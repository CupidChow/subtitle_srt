3
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,439
My child.

4
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,400
I want you to tell me yourself.

5
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,920
What is your name?

6
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,000
My name is...

7
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,439
Huo

8
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,560
Wu

00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,800
Shang.

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,879
Huo Wushang.

11
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,919
Huo Wushang.

12
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,879
Huo.

13
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,159
I am sorry.

14
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,919
I was late.

15
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,199
My child.

16
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,280
You've suffered enough.

17
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,599
It must be tough for you.

18
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,000
Your Majesty,

19
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,000
I know well that I'm unforgivable.

20
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,719
But I was alone in the vengeance mission.

21
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,400
My loved one

22
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,520
has nothing to do with my sin.

23
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,240
You did this alone.

24
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
What about me?

25
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,719
What about those who care about you?

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,560
I only seek for death.

27
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,319
I only wish

28
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
that I could reunite with my parents.

29
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,159
Your Majesty,

30
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,919
General Huo was right.

31
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,719
Your Majesty should give an order now.

32
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,000
Have Huo executed without a doubt,

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
obeying the country's law.

34
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,039
You shut up!

35
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,560
You fool.

36
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,719
Keep talking and

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
I will execute you instead.

38
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,919
As the Palace Aide
to the Censor-in-chief,

39
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,279
I obey the imperial order.

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,959
I admonish the monarch and ministers.

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
State supervision, law as the main one.

42
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,839
Even if Your Majesty had me executed,

43
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,720
I would still beg Your Majesty

44
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,920
to have General Huo executed.

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
Fool!

46
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,639
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

47
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,360
Reckless thing!

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,120
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Your Majesty, please calm down.

50
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,240
Calm down, Your Majesty.

51
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,120
Your Majesty.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,279
You think you're still a teenager?

53
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
We are not in the countryside.

54
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,920
This is the court.

55
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,399
In the Chongde Hall,

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,439
how could you use violence?

57
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
I am angry.

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,680
I am very angry.

59
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,480
This bunch of Palace Aides

60
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
not only once

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
used the reason of
supervising state affairs

62
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,199
to execute their vengeance purpose.

63
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
They even said it fair and square,

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,879
as if it was righteous.

65
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,680
Your Majesty,

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,759
you're the Emperor of the dynasty.

67
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,879
Please emphasize the court etiquette

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,879
when consulting the counselors.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,720
Consort Yue has a point.

70
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,560
Although I am a lady,

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,759
I have read the Book of Rites.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,800
I know that the enemy who killed
our father shall never live among us.

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,160
General Huo avenging for his father

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,199
was never unforgivable.

75
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,480
What he did is forgivable.

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Your Majesty.

77
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,720
Our dynasty has always
emphasized filial piety.

78
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,439
If you were to behead General Huo,

79
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm afraid it would defeat

80
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,079
all hearts of a good son.

81
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,240
Heng is right.

82
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,120
The enemy who killed the
father cannot live among us.

83
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,480
Zheng.

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
He killed that brute.

85
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,839
He was doing justice.

86
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,279
Consort Yue,

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,040
this is the Great Hall.

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,800
Isn't it inappropriate for a lady
to interfere with the politics?

89
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,600
You...

90
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,279
When I was conquering
the nation with His Majesty,

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Official Zuo wasn't
even in the royal yet.

92
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,160
Tackling me with gender discrimination

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,920
while you're unable to refute it.

94
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,920
How impressive you are

95
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,199
as a man.

96
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,680
Anyhow, I refuse to comply.

97
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,519
I must eliminate sins for...

98
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,519
I'm trying to protect
the face of the censors,

99
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,959
and you're crossing the line?

100
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,959
Now that Ling Yi is dead,

101
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,040
Ling Buyi could frame
anyone at his will.

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,319
He accused Ling Yi of
colluding with the enemy.

103
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,519
Any proof for it?

104
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,439
Yes.

105
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,279
Your Majesty.

106
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,920
Ling Yi's wife, Madam Chunyu

107
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,279
once handmade a

108
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,800
statue of Nuwa using kiln,

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,399
and gifted it to Lady Ruyang.

110
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,759
I found

111
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,720
the correspondences
between Lieutenant Kun

112
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
and Ling Yi inside of it.

113
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,120
I also found the evidence of their
collaboration plans with Emperor Li.

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,240
It proves that
they stopped the rescue team

115
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,160
to seize the Gu City.

116
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:16,361
(To Kun. Thanks for the recognition
to assign me such an important task.)

117
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,040
Look at it.

118
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,360
Take a good look at it!

119
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,000
Your Majesty.

120
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,680
Ling Yi colluded with Peng Kun and
betrayed our country along with enemies,

121
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,639
causing Gu City to
fall and get slaughtered.

122
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,959
That's unforgivable sin.

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,199
I implore Your Majesty
to punish him severely,

124
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,759
for the sake of the dynasty's justice.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,759
Your Majesty,

126
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,680
even if Ling Yi deserved to die,

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
General Huo still

128
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,160
stole the tiger seal from Eastern Palace
and privately redeployed the army,

129
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,639
causing chaos in six camps.

130
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,959
This is a severe sin.

131
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,480
It should be disposed
of altogether by right.

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,600
You are the one who should
be disposed of, Official Zuo.

133
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,360
Guards.

134
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,600
Pick up his official
robe and drag him down.

135
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,079
Third Prince, you...

136
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,079
Your Majesty.

137
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,000
The day before yesterday,
I went to rescue Zisheng.

138
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,399
I found out Official Zuo

139
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,560
attempted to cut the
rope and kill Zisheng.

140
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,959
I think there's something strange,

141
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,120
so I interrogated him harshly.

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,480
He confessed in full.

143
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,759
It turned out that

144
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,879
Zuo's Family was already bribed
by remnants of Emperor Li

145
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,159
with huge amount of money.

146
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,360
They left no stone unturned
to execute Zisheng.

147
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
They think

148
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,080
without Ares Ling Buyi in the dynasty,

149
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,080
they would take it easy

150
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,200
and reclaim the dynasty.

151
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,399
Your Majesty,

152
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,759
I'm innocent.

153
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,360
I don't know anything
about Emperor Li's remnants.

154
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,399
You don't know?

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,399
How could you not know?

156
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,559
The Zuo's family

157
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,960
is still hiding the
huge amount of money

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,720
gifted by the Tian's Restaurant.

159
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,399
Official Zuo,

160
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,000
your salary isn't that much, right?

161
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,279
Your Majesty,

162
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,519
Tian Shuo used to be
Emperor Li's camerlengo,

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,240
serving with his full loyalty.

164
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,039
After Emperor Li's defeat and death,

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,720
he lived incognito.

166
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,559
He appeared to be doing
business everywhere.

167
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,279
In fact, he's waiting
for an opportunity to act.

168
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
All these years,

169
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,480
he relied on the protection
from Tian's Restaurant,

170
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,840
connecting with quite
some officials in the court.

171
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,799
Hence, Lord Yong and Marquis Yue

172
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,120
were in collusion with him.

173
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I suspect

174
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,240
that they were instigated by Tian Shuo

175
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,600
to harm the country and the people.

176
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,440
So Tian Shuo

177
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
only mentioned having
a beef with Huo Buyi,

178
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,639
wanting him dead.

179
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,759
However, I didn't know

180
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,600
that Tian Shuo was
Emperor Li's camerlengo.

181
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,639
I am innocent, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,320
Stop quibbling.

183
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,159
Your Majesty.

184
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,480
We implore Your Majesty
to punish Official Zuo.

185
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,200
We implore Your Majesty
to punish Official Zuo.

186
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,080
Guards.

187
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,759
Here.

188
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,399
Drag this man out.

189
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,039
Interrogate him with severe punishment,

190
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,679
regardless of his life.

191
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,639
Your Majesty!

192
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,159
Your Majesty!

193
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

194
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,679
Your Majesty!

195
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm innocent!

196
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,679
Your Majesty!

197
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,480
Your Highness,

198
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
where is Tian Shuo now then?

199
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,320
Your Majesty,

200
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,639
I know that they have spies everywhere.

201
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,519
I wasn't able to report to Your Majesty.

202
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,120
However, I've commanded the guards

203
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,879
to confiscate the Tian's Restaurant.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,399
But it was too late.

205
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,879
By the time I arrived,

206
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,000
Tian's Restaurant was already empty.

207
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,279
However,

208
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,919
I have tracked down the evidence of

209
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,360
Tian Shuo's plan along the years.

210
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,600
Unfortunately,

211
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,879
he escaped.

212
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,879
Ling Yi betrayed the country.

213
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,159
You killed him for it.

214
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,720
I think he deserved it.

215
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,360
However, you abused Crown Prince's
tiger seal to transfer barracks,

216
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
causing Crown Prince to be
impeached by the ministers,

217
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,559
and discredited.

218
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,799
What was actually

219
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,559
your intention after all?

220
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
Your Majesty,

221
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
Zisheng had no choice

222
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
but to use Brother's tiger
seal in a desperate situation.

223
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,639
Desperate my ass!

224
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,799
You think I am a fool?

225
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,240
I've already asked Crown Prince.

226
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
His tiger seal was fake.

227
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,159
Last time when General Wan
suppressed the bandits,

228
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,159
Crown Prince's tiger seal
was stolen by Marquis Yue.

229
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,480
Zisheng withheld the information,

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,120
retrieved the tiger seal and hid it

231
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,440
until today.

232
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Did you...

233
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,240
Did you both already...

234
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,200
You're right.

235
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,759
I reckon

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,240
that Brother doesn't deserve
to be the Crown Prince.

237
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,240
He is incapable of ruling this country.

238
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,399
How dare you!

239
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,120
If he isn't capable,

240
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,799
are you capable then?

241
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,639
Regardless,

242
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,519
your Brother is way more
generous than you at least.

243
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,960
It doesn't matter if a monarch
is generous or mean.

244
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,600
We must act reasonably.

245
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,120
Brother didn't award or punish

246
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
anyone that he's supposed to.

247
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,720
That's exactly the reason of the case
between Lou Ben and Tongniu County.

248
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,960
Do you really think

249
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,759
such generosity is a good thing?

250
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,559
Shut up!

251
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
You're such an evil creature!

252
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,679
With your impatient manner,

253
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,039
who are you to

254
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,120
criticize your generous Brother?

255
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,919
Zisheng,

256
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,240
do you also reckon that Crown Prince

257
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,159
must be discarded for good?

258
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,799
Your Majesty,

259
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,960
I was with Crown Prince
for only a few months.

260
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,639
I was already the chief of the
Eastern Palace for all operations.

261
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,159
Operations regarding staff,
tax return, whistleblowers,

262
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,120
and letter of the command

263
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,200
are all handled by me.

264
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,039
By the time
Crown Prince ascends the throne,

265
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,879
if I want,

266
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,320
I could immediately rule the country

267
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,840
and monopolize the power.

268
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,799
Your Majesty,

269
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,879
is this really what you'd like to see?

270
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,279
If you said so,

271
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,720
why do you give up

272
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,519
the opportunity of ruling the country

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,559
and monopolizing the power?

274
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,720
My heart is loyal.

275
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
I would never think of
replacing the throne.

276
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,960
However, I

277
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
am willing to take the blame
as an ungrateful person

278
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,159
for the sake of country's stability.

279
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,279
I reckon

280
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,879
that Crown Prince

281
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,559
couldn't take this responsibility.

282
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,759
Well said.

283
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,919
Shen'an.

284
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,200
Everything Zisheng said makes sense.

285
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,440
Your Majesty did an improper
establishment of the Crown Prince.

286
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,200
Crown Prince is
ridiculously incompetent.

287
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,720
Third Prince has great ambition

288
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,440
and you have vengeance.

289
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,159
And I

290
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,960
am a loving mother
who spoiled my child.

291
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
Well, let me ask you.

292
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,960
What does Shaoshang
have to do with this?

293
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,159
Why did you drag her into this?

294
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Could it also be

295
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,840
for the sake of our country?

296
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,159
Just now, you were
all clear and logical.

297
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,519
You chose to give up personal love and
contributed favor to the general public.

298
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,320
So let me ask you once more.

299
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,720
That day

300
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,279
when you went to
Marquis Chengyang's Residence alone,

301
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,039
did you

302
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,879
already decide to abandon Shaoshang?

303
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,879
Yes.

304
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,919
Are you speaking the truth?

305
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,799
Regarding this,

306
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,440
are you truly not regretful?

307
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,679
I am not regretful.

308
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,519
Zisheng.

309
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Shaoshang.

310
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,720
Shaoshang.

311
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,880
I have confessed to you

312
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,960
about everything in my mind.

313
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,880
I don't expect your forgiveness.

314
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,359
But I believe you,

315
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,519
that you would understand me.

316
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,720
I do.

317
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,279
I understand that you don't wish
to drag down Cheng's Family

318
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,839
and me.

319
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,559
I also understand

320
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,400
that you couldn't let go of
the opportunity to avenge.

321
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,079
I understand them all.

322
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,559
However,

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,799
do you ever understand me?

324
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,440
Your Majesties.

325
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,160
I came from humble beginnings.

326
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,559
My knowledge is shallow.

327
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,240
My temperament is reckless.

328
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,240
I truly don't deserve to be
married by General Huo.

329
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,720
Your Majesties,

330
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,839
please make the decision for me.

331
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,839
Cancel our marriage.

332
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,440
Shaoshang.

333
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,359
Listen to me...

334
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,839
You listen to me now.

335
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,720
I have been unfortunate all along.

336
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,799
I never believed that someone
would treat me sincerely.

337
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,599
Until I met you...

338
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,440
I fell for you,

339
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,759
because you made me to.

340
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,200
I relied on you,

341
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,240
because you let me.

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,079
I believed in you,

343
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,240
because you want me to.

344
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,880
What about you?

345
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,000
I told you before.

346
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,720
If you ever dare to leave me,

347
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,839
I would never ever forgive you.

348
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,400
You are ruthless.

349
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,759
So I'd do what I said.

350
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Please, General Huo,

351
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,440
for old times' sake,

352
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,119
let me go.

353
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,960
Shaoshang,

354
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
are you really leaving?

355
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,839
Did Ling Buyi say anything?

356
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,319
He used tiger seal to transfer the army,

357
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
which would involve Crown Prince

358
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,839
and even Her Majesty.

359
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,519
I'm afraid

360
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,359
His Majesty would depose
the Crown Prince and Her Majesty.

361
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,440
Won't you wait and see?

362
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,400
You think too much.

363
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,599
Even if Her Majesty is being replaced,

364
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,839
that's because Her Majesty herself

365
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,519
isn't willing to stay in
Changqiu Palace any longer.

366
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,000
The positions
for Crown Prince and Empress

367
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,160
are like two swords,

368
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,400
hanging above their heads for decades.

369
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,240
She's exhausted.

370
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,279
What?

371
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,519
I'm exhausted too.

372
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,279
I don't wish to stay here
in the Palace any longer.

373
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,720
Shaoshang.

374
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:09,160
Shen'an, what are you doing?

375
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,440
The Crown Prince is
cowardly and incompetent.

376
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,920
He doesn't deserve
to be the future ruler.

377
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,279
All of these

378
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,039
are caused by my incapability
of teaching him as a mother.

379
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,079
I implore Your Majesty

380
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,039
to dethrone the Crown Prince.

381
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,160
And please

382
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,599
depose me too.

383
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Shen'an,

384
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,400
do you really have to force me?

385
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
All my life,

386
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,480
I have been manipulated.

387
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,799
For many things,

388
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,960
I know that's wrong.

389
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
I still let it flow.

390
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,200
Back then,

391
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,759
I knew that Your Majesty was married.

392
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,000
But Uncle wanted me to marry you.

393
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,359
So I still did.

394
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,160
After that,

395
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,799
Your Majesty wanted to
enthrone me as Empress.

396
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,279
I was well aware that being
Empress was filled with danger.

397
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,480
But I

398
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,160
still accepted it.

399
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,200
So right now,

400
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,519
do you regret it?

401
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,839
Not only me.

402
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,359
Haven't you
ever regretted before?

403
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,920
Crown Prince's temper

404
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,119
is more like my father's.

405
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
By right, like my father,

406
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,319
he should be building a house,
opening a garden in the valley,

407
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:56,160
writing books,
and becoming reputational.

408
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,839
Unfortunately, he became
the Crown Prince instead.

409
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,039
It's just like

410
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,839
sitting on the tip of a sword,

411
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,960
being worried every day and night.

412
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,039
If he

413
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,960
really refuses to be the Crown Prince,

414
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,599
I could arrange otherwise.

415
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
However, Shen'an,

416
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,880
why do you need to depose
your own position as an Empress?

417
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,920
Yue Heng isn't the Empress.

418
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,759
Enthroning Third Prince to be the Crown
Prince won't convince the people.

419
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,440
So, I implore Your Majesty.

420
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,799
For the sake of country and
people, please depose me,

421
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,759
and enthrone Yue Heng
as Empress instead.

422
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,319
Third Prince could still logically

423
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
take over the Eastern Palace.

424
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,680
Shen'an,

425
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,000
I will not allow this.

426
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I am an incompetent mother.

427
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,640
I couldn't educate my children well.

428
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,480
If Your Majesty really has to dethrone
Crown Prince and put on charges,

429
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,839
please let me take the responsibility

430
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,400
for him as a mother,

431
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,519
rather than putting the blame on him.

432
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,680
As long as I am deposed,

433
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,559
Crown Prince

434
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,400
would never be criticized
by the ministers anymore.

435
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,559
So he could safely dethrone to a prince.

436
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,960
I implore Your Majesty.

437
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,960
Please fulfill my request.

438
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,319
But compared to Crown Prince,

439
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,759
you, as the Empress
have no fault at all.

440
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,319
How could I depose you?

441
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,920
Just see me as a resentful Empress

442
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,279
with jealousy and cruelty.

443
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,480
Nonsense!

444
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,440
I

445
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,079
have never seen anyone

446
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,559
as magnanimous as you.

447
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm not being ridiculous.

448
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,200
The past decades,

449
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,400
whenever I saw you and Yue Heng

450
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,079
joking around and having fun,

451
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,839
my heart ached deeply.

452
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,799
I was jealous and
resentful all the time.

453
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,599
I've had enough.

454
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,920
It's only torture

455
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,559
being the Empress.

456
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,680
I'm not emotionless.

457
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,680
I still desire a relationship
with mutual love.

458
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,480
Your Majesty and Yue Heng

459
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,160
were having a marital harmony,

460
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:25,480
while I could only pretend to
be dignified and generous.

461
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,359
Shen'an, but

462
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,480
I treat you...

463
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
If Your Majesty

464
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,359
still sees me as your wife,

465
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,000
please don't retain
me in Empress position.

466
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,240
It's torturing.

467
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,759
I

468
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,359
want to be Xuan Shen'an again,

469
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,799
not Empress Xuan.

470
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,880
I beg Your Majesty.

471
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,759
Please imprison me

472
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,160
from Changqiu Palace.

473
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,559
Niaoniao seems weird.

474
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,480
These few days,

475
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,319
Ling's Family was breaking apart.

476
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,599
Ling Yi's three brothers were beheaded.

477
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,960
Her Majesty deposed herself.

478
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,240
Crown Prince was
relegated to Prince of Eastern Sea.

479
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,599
She could still be
composed and read calmly.

480
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,319
How odd is it.

481
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,160
I see it as a good thing.

482
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,559
She's not making any noises.

483
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,799
What's so good about it?

484
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,680
Huo Buyi

485
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,519
relegated himself and settled down in
the Northwest for the next seven years.

486
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,079
Is he atoning?

487
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,240
Huo Buyi?

488
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,519
Yes.

489
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,720
He said he wanted to
stay alive for Ling Buyi,

490
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,319
and he even used the name "Buyi".

491
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,920
Father, brothers.

492
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,000
Huo Buyi is leaving the capital
today, towards Northwest.

493
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,079
He assigned Liangqiu Qi
to deliver a message

494
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,680
about his wanting to meet you.

495
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,480
Why are you mentioning Huo Buyi?

496
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,039
Are you both still teenagers?

497
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,640
You must learn to be mature,

498
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,160
to think before you talk.

499
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,920
Look at Niaoniao.

500
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,640
How mature is she.

501
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,519
Niaoniao.

502
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,720
Are you alright?

503
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,599
Sorry for troubling you.

504
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,759
Please send General Huo a ride for me,

505
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,079
and send him my wishes.

506
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,279
I'm afraid I wouldn't see
him anymore in my life.

507
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,759
Please help me send him a ride.

508
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,880
We shall forget the past.

509
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,440
Niaoniao,

510
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
where are you going?

511
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,799
Let me help you?

512
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,440
I'm going for a walk.

513
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,599
Don't worry.

514
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,000
Madam.

515
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,359
Young Lady has really
become a whole new person.

516
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,519
A different person compared to when we

517
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,599
came back home.

518
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,440
She's grown up.

519
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,640
Back then,

520
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,119
I always hoped she could be mature,

521
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,759
and more mature.

522
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,319
Until today,

523
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,960
she has become so composed,

524
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,880
as if she was a different person.

525
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,239
Recalling old times,

526
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,480
she behaved aggressively,

527
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,360
and always romped around.

528
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,800
That would rather put my mind at ease.

529
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,679
Qingcong,

530
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,440
was I wrong since the beginning?

531
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,079
Children will grow up eventually.

532
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,239
As a mother,

533
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,360
who doesn't see them grow.

534
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,360
After all,
we couldn't be with them forever.

535
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,039
They would have to

536
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:51,039
walk on their own in the future.

537
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,679
Young Master,

538
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:23,639
should we set off already?

539
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,639
Young Master,

540
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,159
we have waited for six hours.

541
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,400
Lady Cheng

542
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,320
won't be coming.

543
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:53,601
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

544
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,159
Stop.

545
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,920
Niaoniao,

546
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,519
where are you going?

547
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm visiting Her Majesty
in Changqiu Palace.

548
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,760
After Empress Xuan deposed herself,

549
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,719
she requested to be imprisoned
in Changqiu Palace.

550
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,519
Right now, people in Changqiu Palace

551
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,639
are trapped inside,

552
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,199
just like an abandoned palace.

553
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,840
Why would you go there?

554
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,719
This is exactly the hard time

555
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,840
when I should be beside Her Majesty.

556
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,880
Father and mother

557
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,320
were ordered by
the military to go to Gu City.

558
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,400
You left me alone
at home just like this.

559
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:30,960
Am I right?

560
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,519
We could only choose
either loyalty or filial piety.

561
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,559
Finally,

562
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,800
I understand now.

563
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,280
Please, mother.

564
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,039
Let me go to Changqiu Palace.

565
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
Let me fulfill my loyalty.

566
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,920
You can step back for now.

567
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,199
Sure.

568
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,119
Shaogong,

569
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,719
Shaoshang...

570
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,719
Old General Huo is respectable
for his loyalty and bravery.

571
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,039
He's very unique.

572
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,400
Our entire family
admires him very much.

573
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,480
About us saving you that day,

574
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,719
His Majesty showed mercy

575
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,119
and pardoned us.

576
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,559
You don't have to worry.

577
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,519
However, matter to matter.

578
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,880
There is no fate indeed.

579
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,679
General Huo shouldn't insist anymore.

580
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,880
Did Shaoshang

581
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,599
say anything else?

582
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,679
(You say that Her Majesty
needs someone by her side.)

583
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,440
However, all these years,

584
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,519
Aunt's health hasn't been well.

585
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,480
She needs someone for her even more.

586
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,599
If you insist on leaving,

587
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,199
I'll have to look after her

588
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,679
and never marry.

589
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,800
Mother always says I'm stubborn.

590
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,360
You're the same, Yangyang.

591
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,800
Niaoniao,

592
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,280
listen to me one time.

593
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,079
You surely will find

594
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,519
another man
who could cherish you in future.

595
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,599
Don't be so depressed

596
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,280
to ruin your whole life.

597
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,400
Shaoshang.

598
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,920
Has she left any message?

599
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,079
She said,

600
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,519
never ever see again.

601
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,199
Who says that ladies

602
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,320
have to find a husband?

603
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,480
I find one as I will.

604
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,280
There's no problem if I don't.

605
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,360
Yangyang,

606
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,599
take care of yourself.

607
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,159
Mother,

608
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,760
take care of yourself.

609
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,000
(If she's ever betrayed)

610
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,440
(she's never going to forgive.)

611
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,199
(I knew that's who she is.)

612
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,519
Set off.

613
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,200
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

614
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:03,039

00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,440

00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,360

619
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:12,559
(when I should be beside Her Majesty.)

620
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,119
(We could only choose
either loyalty or filial piety.)

621
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,119
(Please, mother.)

622
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,079
(Let me go to Changqiu Palace.)

623
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,360
(Let me fulfill my loyalty.)

624
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,199
She's never coming back.

625
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,920
She plans to stay

626
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,639
in the abandoned palace forever.

627
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,039
