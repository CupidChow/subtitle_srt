00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,760
=Episode 27=

3
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,740
Let me sleep some more.

4
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,940
Good.

5
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,340
Draw harder.

6
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,820
Yes, that's it.

7
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:32,980
Good.

8
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,980
Why is Song standing
upside down on a rock?

9
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,900
Father, look.

10
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,500
Mr. Cheng.

11
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,380
Second Brother needs to ride a horse
when he goes to war.

12
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,460
If his lower body isn't stable,

13
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,060
he'll be in danger
of falling from his horse

14
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,260
when he's fighting on it.

15
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,060
This is the best method
I used in the military

16
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,580
to train the lower body.

17
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
If you ask me,

18
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,700
we'll need to add another rock tomorrow.

19
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,980
What do you think?

20
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,620
Another rock?

21
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,620
Don't bend your arm.

22
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,620
Zisheng, you're right.

23
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,340
They must do proper training.

24
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,580
Yes.

25
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,860
Third Brother,

26
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,020
you're used to using the bow.

27
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,060
If you have no strength in your arms,
you won't hit the target.

28
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,140
If your hands are steady,
you'll hit accurately.

29
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,180
If you want to hit the target
all the time,

30
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,980
you need to train more.

31
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,580
Honestly, I don't want to hit
the target all the time.

32
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,460
When I performed divination today,

33
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,060
I knew today won't be a good day.

34
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,660
Third Brother,

35
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,020
Confucius said, be an upright person
instead of being superstitious.

36
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,620
Rather than performing divination,

37
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,820
how about

38
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,300
you talk to me.

39
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,180
Wait.

40
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,420
What exactly are you doing?

41
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,660
Only when the family are healthy

42
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,060
can everything prosper.

43
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,340
From today on,

44
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,100
your family will train with me.

45
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,220
Ridiculous.

46
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,500
Shaoshang.

47
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,060
I'm a young lady.

48
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,540
I don't need to charge the enemy lines.

49
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,740
Besides, young ladies don't train.

50
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,620
I'm not like those with pedantic ideas.

51
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,900
I think

52
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,420
men and women should
have equal treatment in the world.

53
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,980
Besides,

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,420
there are

55
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,660
training methods catering to young ladies too.

56
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,140
Young ladies have...

57
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,860
Second Brother,

58
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,740
can you hold on?

59
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,900
You're like General Cheng.

60
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,100
You're a good man of the Cheng Family.

61
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,340
Block it.

62
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,620
Spread it.

63
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,780
Pierce!

64
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,660
Pierce!

65
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,100
Again!

66
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,180
Block it!

67
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,420
Pierce!

68
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,660
Good. Do it again.

69
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,180
Spread it!

70
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,980
Yangyang.

71
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
Lianfang.

72
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,660
Niaoniao.

73
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,420
If you drop the earthenware,

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,140
you have to train an additional quarter
of an hour tomorrow.

75
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,980
Do I need to train this too?

76
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,700
I heard you almost died

77
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,340
from illness last year.

78
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,860
That's because you didn't train enough.

79
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,940
Rest assured.

80
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,220
Of course,

81
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,580
I'll train you meticulously.

82
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,660
No need.

83
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,820
I'll never train these.

84
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,420
Is this what you mean
by training me meticulously?

85
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
Yes.

86
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,700
I'll accompany you

87
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,460
as long as you train.

88
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,340
No need.

89
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,700
You only need to tell me

90
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,180
how long I need to train.

91
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,340
About

92
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,300
two hours.

93
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,380
Two hours?

94
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,380
That's easy.

95
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,580
Niaoniao!

96
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,260
You're the good lady

97
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
of the Cheng Family!

98
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,780
Niaoniao,

99
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,500
I find it difficult

100
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,580
to cope with your future husband.

101
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,020
He...

102
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,340
He has split my target board
with his arrows.

103
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,700
I've never split it after using it
for 20 years.

104
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,580
Niaoniao,

105
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,900
it'll be the first time

106
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,300
for me to disobey.

107
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,220
Yangyang,

108
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,180
my hands are

109
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,540
still trembling.

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,380
I don't know how to get out of this.

111
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,460
Everyone marries
to get a hold of a person.

112
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,820
But mine is taking my life.

113
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,180
No.

114
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,100
Your marriage

115
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,940
is taking our lives.

116
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,820
You should just give me a quick death.

117
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,700
I can't hold it anymore.

118
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,860
All of you have done well.

119
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,940
I've asked Lianfang
to prepare cold plum drinks.

120
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
She'll bring it over later.

121
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,580
Have some to clear away summer heat.

122
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,660
It's here.

123
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,180
Is this the cold plum drink

124
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,060
you said?

125
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,780
I told you to prepare cold plum drinks.

126
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,020
Why is it hot?

127
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,300
I told Lianfang to make it hot.

128
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,420
Consuming cold drinks
is harmful to health.

129
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,900
After training,

130
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
it's best to drink something hot.

131
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,700
All of you should drink it

132
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
while it's still hot.

133
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,860
I can't live like this.

134
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,980
Keep it down.

135
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,540
The black armored guards are outside.

136
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,380
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

137
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,660
It's all Niaoniao's fault

138
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,020
for being pretty for no reason

139
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,580
that attracts Ling Buyi.

140
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,540
Niaoniao,

141
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,340
it's harder to talk
to your future husband than Yao.

142
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
The marriage is confirmed now.

143
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,420
It's useless to say anything now.

144
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,820
I can't even break off the betrothal.

145
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,860
I won't allow that!

146
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,780
You're not allowed
to break off the betrothal.

147
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,780
A bunch of fools.

148
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,940
It's rare to find

149
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,660
such a handsome man to marry.

150
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,380
How can you try and stop this wedding?

151
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,620
Mother,

152
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,340
keep your voice down.

153
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,460
The black armored guards are just outside.

154
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,740
Did you get ahead of yourself

155
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,500
that you can't tell what's good
and what's bad?

156
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,860
You can break off the betrothal

157
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,300
only

158
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,740
when you walk over my dead body.

159
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,260
We're not breaking off the betrothal.

160
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,620
You've already moved
the betrothal gifts into your room.

161
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,860
There's no way we can break it off now.

162
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,740
Mother, you can rest assured.

163
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,900
Old Madam,

164
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,180
you must not make a scene.

165
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,860
His Majesty granted this marriage.

166
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,140
If the words about breaking off
the betrothal get out from here,

167
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,540
His Majesty will blame Master.

168
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,100
When that happens,
not only we'll lose everything,

169
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,180
but we'll also lose our lives.

170
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,740
In any case,

171
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,660
I'm going to have Ling Zisheng
as my grandson-in-law.

172
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,820
If you dare break it off,

173
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,700
I'll annoy you to death.

174
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,140
Mother, don't worry.

175
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,140
Your future grandson-in-law
won't go anywhere.

176
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,700
Mother, you should retire now.

177
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,500
Let's retire.

178
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,380
Thank you for your hard work.

179
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,420
When Ling Buyi comes to our house again,

180
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,940
you three should entertain him.

181
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,620
I have too many things

182
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,980
to take care of these days.
I'm a little exhausted.

183
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,620
I can't handle this.

184
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,860
I just can't.

185
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,980
Niaoniao,

186
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,100
I've thought about this carefully.

187
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,420
When Ling Buyi comes again,

188
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,180
you should entertain him yourself.

189
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,500
If the elders are around all the time,

190
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,740
it'll be hard for you
to say something intimate.

191
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,180
All right, then.

192
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,460
It's decided, then.

193
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,940
That's it.

194
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,980
-Father, you're wise.
-How wise of you, Father.

195
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Yangyang,

196
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,380
are you going to abandon me?

197
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,140
Niaoniao,

198
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,420
I think

199
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,820
you're more suitable
for practicing the sword.

200
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,580
I'm not really suitable for it.

201
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,580
Come.

202
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,340
Drink some more.

203
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,420
You rarely came out in the past.

204
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,420
Why do you have more freedom

205
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,300
when you're getting married?

206
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,180
In the past,

207
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,500
my family would watch me study.

208
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,460
Now, Ling Buyi comes
and visits every day.

209
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,260
They're busy hiding from him.

210
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,620
No one is willing to keep an eye on me.

211
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,780
It was hard to sneak out
to take a breather.

212
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,740
Isn't this great?

213
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,140
No one is keeping an eye on you
when you're getting married.

214
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,180
Then I want to get married too.

215
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,420
When my mother used
to keep an eye on me every day,

216
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,260
I felt so agitated.

217
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,820
Now when she doesn't care
about me anymore,

218
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,060
I feel so empty inside

219
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,700
and insecure.

220
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,780
You're just

221
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,860
a little anxious before you get married.

222
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,620
Ally of my 12 older sisters experienced

223
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,020
the same thing.

224
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,780
Worrying about losing and gaining.

225
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,140
You'll be fine
after you get used to it in the future.

226
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,620
Don't tell me you want
your mother to accompany you

227
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,900
after you marry Ling Buyi.

228
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,580
My mother no longer keeps
an eye on me now.

229
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,060
But it's Ling Buyi's turn now.

230
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,100
I used to think

231
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,300
Mother's method was scary enough.

232
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,700
But compared to Ling Buyi's method,

233
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,260
her method is not
worth mentioning at all.

234
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,060
Why are you gritting your teeth
when you talk about him?

235
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,020
Practice horsemanship and archery.

236
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,740
It's unimaginable.

237
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,820
He wants everyone in Cheng's Residence

238
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,820
to practice horsemanship and archery.

239
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,860
Then you should train more.

240
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,860
Just look at your sickly appearance.

241
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,900
It's caused by lack of sleep

242
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,980
and poor health.

243
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,700
I don't understand.

244
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,580
Can't a person just lie down?

245
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,180
Why do we need
to practice horsemanship and archery?

246
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,420
Yao never tried to control me.

247
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,100
He won't do anything I don't like

248
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,140
or control what I should eat or drink.

249
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,100
He's not like Ling Buyi.

250
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,220
Ling Buyi doesn't let me eat after noon.

251
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,220
He doesn't let me eat cold food.

252
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,580
He doesn't let me eat after I ate a lot.

253
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,740
He should just let me starve to death.

254
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,340
Come.

255
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,140
Let's drink some more.

256
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,700
They can let him control them.

257
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,660
But I don't want to be controlled.

258
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,740
He likes to tell stories

259
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,500
to threaten me and scare me.

260
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,180
He said

261
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,740
if I don't marry him,

262
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,020
he'll kill my entire family.

263
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,980
He thought I didn't know
his underlying meaning.

264
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,300
But I did.

265
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,260
Ling Buyi is

266
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,100
extremely hateful.

267
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,620
Yao is better.

268
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,620
He'd drink with me.

269
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,100
I can drink with you too.

270
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,100
Come, drink up.

271
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,580
Cheers!

272
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,780
Why are you staring at me?

273
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm staring at you
because you're strange.

274
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,660
Ling Buyi has done so many things for you.

275
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,060
When you like him,
you just can't help but like him.

276
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,140
If you don't like him,
nothing can make you like him.

277
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,380
Then

278
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,620
do you like him?

279
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,940
Do I like him?

280
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,340
How does it feel to like someone?

281
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,060
Just close your eyes.

282
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,660
You'll see him when you think of him.

283
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,340
Then he'll be the person you like.

284
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,300
Close your eyes.

285
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,820
Do I like him

286
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,700
or not?

287
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,740
Do I like...

288
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,380
Qiqi,

289
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,460
I saw Ling Buyi.

290
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,820
It feels like he's sitting here.

291
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,660
Ling Buyi.

292
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,340
Qiqi,

293
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,860
if I see Ling Buyi,

294
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,940
that means...

295
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,780
Ling Buyi is gone again.

296
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,180
Help!

297
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,420
General Ling,

298
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,940
I respect you
because you're an upright person.

299
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,700
How could you take advantage of her?

300
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,980
General Ling,

301
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,820
why are you not behaving properly?

302
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,940
All you see is him

303
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
taking advantage of Niaoniao.

304
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,460
Niaoniao is the one
who doesn't behave properly.

305
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,500
See that?

306
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,420
I didn't only bring Shaoshang home.

307
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,780
Lady Wan is also

308
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,660
in the carriage.

309
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,060
What? Qiqi is also drunk?

310
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,420
Well, both of them are embarrassing.

311
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,820
How about this?

312
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,980
You can let me carry Niaoniao.

313
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,380
After she's sober...

314
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,300
I'm afraid I can't.

315
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,900
You and Shaoshang may be betrothed.

316
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,820
But you're still not married.

317
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,860
I ask that you let her go

318
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,740
and let her father carry her

319
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
to her room.

320
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,260
Madam Cheng,

321
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,180
it's not that I refused to let her go.

322
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,620
Madam Cheng, look.

323
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Madam Cheng,

324
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,660
let me send

325
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,260
Shaoshang to her room first.

326
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,820
Then

327
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,580
thank you for

328
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,700
sending Niaoniao back to her room.

329
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,940
Lianfang,

330
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,260
go along and help out.

331
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,260
Yes, Madam.

332
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,900
Thank you for understanding.

333
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,780
I shall get going now.

334
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,700
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

335
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,700
I can't blame others

336
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,980
when my own daughter is immature.

337
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,340
I'm tired.

338
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,380
General,

339
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,340
don't forget to help Song

340
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,340
to send Qiqi back to Wan's Residence.

341
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,060
Why hasn't this brat

342
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
come out of the carriage yet?

343
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,500
Don't tell me

344
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,420
he's being caught too.

345
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,300
You madwoman.

346
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,300
If you don't let me go,

347
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,140
I'll tie you up
and send you back to Mr. Wan.

348
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,980
I'll let Old Madam Wan punish you.

349
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,420
Do you think I'm scared
of my father and grandmother?

350
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,220
I'm not scared of anybody.

351
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,980
Are they fighting now?

352
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,940
Wan Qiqi,

353
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,700
you'll have to pay
if I can't have children.

354
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,540
Let me go!

355
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,500
Stop making a fuss.

356
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,100
Or else I'll have to subdue you.

357
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,940
You want to subdue me?

358
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,900
Do you think

359
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,820
I live in the barracks for nothing?

360
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,260
Someone! Someone!

361
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,140
Stop shouting!

362
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,820
Young ladies nowadays are

363
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,100
so fierce and tough.

364
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,620
Only my wife is gentle, kind,

365
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,900
and virtuous.

366
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,740
It's hard to find such a wife.

367
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,380
Listen.

368
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,060
Prepare some medicinal ointment.

369
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,020
Yes, Master.

370
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,820
Ling Buyi!

371
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,300
Hyah!

372
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,780
Some hangover soup too.

373
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,020
Yes, Master.

374
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Someone!

375
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,700
Stop causing trouble!
I'll get you down from the carriage,

376
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,100
and send you home
after you have some hangover soup.

377
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,180
I still want to drink.

378
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,620
You had enough!

379
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,820
I can hold my drinks.

380
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,260
Don't kick me.

381
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,180
Don't stop me!

382
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,300
Do you still care about your image?

383
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,660
-If you keep shouting,
-Someone!

384
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,900
I'll... I'll...

385
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,620
What will you do?

386
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,580
Someone! Someone!

387
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,420
Someone...

388
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,700
Did you say

389
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,940
Ling Buyi carried me home?

390
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,780
Young Lady,

391
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,700
please don't drink liquor anymore.

392
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,580
General Ling coaxed you
all night yesterday.

393
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,340
Let's go.

394
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,900
Slow down.

395
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,820
I'm done for.

396
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,140
Come on, let's go.

397
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,260
Here's hangover soup.

398
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,820
Drink it first.

399
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,620
Do you blame me

400
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,620
for stopping you from drinking liquor?

401
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,100
Is that why you drank
to your heart's content?

402
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,420
This is the plum liquor mixed
with precious medicinal herbs

403
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,940
I ordered the imperial physician to make up.

404
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,100
It's mellow

405
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,620
and you won't get drunk easily.

406
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,420
If you crave liquor after this,

407
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,900
you can drink this.

408
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm not trying to stop you
from doing things you like.

409
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,340
I just don't want you

410
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,700
to harm your health.

411
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,100
I don't like this liquor.

412
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,260
Rather than plum liquor,

413
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,140
I prefer Qianlizui.

414
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,500
If you don't like the taste,

415
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,620
I can tell Physician Sun to change it.

416
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,340
Or do you think it's not the liquor
that you don't like,

417
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,180
but me?

418
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,220
You're resisting to marry me
in your heart.

419
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,460
So you'll loathe anything

420
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,500
that's related to me.

421
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,860
Even if you like it,

422
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,940
you'll force yourself to reject it.

423
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,980
Am I right?

424
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,300
Shaoshang,

425
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,260
I've been trying to change now.

426
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,940
Why do you still want to reject me?

427
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,620
You and I are not on the same road,
to begin with.

428
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,020
You're powerful and influential.

429
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,740
While I have nothing.

430
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,100
You're not without anything.

431
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,220
I'm not without any shortcomings either.

432
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,580
Shaoshang,

433
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,060
you have your family.

434
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,500
Everyone treats you sincerely.

435
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,460
I never had these.

436
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,260
You and I don't walk on the same road.

437
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,380
So what if I have a family?

438
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,060
This is my home,

439
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,380
not yours.

440
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,100
They're my family, not yours.

441
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,300
Yes.

442
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,980
It's your home.

443
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,220
Your family is

444
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,340
also yours.

445
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,580
I've been training in the military
since young.

446
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,780
So I'm used to military orders.

447
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,620
Most of my actions are
from orders and implementations.

448
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,460
Shaoshang,

449
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,980
I never meant to force you
or control you.

450
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,020
I'm just not used

451
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,500
to discussing things with others.

452
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,540
All these years,

453
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,820
I never really have a family

454
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,660
nor do I know how
to get along with family.

455
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,220
That's why I'm eager to learn
how to blend in.

456
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,500
You said I don't know you

457
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,100
so I used my power to force you.

458
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,780
I just want you and your family to know

459
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,060
that I'm also an ordinary person.

460
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,180
I, Ling Zisheng also want

461
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,740
to have a normal life with you.

462
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,700
But you only bring oppression to my life.

463
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,860
I don't need plum liquor

464
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,740
or you to take care of me

465
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,900
and my family like this.

466
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,980
You said you're normal like other people.

467
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,820
But you're not a normal person.

468
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,780
We were never equal from the beginning.

469
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,300
When you asked His Majesty
to grant this marriage,

470
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,540
you didn't discuss it with me.

471
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,780
You never asked

472
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,260
if I have feelings for you.

473
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,940
You act according to your will.
How is that being respectful?

474
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,540
General Ling,

475
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,660
I'm going to be suffocated

476
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,180
by your love.

477
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,580
Tell me, then.

478
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,180
Do you have feelings for me?

479
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,180
This has nothing to do with feelings.
You just can't...

480
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,580
So you never liked me.

481
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,620
If liking you

482
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,060
means I have to submit
to you all the time,

483
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,980
let you restrain me,
let you interfere in my life,

484
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,620
let your men monitor me every day,

485
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,300
let you arrange

486
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,540
whatever I do and eat,

487
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,460
and let you drag me out to train
at dawn every day

488
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,980
that the whole family couldn't live
in peace because of you,

489
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,820
I'm sorry to say this.

490
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,620
Ling Buyi,

491
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,940
I can't bear these kinds
of feelings from you.

492
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
Besides,

493
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,500
I'll never like this kind of life.

494
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,460
What kind of life do you like then?

495
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,740
A life without you.

496
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,820
Do you mean it?

497
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,020
More than it does.

498
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,260
Please leave my home.

499
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,780
Get out of my life and leave me.

500
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,260
We shall sever our ties

501
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,380
and take care of our own lives.

502
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,380
All right.

503
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,940
I'll go.

504
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,340
I'll give you your freedom.

505
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,460
Young Lady,

506
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,060
you've been sitting all morning.

507
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,140
Why don't

508
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,500
you have some breakfast?

509
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm not hungry.

510
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,380
How can you not be hungry?

511
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,540
You vomited everything you ate last night.

512
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,740
Your stomach must be empty now.

513
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,540
I even threw up yesterday?

514
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,980
You did.

515
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
General Ling helped
you clean up all night.

516
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,260
Young Lady,

517
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,180
I was worried sick about you last night.

518
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,780
Last night,

519
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,820
you cried and laughed.

520
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,580
You were hitting and kicking.
You even bit anyone you caught.

521
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,660
Other than General Ling,

522
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,740
I'm afraid no one can stand that.

523
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,500
I was worried

524
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,740
General Ling might kill you
out of anger.

525
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,740
But I didn't expect
he'd accompany you all night.

526
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,060
He didn't sleep all night?

527
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,820
How can he sleep?

528
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,020
You were making so much scene.

529
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,140
But

530
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,220
you did sleep well

531
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,180
on top of General Ling.

532
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,220
Young Lady, where are you going?

533
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,780
I want to see Mother.

534
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,820
Whose shoes are these?

535
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,420
General Ling said

536
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,900
he's worried your feet might get cold.

537
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,700
So he especially went hunting
for a python

538
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,860
to make these snake leather shoes.

539
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,300
He said it's neither stuffy nor cold.

540
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,860
It's suitable to be worn in four seasons.

541
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,020
Niaoniao,

542
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,060
are you willing to listen to my opinion?

543
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,140
Ling Buyi did nothing wrong
in this matter.

544
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,300
I've seen how you interact
with each other.

545
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,820
Both of you

546
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,580
had a good time talking and laughing.

547
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,140
We're not blind.

548
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,940
Even if it's not a romantic feeling,

549
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,780
there must be
some feelings of admiration.

550
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,820
You made him have feelings for you

551
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,100
and he asked me for your hand in marriage.

552
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,620
I already accepted it.

553
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,340
The betrothal is completed.

554
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,940
What wrong did Ling Buyi do?

555
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,260
I never said he did anything wrong.

556
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,060
I just feel this is not the life

557
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,860
I've imagined.

558
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,660
I want...

559
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,580
In this world,

560
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,500
everyone wants
to live the way they want.

561
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,580
But how many can actually do that?

562
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,460
Let me say this generally.

563
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,380
I'm afraid there are times

564
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
when His Majesty feels helpless too.

565
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,020
Niaoniao,

566
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,340
do you think

567
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,060
you can live the way you want

568
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,900
even if you don't marry Ling Buyi?

569
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,020
I can feel he won't
make things difficult for me.

570
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,220
You're so sure
he won't make things difficult for you.

571
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,100
Why do you think so?

572
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,740
Isn't it because you know
Ling Buyi likes you?

573
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,340
That's why you're proud and spoiled?

574
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,580
Since you accepted this betrothal,

575
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,700
now you're hesitating.

576
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,180
This isn't the conduct
of a noble character.

577
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,220
Niaoniao.

578
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,580
Your mother and I

579
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,780
don't greed for fame and wealth.

580
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,100
In the beginning,

581
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,660
we only wanted to live a peaceful country life,

582
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,380
and keep our family well-fed.

583
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,500
For these 20 years,

584
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,860
we fought in bloody battles.

585
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,700
It's enough for us

586
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,540
that we managed to accomplish
some achievements

587
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,860
without the death and destruction
of my family.

588
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,540
Worse come to worst, I can just retire.

589
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,420
We can go back to the countryside
and start farming.

590
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,020
Since ancient times,

591
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,820
it feels like being born again
when a woman gets married.

592
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,780
One wrong step will follow you
for the rest of your life.

593
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,100
Wealth and power are nothing compared

594
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,540
to your lifelong happiness.

595
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,660
Niaoniao.

596
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,460
If you're not willing
to be with Ling Buyi,

597
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,020
your father and I

598
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,300
will protect you

599
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,980
and break off this betrothal

600
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,060
even if we have to retire
from our positions.

601
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,340
Now,

602
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,740
I want you to be honest with me.

603
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,340
Do you really not like Ling Buyi?

604
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,860
Do you really not want to be with him?

605
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,940
No one is perfect in this world.

606
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,820
Even if your beloved husband

607
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,580
may not necessarily
be complete to your liking.

608
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,380
Even your father and I

609
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,620
had to work it out

610
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,820
before we become the perfect couple.

611
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
In this lifetime,

612
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,180
it's hard to be able

613
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,740
to marry someone you like.

614
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,060
I hope you'll make your decision

615
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,660
after thinking about this carefully.

616
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,380
No matter what you decide,

617
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,940
your mother and I

618
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,540
will support you.

619
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,220
(You're so sure
he won't make things difficult for you.)

620
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,020
(Why do you think so?)

621
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
(Isn't it because you know
Ling Buyi likes you?)

622
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,620
(That's why you're proud and spoiled?)

623
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,220
(Since you accepted this betrothal,)

624
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,420
(now you're hesitating.)

625
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,900
(This isn't the conduct
of a noble character.)

626
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,380
(General Ling said)

627
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,780
(he's worried your feet might get cold.)

628
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,220
(So he especially went hunting
for a python)

629
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,460
(to make these snake leather shoes.)

630
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,020
(He said it's neither stuffy nor cold.)

631
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,500
(It's suitable to be worn in four seasons.)

632
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,580
I'm someone who likes

633
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,020
to follow my own will.

634
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,180
However, if I do get married to you,

635
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,500
I'll have to live
by your rules in the future.

636
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,140
By then,

637
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,140
I'm no longer who I was.

638
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,500
(You said I don't know you)

639
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,300
(so I used my power to force you.)

640
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,300
(I just want you
and your family to know)

641
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,620
(that I'm also an ordinary person.)

642
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,740
I, Ling Zisheng also want

643
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,380
to have a normal life with you.

644
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,340
But you only bring oppression
to my life.

645
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,660
(I'm going to be suffocated)

646
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,220
(by your love.)

647
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,900
(I've been training in the military
since young.)

648
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,940
(So I'm used to military orders.)

649
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,180
(Most of my actions are
from orders and implementations.)

650
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,180
(Shaoshang,)

651
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,060
I never meant to force you
or control you.

652
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,100
I'm just not used

653
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,620
to discussing things with others.

654
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,220
I especially assigned a team of guards

655
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,140
to set up a barrier at the entrance

656
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,700
in order to ensure your safety.

657
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,260
After training,

658
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,620
it's best to drink something hot.

659
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,740
How about

660
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,980
I tell you one interesting story?

661
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,700
(All these years,)

662
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,700
(I never really have a family)

663
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,580
(nor do I know how
to get along with family.)

664
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,780
That's why I'm eager to learn
how to blend in.

665
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,220
I've been trying to change now.

666
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,820
Why do you still want to reject me?

667
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,300
(Ling Buyi)

668
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,820
(has done so many things for you.)

669
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,980
(When you like him,
you just can't help but like him.)

670
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,980
(If you don't like him,
nothing can make you like him.)

671
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,180
Then

672
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,740
do you like him?

673
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,540
(No one is perfect in this world.)

674
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,300
(Even if your beloved husband)

675
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,940
(may not necessarily
be complete to your liking.)

676
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,340
Kill!

677
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,580
(Even your father and I)

678
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,780
(had to work it out)

679
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,980
(before we become the perfect couple.)

680
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,260
(In this lifetime,)

681
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,180
(it's hard to be able)

682
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,860
(to marry someone you like.)

683
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,420
(Now,)

684
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,620
(I want you to be honest with me.)

685
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,500
(Do you really not like Ling Buyi?)

686
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,940
(Do you really not want to be with him?)

687
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,420
I'm someone who has been admiring
you for a long time.

688
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,580
Yet, you show me no interest at all.

689
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,460
I'm Zisheng.

690
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,660
It's too late.

691
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,660
You'll suffer from indigestion

692
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,460
if you eat too much before sleeping.

693
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,260
(Lady Cheng, you eavesdropped
on a military discussion.)

694
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,660
(When you go to
the Ministry of Justice,)

695
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,300
(you can only be a wanted criminal)

696
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,380
not an interrogator.

697
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,620
I didn't eavesdrop on
any military discussion.

698
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,340
General Ling, you can't make
a false accusation.

699
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,900
Ling Buyi!

700
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,740
Ling Buyi.

701
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,540
Help!

702
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,460
If there's anything else you want

703
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,620
to talk about my betrothal,

704
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,460
you may ask now.

705
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,260
Stop causing problems
for my future wife.

706
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,940
Don't move! Hold on tight!

707
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,980
(Is it painful?)

708
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,780
Do your hands hurt?

709
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,340
I'm glad to hear that.

710
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,980
General Ling, I can do...

711
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,740
Allow me.

712
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,260
General Ling has a point there.

713
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,700
If heaven is fair,

714
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,900
it won't separate two lovers.

715
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,820
Don't be scared.

716
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,300
I'm here.

717
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,260
(His Majesty always says)

718
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,020
(my life is lifeless)

719
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,260
(just like a wandering soul.)

720
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,860
(But when I'm with you,)

721
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,300
(my life becomes lively.)

722
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,340
(Shaoshang might not be)

723
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,260
(an obedient lady in everyone's eyes.)

724
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,220
But to me,

725
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,980
she's the whole capital

726
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,700
and the whole world's

727
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,220
best

728
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,900
young lady.

729
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,700
(She's pure and decisive.)

730
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,940
(She dares to love and hate.)

731
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,140
She's the one who can walk
alongside me in this world.

732
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,460
I'll marry no one else in my life

733
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,180
but her.

734
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:31,860
Father! Mother!

735
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,180
Father. Mother. I've already decided.

736
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,660
I'll marry him.
