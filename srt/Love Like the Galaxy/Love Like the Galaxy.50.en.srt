3
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,870
Come on, everyone!

4
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,590
Come on!

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
Come on!

6
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,710
Come on!

7
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,710
Come on!

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Come on!

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,200
Come on!

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,560
Come on!

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,280
Move aside.

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
Are you exhausted? I'll do it.

13
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,190
Come on!

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,080
Come on!

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,590
Come on!

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,430
Come on!

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,400
Come on!

18
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,240
Come on!

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Come on!

20
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,150
General Zuo.

21
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,520
Are you trying to kill Ling Buyi?

22
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,520
His Majesty gives order to save him.

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,870
How dare you think of harming him!

24
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,310
Seize him.

25
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,680
What?

26
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,960
Are you still waiting for someone
to come to your rescue?

27
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,560
Unfortunately,

28
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,710
it's too late.

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,000
Put him into the jail.

30
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,750
Torture him, dead or alive.

31
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,520
Noted.

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,280
Come on.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,680
We saved him.

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,030
We've saved General Ling.

35
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,630
Loosen your grip.

36
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,080
General.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,590
Why isn't he loosening his grip?

38
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,470
General.

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,870
Be gentle.

40
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,840
Relax.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,470
Loosen your grip, General.

42
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,750
General.

43
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,750
Try it again.

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,000
Be gentle.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Relax your grip.

46
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,870
You're all useless.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,190
It's been hours.

48
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,680
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,870
Relax.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Your Majesty.

51
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,750
General Ling holds the string
around his wrist tightly.

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,870
The string

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,430
has sunken into his flesh.

54
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,560
We'd like to disentangle it,

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,150
but he refused to loosen his grip.

56
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,590
If he doesn't loosen his grip,

57
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,960
we couldn't treat his wound.

58
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,630
String?

59
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,800
It's Shaoshang's string.

60
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,040
Zisheng wouldn't
let others lay hands on it

61
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
even when he's unconscious.

62
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,600
Shaoshang.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,310
Where is Lady Cheng then?

64
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,240
Didn't I order you to bring her over?

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Your Majesty.

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
Lady Cheng is outside.

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,950
She's outside?

68
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,680
Why didn't she come in then?

69
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,680
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,830
Lady Cheng said

71
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,160
that

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
it's over between her and General Ling.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's better if she doesn't see him.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
Over?

75
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,870
Did I allow this?

76
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,430
Bring her in.

77
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,240
If she refuses, force her in.

78
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,480
Noted.

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,800
Your Majesty,
General Ling's injury is serious.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
He was left in the cold too.

81
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Tonight

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,920
will be critical as
his chances of survival depend on this.

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,240
But General Ling
wouldn't let us touch him.

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
We couldn't even feed him medicine.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,720
I'll get Cheng Shaoshang in.

86
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,070
(General Ling.)

87
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,190
(Is it painful?)

88
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,560
(Come back soon.)

89
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,270
(I'll be at the capital,
awaiting your return.)

90
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,240
I'll wait for you to marry me.

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,390
(From now on,)

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
(as long as you don't abandon me,)

93
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,160
I won't let you down.

94
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
(We've bit each other's arm
as a signification of our promise.)

95
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,160
(The wound is connected to the heart.)

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,480
(I'll ask you again.)

97
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,600
Do you have anything to say?

98
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,070
(Who exactly are you?)

99
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
(Are you Ling Buyi)

100
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,070
(or Huo Wushang?)

101
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,270
(Ling Buyi.)

102
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,390
(If you dare to abandon me today,)

103
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,360
I, Cheng Shaoshang, swear to God

104
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,240
that I will never forgive you.

105
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,430
(I will never forgive you)

106
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,680
(my whole life.)

107
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,390
Ling Buyi!

108
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
(Shaoshang.)

109
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,160
Let go of me!

110
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,070
(In the future,)

111
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,600
(we can grow a garden)

112
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,870
(in the courtyard.)

113
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,030
(You shall play the qin
while I'll play the flute.)

114
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,910
(From now on,)

115
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,440
(we'll grow old together,)

116
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,080
(till death do us part.)

117
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,240
He has loosened his grip.

118
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,720
We can treat
his wound now, Your Majesty.

119
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,360
Hurry up and treat his wound.

120
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
Hurry up!

121
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,120
Okay.

122
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,080
What a relief!

123
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,550
General Ling.

124
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,080
That's great.

125
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,200
General Ling's fever is brought down.

126
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,390
He's fine now.

127
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,550
He has just regained consciousness,

128
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,120
yet you've fallen sick.

129
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,480
I apologise for
making you worry, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,000
If you know I'll be worried,

131
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,870
you should have
taken good care of yourself.

132
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,360
If Zisheng wakes up

133
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,000
and sees your current state,

134
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,630
he'd be worried.

135
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,030
It's over

136
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,200
between us now.

137
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,910
Are you furious at him

138
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,320
for hiding the Gu City case from you?

139
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,360
The righteousness of the country,

140
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,390
the warriors of Gu City,

141
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,630
and the injustice faced by the folks

142
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,720
are too significant

143
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,440
compared to

144
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,240
our relationship.

145
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,120
If I were him,

146
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,200
I'd make the same decision.

147
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,670
I won't blame him.

148
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
It's good that you could understand.

149
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,630
Are you blaming him
for risking his own life

150
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,080
just to kill Ling Yi then?

151
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,200
I have no idea when is he sincere

152
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,790
or when is he tricking me.

153
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,320
I thought he used my anxiousness to
save His Highness to get the tiger seal.

154
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,870
In the end,
I involved the both of you in this.

155
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,030
I even testified for him

156
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,720
in front of His Majesty.

157
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm truly sorry.

158
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,630
Women can never interfere with

159
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,270
what men do.

160
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,870
I understand your circumstances.

161
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,320
I won't blame you.

162
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,840
Your Majesty is kind

163
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,360
and

164
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,910
tolerant.

165
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm your total opposite.

166
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,240
I can't tolerate his actions.

167
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,150
If he wants to kill the enemies,

168
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,120
he can let me know.

169
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,030
I'm willing to go with him.

170
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,030
Even if it's dangerous,

171
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,790
I'd still go with him.

172
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,870
But I could never forgive him
for abandoning me.

173
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,000
He said that it's for my sake.

174
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,360
I was abandoned
by my parents when I was little.

175
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,960
Now, he has abandoned me too.

176
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,960
His Majesty and Your Majesty

177
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,910
have taught me

178
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,240
that a married couple must treat
each other wholeheartedly,

179
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,270
haven't you?

180
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,750
I've given my all to him,

181
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,750
yet he hides so many things from me.

182
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,960
He never treated me

183
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,200
wholeheartedly.

184
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,440
Are you certain about this?

185
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,440
Yes.

186
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,150
Do you intend

187
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,000
to find out the truth then?

188
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,320
Yes.

189
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,120
I'd like to find the truth back then.

190
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,600
What happened back then?

191
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,510
I want to give up

192
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,670
after knowing the truth.

193
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,720
If you want to find out the truth,

194
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,150
go ahead and investigate.

195
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,910
No matter what you discover,

196
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,790
no matter what decision you make,

197
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll always support you.

198
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,600
Why do you treat me
so well, Your Majesty?

199
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,030
I can

200
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,270
never

201
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,720
ever

202
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,910
repay your kindness.

203
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,030
My life isn't pleasant.

204
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,270
I hope

205
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,270
that yours would be pleasant.

206
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,790
You must

207
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,320
live a good life for my sake.

208
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,550
(I should learn from you)

209
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,720
(to be brave and seek for the truth.)

210
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,960
Let me go.

211
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
Go back.

212
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,400
I told you not to come,

213
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
yet you insisted on coming.

214
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,440
Let me free.

215
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,310
Let me out.

216
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,160
Ever since the day when

217
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,790
Madam Chunyu witnessed the bloodbath
at Marquis Chengyang's Residence,

218
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,440
she became mad.

219
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,030
She will pounce and
bite whoever she sees.

220
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,070
We got nothing from her.

221
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,480
She has gone mad?

222
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
What a coincidence!

223
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm here today

224
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,070
to clear my doubts.

225
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,240
I saw how Madam Chunyu
and Ling Yi treat each other.

226
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,960
They're not a pair of loving couple.

227
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,310
If they're not a loving couple,

228
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,750
why did Ling Yi risk his reputation
to marry Madam Chunyu?

229
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,550
Do you mean

230
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,480
that Madam Chunyu
has something on Ling Yi?

231
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,350
That's why he had to marry her?

232
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,070
Madam Chunyu.

233
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,830
Ling Yi has died.

234
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,590
If you get honest with us,

235
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,920
His Majesty might be merciful

236
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,440
and let you go.

237
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,720
Died?

238
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,440
He died?

239
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,640
Has he really died?

240
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
He's died.

241
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,310
He was beheaded.

242
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,350
His Majesty ordered

243
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,000
to dispose his corpse
at the unmarked grave.

244
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,550
No one mourned over his death.

245
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,400
What about you?

246
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,110
Do you want to live?

247
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,310
I...

248
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,310
I don't want to die!

249
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,400
She's mad.

250
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,310
Open the door.

251
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,750
She's not in her right mind.

252
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,030
Open the door.

253
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,920
Open the door.

254
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Yes.

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,790
Do you know why did you
have a miscarriage back then?

256
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,350
We asked your butler.

257
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,750
He told us that Ling Yi

258
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,160
added something in your food

259
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,310
that would make you infertile

260
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,200
after consuming it for years.

261
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,400
Do you think that
if you hide the evidence

262
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,640
of his collusion with Peng Kun,

263
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,110
you can be the Marchioness Chengyang

264
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,680
without any worry?

265
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,030
For a duplicitous man like Ling Yi,

266
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,830
he'd never get threatened easily.

267
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
He hopes

268
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,070
that you'd

269
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,790
live alone

270
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,790
for the rest of your life
more than anyone else.

271
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,240
By this way,

272
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,830
he can control you better

273
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,270
and you won't have
the guts to threaten him then.

274
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,310
Never mind.

275
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,590
Since you're mad,

276
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,550
it's useless telling you these.

277
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,440
It's good that you're mad too.

278
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,880
You won't suffer

279
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,110
when you know about the truth then.

280
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,960
(You will get to stay together
as father and son.)

281
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,310
(I'll find myself)

282
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,750
(another way out.)

283
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,000
Send this statue

284
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,070
to Lady Ruyang at Sancai Temple.

285
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,110
Tell her

286
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,270
that I molded this statue by myself.

287
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
Marquis

288
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,680
will be having his 50th birthday soon.

289
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,590
I hope that the Old Consort

290
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,240
can make offerings to the statue

291
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,160
to pray for Marquis.

292
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,590
Sancai Temple's

293
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,000
Nuwa.

294
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,400
Bless me.

295
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,590
Bless me

296
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,550
so I could give birth to a son.

297
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,440
Don't make me

298
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,830
live the rest of my life alone.

299
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,160
Sancai Temple's

300
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,590
Nuwa.

301
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,400
Nuwa.

302
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,830
Well.

303
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,350
Is she really mad

304
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,960
or it's just her act?

305
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Regardless of that,

306
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,480
if she doesn't want to die,

307
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,000
she has to be mad.

308
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,750
She's experiencing the suffering

309
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,030
that Madam Huo had
gone through previously.

310
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,400
This is causation.

311
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,830
It's her karma.

312
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,160
What are we going to do now?

313
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,960
Let's go to Sancai Temple.

314
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,510
Madam Chunyu must
have hidden the evidence there.

315
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,550
She must have

316
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,720
sent a gift to Lady Ruyang recently.

317
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,680
General Ling is cooking his medicine

318
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,270
at Chongde Hall.

319
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,030
Isn't it inappropriate?

320
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,350
It's my idea to do so.

321
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,030
Do you have

322
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,510
a problem with it?

323
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,830
I dare not to.

324
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,160
Since all officials are present today,

325
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,310
we want to know

326
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,400
what happened

327
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,480
in Gu City back then.

328
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,110
General Ling.

329
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,480
General Ling.

330
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,110
My surname is Huo,

331
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,000
not Ling.

332
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,720
I still remember

333
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,680
that was when
the apricot tree was harvesting.

334
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,070
(I was active since little.)

335
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,720
(Li was weak,)

336
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,790
(but he loved to eat apricot.)

337
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,510
(He asked me to pick some for him.)

338
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,070
Be careful.

339
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,350
Oh, no.

340
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,400
My mother prepared the clothes

341
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
for me in the morning.

342
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
If she knows
that I've ruined it in just one day,

343
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,680
she'll certainly punish me.

344
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,400
I'll have a look.

345
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,720
It's okay.

346
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,550
We can exchange our outfits.

347
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,350
You can say that it's my idea.

348
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,960
I want to wear your clothes
to the military training area

349
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,200
to show uncle

350
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,720
and test if he can tell us apart.

351
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,070
When we return,

352
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,160
you can say that I'm the one
who ruined your clothes.

353
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,110
Aunt won't bear to scold me.

354
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,160
My parents won't scold you.

355
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,070
But my aunt is hot-tempered.

356
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,110
She wouldn't let you get away with this.

357
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,350
I'm allergic to apricots.

358
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,960
These are not for you,

359
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,680
but for aunt and uncle.

360
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,830
They'll put in a good word for me,

361
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,920
as they're getting the apricots from me.

362
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,790
If my mother wants to punish me,

363
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,110
they can stop her.

364
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,510
(I changed into Li's clothes)

365
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,550
(and entered my father's
military tent stealthily.)

366
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
(I thought of putting
the apricots there and then leaving.)

367
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,720
I'd like to have a discussion

368
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,000
with General alone.

369
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,350
Who knows?

370
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,160
I witnessed that incident.

371
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,220
(Huo Chong)

372
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,880
Reinforcements from
the Wen Family are nowhere to be seen.

373
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,110
I think that they won't be coming.

374
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,920
Emperor Li currently
rules over half of the empire.

375
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,310
The Wen Family

376
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,510
wouldn't last long too.

377
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,270
It's hard to tell

378
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,920
who will be the winner.

379
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,510
We're both serving the Wen Family.

380
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,590
Is that worth it?

381
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,680
Since the Wen Family
disregards our safety,

382
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,510
why should you

383
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,480
hold the ground

384
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,400
at Gu City for their sake?

385
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I heard that Emperor Li

386
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,200
has sent over
200 thousand of reinforcements.

387
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,510
We won't be able to withstand this.

388
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,240
Let's

389
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,030
retreat.

390
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,310
I'll pretend I didn't hear that,

391
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,510
seeing that you're my brother-in-law.

392
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,070
If you ever mention
about abandoning the city again,

393
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,440
I'll kill you.

394
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,720
Huo Chong,

395
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,640
I don't want to kill you.

396
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,680
You forced me to do this.

397
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,160
You've collaborated
with the enemy indeed.

398
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,790
Why didn't you abandon the city?

399
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,550
Why didn't you admit defeat?

400
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,750
Are you trying to die with us all

401
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,590
just to realise your dream to be a hero?

402
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,070
The 200 thousand army
from Emperor Li is outside the city.

403
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,920
We'll surely die.

404
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,070
We have no reinforcements.

405
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,640
Did you think that the Xuan Family
will come to your rescue?

406
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,590
They won't.

407
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,680
Will the Yue Family come then?

408
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,680
No.

409
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,240
They can't come.

410
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,030
There's no reinforcements,

411
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,240
none.

412
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,350
I am forced to do this.

413
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,880
I'm doing this for everyone's sake.

414
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,640
Don't blame me.

415
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,920
Scoundrel!

416
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,550
Ling Yi

417
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,240
was always a coward.

418
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,240
Huo was the one who assigned him
to guard the storehouse,

419
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,350
so he needed not
to go onto the battleground.

420
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,510
If it's not for Huo,

421
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,920
he can't even

422
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,160
join the army.

423
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,510
Ling Yi colluded
with someone else early on.

424
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,270
But I didn't know who was that.

425
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,590
It's not until recently
when I discovered Shouchun

426
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,920
and I got to know that the one
who caused the Gu City tragedy with him

427
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,590
was Peng Kun.

428
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,270
Didn't I ask you
to persuade him into surrendering?

429
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,400
Why did you kill him?

430
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,720
Huo Chong is way too stubborn.

431
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,720
He'd never surrender.

432
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,160
If I don't kill him,

433
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,480
one day,

434
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,680
he'll kill me.

435
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,110
I've killed him now.

436
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,310
Can you let me and my family go?

437
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,590
When did I say so?

438
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,070
Huo Chong's death

439
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,200
is a good opportunity for us to attack.

440
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,790
Gu City must be exterminated.

441
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,590
The defeat of Emperor Wen
will depend on this.

442
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,790
Follow

443
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,510
me to welcome Master to the city.

444
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,000
You lied to me.

445
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,590
Didn't we agree

446
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,830
that you'll let my family go?

447
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,070
I agreed to protect you,

448
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,400
not your family.

449
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,920
If anyone from
the Huo Family did not die,

450
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,070
he or she will avenge for Huo Chong.

451
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,960
To succeed,

452
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,640
you need to be cold-blooded.

453
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,720
When you're titled as the Marquis,

454
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,680
you can have as many women as you want.

455
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,640
I'm not asking you
to kill them in person.

456
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,070
The army will do the job for you.

457
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,070
Stop contemplating about it.

458
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,830
Let's go.

459
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,550
The defeat of Gu City.

460
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,750
No one

461
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,750
survived.

462
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,680
Scoundrels!

463
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,640
Since Ling Yi

464
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,750
helped Emperor Li
to exterminate all folks in the city,

465
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,640
how did you survive

466
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,920
with Huo Junhua?

467
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,720
(They lit the house.)

468
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,310
(I passed out due to the smoke.)

469
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,310
(I was rather fortunate.)

470
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,440
(Dongye City)
(On that day,)

471
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,240
(Dongye City)

472
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,680
(Dongye City)
(it was raining heavily in Gu City.)

473
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,110
(Dongye City)

474
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,400
(Dongye City)
(When I woke up,)

475
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,200
(it was already dark.)

476
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,550
(There were corpses everywhere.)

477
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,720
Aunt.

478
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,070
Aunt.

479
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,640
Shush.

480
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,350
Don't let anyone hear you.

481
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,440
They'd return again.

482
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,710
They'd be back.

483
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,030
(I exchanged my clothes with Li.)

484
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,670
(He died for me.)

485
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,670
Li.

486
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,000
(We were afraid that
there might be some rebel army around.)

487
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,710
(We hid among the corpses for two days,)

488
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,710
(without eating nor drinking anything.)

489
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,280
(Then only we dared
to escape the city.)

490
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,630
(From that day onwards...)

491
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,960
Zisheng.

492
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,440
My aunt

493
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,510
was sometimes mad

494
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
and sometimes nonsensical.

495
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,480
Yet, she kept on calling Li's name.

496
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,230
Back to the capital.

497
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,230
Back to the capital.

498
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,840
On the way,

499
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,320
we had been beggars,

500
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,590
ate food waste,

501
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,480
and nearly died a few times.

502
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,360
We endured that for two years

503
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,710
until we managed
to return to the capital

504
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,550
and met Your Majesty.

505
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,000
Son.

506
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Tell me.

507
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,510
Who are you?

508
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,880
(Aunt addressed me as Li)

509
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,760
(as she wanted
to protect me from Ling Yi.)

510
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,800
(She was mad)

511
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,960
(whereas I was too young.)

512
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,550
(We couldn't fight against him.)

513
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,440
My name is

514
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,590
Ling Buyi.

515
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,630
Your Majesty.

516
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,110
This is all Ling Buyi's

517
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,960
one-sided statements
to get away with his wrongdoings.

518
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,070
Shut up.

519
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,670
I want to listen to him.

520
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,550
No one would believe me

521
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,190
even if I tell you this now.

522
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,800
Let alone back then,
when I was just a child.

523
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,150
Everyone would think

524
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,110
that my aunt was
jealous of Ling Yi's new wife

525
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,360
and taught me these lies.

526
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,960
If I want to avenge,

527
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,480
I could only
exchange identities with Li

528
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,440
and call him Father.

529
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,280
I hid my identity,

530
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,800
just to avenge my father.

531
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,320
But I'm not contented.

532
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,480
I don't want to kill him just like that.

533
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,320
I want to avenge.

534
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,230
I want to avenge my father.

535
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,030
I want to avenge the Huo Family.

536
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,510
I want to avenge the folks of Gu City.

537
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,920
I'll make sure

538
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,550
everyone who is related
to the Gu City case

539
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,190
pays the price for their actions!

540
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,190
I almost did it.

541
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,710
I returned to the capital

542
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,960
and started to investigate secretly.

543
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,280
On the other hand, Ling Yi started

544
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,510
covering his wrongdoings.

545
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,590
However, in the end,

546
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,550
I lost.

547
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,590
He killed everyone who is related,

548
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,280
including Peng Kun.

549
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,150
My aunt got sick

550
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
and died

551
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,150
in vain too.

552
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,510
Thus far,

553
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,150
we have no witness.

554
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,510
I'm devastated.

555
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,110
There's no other rightful way
to bring him to justice.

556
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,960
I could only do it myself

557
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,960
and meet violence with violence.

558
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,550
Zisheng.

559
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,480
Tell me, in your own words,

560
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,590
what is your name?

561
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,110
My name is

562
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,670
Ling Buyi.

563
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,150
My name is

564
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,800
Huo

565
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,670
Wu

566
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,320
