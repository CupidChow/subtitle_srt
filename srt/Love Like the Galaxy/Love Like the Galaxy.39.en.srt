3
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

4
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,699
Official Yue,

5
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,179
you may rise.

6
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:17,459
Thank you, Your Majesty.

7
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,940
I heard you were severely punished
by His Majesty

8
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,859
for causing trouble at the Censorate.

9
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,780
Why are you here
in His Majesty's presence?

10
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,459
Is your injury

11
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,340
better now?

12
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,859
Greetings, Marquis Yue.

13
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,380
I haven't recovered
from my injury yet.

14
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,739
But I had to discuss state affairs
with His Majesty.

15
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,260
That's why I'm lacking in grace

16
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,980
as I accompany His Majesty.

17
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,299
Zisheng, you're sure a filial child.

18
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:57,660
Official Yue.

19
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:58,739
Yes, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,660
I ask you here

21
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:02,019
to discuss something

22
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,419
with you.

23
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,540
I want Fifth Princess

24
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,179
and your youngest son
to hold their wedding quickly.

25
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,299
What do you think?

26
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:15,579
Your Majesty,

27
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,139
why are you bringing this up
so suddenly?

28
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,660
Father made a solemn promise

29
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,739
for the Xuan and the Yue clan's
marriage alliance that year.

30
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,220
Third Sister has married
into the Xuan clan for many years now.

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,260
Fifth Sister

32
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,340
and your son have been betrothed
for a long time.

33
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,540
It's about time
to fulfill Father's promise.

34
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Before the young ladies
of the Yue clan were married,

35
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,780
they were upright and virtuous.

36
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,820
Of course, you have to honor
your promise.

37
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,139
But don't you have to consider clearly

38
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:41,739
before you allow
the Xuan clan's young lady

39
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,459
to marry into the Yue clan?

40
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,260
What should we consider clearly?

41
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,859
Do I have to point it out clearly?

42
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:48,820
All right.

43
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,260
I never knew

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,500
Marquis Yue would segregate

45
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,540
the princesses in such a manner.

46
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,179
In my opinion,

47
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,260
the princesses are
His Majesty's daughters.

48
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,940
If I may be bold to ask,

49
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:03,100
why are you discriminating against them?

50
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,060
Your Majesty,

51
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,419
Fifth Princess had caused such
a big problem.

52
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,459
Everyone in the capital
is talking about it.

53
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,940
If she marries into the Yue clan
at this time,

54
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,980
won't it affect my...

55
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,379
I mean won't it affect
Fifth Princess's reputation?

56
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,499
Official Yue,

57
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,419
don't be anxious.

58
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,379
I'm precisely doing this

59
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,859
to protect Fifth Princess's reputation.

60
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,059
Just early this morning,

61
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,780
the Crown Prince suggested to me

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,340
to let Fifth Princess marry sooner.

63
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:40,140
The people don't know the truth.

64
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,259
That's why

65
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,939
the rumor gets even worst as it spreads.

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,340
If the Yue clan is willing

67
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,780
to welcome Fifth Princess at this time,

68
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,660
won't that prove

69
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,819
Fifth Princess

70
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,739
had never done
those immoral things before?

71
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,819
It's the best way

72
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,419
to stop people from talking.

73
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Official Yue,

74
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:03,660
are you not willing to do it?

75
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,819
I dare not.

76
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
It's just...

77
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:15,939
I

78
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:19,580
shall accept and thank you
for Your Majesty's grace.

79
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,220
Greetings, Crown Princess.

80
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,419
Greetings, Fifth Princess Consort.

81
00:05:58,419 --> 00:05:59,859
It's you, Lady Cheng.

82
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,980
Instead of serving Her Majesty
in Changqiu Palace,

83
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,140
why are you here?

84
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,499
Madam Liang and Official Liang came

85
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:05,780
to bid farewell to Her Majesty just now.

86
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,020
They left in a hurry

87
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,619
that they forgot to take the gifts
Her Majesty gave them.

88
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,660
So Her Majesty asked
that I go after Madam Liang

89
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,059
to reward some more gifts.

90
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,499
But I didn't see them

91
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,299
when I arrived here.

92
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:21,460
Isn't that Lingjun?

93
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,020
Lingjun!

94
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,859
I, Liang Shang, greet Crown Princess

95
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,460
and Fifth Princess Consort.

96
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,980
Greetings, Crown Princess

97
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:41,419
and Fifth Princess Consort.

98
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,379
Lingjun,

99
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,259
I heard you came
to bid farewell to Mother

100
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,859
right after you returned to the capital.

101
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,739
Why don't you stay a few more days?

102
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,419
My husband and I

103
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,179
have been living in our ancestral home.

104
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,980
My brother-in-law, Governor of Liang
came to report his work.

105
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:59,700
It happens to be Her Majesty's birthday.

106
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,340
So he asked that we come along.

107
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:02,859
Now that the birthday banquet is over,

108
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,179
we should also return now.

109
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:09,939
That's so rushed.

110
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,819
I heard

111
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,299
you have two clever children.

112
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,419
Why didn't you bring them to the palace?

113
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,540
The Crown Prince always talks
about your children

114
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,580
and wants to meet them.

115
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,179
Children scream and cry too much.

116
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,580
I'm afraid it's inconvenient
as they might bother the royal families.

117
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,580
I'm so envious

118
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,739
that you have children.

119
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,780
But I can't seem to have any.

120
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,660
Say,

121
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,460
if you married
the Crown Prince in the past,

122
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,819
we don't have to worry
about the royal successor now.

123
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,059
Lady Cheng,

124
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,700
let me make the introduction.

125
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,660
This is my childhood friend
I grew up with,

126
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,700
Qu Lingjun.

127
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,259
Lingjun,

128
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,780
this is Zisheng's fiancee,

129
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,140
Cheng Shaoshang.

130
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,179
I didn't expect Zisheng is already

131
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:11,220
at a marriageable age.

132
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:14,059
When I was your companion
in the palace,

133
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,419
he was only eight.

134
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,460
That's right.

135
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,859
I was only several years old
at the time.

136
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,460
Many years have passed since then.

137
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,540
Why don't you have a chat with them?

138
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,780
I'll take my leave first.

139
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,059
Official Liang,

140
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,299
what's the hurry?

141
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,259
Madam Liang.

142
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,980
Since you're already in the capital,

143
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,139
why didn't you visit
the Eastern Palace earlier?

144
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,820
I followed my husband here
to bid farewell.

145
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,659
We won't be visiting.

146
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,100
When I remember the past,

147
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,980
you and the princesses
treat each other like siblings.

148
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,060
I was so envious of that.

149
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,019
Yet, you ended up as an official's wife.

150
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,340
How things remain the same
but people have changed.

151
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,019
In this world,

152
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,820
many things remain the same
while people change.

153
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,100
It's not just my life.

154
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:11,060
I won't go to the Eastern Palace.

155
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,100
I ask that Crown Princess

156
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,060
stop saying these meaningless words.

157
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,019
Lest someone
with bad intentions heard it,

158
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,859
it'll bring no benefits

159
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,340
to the both of us.

160
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,420
That's fine too.

161
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,539
Then the Crown Prince doesn't have
to anticipate your arrival.

162
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,220
You can continue reminiscing.

163
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:27,980
I'll head back first.

164
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,340
Lingjun,

165
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:43,820
Crown Princess has left.

166
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,259
We can have some private time together.

167
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:52,980
I'll have to decline.

168
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,300
It's already late.

169
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,019
My children are still waiting
for me at home.

170
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:59,100
I'll be going home with my husband now.

171
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,139
It's a pity.

172
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,779
In those days,

173
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,820
we used to play together.

174
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,300
I was looking forward
to having Lingjun as my sister-in-law.

175
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,859
I pity that someone knowledgeable
like Lingjun

176
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,300
had to marry such a husband.

177
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,619
Her husband

178
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,940
looked impatient.

179
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,739
He treats her harshly too.

180
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:38,100
I wonder if she has a good life

181
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,700
with the Liang Family

182
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,580
all these years.

183
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,379
Fifth Princess Consort, don't worry.

184
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,259
I heard the Governor of Liang is
a reasonable man.

185
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,859
With such a brother-in-law around,

186
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,420
Madam Liang's life

187
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:50,739
won't be bad.

188
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:06,460
Madam Liang, wait!

189
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,499
This is a farewell gift
from the Eastern Palace.

190
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,060
Please convey my message
to the Crown Prince.

191
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,100
I don't deserve

192
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,659
such a valuable gift.

193
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:32,539
The Crown Prince granted

194
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,539
this treasure to you

195
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,019
to relieve the pain of separation.

196
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,659
How can it be easily returned?

197
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:41,940
Since it's a kind gesture
from the Eastern Palace,

198
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,539
you shouldn't refuse.

199
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:50,139
I thank the Crown Prince
on my wife's behalf.

200
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,300
Are you reluctant
to leave the imperial palace?

201
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,619
No, I wasn't.

202
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,499
You sure can't forget your old lover.

203
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,820
Do you think of continuing
your relationship with your old lover?

204
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,739
No, I don't.

205
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:39,619
Who do you think you are?

206
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,259
Shameless.

207
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:44,580
I should've beaten you to death
on the day of our wedding!

208
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:45,779
No, stop!

209
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,100
Why do you have time to come
to Changqiu Palace today?

210
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,019
I'm here

211
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,700
to report to Her Majesty

212
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,820
that Qu Lingjun
had murdered her husband.

213
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
The Ministry of Justice is

214
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,379
on the way to arrest her.

215
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,340
When did it happen?

216
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,060
Around noon yesterday,

217
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,300
Qu Lingjun sent lunch to Liang Shang.

218
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:34,460
After that,

219
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,580
the servant noticed

220
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,460
Liang Shang was stabbed
to death in the room.

221
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:38,580
Zisheng,

222
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,420
are you certain it was noon?

223
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,859
Many servants proved

224
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,659
that it was noon.

225
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,379
Impossible.

226
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,259
Mother,

227
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,739
Qu Lingjun is framed.

228
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,619
She didn't murder Liang Shang.

229
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,580
Yesterday noon,

230
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,580
I met her at Zigui Courtyard.

231
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,100
A tryst?

232
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
(Liang's Residence)

233
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,580
Where do you think you're going?

234
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,019
Who allowed you to take my son away?

235
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,300
Son, you died so tragically.

236
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,700
I won't allow anyone
to take my son away.

237
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Son...

238
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,779
Uncle,

239
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,139
this case is suspicious.

240
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:40,619
I must take Liang Shang's body

241
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:43,139
to the Ministry of Justice
for inspection.

242
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,739
This is the Liang Family's affairs.

243
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,700
Your mother is the eldest daughter
of the Liang Family's lineal descent.

244
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,379
(Governor of Liang)
You're also addressing me as your uncle.

245
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,460
This matter concerns the reputation
of your mother's clan.

246
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,980
You can't take him away.

247
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,619
This case involves murder.

248
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,060
It's no longer a family matter.

249
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,659
Finding the murderer
and trying according to the law are

250
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,460
the Ministry of Justice's duty.

251
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,259
I ask that Uncle

252
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,019
should not make it difficult for me.

253
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,779
Let me take Liang Shang's body
and the suspect with us.

254
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:09,980
Take them away.

255
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,980
No! I won't let you!

256
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,700
This vicious woman murdered my son.

257
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,259
(Madam Liang)
If I don't cut her to pieces myself,

258
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:22,460
it'll be hard to get rid of my hatred.

259
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,180
Do you think I don't know?

260
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,980
The Ministry of Justice
will take her away

261
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,379
and interrogate her several times.

262
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:30,580
Maybe you'll even discharge her
from the crime.

263
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,300
This is the Liang Family's affairs.

264
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,300
I should be the one who decides
this vicious woman's punishment!

265
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,820
If you want to take her away,

266
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,539
you'll have to walk over my dead body!

267
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:45,700
Someone!

268
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,539
Murder! Murder!

269
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,019
The Ministry of Justice is taking
the murderer away

270
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,180
to protect her! Someone!

271
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,340
You went out the palace yesterday noon

272
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,580
to see her?

273
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,180
Since you can't forget Qu Lingjun.

274
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,980
You could just order her
and Liang Shang to end their marriage

275
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,940
and bring her into the Eastern Palace.

276
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,779
Why did you have to have a tryst?

277
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,100
We were meeting

278
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,019
not had a tryst.

279
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:25,659
Not a tryst?

280
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,379
Then what is it?

281
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,580
I've been married to you
for more than ten years.

282
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,139
Why can't you just forget her?

283
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,180
I've told you

284
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,739
not to keep in touch with Qu Lingjun.

285
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:42,259
But you never listened.

286
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,259
Now, look what happened.

287
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,300
You had a tryst with an official's wife.

288
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:48,180
If this matter gets out,

289
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,820
won't Eastern Palace be a laughingstock?

290
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,539
I knew

291
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,180
Qu Lingjun rushed

292
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,139
to attend Mother's birthday banquet

293
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,659
only to use the birthday banquet
as a chance to seduce you.

294
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,539
But is she really

295
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,299
that good in your heart?

296
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,180
Is she that good enough

297
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,140
that you lost your senses

298
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,059
and did such immoral acts
after a reunion?

299
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,140
Now, she's even involved in a murder.

300
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,180
Nothing can be said
to prove your innocence now.

301
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Crown Princess,

302
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,980
you should let Crown Prince finish
what he wants to say.

303
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,700
What else is there to say?

304
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,339
Qu Lingjun shamelessly
seduced His Highness.

305
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,620
To continue her relationship
with His Highness,

306
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,259
she even murdered her husband!

307
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,299
Such a scandalous matter,

308
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:35,660
it's too obscene to hear.

309
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,220
How do you expect me
to listen to all that?

310
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,460
Just shut up!

311
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,220
It was because I put up with you

312
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,259
that you're becoming more unreasonable.

313
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:46,259
I met Qu Lingjun

314
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,019
because I learned she had been abused
by Liang Shang for more than ten years.

315
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,059
Why did she have such a miserable life?

316
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:55,860
It's all because of you.

317
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:58,140
Tell me.

318
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,539
How did my handkerchief end up

319
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:02,660
in her hand?

320
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:05,140
For the past ten years,

321
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,299
who has been using my name

322
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,660
to send gifts to her?

323
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,099
I've already asked

324
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,339
the eunuch who serves you.

325
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:18,739
In front of Mother

326
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,660
and me,

327
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:24,220
you pretend to be virtuous.

328
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:26,420
But behind us,

329
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,420
you deliberately ordered someone

330
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,059
to pretend that I sent the gifts
to Liang's Residence.

331
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,499
You even gave intimate items.

332
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,499
Last year,
you sent a summer sleeping mat.

333
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,019
This year, it's a jade pillow.

334
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:42,739
This time you actually gave
my handkerchief to her.

335
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,299
How can Liang Shang not be upset

336
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,980
and not beat Qu Lingjun?

337
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,660
She would take a beating
every time you sent something.

338
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,620
For the past ten years,

339
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,140
her life is as good as dead

340
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,739
because of you!

341
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,019
Why did you think

342
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,819
I did all these?

343
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,140
It's because of you.

344
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,460
If you say

345
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,420
her life is as good as dead

346
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,819
for the past ten years.

347
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,299
Have you ever thought

348
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,019
about what kind
of life I've been living?

349
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,460
It's been so many years.

350
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,779
We sleep in the same bed
but we don't think the same.

351
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,700
You look at me while thinking of her.

352
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,460
How can I not resent

353
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:48,180
or feel pain

354
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,819
in my heart?

355
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,539
When have I thought of her?

356
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,499
I've told you

357
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,019
it was already over.

358
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,299
But why won't you believe me?

359
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,539
Since we've married,

360
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,019
I've sworn

361
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,299
to spend the rest of my life with you.

362
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,819
But you never change yourself.

363
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,660
Look at yourself now.

364
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,299
Put aside that I'm not fond of you.

365
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,339
Do you see anyone

366
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,660
in the palace thinks highly of you?

367
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,140
I knew

368
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,180
you looked down on me.

369
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,019
Why don't you just divorce me?

370
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,980
And marry that Qu Lingjun!

371
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,259
That's enough!

372
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,019
It's all because of you

373
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,140
that Qu Lingjun was wronged
for more than ten years!

374
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,099
Today,

375
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,259
I'm going to prove her innocence!

376
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,940
If you're willing,

377
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,180
you can see His Majesty with me

378
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,940
to plead for Qu Lingjun.

379
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,460
If you're not willing,

380
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,620
you can get lost!

381
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,299
Qu Lingjun is

382
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,099
someone I've hated for more
than ten years.

383
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,620
She's like

384
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,299
a thorn

385
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:25,860
in our hearts

386
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,099
that can't be removed.

387
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,099
Someone that we couldn't see
without notice.

388
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,860
I can't wait for her to be arrested
by the Ministry of Justice

389
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,860
and die in the dungeon!

390
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
I

391
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,140
will never

392
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,819
plead for her.

393
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,539
Someone!

394
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,620
The imperial officials are bullies!

395
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:25,499
Get back!

396
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:27,420
The officials
from the Ministry of Justice hit me!

397
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,059
Someone! They hit me!

398
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Fine.

399
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,819
Both of you joined hands
to obstruct an official investigation.

400
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,980
You say

401
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:38,220
the Ministry of Justice
can't get involved in family affairs

402
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,140
and you want
to punish Madam Qu illegally.

403
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:41,420
Fine.

404
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,380
Then I'll bring someone

405
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,539
to discuss family affairs!

406
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:49,940
Let's go!

407
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,380
You vicious woman!

408
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,499
You had an affair with the Crown Prince
and killed my son.

409
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,739
My poor son

410
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,860
actually died in your hands.

411
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,539
You've gone too far!

412
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:08,539
The Crown Prince relied on his power
to covet his subject's wife.

413
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,220
(Liang Xia) I'm going to file this matter
to the Censorate.

414
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,259
Shut up!

415
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,660
Close the doors.

416
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,579
This matter ends here.

417
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,660
Stop pursuing this anymore.

418
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,180
Why should we?

419
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,420
Is my son going to die for nothing?

420
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,380
The Crown Prince
and she took someone's life.

421
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,420
Is His Majesty not doing
anything about it?

422
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,180
I trust Sister-in-law's character.

423
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,579
How many children of the Liang Family
are too poor to study?

424
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,660
It's all thanks
to Sister-in-law's financial help.

425
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,980
I don't believe she has an affair
with the Crown Prince.

426
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,380
Even if they did,
what can we do about it?

427
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,779
Can anyone really know

428
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:48,180
what's going on in the compound
of wealthy families?

429
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:50,019
Do we also need to know

430
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,019
how you rose from a concubine?

431
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,380
You ungrateful Liang Wuji.

432
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,259
I knew you were not satisfied
with me over the years.

433
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,819
But you're just
my late husband's adopted son.

434
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,099
You become the Governor

435
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,579
because my late husband helped you.

436
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,539
Today,

437
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,099
you take Qu Lingjun's side
and disregard my son's life.

438
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,819
Tomorrow, I'll report this
to the head of the clan

439
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,460
and expel both of you from the clan!

440
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,499
My poor son.

441
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,099
Brother-in-law,
you don't have to defend me.

442
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,739
I did meet the Crown Prince in private.

443
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,259
I'm at fault for my lack of conduct.

444
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,299
I admit my crime.

445
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,299
I'm willing

446
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,739
to pay for my husband's life.

447
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,140
You scoundrel!

448
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,059
You met an official's wife in secret.

449
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,460
How dare you come

450
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,700
and surrender to me?

451
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,620
You actually want me

452
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,940
to try the case
at the Ministry of Justice

453
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,339
to prove Qu Lingjun's innocence

454
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:10,499
and clear her name?

455
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:11,779
Why didn't you just choose a river

456
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:12,819
and kill yourself

457
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:13,620
by jumping into it?

458
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,860
I thought of that too.

459
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,059
But I'm afraid if I die,

460
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:19,099
Qu Lingjun would still be wronged.

461
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,779
I still can't save her.

462
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,819
So I came to ask Father

463
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,779
to handle this justly.

464
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:25,700
You

465
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,299
even notified this matter

466
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,819
to the Ministry of Justice.

467
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,700
Why didn't you just inform the Censorate

468
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,059
or the whole world?

469
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,140
Trust me.

470
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,420
Tomorrow morning,

471
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,099
I'll depose you from your position!

472
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,220
Father,

473
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,339
I just don't want Qu Lingjun
to be treated unjustly again.

474
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,019
I admit

475
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:50,700
that I met an official's wife privately.

476
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,700
Even if I am deposed,

477
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,180
I have no complaints.

478
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,380
I once

479
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:57,980
loved her.

480
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,460
But so many years have passed.

481
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,140
I've already let it go.

482
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,779
I'm just not willing

483
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,779
to watch her being wronged anymore.

484
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,380
I can't bear to see her being abused
for years because of me.

485
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,180
Nothing is going on
between Qu Lingjun and me.

486
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,860
We never did anything
against proper conduct.

487
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,380
I just feel guilty

488
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,499
toward her.

489
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,860
But there were only the two of you.

490
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,620
You had a private meeting
in the courtyard.

491
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,460
Even if you say you're innocent,

492
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,739
who would believe you?

493
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,099
Would the world believe you?

494
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:26,180
Would they believe you?

495
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,579
I don't care if they believe me

496
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,059
as long as I have a clear conscience.

497
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,059
Child!

498
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,660
You're being a fool!

499
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,019
As the Crown Prince,

500
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:34,700
you should be a role model
to the people.

501
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,660
But what did you do?

502
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:37,099
You almost ruin your reputation

503
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,620
because of a love affair!

504
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,140
Could it be that in your eyes

505
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:41,579
that Qu Lingjun's injustice is

506
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:43,499
more important than the country?

507
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,779
You

508
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,739
prioritize feelings over the country.

509
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,099
Can you even take the responsibility
as the Crown Prince?

510
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,499
Your Majesty,

511
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,380
we know our children's personalities.

512
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,660
When the children are wronged,

513
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,180
it doesn't matter what people think.

514
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,620
What they care about is

515
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:11,460
whether parents are willing
to trust them.

516
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,019
As a mother,

517
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,339
I trust

518
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,220
that my son

519
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,019
never did anything
that disgraced the royal family.

520
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,259
I wonder you as a father,

521
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,660
do you believe him?

522
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Zisheng,

523
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,819
go.

524
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,700
Get to the bottom of this

525
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
to answer the Eastern Palace

526
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,940
and the world.

527
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:50,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

528
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,819
You scared me.

529
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,980
How long are you going to eavesdrop?

530
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,460
Who says I'm eavesdropping?

531
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:33,220
I'm leaving.

532
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,499
His Majesty ordered
to investigate this case.

533
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,339
Can you bring me along?

534
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,660
Why do you want to go?

535
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,140
Then why do you want to go?

536
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,620
Naturally, for His Majesty

537
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:46,819
and the people.

538
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,460
I'm doing this for Her Majesty
and the Crown Prince.

539
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:50,620
You're doing it for His Majesty

540
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,339
because he raised you with love.

541
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,420
I'm doing this for Her Majesty

542
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,259
because she takes good care of me.

543
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,140
The Crown Prince made a wrong judgment

544
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,660
by choosing the wrong Crown Princess,

545
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,940
which led Qu Lingjun
to marry a bad person.

546
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,819
Now, he wants to lend a hand
to Qu Lingjun.

547
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,700
Yet, he got her into
an even worst situation.

548
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,539
He even got himself involved.

549
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,739
The Crown Prince's action is

550
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,660
truly...

551
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:15,940
Are you serious

552
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,700
about investigating this case
for the Crown Prince?

553
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:22,259
I wanted to help him

554
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:23,299
because I was impressed with him.

555
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:26,059
After all these years,

556
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:28,059
he's finally resolute for once.

557
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,539
He may have made
a mistake ten years ago.

558
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,420
But he's not doing anything wrong now.

559
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,499
He knew Qu Lingjun was abused.

560
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:38,140
If he ignores her
to protect his reputation,

561
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,499
that would be a disappointment.

562
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,380
At this moment,

563
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,460
he's a decent

564
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,860
and praiseworthy young man.

565
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,019
Besides,

566
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:48,420
the Crown Prince and Qu Lingjun
are good people.

567
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:51,059
It's not reasonable for good people
to compromise for everyone's interest

568
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
while bad people gloat proudly.

569
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:54,620
Besides,

570
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:57,380
seeing how Liang Shang abused
Qu Lingjun all year,

571
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:00,460
I'm afraid he also abused his children.

572
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,860
Such a despicable human,

573
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,299
just let it go after he's dead.

574
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:05,579
Why do they want Qu Lingjun
to pay with her life?

575
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:06,779
Such injustice

576
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:08,420
in this world,

577
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:09,579
I hate...

578
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,180
I hate it the most.

579
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,579
So

580
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:18,339
I must call out this injustice.

581
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,739
Bring me with you.

582
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:25,299
Oh, bring me with you.

583
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,779
All right.

584
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,220
Then

585
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,579
you must promise

586
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,299
that you won't cause any trouble.

587
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,819
When did I ever cause any trouble?

588
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,819
When have you never?

589
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,660
I swear I won't cause
any trouble in this matter.

590
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:00,259
So many carvings.

591
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,099
All the gold and stones in this room are

592
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:04,339
what my Second Brother
cherished the most.

593
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,380
Normally, he won't let
anyone touch it.

594
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,819
Unless it's urgent,

595
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,339
he wouldn't knock over the bookshelf.

596
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:12,779
According to the two servants on duty,

597
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,059
at noon,

598
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,059
Sister-in-law sent lunch
to Second Brother.

599
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,860
Then they heard him going in rage

600
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,019
and wanting to chase Sister-in-law out.

601
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,860
Dishes made

602
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,180
from your filthy hands are not

603
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:23,380
even

604
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:25,539
as clean as my feet!

605
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,819
Get lost!

606
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,980
I don't want to see you again!

607
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:31,140
Get lost!

608
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,259
Don't come in here again,
do you hear me?

609
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:35,539
Get out!

610
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,499
In the evening,

611
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:40,620
the servants who delivered the scrolls

612
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,460
found Second Brother dead.

613
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,739
- Master.
- Master?

614
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,660
Master?

615
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:57,700
Someone!

616
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,940
Master was murdered!

617
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,259
- Someone!
- Master is dead!

618
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:05,099
During this time,
no one went in or out of the room.

619
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:06,220
So we concluded

620
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:08,700
that Sister-in-law was the murderer.

621
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:10,539
And

622
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:12,059
she already admitted it.

623
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,779
The blood stench is too strong.

624
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,579
You should go and question Madam Liang.

625
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:28,940
I have something

626
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:30,940
to tell the Governor of Liang.

627
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,940
Third Young Master Liang, please stay.

628
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:44,460
General Ling,

629
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,579
what else do you want to tell me?

630
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,299
This case involves all the men
in Liang's Residence.

631
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,019
Everyone

632
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,140
including Third Young Master Liang

633
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,380
must listen.

634
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:03,860
Mother!

635
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,019
Child!

636
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,380
My children.

637
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,099
Mother!

638
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:09,099
Stop!

639
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:11,660
Child!

640
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,019
You vicious woman.

641
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,299
Was it because Shang learned

642
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,660
about your tryst with the Crown Prince?

643
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,579
To cover up this matter,

644
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,539
did the Crown Prince instigate you
to kill Shang

645
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:21,980
to cover up your immoral behavior?

646
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,620
It has nothing to do
with the Crown Prince.

647
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:25,420
The Crown Prince and I treat
each other with courtesy

648
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,180
and I've never done anything
wrong to Shang.

649
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,980
This concerns
the Liang Family's reputation.

650
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,099
Now,

651
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,259
only sending you to my son

652
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,940
then it can appease the hatred
in my heart!

653
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,579
That fellow, Liang Wuji is

654
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:40,700
occupied because of Ling Zisheng.

655
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,460
I'm going to beat you to death

656
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,819
to avenge my son!

657
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,140
Beat her!

658
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,579
What are you doing?

659
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:49,579
I won't let you hurt Madam!

660
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:51,019
A life for a life!

661
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,339
Youtong, get out of the way!

662
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,660
Beat until she's dead!

663
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,860
Get out of here!

664
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,940
Stop it!

665
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,180
Madam.

666
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,940
Madam Liang,

667
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,180
this case is not tried yet.

668
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,620
How can you punish her in private?

669
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:04,059
Who are you?

670
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:05,860
Why are you meddling
in the Liang Family's affair?

671
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,980
I'm Cheng Shaoshang
who attends to Her Majesty.

672
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,019
I came here with General Ling
to investigate this matter.

673
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:12,420
The Liang Family is
a century-old noble family.

674
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,740
Even His Majesty has
to give us some face.

675
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,699
Qu Lingjun murdered my son.

676
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:19,499
We have evidence!

677
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,420
I'm afraid Her Majesty wants
to protect the Crown Prince.

678
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:26,820
That's why she sent you here
to stop me.

679
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,139
Her son is important.

680
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,179
But is mine not important?

681
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,579
This is not fair!

682
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,179
You want to stop me
from punishing Qu Lingjun?

683
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,019
I'm going to bring
this case to His Majesty

684
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,860
and roll over the nail board
to file this complaint!

685
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,260
I want the whole world to know

686
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,539
how His Majesty and Her Majesty

687
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:50,780
try to protect the Crown Prince

688
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,740
and humiliate
the century-old Liang Family!

689
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,059
I want the world to judge this!

690
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,980
Beat her! Beat her!

691
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,619
Beat her!

692
00:34:58,619 --> 00:34:59,740
- Stop it!
- Stop!

693
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,380
Anyone who wants to judge this

694
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,179
can ask me to judge.

695
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,019
If it's an official affair,

696
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:07,740
we'll just hand it over
to the Ministry of Justice

697
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,380
and let Shanjian be in charge of it.

698
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,300
If it's family affairs,

699
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,059
since Official Liang isn't here,

700
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,539
then let me, the eldest daughter
of the Liang Family decide.

701
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,139
You're already married.

702
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,659
What gives you the right
to tell us what to do?

703
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,380
The right when I was still
the Liang Family's eldest daughter,

704
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:23,740
you were just

705
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,860
my father's maidservant.

706
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:26,940
Someone.

707
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,099
Bring Old Madam inside the hall.

708
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,059
Since you said it's a family affair,

709
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,179
we'll invite all the elders of the clan

710
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:35,980
to try this matter
according to family rules.

711
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,059
You...

712
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,499
You... Let go of me.

713
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,219
Hold her down.

714
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:11,740
From today on,

715
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,059
you shall no longer be in charge
of Qu Lingjun and her maidservant.

716
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:17,219
If you want to touch her,

717
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,420
you need to ask if I'll allow it.

718
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,780
I'm your father's concubine.

719
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,300
How dare you disrespect me?

720
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,179
At that time,

721
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:25,539
I never agreed
when Father wanted to take you in.

722
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,539
Poor family background is not an issue.

723
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:30,179
But you're narrow-minded,
shallow, selfish,

724
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:31,539
and never cared
about everyone's interest

725
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:33,260
but your own benefits.

726
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,179
Now, you made

727
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:36,579
a huge commotion in public

728
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,940
and dragged the Crown Prince
into this matter.

729
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,860
Why don't you ask the elders

730
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,619
if they're willing
to stand on your side?

731
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,579
Are we going
to let my son die tragically

732
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,019
and let this vicious woman escape
from her crime?

733
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:49,499
We haven't gone to the bottom
of this case.

734
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,019
We must not act hastily.

735
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:52,980
If you beat Qu Lingjun to death,

736
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,499
we'll lose a witness for trial.

737
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:56,099
If this angers His Majesty,

738
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,619
His Majesty won't make things difficult
for us

739
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,539
because we're
a century-old noble family.

740
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:04,619
But this will end the clan's career
in officialdom.

741
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,059
For your son alone,

742
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,019
is it worth it?

743
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,380
I don't care about officialdom.

744
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,820
I wanted Xia to be an official.

745
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,659
But none of you refuse to recommend him.

746
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:19,019
I want Xia to be the head of the house.

747
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,019
You insisted on saying
there's a rank to follow

748
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,780
and refused to give him a chance.

749
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,219
You're all proud of your noble origins

750
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,579
and always look down on us.

751
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,260
You refuse to admit when I say
you're narrow-minded and shallow.

752
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,420
When you gave birth to Liang Shang,

753
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:35,179
Father didn't elevate you.

754
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,099
It was after you gave birth to Liang Xia

755
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,740
that Father made you his official wife.

756
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,460
So Liang Shang was a concubine's son.

757
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,059
You were not willing
to bring up that origin of his.

758
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,499
So you never liked your eldest son
and only doted on your youngest son.

759
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:47,820
That's why you raised Liang Shang

760
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,219
into someone sensitive, suspicious,

761
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:50,940
and distrustful of women,

762
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,820
which led to today's disaster.

763
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,380
Xia is filial.

764
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,219
Is it wrong

765
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,219
to dote on him more?

766
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:01,380
I care for Shang too.

767
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,179
Now, am I not fighting

768
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,380
for justice for Shang?

769
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:09,019
He's already dead.

770
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,179
You can stop pretending now.

771
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:12,820
You were just worried

772
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,380
that Qu Lingjun and her children
would be the head of the house.

773
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:18,139
You're biased toward your youngest son

774
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:20,300
and you wanted him to be
the head of the house.

775
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,860
That's why you were so eager
to declare her guilty.

776
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,019
That's why

777
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,340
I don't agree my father should help you.

778
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,539
You must know this.

779
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:29,059
Liang Family comes first.

780
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,619
Your useless sons come second.

781
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:33,780
Without Liang Family,

782
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:35,460
how much

783
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:37,740
do their lives worth?

784
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:40,659
You...

785
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,539
You...

786
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:47,019
I'm still your father's widow
no matter what.

787
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:48,780
I'll just be frank with you.

788
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,659
No matter how things end today,

789
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,099
your position as the widow

790
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:56,019
has come to an end.

791
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,780
You wouldn't dare.

792
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:09,740
General Ling,

793
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:13,740
why are you gathering
all Liang Family's men here?

794
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:16,780
The murder may have taken place
in Liang's Residence.

795
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,340
But we're innocent.

796
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,179
We shouldn't suffer such humiliation.

797
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:21,699
Innocent, you say?

798
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:24,059
Liang Shang is a part
of the Liang Family too, right?

799
00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:25,740
If he was upright

800
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,659
and a good husband to Qu Lingjun

801
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,780
and intimate with her,

802
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:31,460
someone's scheme may not have succeeded.

803
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,340
But he chose to be an animal.

804
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,539
It was said that he and his wife
did not get along.

805
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,820
Now that the case is exposed,

806
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,579
we learned of Qu Lingjun's sufferings

807
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:40,420
and Liang Shang's despicable means.

808
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,380
Is the Liang Family

809
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,780
not related to this?

810
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,579
Are you saying Liang Shang's death
is the Liang Family's fault?

811
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
Ling Zisheng,

812
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,579
you're sure good
at distorting the truth.

813
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,340
It's the Liang Family's members,

814
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,139
Liang Family's married couple,

815
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,460
Liang Family's Residence,
and Liang Family's murder case.

816
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:58,579
If the Liang Family is innocent,

817
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,940
are you saying it's my fault?

818
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,300
I won't argue with you.

819
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,740
Just tell me.

820
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,740
Why are you gathering all the men
in Liang's Residence here?

821
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:08,699
This matter concerns the Crown Prince.

822
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:10,820
You can't hide it if you want.

823
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,099
If the Liang Family
doesn't hand over the murderer,

824
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,619
it'll implicate the whole clan.

825
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:21,619
Qu Lingjun,

826
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,940
I've always thought you were
a smart woman.

827
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:27,300
Why did you let your marriage

828
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,499
end up in such a manner?

829
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:31,460
Liang Shang abused you.

830
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,539
Can't you say or do anything about it?

831
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,940
If you make a scene about it,

832
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,820
this won't have happened.

833
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,539
At first, I wanted to end the marriage.

834
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,179
But Liang Shang threatened me

835
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,740
to spread rumors of me having

836
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,179
a secret affair with the Crown Prince.

837
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,699
I was young at the time.

838
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,380
So I was scared.

839
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:54,139
After I gave birth to my children,

840
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,219
I realized Liang Shang
was only bluffing.

841
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,380
So I asked to end the marriage again.

842
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,860
But he threatened me

843
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,539
that I have to leave my children here

844
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,579
even if I could leave.

845
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,179
How can such

846
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:10,460
young children suffer such abuse?

847
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,019
So I hesitated again.

848
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,059
Because of your indecisiveness,

849
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:19,340
you have brought
the matter to this stage.

850
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Now,

851
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:23,179
are you still not willing
to tell us the truth?

852
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:24,820
At noon that day,

853
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,860
who was the person

854
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:28,300
who delivered the meal to the study?

855
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,539
It was my maidservant,

856
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,460
Youtong.

857
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,820
Why do you think

858
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,659
the murderer is among us?

859
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,300
Don't tell me you want the whole
of the Liang Family to bear the crime

860
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,860
because you can't find the murderer.

861
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,699
Who says I can't find the murderer?

862
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,059
This person had such strength

863
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,420
to stab him through his chest
from the back.

864
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,139
The person who took his life

865
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,699
must be a man.

866
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:00,860
Liang Shang wasn't good at socializing.

867
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,179
So he stayed at home
and focused on his gold and stones.

868
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,460
Those who held a grudge against him

869
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,260
and competed for interests

870
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,579
must not be outsiders.

871
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,780
They can only be the Liang Family.

872
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,179
This matter concerns the Crown Prince.

873
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,380
In just one day,

874
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,139
everyone in the capital
already knows about it.

875
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,499
The murderer dares to act conspicuously

876
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:21,059
because someone is protecting him.

877
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Also,

878
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:25,539
Liang Shang is the head
of the Liang Family.

879
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:26,820
If the head of the family died

880
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,780
and his wife was framed as the murderer,

881
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,260
then his son

882
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,380
can never inherit his father's position
as the head of the house.

883
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:34,539
Whoever can replace him

884
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:37,659
may be the murderer.

885
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,019
Liang Wuji,

886
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,820
this person could be you.
