3
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,610
General Peng,

4
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,769
we've been eating meat all night

5
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,769
while you suffered beatings all night.

6
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,170
We feel bad

7
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:07,769
about it.

8
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:09,849
Treason is

9
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,530
punishable by death.

10
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,409
Since I committed treason,

11
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,449
I don't fear death.

12
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:21,449
If you want to kill me,

13
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,490
it's up to you.

14
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,289
Young Master,

15
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,689
General Peng's hot oil is ready.

16
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,609
If you insist on keeping quiet,

17
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,650
then you can stay silent

18
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,449
for the rest of your life.

19
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,930
Ling Buyi.

20
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,129
Are you mad? You're mad!

21
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,050
Stop it!

22
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,129
Ling Buyi, are you mad?

23
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,889
Peng Kun is a prisoner
of the imperial court.

24
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,609
You can't interrogate him in private.

25
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,609
His Majesty entrusted Shouchun to him

26
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,409
with great expectation.

27
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:15,409
But because of his selfish interests,
he plotted a rebellion.

28
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,210
This is disloyalty.

29
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,849
Lord Qian'an treated him as his brother.

30
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,490
So he trusted him and nurtured him.

31
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,250
Yet, he repays his kindness with evil

32
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,650
by killing Lord Qian'an.

33
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,370
This is immorality.

34
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,689
For someone
who has no morals or loyalty,

35
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,009
why do you want to defend him?

36
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,090
You're the one who's mad.

37
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:34,609
Every country has its law.

38
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,650
Even if Peng Kun must die,

39
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,650
we can only do so
after His Majesty orders it.

40
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,770
I must take him

41
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,889
back to the Ministry of Justice.

42
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,169
General Ling,

43
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:49,169
you've been interrogating him
all night in the military camp.

44
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,810
It's already against the rules.

45
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,770
I hope you will stop
breaking the law on purpose

46
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,650
and putting me tight spot,

47
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,689
and embarrassing His Majesty.

48
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,770
What if

49
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,210
I insist on interrogating him?

50
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,650
Then I ask you

51
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,930
to walk over my dead body.

52
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,729
I didn't expect you to be someone

53
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,210
who behaves in a fit and proper way.

54
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,970
I don't care

55
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,330
about Peng Kun's life.

56
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,650
But if you keep behaving recklessly,

57
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,809
you're bound to get into trouble.

58
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,650
You and Cheng Shaoshang
will be married soon.

59
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,210
I suggest you

60
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:38,849
be prudent in your actions.

61
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,450
Don't let anyone in the royal court
have something against you.

62
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,289
If you can only bring her trouble,

63
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,090
I don't mind

64
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:51,849
taking your place.

65
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:02,890
Your Majesty,

66
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,010
Peng Kun's wife

67
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,929
has complained tearfully
at Changqiu Palace.

68
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:07,929
How pitiful Peng Kun's wife is.

69
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:09,530
We don't know for sure
if the baby in her womb is safe.

70
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,690
It's all Ling Buyi's fault.

71
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,729
Does the Censorate also want

72
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,530
to blame General Ling

73
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,090
for other people's miscarriages?

74
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,650
The Censorate indeed has
too much time on its hands.

75
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,049
Hadn't Ling Buyi

76
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,530
brutally tortured him

77
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,890
into confessing the crimes,

78
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,609
would His Majesty be criticized now?

79
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:27,049
Are you saying we must be gentle
in executing punishment?

80
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,849
Official Zuo, do you think

81
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,530
handling investigations and war are

82
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,409
just what the imperial counselors
like you usually do?

83
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,770
Do you think you can
just use your mouths

84
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,489
to make a traitor confess his crime?

85
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:36,890
Third Brother,

86
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:38,609
Official Zuo didn't mean it that way.

87
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,530
Official Zuo,

88
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,809
Zisheng was also anxious
to convict the traitor.

89
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,770
I'm afraid there must be
a misunderstanding between you.

90
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,890
There's a fine line
between right and wrong.

91
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,570
There will always be a verdict for that.

92
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,570
Brother,

93
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,690
you can't blame
the guilty and innocent alike.

94
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,929
Are you done talking already?

95
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,369
Cheng Shaoshang,

96
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,770
you're getting outrageous by the day.

97
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,330
Your Majesty,

98
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,210
I'm innocent.

99
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,169
No matter how confused I am,

100
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,690
I would never harm a pregnant mother.

101
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:11,849
But she kept siding

102
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,330
with the traitor, Peng Kun,

103
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,929
and vilifying our Zisheng.

104
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,130
I just couldn't...

105
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,289
I couldn't tolerate it anymore.

106
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,090
So I gagged her with a handkerchief.

107
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,450
Do you call that a handkerchief?

108
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,489
You obviously used your sock.

109
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,489
When did you smell my sock?

110
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,650
You... Outrageous!

111
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,809
This is the Chongde Hall.

112
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,609
Even if Ling Buyi is your fiance,

113
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,369
you can't humiliate important officials

114
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,570
of the imperial court by saying so.

115
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:40,890
It's not that she can't.

116
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:43,890
She doesn't have to

117
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,690
because her fiance can

118
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,489
also insult
the so-called important officials

119
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,729
of the imperial court himself.

120
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,530
Official Zuo,
I guess you still need some beatings.

121
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,169
How dare you trouble my fiancee again?

122
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,330
Ling Buyi, don't go too far!

123
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,169
You kept siding with the traitor Peng Kun.

124
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,729
You're the one who went too far.

125
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,049
When did I side with Peng Kun?

126
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,770
He attempts to usurp the throne

127
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,849
and go against his superiors.

128
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,409
We can punish him according to the law.

129
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,890
But General Ling snatched him

130
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,489
from the Ministry of Justice
to the Northern Army Prison

131
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,570
to interrogate and torture him
in private.

132
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,849
This is against the rules.

133
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:30,049
That's because he's not
only involved in treason.

134
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,130
He's also related to the reason
Gu City was breached.

135
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,249
What did you find out?

136
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,450
Peng Kun made a desperate move

137
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,409
because Marquis Yue was captured.

138
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,249
Peng Kun is aware the secret
of his killing Lord Qian'an

139
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,489
that led to Gu City being breached
can't be hidden anymore.

140
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,770
But he was only
a deputy general back then.

141
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:57,570
He wouldn't have dared
to plot against the general.

142
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,130
The mastermind must be someone else.

143
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,650
Wang Ling told me

144
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:02,890
that Peng Kun has been keeping in touch

145
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,169
with someone in the capital
over the years.

146
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,450
And this person
who secretly associated with Peng Kun

147
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,489
is likely

148
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,809
to be the real culprit
who participated in Gu City's case.

149
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:12,690
Peng Kun felt threatened

150
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,090
and was forced to take risks.

151
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,609
General Ling took Peng Kun
to the Northern Army Prison

152
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,690
to find out this person quickly.

153
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,249
So Official Zuo,

154
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,929
how is this wrong?

155
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,690
Even so,

156
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,570
Peng Kun should be handed over
to the Ministry of Justice for trial.

157
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,049
Zisheng is one of the victims
in Gu City.

158
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,090
It's not suitable for him
to investigate this matter.

159
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,050
It's precisely the reason

160
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,849
I should be investigating this case

161
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,649
so I could comfort
the dead souls of Gu City.

162
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,810
Since this case is related to Gu City,

163
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,649
I'll let Zisheng
and the Ministry of Justice

164
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:47,769
investigate this together.

165
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,450
Third Prince,

166
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:52,570
keep a close watch.

167
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,330
Don't use torture
to extort a confession.

168
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:56,970
I shall obey.

169
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,009
Your Majesty,

170
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,810
Wang Ling said Peng Kun refuses
to confess

171
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,129
because he's afraid he'll implicate
his wife and unborn child.

172
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,129
If Your Majesty is willing

173
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,970
to spare Wang Ling and her unborn child,

174
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,649
she's willing to go
to the Ministry of Justice

175
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,290
to persuade Peng Kun.

176
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,769
The child is innocent.

177
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,009
I'm not

178
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,849
a tyrant ruler.

179
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:22,330
If Peng Kun is willing to confess,

180
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,489
I shall spare

181
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:26,489
his wife and unborn child.

182
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,290
Thank you, Your Majesty.

183
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:47,769
Your Highness, just a moment.

184
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,290
Marquis Chengyang, what's the matter?

185
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,849
I have a request.

186
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,930
Can I speak to you in private?

187
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:06,690
Shaoshang.

188
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,210
Shaoshang,

189
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,849
what did Wang Ling tell you?

190
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:17,369
She said

191
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,249
to let Marquis Yue give himself away,

192
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,810
you watched him collude with Liang Xia

193
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,450
to kill Liang Shang

194
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,090
and frame the Crown Prince.

195
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,249
Is that true?

196
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,690
Marquis Yue set up Madam Wen Xiu

197
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,450
to mint coins in Shouchun
without permission.

198
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,210
You already knew about it earlier.

199
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,729
But you never planned
to tell Her Majesty.

200
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,849
Let alone stop it.

201
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,889
You want His Majesty to be disappointed
in Her Majesty and the Crown Prince

202
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,970
than think of helping them hide it.

203
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:00,410
Is that true?

204
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,649
You punished Madam Wen Xiu.

205
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,290
I thought you were avenging me.

206
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:16,649
Rather than say you wrecked
the Censorate for me,

207
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:18,249
we should say

208
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,129
you purposely blew Fifth Princess's
case out of proportion

209
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,330
to make Marquis Yue make his move
on the Eastern Palace.

210
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,729
Is it true?

211
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,649
Everyone says you do whatever it takes

212
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,570
for me.

213
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,210
But who would have thought

214
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,849
that I was merely your cover?

215
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,529
I don't want to be called
the root of your doing.

216
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,090
I can't afford to bear that accusation.

217
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:01,450
Have you finished talking?

218
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:03,970
It's my turn to speak now.

219
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:11,330
The Crown Prince does nothing.

220
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,410
All the officials dislike him
for his foolishness and incompetence.

221
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,450
If he makes a mistake,

222
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,529
more people will criticize him.

223
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,369
But he's so easily persuaded

224
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,889
and values Wang Chun
and Grand Tutor Lou.

225
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:27,729
Between those two,

226
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,129
one is an incompetent person
who indulges in worldly pleasures.

227
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,529
The other one is a hypocrite
who's complacent.

228
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:34,570
If this goes on,

229
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,729
the Crown Prince would be wrong
even if he makes no mistakes.

230
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,129
Not only that, but it'll also lead
to more mistakes.

231
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,369
If we don't remove useless officials,

232
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,410
how can we build a great nation?

233
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,529
So

234
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,570
you were indeed behind all these.

235
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,489
Shaoshang,

236
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,290
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

237
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,570
I never misunderstood you.

238
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,210
I only want to know the truth.

239
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,930
I want to know what kind
of person you are.

240
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,609
How can you pretend nothing is going on

241
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:03,009
in front of Her Majesty
and the Crown Prince

242
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,810
when you were plotting on everyone?

243
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,009
Everyone I plotted against deserved
to be punished

244
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:08,810
and didn't deserve
the positions they were holding.

245
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:10,889
But everything I did for you came

246
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,609
from the bottom of my heart.

247
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,369
But I want to understand you.

248
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:22,849
I want to know

249
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:25,769
what kind of person

250
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:26,729
I'll be sharing my bed with

251
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:28,170
and having children with in the future.

252
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,170
We'll be married soon.

253
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,450
But I don't know anything about you.

254
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,210
Zisheng,

255
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:51,889
I ask you one more time.

256
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,210
Is there anything important

257
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,690
you haven't told me yet?

258
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:01,529
As long as you tell me,

259
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:05,170
I'll believe you.

260
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,009
Actually, I...

261
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,009
General Ling!

262
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:20,330
General Ling,

263
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,769
the Crown Prince requests to see you.

264
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,769
Go.

265
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:47,529
I want to see how you face

266
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,410
the brotherhood you have
with the Crown Prince.

267
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,849
Zisheng.

268
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,570
Your Highness.

269
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:40,529
Zisheng,

270
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,330
Marquis Chengyang rarely enters
the palace

271
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,450
and it's not always that you both meet.

272
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:46,849
Why don't we have lunch together today?

273
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,810
Your Highness,

274
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,129
His Majesty ordered me
to assist the Ministry of Justice

275
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,649
in handling Peng Kun's case.

276
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,930
The case is not solved yet.

277
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,529
If there's nothing important,

278
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,970
I shall take my leave.

279
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:58,889
- Zisheng.
- No need to hurry.

280
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,210
Zisheng.

281
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,930
Ever since you had returned
from Shouchun,

282
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,889
you never came to visit me once.

283
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:16,249
You're going to be married soon.

284
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:18,050
I have something private

285
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,290
to tell you.

286
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,129
Can't I even do that?

287
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:22,570
Zisheng,

288
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,009
Marquis Chengyang only wants

289
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,970
to have lunch with you.

290
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:27,690
After all, you're family.

291
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,369
Why are you so determined
to sever ties with him?

292
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:32,849
Zisheng.

293
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,570
Is that Peng Kun so important to you

294
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:37,810
that he made you put aside
your meals and sleep

295
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:39,649
and refused to delay even
for a moment?

296
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,210
Why are you nervous

297
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,690
about me investigating Peng Kun's case

298
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,849
that you'd stall me

299
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,129
from investigating the case at all cost?

300
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,249
I only feel bad for you.

301
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,330
I don't want to see you ruin your health

302
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,649
from investigating cases, that's all.

303
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:05,690
If it's just these meaningless words,

304
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,569
you can say no more.

305
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,249
I don't have time to hear them.

306
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,529
Nor do I have time to pretend
that you're a kind father.

307
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,729
Such pretense,

308
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,769
you can leave it to Madam Chunyu.

309
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,729
Zisheng!

310
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:26,970
I couldn't

311
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,890
help you at all.

312
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,569
I'm already used to it.

313
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:33,690
It doesn't matter.

314
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:36,529
No matter.

315
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,049
Madam Peng was preparing
to visit Peng Kun with his meal

316
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,850
under His Majesty's decree.

317
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,529
She wanted to persuade
her husband to confess.

318
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,690
But she didn't expect

319
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,489
that Peng Kun would die from illness

320
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,089
when she found him in the dungeon.

321
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,529
Has the clerk investigated

322
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:29,809
the cause of death?

323
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,809
The clerk found out

324
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,450
that it was an asthma attack.

325
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,809
Wang Ling said

326
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:37,410
Peng Kun had asthma.

327
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,850
He can't get near flowers.

328
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,049
It should be an old illness.

329
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,210
Peng Kun had committed a heavy offense
and was imprisoned alone.

330
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:44,130
No one noticed he had an asthma attack.

331
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:45,930
So he missed the chance for treatment.

332
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,970
This is obviously his retribution.

333
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,729
Peng Kun killed Lord Qian'an,

334
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,769
which led to the breach of Gu City.

335
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,210
Your uncle's family was slaughtered.

336
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,289
He deserves more

337
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,769
than dying like this.

338
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,489
Zisheng,

339
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,170
I know you can never forget
what happened in Gu City.

340
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,489
Peng Kun is now dead.

341
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,769
You can finally be at ease.

342
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,489
After you marry Shaoshang,

343
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,930
you can have a real life.

344
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:14,529
Stop worrying about irrelevant things.

345
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,410
Was it you?

346
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,769
Did you kill him?

347
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:20,569
Zisheng,

348
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,729
calm down!

349
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:23,809
It's all accident.

350
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,410
Ling Yi.

351
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:08,000
(Wang's Restaurant)

352
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,410
Young Master.

353
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,289
Get lost!

354
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,529
Young Master, it's raining heavily.

355
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:17,769
I said get lost!

356
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,170
I'll keep you company.

357
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:33,170
Zisheng.

358
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,450
If there's something

359
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:40,089
you can't do in this world,

360
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,329
it must be very difficult.

361
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,329
Other people won't be able
to do it either.

362
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,890
Everyone says

363
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,289
that I'm capable of everything.

364
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,769
But I couldn't do anything at all.

365
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:06,009
I can't do anything at all.

366
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:09,930
Shaoshang.

367
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:17,009
Every time I close my eyes,

368
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,850
they all looked at me

369
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:26,009
drenched in blood.

370
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,410
They kept questioning me.

371
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:33,529
Why?

372
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:39,089
Why am I not avenging them?

373
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,130
Why am I not avenging them?

374
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,170
I shouldn't have lived.

375
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,489
I've waited for more than ten years.

376
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,569
I've endured it for more than ten years.

377
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:02,569
But in the end...

378
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,970
But in the end, it's all gone.

379
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:21,729
No.

380
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,489
No, it won't.

381
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,690
There must be another way.

382
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,289
There's no way.

383
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,249
There's none.

384
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,529
I've thought of every way

385
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,890
and done everything.

386
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:58,329
But there's no way.

387
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,249
What exactly is it?

388
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,529
Tell me.

389
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,009
I can share the burden with you.

390
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,729
I'm your fiancee.

391
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,170
We ought to share everything.

392
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,009
At present,

393
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:20,729
it's a dead end.

394
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:24,890
Shaoshang,

395
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,370
I have no way out.

396
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,289
Are you really going
to stay by my side?

397
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,489
No matter what happens,

398
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,210
I'll help you.

399
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:51,729
No matter what it is,

400
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,529
I'll always stand on your side.

401
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:17,489
Cheng Shaoshang.

402
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,809
Actually,

403
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:33,210
my name isn't...

404
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,289
Young Master!

405
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,610
Something bad had happened!

406
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:42,170
Madam, she...

407
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,210
She's not going to make it.

408
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,890
Yuan.

409
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:11,130
I'm here.

410
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,850
Did you pick the apricot flower?

411
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,089
I'll go and pick them up now.

412
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,890
You love apricot flowers the most.

413
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,210
I'll pick as many

414
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,410
as you want.

415
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:34,249
Yuan,

416
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,489
it'd be nice

417
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,329
if I married you back then.

418
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,809
I was a fool.

419
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:49,970
An idiot.

420
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,249
I should've married you.

421
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,930
If I married you,

422
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,650
I wouldn't have ended up

423
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,450
in such a state.

424
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,289
Yuan,

425
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,329
I'm sorry.

426
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,850
Come here.

427
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,890
Don't forget

428
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,850
our revenge.

429
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:38,450
I promise you

430
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:44,850
I'll never forget it.

431
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,610
I shall

432
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,930
avenge us.

433
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,690
Good.

434
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,130
Li.

435
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,009
Li.

436
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,690
Junhua.

437
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,450
Don't worry.

438
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,210
You didn't sleep all night.

439
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,809
The physicians had prepared
some medicinal soup to calm the nerves.

440
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:20,569
Why don't you take some rest first?

441
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,130
So you'll have the energy
to handle Madam Huo's funeral.

442
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,489
I knew this day would come.

443
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,489
Human life is

444
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,049
like plants in the spring.

445
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,009
Death is inevitable in life.

446
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,329
A person would have to bid farewell.

447
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:45,650
It may be inevitable
to face separation because of death.

448
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:49,850
But as long as you have them
in your heart,

449
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,329
be it in the underworld

450
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,289
or in a far distance,

451
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,809
no one can truly separate you.

452
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,130
Is it really like that?

453
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:08,890
Zisheng,

454
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:14,330
what did you want to tell me last night?

455
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,209
Zisheng.

456
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,450
No matter what you want to do,

457
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:42,730
as long as you tell me,

458
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,169
I'll not stop you.

459
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,450
I know the case of Gu City

460
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,089
has been a thorn in your heart.

461
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,370
I also know

462
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:59,689
the sacrifices you made
for the Huo Clan.

463
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:03,169
If I had met you several years earlier,

464
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:07,290
I could've shared this burden with you.

465
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,009
You didn't have to face it all alone.

466
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,129
Now that Peng Kun is dead,

467
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:17,569
the case of Gu City
has already come to an end.

468
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:21,810
You can finally put aside

469
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,410
your vengeance.

470
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,609
Before we marry,

471
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:32,689
I hope you can trust me.

472
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,920
(Memorial Tablet
of Eldest Brother, Huo Chong)

473
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:44,169
Shaoshang.

474
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,089
If I do

475
00:35:49,169 --> 00:35:51,209
something that shakes the world one day,

476
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,730
would you still feel the same for me?

477
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,410
Your mother's coffin is here.

478
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:08,169
I'm willing to swear an oath
before her.

479
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:20,689
Spirits of the ancestors

480
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,930
and divine deities as my witness.

481
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,129
I, Cheng Shaoshang

482
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:27,609
hereby make an oath

483
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,250
that Ling Buyi and I

484
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,569
will never walk away

485
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,450
from our love in this life.

486
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,049
If he doesn't leave me,

487
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:45,689
I shall never forsake him.

488
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:50,689
I swear on my will

489
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,930
I will not regret it in this life.

490
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:04,810
Zisheng,

491
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:07,330
I dare to form a bond with a bite.

492
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:10,169
Do you dare?

493
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,489
Both of us have formed a bond
from this bite.

494
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,609
This pain will link our hearts.

495
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:18,450
I ask you again.

496
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,009
Do you have anything to tell me?

497
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,689
If someone hurts your family

498
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:35,930
and you know that person is guilty

499
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,330
but you can't punish him by law,

500
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:43,169
what will you do?

501
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,810
If someone hurts a person close to me,

502
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,290
I won't forgive them.

503
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,209
(I'll return the pain)

504
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:50,370
(1,000-fold back to them.)

505
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:53,689
No matter what happens,

506
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:56,290
I'll help you.

507
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,330
No matter what it is,

508
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,890
I'll always stand on your side.

509
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:16,770
No.

510
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,450
You scum!

511
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,689
You have the nerve to see her?

512
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,609
Get out!

513
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,410
We don't welcome you!

514
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:42,930
Marquis Cui,

515
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,810
there are many rumors

516
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,009
about you and Junhua.

517
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,410
If you stop us from entering,

518
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,689
aren't you afraid
people will criticize her?

519
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,489
You shameless woman!

520
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:55,730
Don't think about slandering Junhua.

521
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,569
Do you think everyone is

522
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,529
an adulterer like you?

523
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,209
Dear!

524
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:09,689
I wonder what brings Marquis Chengyang

525
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,529
to my mother's funeral hall.

526
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:15,009
I came to see her off.

527
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,689
Why did he hurt me?

528
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,970
Hurt you?

529
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,370
I was obviously hitting you!

530
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,730
Zisheng,

531
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:33,930
it'll be your father's 50th birthday
in seven days.

532
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,089
He plans to hold a banquet at home.

533
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,089
The Ling Clan from over the country

534
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:39,370
had already arrived here.

535
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:40,970
Your father came here
to invite you and your mother

536
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,450
to his birthday banquet today.

537
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,529
But we didn't expect

538
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:48,770
Junhua would suddenly pass away

539
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:50,730
and leave us forever.

540
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,290
We can forget about the banquet.

541
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,129
Junhua just passed away.

542
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,569
It's not proper

543
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,330
to hold a birthday banquet at this time.

544
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,730
But the Ling Clan has arrived
in the capital.

545
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,529
We can't reschedule.

546
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:10,089
Since it's already been set,

547
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:12,890
just hold the banquet as scheduled.

548
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,009
On your birthday,

549
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:17,169
I'll send a gift from Mother

550
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,089
to you.

551
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:23,689
I'm happy

552
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,089
that you can come.

553
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,489
I'll prepare
your favorite food and drinks.

554
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:31,689
I know you're sad.

555
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,930
But nothing is left after a person dies.

556
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,410
You must take good care of your health.
