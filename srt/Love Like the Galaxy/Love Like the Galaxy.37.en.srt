00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,680
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,488
Fifth Prince, do you want
to change into dry clothes

4
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,688
in Changqiu Palace?

5
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,369
If I follow you looking like this

6
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:57,768
to Changqiu Palace,

7
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:59,449
I can't imagine what others would say

8
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,369
about us if they saw us together.

9
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,249
When that happens,

10
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:03,328
it'll be hard for us
to explain ourselves.

11
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,848
Why not?

12
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,568
If someone asks you about it,

13
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:08,529
just tell them the truth.

14
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,209
It'll only work if they believe it.

15
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,809
There's nothing between us...

16
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,848
It's indeed as Chun Tiao said.

17
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,848
Fifth Brother and Lady Cheng

18
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:20,008
had a tryst.

19
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:23,568
Fifth Prince,

20
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,008
what's going on?

21
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:27,128
What happened to your clothes?

22
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:27,848
Father, I...

23
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,969
Isn't it already obvious, Father?

24
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,649
Chun Tiao just said

25
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:34,448
Fifth Brother and Lady Cheng
had a tryst.

26
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,769
Lady Cheng, how greedy can you be?

27
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:38,769
You're already betrothed to Zisheng.

28
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,769
How could you play around
with my Fifth Brother?

29
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,209
Fifth Sister,

30
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,848
don't try to implicate people.

31
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:45,408
I didn't have a tryst
with Cheng Shaoshang.

32
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:47,049
There's nothing going on between us.

33
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,489
It's not your first time having a tryst

34
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,249
with other young ladies in the palace.

35
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:52,329
Since when you were innocent?

36
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,369
Could it be you're afraid
Zisheng will come after you?

37
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:55,929
Is that why you don't dare to admit it?

38
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,168
Fifth Brother,
stop giving excuses anymore.

39
00:02:58,168 --> 00:02:59,688
Everything that you and Lady Cheng did

40
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,369
was seen by Chun Tiao.

41
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,769
Chun Tiao, tell everyone

42
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,369
what you saw.

43
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:06,529
Chun Tiao,

44
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,249
tell the truth.

45
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:10,809
I didn't see it clearly.

46
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:14,769
I only heard Fifth Prince call
Lady Cheng

47
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:15,769
"beauty."

48
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,049
Ah, I remember now.

49
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,448
I was reciting the Classic of Poetry.

50
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:21,408
Do you even know any poems
from the Classic of Poetry?

51
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:24,008
You were clearly too drunk
to restrain yourself

52
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:25,608
and acted indecently with Lady Cheng.

53
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,008
Absolute rubbish!

54
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,089
It was clearly one of your lady guests
who tricked me.

55
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,529
She tricked me by saying
there was a beauty waiting

56
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,089
for me at Jingxin Lake!

57
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,489
Fifth Brother,
you can't drag me into this

58
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,288
just to get rid of the suspicion.

59
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:44,848
I want all of you to stand forward

60
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,649
and let Fifth Brother see you.

61
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,649
Rest assured. If you recognize her.

62
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,089
I'll have her flog to death right away.

63
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,608
Why...

64
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,769
Why is she not here?

65
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,049
Fifth Brother,

66
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,128
you must be confused
because you were drunk.

67
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,969
It was Lady Cheng who asked you out.

68
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:01,369
In my opinion,

69
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,329
any young lady with immoral behavior

70
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,848
should be beaten to death.

71
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,688
So as not to be an eyesore to everyone.

72
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:07,649
Keep quiet!

73
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:09,408
Today is your mother's birthday banquet.

74
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,089
Why are you clamoring here?

75
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:14,809
Do you still respect your mother?

76
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,928
Shaoshang, tell me.

77
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,689
What exactly had happened?

78
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:27,569
Your Majesty.

79
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,488
When I was passing by Jingxin Lake,

80
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,848
I saved Fifth Prince
who fell into the lake by chance.

81
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:32,769
That's right.

82
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,608
Who would even believe that?

83
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:35,848
Do you believe it?

84
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:36,848
Enough!

85
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,248
Your Majesty,
I'm feeling a little tired.

86
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:41,288
I won't return to the banquet.

87
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:43,368
I shall return and get some rest
in Changqiu Palace.

88
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,808
I shall take my leave now.

89
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:55,649
Today's the empress's birthday banquet.

90
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:58,009
I can't believe
someone would cause trouble.

91
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,209
I'm not letting
this matter go that easily.

92
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:00,969
Someone!

93
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:01,848
Your Majesty,

94
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,449
it's after all
Her Majesty's birthday banquet.

95
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,608
The officials are still waiting
inside the hall.

96
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,689
It's not the time to pursue this matter.

97
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,368
Everything should be decided tomorrow.

98
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,769
For the sake
of the empress's birthday banquet,

99
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:19,769
I

100
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,928
shall let all of you go for now.

101
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:23,928
After the birthday banquet is over,

102
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,488
I'll settle scores with all of you.

103
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,969
It's a happy occasion today.

104
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,608
Let's go back
and continue with the celebration.

105
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:38,728
This is not over yet, Cheng Shaoshang.

106
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,368
Wait and see.

107
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:52,449
The weather is too cold.

108
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:53,969
I'll head back
to change my clothes first.

109
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:10,728
Are you all right?

110
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,288
Do you trust me?

111
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:13,488
Of course.

112
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,288
That's all that matters.

113
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:18,009
I'll go and check on Her Majesty first.

114
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,449
Last night,

115
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:15,449
you were not in a good mood.

116
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,048
You didn't manage to sleep
after tossing and turning all night.

117
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:21,168
Don't worry about me.

118
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,288
But you,

119
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,089
you need to rest well.

120
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,209
You woke up so early.

121
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,129
How can I continue sleeping?

122
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,129
It's all right.

123
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,689
You must sleep a little more.

124
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,689
Why are you up so early?

125
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,168
Shaoshang,

126
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,529
you've worked hard
for the birthday banquet.

127
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,009
After not returning home
for several days,

128
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,969
I'm sure your parents miss you
very much.

129
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,009
Why don't you pack your things

130
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,529
and go home?

131
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,728
Thank you, Your Majesties.

132
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:03,248
Cheng Shaoshang!

133
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:04,649
Cheng Shaoshang!

134
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:05,248
Your Highness!

135
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:06,569
I'm going to kill you!

136
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,168
You can't just barge in!

137
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,569
I'm going to kill you!

138
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,529
Outrageous.

139
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,608
How dare you clamor in Changqiu Palace?

140
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:13,969
Where are your manners?

141
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:17,649
Fifth Princess?

142
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:21,529
Why do you look like a mess?

143
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,009
I was rash

144
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:26,928
because I was also irritated.

145
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,209
What happened to you?

146
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,209
I was drunk last night.

147
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:32,848
I planned to spend the night
at Longyuan Garden in Yongle Palace

148
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:34,449
and leave the palace in the morning.

149
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:35,569
Who knows

150
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:36,848
Cheng Shaoshang actually...

151
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,329
She actually...

152
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,648
Father. Mother.

153
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,409
It's Cheng Shaoshang's fault
for pulling this dirty trick.

154
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,848
I invited those noble ladies
into the palace.

155
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,128
They did contribute by performing
during your birthday banquet.

156
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:50,089
Yet, they had to suffer
such humiliation.

157
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:52,449
Mother must seek justice for me.

158
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:53,608
What justice?

159
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,409
How can you prove
it was Shaoshang who did it?

160
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:58,728
I asked Longyuan Garden palace servants
who were on night duty.

161
00:09:58,728 --> 00:09:59,848
They said Cheng Shaoshang

162
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:02,089
went there before dawn this morning.

163
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,008
Did anyone see

164
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,848
her set up all those?

165
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,128
Even if no one saw,

166
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,848
who else if not her?

167
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,368
Only she knows

168
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,848
how to set up all those mechanisms.

169
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:13,289
If I may ask Fifth Princess,

170
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,209
why would I do that?

171
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:18,008
Why do I have to spend
so much effort to do this?

172
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,488
Because we push you...

173
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,289
Enough.

174
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,488
Since you have no proof,

175
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,488
stop making groundless accusations here.

176
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,049
Go back and get yourself cleaned up.

177
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,768
Go now. Look how dirty you are.

178
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,809
Mother.

179
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,569
Instead of standing up for me,

180
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,449
you're protecting Cheng Shaoshang.

181
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,569
I'm your daughter, not her.

182
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,969
Are you done shouting?

183
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,128
When you hate Her Majesty trying
to restrain you,

184
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,969
you will escape living freely
at Princess's Mansion.

185
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:53,209
I've never seen you being filial to her.

186
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,128
Now when you need Her Majesty
to stand up for you,

187
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:57,409
only then

188
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:00,049
do you remember you're
Her Majesty's daughter.

189
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,209
Heng, why are you...

190
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,209
Your Majesty,

191
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:04,768
the incident happened
in Longyuan Garden, in my palace.

192
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:06,969
How can I not get involved?

193
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,569
That's why I'm here.

194
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,929
Cheng Shaoshang set up traps
in Longyuan Garden

195
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:13,969
and made the whole place dirty.

196
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,689
Consort Yue, you must punish her.

197
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,209
Well,

198
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:21,648
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

199
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,329
This wastewater and whipping
are still not enough

200
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,728
to make you realize your mistake.

201
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,248
If you're still confused,

202
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:33,809
I can grant you another bucket.

203
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:35,929
Consort Yue.

204
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,768
I may not be your birth daughter.

205
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:40,128
But you can't be this unreasonable.

206
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,449
You're doing this to me

207
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:42,089
because

208
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:43,848
I refused to marry into your Yue Family.

209
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:44,809
Fifth Princess.

210
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,289
What's so great about your Yue clan?

211
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,409
All you did was go to war with Father
and make some accomplishments.

212
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,449
Everyone did that.

213
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,528
Even my mother is not
as arrogant as you.

214
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:56,449
Shut up.

215
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:58,608
Stop spouting nonsense.

216
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,728
Who are you

217
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,528
to discuss the Xuan
and the Yue clan's accomplishments?

218
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,488
Do you think forbidding me
from saying it

219
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,488
will stop the people
from speaking of it?

220
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:08,689
Even the aides in my mansion know

221
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:09,488
that the Yue clan

222
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,848
flaunts their power
over their past achievements

223
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,128
and attempts to oppress Changqiu Palace!

224
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:15,248
Keep quiet!

225
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:17,169
Child!

226
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,528
Heng,

227
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,368
I failed to teach my daughter well.

228
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:25,848
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,049
Mother,

230
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,569
don't blame yourself.

231
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:30,809
The more you tolerate her,

232
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,569
the more she gets ahead of herself.

233
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,768
You were worried about Father
and suffered all grievances alone.

234
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,409
I can never endure such grievance!

235
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,049
All these years, do they still remember

236
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,089
that you are the empress?

237
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:39,848
You!

238
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:42,488
All Father does all day
is flirt with Yue Heng.

239
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:43,848
He doesn't care about us
from Changqiu...

240
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:52,248
Your Majesty,

241
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,008
forgive me.

242
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,689
Fifth Princess had made
such impertinent remarks.

243
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:58,329
I had

244
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,728
to teach her for you.

245
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:05,409
How dare you slap me?

246
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,929
You set Cheng Shaoshang up

247
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,289
during your mother's birthday banquet.

248
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,488
Is it wrong for me to slap you?

249
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:13,728
You're spouting nonsense!

250
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:14,929
No one has any evidence!

251
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,089
I do!

252
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:29,608
What's...

253
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,209
Your Majesty,

254
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:32,689
this person was brought into the palace
by Fifth Princess

255
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,449
for the dance performance.

256
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:35,768
Just now,

257
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,248
she has confessed everything.

258
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:38,768
Everything

259
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:41,128
was ordered by Fifth Princess.

260
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,128
Fifth Princess knows my fiancee

261
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,648
is trying to sober up at Jingxin Lake.

262
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,848
She deliberately tricked
Fifth Prince there

263
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,409
to set up my fiancee
and Fifth Prince having a tryst

264
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:52,848
so she could ruin
my fiancee's reputation.

265
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,248
Fifth Prince

266
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:56,728
and this young lady

267
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,569
can be witnesses to this incident.

268
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,929
Father. Mother.

269
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,368
It was her.

270
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,608
She was the one

271
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,488
who tricked me to go to Jingxin Lake.

272
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,169
Tell me.

273
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,248
What exactly had happened?

274
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:13,608
That's right.

275
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:14,728
Speak.

276
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:16,648
Did I order you to do it?

277
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:19,528
You better watch what you say.

278
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,169
I...

279
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:25,329
Speak!

280
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,049
Father,

281
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,329
she's the Palace Aide's daughter.

282
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:36,809
I invited her into the palace

283
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,488
as an honored guest
at Mother's birthday banquet.

284
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,648
Now she fainted

285
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:40,969
after being framed.

286
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:43,648
Someone.

287
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,049
Send her back to her father

288
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:46,449
and discipline her!

289
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:47,209
Father,

290
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,569
Fifth Sister obviously threatened her

291
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:49,768
until she fainted.

292
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:51,089
Everything was ordered by Fifth Sister!

293
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:51,969
Enough already.

294
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:53,089
You bastard.

295
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,248
How dare you have a shot at me?

296
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:55,049
What did you call me?

297
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:56,169
Shut your mouth!

298
00:14:57,248 --> 00:14:58,289
What did you say?

299
00:14:58,368 --> 00:14:59,969
He's your Fifth Brother!

300
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:02,768
How dare you shame your brother?

301
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:03,969
In your eyes,

302
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,768
do you have no family affections

303
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,049
and me as your father?

304
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,969
Father, I wasn't criticizing you.

305
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:11,209
But him!

306
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,569
Brother?

307
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:14,848
His mother is only a lowly palace maid.

308
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,368
She climbed into your bed
while you were drunk.

309
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:19,049
That was the reason

310
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,969
palace maids are not allowed
to serve in your palace hall anymore

311
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:21,929
and you never visit

312
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,848
the filthy place both mother
and son live!

313
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:26,569
Father,

314
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:29,049
I'm the direct descendant
of Changqiu Palace.

315
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,848
How could you take
these filthy people's side

316
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,608
to say I'm to be blamed?

317
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,449
How can there be truth coming
from these filthy people's mouths?

318
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:36,728
That's enough!

319
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,569
When I was young,

320
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,329
I went through difficult times

321
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,809
so my children could live a better life.

322
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:45,049
I didn't expect

323
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,008
you'll turn out so arrogant!

324
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,248
You were heartless to your brother

325
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,089
and disrespectful to Consort Yue

326
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:53,809
and your father.

327
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:54,809
You actually

328
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,528
frame others on the day
of my birthday banquet.

329
00:15:57,969 --> 00:15:59,049
Now,

330
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,049
even if your father forgives you,

331
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,809
I'll never let you go easily!

332
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:03,929
Someone!

333
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,128
Mother,

334
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,329
I'm your flesh and blood.

335
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:09,449
How could you...

336
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:11,289
Father,

337
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:12,848
you can't just blame me alone.

338
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:14,929
There's no grudge
between Cheng Shaoshang and me.

339
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,608
Consort Yue's
Longyuan Garden looks exquisite.

340
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,089
Putting aside
that the noble ladies and I

341
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:19,329
were splashed with wastewater
in Longyuan Garden

342
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,008
for no reason at all.

343
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,289
We were also thrashed by twigs

344
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:23,848
and dumped on by mugwort ashes.

345
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,648
Shouldn't she be punished for that?

346
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:29,049
No grudge, you say?

347
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:30,089
The day before,

348
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,329
you and those young ladies pushed
Cheng Shaoshang into the lake.

349
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:34,449
Did you think no one knew about it?

350
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,648
Unexpectedly, I know

351
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:37,528
everything that happens

352
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,528
in the palace!

353
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,409
Cheng Shaoshang,

354
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,409
it looks like

355
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:53,488
you've kept many things in your heart.

356
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:03,248
Your Majesties,

357
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:04,328
I've committed a crime.

358
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:07,129
I indeed set up the traps at dawn.

359
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,169
See?

360
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,129
She admitted she did it.

361
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,409
I'm willing to be punished.

362
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:16,929
Fifth Princess knew I couldn't swim.

363
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,449
But they still pushed me into the lake.

364
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:19,649
They also threw rocks at me

365
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,169
to stop me from going ashore.

366
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:23,209
So

367
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:25,288
I did it to get even with her.

368
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,169
Since you were going
to revenge for yourself,

369
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,328
why did you wait until today?

370
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:31,328
Consort Yue,

371
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,248
Her Majesty's birthday banquet
was an important event.

372
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:35,169
I can't disregard Her Majesty's dignity

373
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,609
because of my personal grudge.

374
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:38,409
I waited until Her Majesty's
birthday banquet was over.

375
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,728
Only then did I seek my revenge.

376
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:43,008
Fifth Princess,

377
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:44,689
I splashed you with wastewater

378
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:47,288
because you made me swallow
a lot of lake water.

379
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,728
I used twigs to thrash you

380
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,649
because you ruined Her Majesty's
birthday banquet

381
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:52,169
by framing me.

382
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:54,449
I'll take those whipping
as your punishment.

383
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:56,808
Finally,

384
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:00,369
did the ashes make you realize
your mistakes yet?

385
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,048
Judging from your behavior,

386
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:03,849
I guess not.

387
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,088
Cheng Shaoshang!

388
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,849
I should've killed you
with poisonous snakes that day!

389
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,328
So you won't be alive

390
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:12,728
to humiliate me so!

391
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,568
You even released snakes?

392
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,449
I...

393
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:21,649
Fifth Princess,

394
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,649
you released snakes to bite my fiancee.

395
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,449
What an atrocious deed.

396
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:28,568
After you leave the palace,

397
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,169
I'll definitely prepare
a huge "gift" for you.

398
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,209
You don't scare me.

399
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:37,129
I'm a princess.
You can't do anything to me.

400
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,129
Father. Mother.

401
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,369
Cheng Shaoshang is nothing
but a military general's daughter.

402
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:43,929
So what if she dies?

403
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:44,849
As a princess,

404
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:45,808
killing someone

405
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,409
is just similar to killing an ant!

406
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,248
How are their lives considered precious?

407
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:52,609
Father. Mother.

408
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:53,808
Why do you keep taking their sides

409
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:55,689
and not your child's side?

410
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,409
You're mad.

411
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,248
You're totally out of your mind!

412
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:04,048
Do you still deserve
to be someone's child?

413
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:07,528
Do you deserve to call her mother?

414
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,209
You treated Cheng Shaoshang
in such an atrocious manner.

415
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:12,169
Even she knows how to be patient

416
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:14,248
and waited
until the birthday banquet ended

417
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:15,568
to settle scores with you.

418
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,808
But what did you do?

419
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:19,288
During your mother's birthday banquet,

420
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:21,808
you chose to frame others
with your malicious plot.

421
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:24,248
Treacherous and unfilial!

422
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,248
Get out. Get out of Changqiu Palace.

423
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:29,209
Your Majesty.

424
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,248
Go back to your Princess's Mansion!

425
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,248
If you still want to save
our mother-daughter relationship,

426
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:36,728
get out now!

427
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:37,808
Someone!

428
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,369
Take Fifth Princess

429
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:40,969
to the imperial mausoleum.

430
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,209
Let her reflect on her mistakes

431
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:45,129
in front of the ancestors for the day!

432
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:46,689
Only then can you return
to your Princess's Mansion!

433
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,169
From now on,

434
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,568
without my decree,

435
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,488
you're forbidden from leaving
your Princess's Mansion!

436
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,409
Father,

437
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:55,568
I'm not wrong!

438
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,528
I've been framed, Father!

439
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:58,768
Mother!

440
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,369
Chase her out!

441
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,528
Father!

442
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:02,768
Father!

443
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:05,768
Cheng Shaoshang, I'll never forget this!

444
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:06,568
Your Majesty!

445
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:07,609
Your Majesty!

446
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,129
- Your Majesty.
- Empress.

447
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:10,369
Cheng Shaoshang, just you wait!

448
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:11,849
Hurry, bring her inside.

449
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,728
Get lost! Get out of here!

450
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,008
Shen'an.

451
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:22,689
Hold it right there.

452
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:24,129
Lady Luo.

453
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:28,849
Fifth Princess has
Their Majesties to punish her.

454
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:30,728
What about Chun Tiao?

455
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:32,409
She shouted the moment
she entered the hall

456
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:35,008
that Cheng Shaoshang
and Fifth Prince had a tryst.

457
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:36,689
How are you going to punish her

458
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,288
for such an instigation?

459
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,409
Consort Yue,

460
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:48,689
I never thought

461
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,969
Chun Tiao would do such a thing.

462
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,169
A scheming maidservant like this,

463
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:54,768
I dare not keep her.

464
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,209
Tomorrow, I'll request Father
and Brother to sell her off.

465
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,409
Northwest or southern border

466
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:01,929
is fine with me.

467
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:07,248
I had no idea

468
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,969
that you were this decisive.

469
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,169
I've underestimated you.

470
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,969
It looks like things are getting

471
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,609
more and more interesting
in Changqiu Palace.

472
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,129
I

473
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:23,689
shall watch how all of you keep this up.

474
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:15,409
You cried asking me
to hug you that night.

475
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,488
Was it because they bullied you

476
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,288
and felt wronged?

477
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,169
If Fifth Princess
didn't accidentally slip it out,

478
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,169
how long are you planning
to hide this from me?

479
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:32,409
Those weren't venomous snakes.

480
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:34,488
They were just common water snakes.

481
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:36,689
They're often seen in the countryside.

482
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,169
What about pushing you into the lake?

483
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:40,609
Why didn't you tell me?

484
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:42,969
What if one day

485
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,048
they wanted to take your life?

486
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:47,689
Are you not going to tell me either?

487
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:49,849
Shaoshang,

488
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,169
who do you see me as?

489
00:22:52,808 --> 00:22:54,409
Why do you always act on your own

490
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:56,488
and don't trust me?

491
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,609
It's not I'm not willing to trust you.

492
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:00,209
I was just...

493
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:02,209
You just don't think I'm important.

494
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:13,929
After betrothing to you,

495
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:17,849
I'd often think

496
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:20,609
it'd be nice

497
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:23,209
if I could be your confidant

498
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:25,929
and support.

499
00:23:26,728 --> 00:23:28,528
You could share with me

500
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:30,129
all your fears and loneliness.

501
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:32,689
I'm not trying to control you.

502
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,328
I just hope you can be honest with me.

503
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,768
But I can't seem
to make you warm up to me.

504
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,849
Why must a young lady wait

505
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:44,449
for her fiance to save her?

506
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:46,808
Why can't we save ourselves?

507
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,728
It's not a serious matter to me.

508
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:51,169
I can completely take care of it.

509
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:53,969
It was similar

510
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,288
to the fight I had with Wang Ling
because she insulted me.

511
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:57,689
Did I tell anyone about it?

512
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:59,209
When I dismantled the bridge
to vent my anger,

513
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,488
did I tell anyone about that too?

514
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,088
I've always been like this.

515
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,808
Why can't I be myself after knowing you?

516
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:08,849
But those were just fighting
between normal families.

517
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:10,689
This is the imperial palace.

518
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:12,288
What if you lost your life
because of your reckless behavior?

519
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,609
What should I do?

520
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,088
I can avenge your death after that.

521
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,609
But when that happens,

522
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,048
can you still come back to life?

523
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:20,728
You brought me to the imperial palace.

524
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:22,689
Everything is because of you

525
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:23,849
that I run into these dangers.

526
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:25,929
So you think this is my fault.

527
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,568
So this is how you truly feel.

528
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:35,328
You don't trust me.

529
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,609
Sometimes, you'd even fear me.

530
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,008
Yes.

531
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:43,129
I'm afraid of you.

532
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:47,008
But I want to get close to you too.

533
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:50,528
These feelings
don't contradict each other,

534
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:51,929
do they?

535
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,689
I've been given the cold shoulder
for so many years.

536
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:58,488
Even if I want to love you,

537
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:00,488
I still need time to accept it.

538
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:01,689
I can't rush in this matter.

539
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:03,449
I finally understand

540
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:06,568
you like Lou Yao

541
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:08,369
because he can't hurt you.

542
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:11,248
You feel comfortable and carefree
when you're with him.

543
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:14,129
But I forced you to stay.

544
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:18,328
You became fearful of me

545
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:22,528
and even hated me.

546
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,568
You won't even regard me
as someone close to you.

547
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:33,768
I shouldn't have made you stay.

548
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,369
I should have known this earlier.

549
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:40,528
Ling Buyi.

550
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:44,248
Ling Zisheng,

551
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:46,129
I've always been like this.

552
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:48,008
I've always acted alone
and sought revenge.

553
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:49,728
Didn't you say

554
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,409
you love me for this?

555
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,248
Why are you behaving this way now?

556
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:55,088
Why must you make me change?

557
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:56,969
I'm Cheng Shaoshang

558
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:58,209
instead of a young lady

559
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:00,288
who's Ling Zisheng's fiancee!

560
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,528
I know.

561
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,768
You don't have to change.

562
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:25,169
(It's not like that.)

563
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:30,088
(I no longer hate the imperial palace)

564
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,248
(and I've also accepted you.)

565
00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:36,248
(But why can't you accept me
for who I am?)

566
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:57,568
Cheng Shaoshang,

567
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:00,088
to vent your anger,

568
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:01,248
look at what you did

569
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,689
to Yongle Palace.

570
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,048
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

571
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,728
I was willful

572
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,129
and only wanted to vent my anger.

573
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:12,969
But I forgot that my action
would ruin Yongle Palace.

574
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,048
I'll think of a way
to atone for my crime.

575
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:17,609
No need.

576
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:19,649
Consort Yue told me

577
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,369
that Zisheng had dispatched
the imperial bodyguards

578
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,488
to repair Yongle Palace.

579
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:24,449
He mustn't.

580
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:26,169
I did it.

581
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:27,449
So I'll take the responsibility myself.

582
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:28,528
Don't let Zisheng...

583
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,728
A couple is one body.

584
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:39,568
If you truly see Zisheng

585
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,568
as your future husband,

586
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,328
then His Majesty and I

587
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:46,768
are considered your parents-in-law.

588
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:50,649
When someone hurts and frames you,

589
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:53,849
you shouldn't hide it
and act on your will.

590
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:58,048
If you don't see His Majesty
and me as your elders

591
00:27:58,048 --> 00:28:00,849
and don't treat Zisheng
as your loved one,

592
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,328
we'll feel bitterly disappointed.

593
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:06,409
If only Your Majesty could tell me

594
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:11,169
all these earlier, it'd be better.

595
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:14,609
But I've already hurt
everyone's feelings.

596
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:17,369
It's useless to say anything now.

597
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:25,528
Shaoshang,

598
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:29,649
it's not too late

599
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:31,048
to learn

600
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:34,008
how to love Zisheng.

601
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:36,808
Your Majesty,

602
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,728
how do you plan to punish

603
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,649
those young ladies
who pushed Shaoshang into the lake?

604
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:43,449
Shaoshang may

605
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,528
have avenged herself.

606
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,008
But they behaved impudently

607
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,129
in the palace.

608
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:50,849
It shows they must be

609
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:55,088
arrogant and willful outside the palace.

610
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:57,409
Fifth Princess is fearless
because she has backups.

611
00:28:58,209 --> 00:29:01,008
It's because I'm careless in teaching
and spoiling her too much.

612
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,488
Those young ladies
who dare to bully you in the palace

613
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,808
must also lack discipline.

614
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:07,288
I'll have to investigate

615
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,609
their fathers and brothers.

616
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:12,369
Let's see if they also bully others
because of their power.

617
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:41,969
He can't see me.

618
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,449
He can't see me.

619
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:45,209
He can't see me.

620
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:47,369
He can't see me.

621
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:48,609
He can't see me.

622
00:29:48,768 --> 00:29:49,689
He can't see me.

623
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:50,768
He can't see me.

624
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:52,449
He can't see me.

625
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:53,088
He can't see me!

626
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,528
Ling Buyi, what are you trying to do?

627
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:55,689
This is the palace.

628
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:56,929
Are you going to strike a prince?

629
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,169
Besides,

630
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,169
I've told you everything this morning.

631
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:02,609
Cheng Shaoshang
and I didn't have a tryst.

632
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:07,248
Didn't you get to the bottom
of everything today?

633
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:08,528
I have no ulterior motives

634
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:10,328
toward your Cheng Shaoshang.

635
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:11,209
Even if I did,

636
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:12,568
I wouldn't even dare to think about it

637
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:14,048
with you like this.

638
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:16,209
What are you doing?

639
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:16,808
Don't hit me!

640
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:17,649
Fifth Prince,

641
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:20,449
do you know the young ladies

642
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,649
who pushed Shaoshang into the lake?

643
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:26,528
I do.

644
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:28,008
Of course, I know them.

645
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:30,609
Fifth Princess only has
those several playmates.

646
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:31,849
How could I not know them?

647
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:34,849
All right.

648
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:37,169
I'll need to trouble you

649
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:40,048
to leave the palace with me today.

650
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:44,849
Ling Buyi!

651
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,488
Are you mad?

652
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:48,808
Why are you tying me up?

653
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:50,609
I... When...

654
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:52,528
Have I ever offended you?

655
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,120
(Censorate)

656
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,409
You must not think

657
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,689
you can go against the law

658
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:58,129
just because you've made
some accomplishments.

659
00:30:58,129 --> 00:30:59,808
I won't let you go off the hook!

660
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:01,288
Just you wait!

661
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:05,369
Send for the physician!

662
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:07,248
It's hurting me!

663
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:08,929
Official Zuo, you feel wronged.

664
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:10,849
Why don't you ask your daughter

665
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:13,369
what she did?

666
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:16,409
I...

667
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:19,288
I only followed Fifth Princess's order

668
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:22,008
to bump Cheng Shaoshang.

669
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:23,568
Was it his daughter

670
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,169
who pushed your fiancee into the lake?

671
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:27,288
She didn't do only that.

672
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:30,449
She even released
venomous snakes into the lake

673
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,048
to bite my fiancee.

674
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:35,129
This is

675
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,849
just a joke among the young ladies.

676
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,849
Why did you have to cause trouble
at the Censorate

677
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,409
over a small matter like this?

678
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,048
Do... Do you even fear the law?

679
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,449
I'm only joking around with you

680
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:48,129
like men too.

681
00:31:48,488 --> 00:31:49,609
Official Zuo,

682
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:51,288
fight back.

683
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:52,728
Fight back?

684
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:56,768
How... How can I fight back?

685
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:59,048
I'm a civil official.

686
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:00,728
Ling Buyi,

687
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,248
don't think

688
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:03,849
His Majesty dotes on you

689
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,849
means you can do anything you want.

690
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:08,409
This is the Censorate

691
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:10,488
and I'm the Palace Aide
to the Censor-in-chief.

692
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:11,689
My duty is to submit memorials

693
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,169
admonishing the monarchs and officials.

694
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:14,409
If you harm me,

695
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:16,728
I'll impeach you

696
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:19,969
and request His Majesty

697
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:21,768
to punish you by law!

698
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:23,929
Punish by law?

699
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,209
Am I not punishing you by law now?

700
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:28,169
You...

701
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,728
No! No!

702
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:40,088
No!

703
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,008
Don't!

704
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:55,369
Stop beating me. Stop it.

705
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:03,449
Stop! Stop beating!

706
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,649
Official Yuan.

707
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,288
As the Attendant Gentleman
of the Ministry of Justice,

708
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,728
how can you just stand there and watch?

709
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,609
As the Attendant Gentleman
of the Ministry of Justice,

710
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,649
I'd naturally handle
this case indiscriminately.

711
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:16,929
Official Zuo, rest assured.

712
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:19,528
With a scroll and a brush,

713
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:20,849
every time he hits you,

714
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:22,209
I'll record it once.

715
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,689
If he hits you twice,

716
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:25,488
I'll record it twice too.

717
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:28,929
Are you going
to let him keep hitting me?

718
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,969
Yes.

719
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:31,409
Not only must he hit you,

720
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,008
but he must also hit you harder.

721
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:36,288
The harder he hits,
the more severe his crimes are.

722
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:37,609
Official Zuo,

723
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,008
please endure it for a while.

724
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:42,649
I'll record every crime he commits.

725
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,929
I'll definitely punish him severely
at the Ministry of Justice.

726
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:47,929
Thank you, Official Yuan.

727
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:49,808
Fei,

728
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:51,528
serve him some tea.

729
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:02,609
Serve me one too.

730
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,128
Rest assured.

731
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,729
I'll record everything clearly.

732
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:17,088
Stop beating me!

733
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:19,208
Stop! Stop it already!

734
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:22,048
My daughter wasn't the only one

735
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,648
who played tricks on Lady Cheng!

736
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:26,048
Ling Buyi,

737
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:28,769
why are you only beating me?

738
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,929
The other seven officials
had been punished.

739
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:33,008
Please rest assured.

740
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,729
Our Young Master is a fair person.

741
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:37,449
He'd never discriminate
against one and the other.

742
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,608
I want you to drag them

743
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:53,929
and parade them in the capital.

744
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:55,608
Today, I want

745
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:57,648
everyone in the capital to know

746
00:34:58,048 --> 00:34:59,729
if they don't discipline
their children properly,

747
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:02,048
this will be the consequence!

748
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,329
Official Yuan,

749
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,769
listen to me carefully.

750
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:09,249
This case is a serious matter.

751
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:11,048
It involves

752
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:13,648
all eight officials!

753
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:15,208
I've already recorded them.

754
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,048
Seven officials.

755
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:20,128
Too many to record.

756
00:35:22,048 --> 00:35:23,449
I've already investigated

757
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:26,929
that these seven officials
were involved in corruption.

758
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:30,809
I'll hand over the evidence
so they can be trialed.

759
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:32,528
Rest assured.

760
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:36,289
If I record one less offense,

761
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,528
I shall change my name
to Mr. Yuan Kind Heart.

762
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:51,329
But it was Fifth Princess
who ordered us to do it.

763
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:52,568
That's right!

764
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:55,608
Fifth Princess was the one
who instigated it.

765
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:58,449
Yet, you're only taking it out on us.

766
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,208
Ling Buyi,

767
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:02,769
you're a coward

768
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,369
who fears those with power!

769
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:16,608
Ling Buyi,

770
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:18,008
what do you want to do this time?

771
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,648
I'll take care of Fifth Princess myself.

772
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:32,488
You don't have to worry.

773
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:34,688
He broke my leg!

774
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,088
Ling Buyi!

775
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,488
I... I'll never let you go!

776
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:43,729
Is everything arranged
on Fifth Princess's side?

777
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,048
Yes, Young Master.

778
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:47,409
We'll let the whole capital
know about it

779
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:51,008
and completely shame Marquis Yue.

780
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,600
(Princess's Mansion)

781
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:18,168
Fifth Princess,

782
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,769
please go inside.

783
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:24,809
Why are you still here?

784
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,688
His Majesty told me

785
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:30,128
to watch you enter your mansion.

786
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:31,488
Please go inside.

787
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:36,488
Father and Mother
wouldn't ground me for a long time.

788
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,449
They were just trying to scare me
because they were upset.

789
00:37:41,168 --> 00:37:42,769
His Majesty told me

790
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:45,528
to make sure you return
to the Princess's Mansion.

791
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:48,048
It shows His Majesty's resolution.

792
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,969
What a joke.

793
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:53,168
What can a eunuch like you do to me?

794
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:57,409
I may be a eunuch.

795
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,008
But if I had His Majesty behind me,

796
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:04,128
I wouldn't feel weak

797
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:07,528
or feel that my body is incomplete.

798
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,608
I would do

799
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:11,929
what should be done well.

800
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:13,568
Fifth Princess,

801
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:15,168
please go inside.

802
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:47,809
Aides without virtues

803
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:50,809
instigated the princess's misconduct,

804
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,048
which is punishable by death!

805
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:56,449
His Majesty said,

806
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:59,809
"Fifth Princess belongs
to the royal family

807
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,329
and shouldn't behave willfully.

808
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,688
As the princess,

809
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,568
since you received an official salary
from the people,

810
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,528
you should set an example
of filial piety for the world.

811
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:17,208
Should you fail
to reflect upon your mistakes,

812
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:22,688
these aides won't be the only ones
who will die in the future."

813
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:29,648
I

814
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:32,088
shall obey!

815
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:49,208
Get out!

816
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,128
Marquis Yue, calm down.

817
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:52,449
It's me.

818
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:09,249
Why are you so upset?

819
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,608
Ling Buyi advised His Majesty

820
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:19,608
to execute Princess's Mansion's
kept men.

821
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:26,849
Kept men!

822
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,008
This dissolute girl of the Xuan clan

823
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:30,608
is the world's

824
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:32,688
biggest joke!

825
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:35,088
Look what happened now.

826
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:37,048
The whole world now knows

827
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,168
Fifth Princess has been keeping men.

828
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,088
It's a total disgrace

829
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:43,729
to our Yue clan!

830
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,369
My Lord, please calm down.

831
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:49,648
Those are aides, not kept men.

832
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:50,769
It's not like you said.

833
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:52,128
Oh, just keep quiet!

834
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:53,809
The Xuan clan obviously...

835
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:57,809
The Xuan clan obviously used that

836
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:00,048
to cover up for Fifth Princess.

837
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:01,289
How can you even believe that?

838
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,929
A young lady

839
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:10,929
who doesn't stay home to learn how
to be a virtuous wife and mother.

840
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:13,008
She insisted on having hangers-on

841
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:14,329
and raising kept men around her.

842
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:15,648
What does she mean by that?

843
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:17,648
If it's not for pursuing pleasure,

844
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,648
don't tell me

845
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:21,809
she wants to bring down the Crown Prince

846
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:23,969
and take over his seat?

847
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:25,409
Fifth Princess

848
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,769
was only upset with the Crown Prince

849
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:29,769
for being a disappointment.

850
00:41:30,128 --> 00:41:33,969
Being a disappointment is one thing.

851
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,648
If he really ascends the throne,

852
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,048
it'll bring disaster to the country
and the people.

853
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,249
I heard

854
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:49,769
Third Prince

855
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,929
has good conduct, is upright,
and outspoken.

856
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,849
Even His Majesty praises him endlessly.

857
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:59,048
Don't even bring up my nephew.

858
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:01,208
He's a complete fool!

859
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:03,409
About Madam Wen Xiu
minting coins without permission,

860
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:06,849
he had to expose Third Princess.

861
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:10,088
He said he wouldn't favor
his family over justice.

862
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:11,849
See how foolish he is?

863
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:17,008
Marquis Yue,

864
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:19,929
that's all the more reason

865
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,208
Third Prince is the true successor.

866
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:25,289
Most of the monarchs in this world

867
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:27,168
are upright people.

868
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,048
Marquis Yue,

869
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:30,929
there will be good news

870
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,088
in the future.

871
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:52,608
As long as the Crown Prince
is still in my way,

872
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:54,369
I won't be getting

873
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:58,769
any good news in my life.

874
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:21,528
I've already said

875
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:23,488
Fifth Sister is unreasonable.

876
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:25,008
She'd definitely cause a huge problem.

877
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:27,249
Look what happened?

878
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:29,289
She made Mother ill from anger.

879
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:31,369
Last night in the military camp,

880
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:33,208
His Highness was too distressed
to sleep.

881
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:35,249
Luckily, Zisheng advised Father

882
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:37,208
to execute Fifth Sister's aides.

883
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:40,249
Mother, you have no idea
how unpleasant the things people said.

884
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:42,329
I can't even bear to tell you about it.

885
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,568
They said

886
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:49,289
the aides had handsome faces
and strong physiques

887
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:51,128
that Fifth Princess favored them.

888
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:54,088
They would sing, play, and hunt often.

889
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:56,329
Those aristocratic families
with strict upbringing

890
00:43:56,488 --> 00:43:58,849
won't even allow their daughters
to visit the Princess's Mansion.

891
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:00,648
Why are you telling Mother all these?

892
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:02,648
Mother,

893
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:04,048
don't take it to heart.

894
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,729
Fifth Sister was only confused
for a moment there.

895
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,208
We can just advise her after this.

896
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,128
Your Highness didn't want Mother to know

897
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,849
because you considered
Mother's feelings.

898
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:29,969
But I think

899
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,969
she won't learn
if she's not punished severely.

900
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,488
Spoiling will make her worse.

901
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:35,568
Crown Princess, you should stop talking.

902
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:38,449
People advise to comfort others.

903
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:40,008
But your advice

904
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:41,929
makes people upset.

905
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:44,249
You're doing this
because Her Majesty is kind

906
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:45,648
and won't be angry with you.

907
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,369
Try treat Consort Yue this way.

908
00:44:52,688 --> 00:44:53,688
Your Majesty,

909
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,409
don't take these words to heart.

910
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,289
All of you should stop talking now.

911
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:10,568
I know Fifth Sister is domineering

912
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:12,088
and disrespects you.

913
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,048
But you shouldn't take advantage
and get revenge.

914
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:16,208
Do you know how children

915
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,809
should be considerate of their parents?

916
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:20,128
Just don't add fuel to the fire

917
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:21,849
when our parents are worried.

918
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:25,608
It was only a slip of the tongue.

919
00:45:26,048 --> 00:45:28,249
I didn't mean to make Mother sad.

920
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:32,208
You've misunderstood me.

921
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:34,849
Why would I have
such ill intentions toward Fifth Sister?

922
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,729
Whether you have an ill intention,

923
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,449
you know it very well.

924
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,208
If I wanted to revenge,

925
00:45:46,128 --> 00:45:48,648
the one I should take vengeance on
the most isn't Fifth Sister,

926
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,608
but Qu Lingjun
who caused my child's death.

927
00:45:56,969 --> 00:45:57,849
That year,

928
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,289
if she didn't stop entangling with you,

929
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:04,528
it wouldn't have affected my pregnancy

930
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:06,329
and I woundn't have lost my child.

931
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:08,969
All these years,

932
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:11,048
I can't sleep

933
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:13,208
whenever I think of this.

934
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:15,488
Why did you bring her up again?

935
00:46:15,568 --> 00:46:17,088
When did she provoke you?

936
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:19,208
She didn't provoke me.

937
00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:22,008
She only took a few glances
at you during the birthday banquet.

938
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:24,289
But these several glances

939
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:26,488
are enough to make you restless.

940
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:28,369
When did I feel restless?

941
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:33,289
She's already someone's wife.

942
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:35,289
I also treat her openly.

943
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:39,249
I'm fine with you behaving unreasonably.

944
00:46:39,528 --> 00:46:40,648
But why must...

945
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,208
Why must you ruin
an innocent person's image?

946
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:46,849
In your heart,

947
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:50,849
she's innocent and pure
like the clear moonlight

948
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:54,729
while I'm a jealous filthy mud.

949
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,409
If so,

950
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:02,369
you shouldn't have married me.

951
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:05,048
I know I'm a woman from the countryside

952
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:06,568
and not compatible with you.

953
00:47:07,648 --> 00:47:09,488
If you still like her,

954
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:11,849
you can summon her into the palace
and appoint her as Lady of Excellence.

955
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,608
Lest you think of her every day
to torture me.

956
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:16,249
You always say this.

957
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,849
No one ever dislikes you
because of your birth origin.

958
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:22,449
It's you who resent,
despise your background,

959
00:47:22,729 --> 00:47:24,048
and are always suspicious.

960
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:27,409
I don't want to waste time
on this meaningless argument

961
00:47:27,608 --> 00:47:29,329
nor will I marry Qu Lingjun.

962
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:31,809
During the birthday banquet,

963
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:33,168
I saw how her husband

964
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:34,849
treated her considerately.

965
00:47:35,128 --> 00:47:36,929
Both of them are affectionate
and harmonious.

966
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:39,608
You can just let it go.
