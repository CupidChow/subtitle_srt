=Episode 6=

3
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,209
Stop laughing!

4
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:50,249
I want you to come forward
and kneel here.

5
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:54,528
I only asked Lianfang

6
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,769
to carry the writing desk
Third Brother gave me.

7
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,569
How did it become snatching
Cheng Yang's writing desk?

8
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:01,048
Mother,

9
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:02,769
I did give a writing desk to Niaoniao.

10
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:04,368
It was the writing desk

11
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,169
with Qilin carvings
that Big Brother gave me.

12
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:07,809
You've seen it before.

13
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,008
It has Qilin carvings.

14
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:12,888
I've made a grave mistake.

15
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:15,448
I was too flustered to take notice.

16
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:17,689
If there are Qilin carvings,

17
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,528
it's no doubt it belonged
to Young Master.

18
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:23,368
But... But why is it at our place?

19
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:24,968
Could it be...

20
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,328
Could it be Lianfang carried
the writing desk

21
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,928
to flaunt it in front of our Young Lady?

22
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:33,129
I never did that.

23
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,569
I was deceived.

24
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,249
I can confront Changpu
about this matter.

25
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,569
Changpu hasn't awaken
since she fell unconscious.

26
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,528
We can splash her with water,
try to burn her,

27
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:45,008
or cut of two of her fingers!
We shall see if she remains unconscious!

28
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,089
What are you clamoring about?

29
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,368
Do you think I'll allow tortures
in this house?

30
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:05,689
Madam, we've brought Changpu.

31
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:14,089
You can stay unconscious
if you don't wake up now.

32
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:18,649
Madam.

33
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:19,928
Madam, have mercy on me.

34
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,689
Madam, I'm innocent.

35
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,089
Please show mercy on me.

36
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:24,928
Please spare me,

37
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:25,729
Madam.

38
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:27,209
I want both of you

39
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,328
to tell me exactly what happened today

40
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,968
without missing any details.

41
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,809
Whoever dares to lie will be punished.

42
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:35,729
Silence.

43
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,408
Lianfang,

44
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:43,928
Young Lady is waiting for us.

45
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:47,408
When did Young Lady say she wants
to custom make a writing desk?

46
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,809
Young Lady cherishes the writing desk
she currently uses,

47
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:50,888
which Second Master left for her.

48
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,249
How could she bear to change
to a new writing desk?

49
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:53,048
I'm warning you.

50
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:55,089
You better don't meddle in my business.

51
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,008
Why are you so clumsy?

52
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,249
Move the old one away.

53
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:02,169
Changpu,

54
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:03,209
didn't Young Lady follow

55
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,928
First Madam to the shop today?

56
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:09,848
I know that.

57
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,169
But it's all right.

58
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,729
We can wait for Young Lady
to return and look at it.

59
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:15,689
Fourth Lady may be waiting
for her writing desk.

60
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,689
How about we do it another day?
I'll follow the Young Lady...

61
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,089
Who are you to interrupt
when I'm talking?

62
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,249
Changpu, why did you hit Zhuyu?

63
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:25,448
Besides, Zhuyu was right.

64
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,008
Since Third Lady isn't here,

65
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:28,368
I'll carry this back.

66
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:29,928
Third Lady may come to our courtyard

67
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,368
if she wishes to see it.

68
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,209
Come on.

69
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:33,169
No need.

70
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:37,249
How about you go back

71
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:41,008
and leave the writing desk here for now?

72
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,968
We'll return it
after our Young Lady look at it.

73
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:46,209
How about that?

74
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:00,928
That means

75
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,328
it wasn't Niaoniao
who wanted to snatch Yangyang's things.

76
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,609
But it's the other way around.

77
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,048
What nonsense are you talking about?

78
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:09,008
Aunt Yuanyi,

79
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:13,928
I'm to blame.

80
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:15,729
I have no idea my maid servant

81
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:17,769
would behave so inappropriately.

82
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,249
I have no idea.

83
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:20,649
I shall apologize

84
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,408
to Niaoniao, Second Brother,
and Third Brother

85
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:24,649
right here.

86
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:32,488
Yangyang,

87
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,689
you were with me since this morning.

88
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:37,609
You're not involved in this matter.

89
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:40,048
Niaoniao has been studying
since this morning.

90
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,328
How is she involved in this matter?

91
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,729
The maid servants
on both sides are at fault.

92
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,569
Changpu,

93
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:55,368
Yangyang knows what to do

94
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,848
if she wants that writing desk.

95
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,609
It's not for you to decide.

96
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:01,169
Lianfang,

97
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,209
Niaoniao told you
to retrieve the writing desk.

98
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:07,169
Why did you have to go around
and make a display of it?

99
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,089
Both of you are the cause

100
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:10,848
of this conflict.

101
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,209
You must be severely punished.

102
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,368
Madam, you're right.

103
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,528
I'm to blame for not being strict.

104
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,888
I'll go back and teach her well.

105
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,729
Aunt Yuanyi, please forgive me.

106
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,328
I fail to educate my maid servant.

107
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,008
If you must blame her,
please put the blame on me.

108
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,209
This has nothing to do with you.

109
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,528
I know you're usually busy.

110
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,408
So it's normal to overlook this.

111
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:34,129
No need to take it to heart.

112
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:49,569
What's so funny?

113
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,089
I'm laughing at today's incident.

114
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:55,809
It's so amusing.

115
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:57,689
Lianfang,

116
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,408
do you know where you did wrong?

117
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:00,729
Yes.

118
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:03,368
I act according to my will.

119
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:05,368
This is what I like about you.

120
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,328
However, that depends

121
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:09,569
when you should act
according to your will.

122
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:10,848
Let's say

123
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:12,968
I asked you to buy bean paste
at the Eastern Market.

124
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,368
In this case, you can act according
to your will

125
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,048
in searching every street and every shop

126
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,649
to pick you think is
the best bean paste.

127
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,528
There are some things you can't act
according to your will.

128
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:24,008
You can't neither share
the bean paste I bought

129
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,249
with someone else,

130
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:26,528
nor can you decide

131
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:29,328
if I need bean paste.

132
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:32,729
Do you understand?

133
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:36,209
I've never punished you.

134
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,408
So I don't know how
to execute a punishment.

135
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,169
You can just so as Mother tells you.

136
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,249
Go back and get the place clean up.

137
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:44,689
I'll manage here.

138
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,209
Yes, Young Lady.

139
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:05,809
Come here.

140
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,649
Yes.

141
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:16,729
Changpu,

142
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:19,369
Lianfang didn't carry
the writing desk alone.

143
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:22,128
She brought
several servant girls with her.

144
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:24,609
You naturally can't stop them
by yourself.

145
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:25,689
So

146
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:27,609
you called your friends for help

147
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:28,928
to surround her.

148
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,769
So what did you say to
these friends of yours?

149
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:34,048
You said,

150
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:35,329
"Stop them.

151
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:36,529
Don't let her take the writing desk

152
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,048
Third Young Master gave
to Fourth Lady away."

153
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,168
Or

154
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:41,729
"This is our Young Lady's writing desk.

155
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,048
You're not allowed to take it away."

156
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:44,689
I was...

157
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:45,769
You can pretend to faint,

158
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:47,809
But your friends who surrounded

159
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,369
and beat up Lianfang

160
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,208
didn't pretend to faint.

161
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,529
Everything will be clear
after I question them one by one.

162
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:54,168
I shall see

163
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:56,529
if these people are truly clueless

164
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,449
and deceived by you.

165
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,569
Or should I say you deliberately did it

166
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,848
to set the family to go
against each other over a writing desk?

167
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,329
Stop being overbearing.

168
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:04,848
You can punish Lianfang.

169
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:05,809
As for Yangyang's maid servant,

170
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,449
Yangyang can decide what to do with her.

171
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:19,689
All right.

172
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:21,888
Mother shall make the decision.

173
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,128
We shall end it here.

174
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:26,809
The maid servants' mistakes

175
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:28,048
shall not involved the Young Ladies.

176
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,128
The writing desk is only
a trivial matter.

177
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:31,288
Anyone can have it.

178
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:32,449
Both of you

179
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,088
should live in harmony.

180
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,809
You shouldn't feel hostile
with each other.

181
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,609
Thank you Madam
for speaking up for Young Lady.

182
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:43,449
Fourth Lady has three brothers
to stand up for her.

183
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:46,168
It's pitiful
that Young Lady is powerless.

184
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:47,888
As her maid servants,

185
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,729
we're constantly concerned
that she'll be mistreated.

186
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:53,928
So we would always find ways
to make sure Young Lady has

187
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:56,288
whatever Fourth Lady has.

188
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:58,649
That's why we committed such a mistake.

189
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,048
Is Yangyang suffering
from any mistreatment?

190
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,529
What is it that you disapprove of?

191
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,128
The Cheng brothers
have always been dear to each other.

192
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,928
For decades,
they've been closed to each other

193
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,489
and treat each other equally.

194
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:12,609
Are you saying this

195
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,529
to sow discord in the Cheng family?

196
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:16,888
Who taught you that?

197
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:18,409
Was it the Ge family?

198
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:20,128
I dare not.

199
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,609
I don't mean it that way.

200
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:23,208
How dare you gossip
about the Master of the House's family?

201
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,248
Guards!

202
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:25,048
Enough!

203
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,449
Let the matter rest here.

204
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,088
(I was expecting Mother
to punish the governess.)

205
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:40,928
(Who knew you'd say this?)

206
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,449
(In this case,)

207
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,888
(one can only rely on themselves.)

208
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:48,769
Mother, do you feel
this old dame is right?

209
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:50,968
If she's right,

210
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:52,888
my brothers and I will be accused

211
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,248
of mistreating Cheng Yang.

212
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,409
Mother, think about this carefully.

213
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:58,168
If this old dame is wrong,

214
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:00,729
you must deal with her
and make things clear.

215
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:03,928
You dare to defy me?

216
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:07,449
Mother,

217
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:09,048
defiant is a great sin.

218
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,288
Mother,

219
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,409
you didn't punish the old dame

220
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:13,329
when she said such defiant words.

221
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,409
Why did you have to say such
a harsh thing to Shaoshang?

222
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,208
(If we don't make things clear today,)

223
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,888
(I'll forever be oppressed)

224
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:26,008
(and live timidly all my life.)

225
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,968
Do you know
why Mother never reprimands you?

226
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:32,088
Did you think

227
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,928
it was because of this foolish old dame
who thinks she's smart?

228
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,649
It's all to save Cheng Yang's face.

229
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,449
Every one says
my brothers are partial to me.

230
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:42,128
That's because the Madam of the House
is partial to Cheng Yang first.

231
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:43,649
Young Lady.

232
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:44,649
Mother said

233
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,449
the maid servants mistake
shouldn't be blamed on the Young Ladies.

234
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,449
That's the reason I can't accept.

235
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,928
But when Lianfang made a mistake,

236
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:53,809
why did you hold me up and reprimand me

237
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,489
like you were certain
I did something wrong

238
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,048
without asking what actually happened?

239
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,609
But why is Cheng Yang
completely innocent

240
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,529
when Changpu made a mistake?

241
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,208
Explain it.

242
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:07,769
Why do you think that happens?

243
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:09,369
It's because you also knew

244
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:10,888
Mother is partial to Cheng Yang.

245
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:11,968
So you don't have

246
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:13,369
to worry about your Young Lady at all.

247
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,248
As long as my mother is here,

248
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,689
no one in the Cheng residence would dare

249
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,409
to mistreat your Young Lady.

250
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:20,809
You're resenting me.

251
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,248
If you think what I say is too harsh
for you to hear,

252
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,848
I can tell some lies

253
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:26,769
and deceive you.

254
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:30,288
You defiant child.

255
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,088
Guards! Guards!

256
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:33,888
Mother!

257
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,329
Mother, calm down.

258
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,609
I'm to blame.

259
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,329
My thoughtlessness is
the root to this problem.

260
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:41,888
Niaoniao is still young
and no one taught her since young.

261
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:42,928
Please don't blame her.

262
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:44,288
If you must punish her,
please punish me.

263
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,168
Do you think I wouldn't dare
to punish you?

264
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:47,809
You were not fair in this matter.

265
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:49,529
If you sent out two writing desks,

266
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,689
this wouldn't have had happened.

267
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,769
Why is it Shaogong's fault now?

268
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,409
He didn't do anything wrong.

269
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,729
Why did he give me the writing desk?

270
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:01,409
It's because he can't stand seeing me
in a crude state.

271
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:02,609
I'm using a writing desk

272
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,168
for a young child.

273
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,809
He felt sorry for me
and took pity on me.

274
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,649
That's why he gave
his beloved writing desk to me.

275
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:08,569
He has never ordered

276
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:09,689
a custom made writing desk before

277
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,569
so he left Cheng Yang out.

278
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,569
What did he do so wrong?

279
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:14,288
Mother,

280
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,928
the words I recognized,
the books I read,

281
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:20,168
and counting with my fingers now

282
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,649
are what children learn in early stage.

283
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:24,769
I've studied what Cheng Yang studied.

284
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,689
You're there to teach her
what she hasn't studied.

285
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:27,968
Cheng Yang has her own writing desk.

286
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,489
But I never owned one.

287
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:30,968
Very well, then.

288
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:32,168
Let me ask you this.

289
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,529
Let's say you have a wheat bread

290
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:36,128
you can't possibly divide.

291
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:37,968
There are two people standing
in front of you.

292
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,329
One is famished

293
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,088
while the other is half full.

294
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:42,489
Who would you give the bread to?

295
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:46,489
Would you tell this
to one who's famished?

296
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:47,449
"Please bear with it for a little while.

297
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:48,769
When I have two wheat bread,

298
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,008
I'll give one to each of you."

299
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,168
You may find it fair.

300
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:56,809
But is it fair

301
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,529
or is it in the name of fairness?

302
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,248
This is the reality of being partial.

303
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,569
If you want to punish Niaoniao,

304
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:18,288
punish me too.

305
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:21,848
Me too.

306
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:24,848
I'm willing to be punished too.

307
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:27,329
Me too.

308
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:40,649
Sister-in-law,

309
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:42,888
I seem to have stomach ache again.

310
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:44,968
Do you still have the medicinal pill
from the other day?

311
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:48,208
Please get two for me quickly.

312
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,288
Hurry.

313
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,529
Sister-in-law,
that was a mighty presence.

314
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,008
I was scared.

315
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:29,769
Your stomach no longer hurts?

316
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:33,449
Me? Mighty?

317
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:36,128
Did you see

318
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:37,409
how that defiant child talk back at me?

319
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,809
She's the mighty one.

320
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:39,729
You deserved it.

321
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,168
You made the mistake first.

322
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,489
Niaoniao was obviously
the one suffering from injustice.

323
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:44,848
Yet, you refused to stand up for her.

324
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,689
If you can't justify yourself,

325
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,248
how can you display
your mighty presence as a mother?

326
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,649
You deserve to be pushed to this point.

327
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,569
Just look at
those carefree defiant children.

328
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,168
Can't they compromise?

329
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,409
They didn't have
to justify every single word.

330
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,848
Do they think I can't see through

331
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,288
that old dame and maid servant's tricks?

332
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,409
I was planning to punish them in secret.

333
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,208
Why did they have to expose me
in front of everyone?

334
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,529
How is Yangyang going
to face every one now?

335
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,809
Forget about Yangyang already.

336
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,449
I don't like hearing it.

337
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,409
It's common to have favorites.

338
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:19,128
But you're too much.

339
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,409
Even I can't stand it anymore.

340
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,048
Just now,

341
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,968
you even uttered

342
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:28,048
the great sin of defiance.

343
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,088
If you pushed Niaoniao to her death,

344
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,489
how are you going
to answer Brother-in-law?

345
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:34,848
She rebuked everything I said

346
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:36,769
in a unyielding manner.

347
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,409
I was livid.

348
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,409
It's a headache.

349
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:41,489
I never thought

350
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,649
Niaoniao would be this brave.

351
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:47,369
You wanted to use your authority
as an elder to subdue her.

352
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,569
But she wasn't afraid at all.

353
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:51,208
So have you thought

354
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:53,088
of what you should answer
Brother-in-law?

355
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:57,329
I would naturally speak to my husband.

356
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,809
I know I didn't take care
of this the right way.

357
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:01,088
I can't keep it a secret.

358
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:03,968
But how should I solve

359
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,048
today's problem?

360
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,489
Stay here.

361
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:10,769
I'll go

362
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,489
and tell those brats

363
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:13,968
you fainted from anger.

364
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,409
Then I'll have the children to come
and apologize to you.

365
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,689
You can brush it off

366
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,208
and the matter will be solved.

367
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,008
I can't solve this problem carelessly.

368
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,288
Family matters are not court politics.

369
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,168
We don't have any documents
to point things out clearly.

370
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:30,168
I only seek fairness.

371
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,968
I know you're the most just person.

372
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,609
But there are people in the world

373
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:39,008
who wanted to show their selflessness.

374
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,609
They tend to be generous
to people around them.

375
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,008
But harsh on their flesh and blood.

376
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:44,569
Don't you think

377
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:46,288
that's funny?

378
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,088
Niaoniao,

379
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,128
I'm so sorry

380
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:14,449
that you have to suffer.

381
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,449
Song and Shaogong too.

382
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,809
I'm sorry.

383
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,048
Cheng Yang,

384
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:24,769
you didn't know about this.

385
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:26,769
I don't blame you for it.

386
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,168
But the world

387
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,649
itself is not fair.

388
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,128
Your birth mother isn't with you.

389
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,809
Yet, you have a mother figure
around you.

390
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:41,208
While I have my mother with me.

391
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:44,769
Yet, I feel I'm without a mother.

392
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,649
Stop kneeling and get up.

393
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:53,928
Niaoniao,

394
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,489
tell me if you need anything
in the future.

395
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,288
I'll do my best to prepare them for you.

396
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,088
I want...

397
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,208
I want to go to the Lantern Festival.

398
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,769
Mother didn't allow me
to go before this.

399
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:15,968
All right.

400
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:18,329
I shall let you go.

401
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,088
Really?

402
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,529
Cheng Yang can come along.

403
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,529
Yes, Cheng Yang will come with us.

404
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:29,848
I won't be punished this way.

405
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,720
(Ruyang)

406
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,369
This is a huge lantern.

407
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:37,449
Mother, look.

408
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:38,888
They're doing
a fire twirling performance.

409
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:41,729
Cheng Yang, look.

410
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,208
Mother,

411
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,088
let's go for a stroll.

412
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,329
Sure.

413
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:47,848
Zhi, let's go.

414
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,048
Let's take a walk over there.

415
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:50,928
Incredible.

416
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:00,569
Cheng Yang, come.

417
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:07,888
It's a top quality Sichuan brocade.

418
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,609
Only someone of Niaoniao's appearance

419
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:11,168
can wear this.

420
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:12,888
Sister-in-law,

421
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,008
you're only giving to Niaoniao
and not Yangyang.

422
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,769
You're being partial to Niaoniao.

423
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,329
My mother received this
as a gift on her birthday.

424
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:20,848
There's only one.

425
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:22,449
I don't have anymore to give.

426
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,649
Yangyang.

427
00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:36,689
Yes, Aunt.

428
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:38,609
You were at the Ge residence
before this.

429
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,048
Is this your first time
to the Lantern Festival in the capital?

430
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:42,329
Yes.

431
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:43,288
I'll

432
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:44,928
show you around.

433
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:46,928
It looks lively ahead.

434
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:48,569
Let's go.

435
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,689
Let's go and take a look over there.

436
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:56,689
Niaoniao,

437
00:22:57,088 --> 00:22:58,489
I'll show you the lanterns.

438
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,288
Yes, Niaoniao. Let's go!

439
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,609
I'll go with you too.

440
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,008
Then I'll keep Mother-in-law
and Third Uncle company.

441
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,569
Don't get lost.

442
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:09,609
Son,

443
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,128
let's go. Come on.

444
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:13,649
I want to watch the balancing jar act.
Come on.

445
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:14,569
Shunhua.

446
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:33,729
Marvelous!

447
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:01,128
Young Master,

448
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:02,449
I've already made the arrangement.

449
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:03,649
We'll make our move

450
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,689
when someone carries

451
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:06,769
a lantern similar
to Xu Jinzhong's lantern.

452
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:12,168
Isn't that Colonel Cheng?

453
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:14,409
He and his family are enjoying
the Lantern Festival too.

454
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,769
The Fourth Lady Cheng's dress looks

455
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,208
very eye-catching today.

456
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,288
You can recognized her
from such a far distance?

457
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:22,928
The scout who monitored
the Cheng family said,

458
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,329
Third Lady Cheng has an elegant manner.

459
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:27,809
The one who's skipping about

460
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,369
would no doubt be Fourth Lady Cheng.

461
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:25,489
Niaoniao, do you like it?

462
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:26,848
If you like it,

463
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:28,168
I'll buy them all for you.

464
00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:31,689
You don't have to buy it.
I can make them myself.

465
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,449
I knew you're a smart girl.

466
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:37,769
Zhi, look at this.

467
00:25:39,449 --> 00:25:40,609
It's the latest style.

468
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:41,888
Which one looks nice?

469
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:42,888
This one.

470
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:44,008
Son.

471
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:48,809
What's the matter, Mother?

472
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:57,409
Let me see.

473
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:04,968
Is it beautiful?

474
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:05,729
Yes.

475
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,008
Mother,

476
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:08,369
the hair pin looks beautiful.

477
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:09,769
Is that so?

478
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:11,489
Yes, it's pretty.

479
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,248
Beautiful.

480
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:15,369
Which of these two pearl hair pin

481
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:16,968
do you like?

482
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:19,409
Can you pick one for me?

483
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:25,449
The elegant one fits you.

484
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:26,689
All right.

485
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:28,848
I'll take this one.

486
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,720
(Tian's Restaurant)

487
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:56,489
Why is
Tian's Restaurant selling lanterns?

488
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:57,968
How much is one lantern?

489
00:26:58,809 --> 00:26:59,569
Young Lady,

490
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,529
it must be your first time
at the Lantern Festival.

491
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:03,529
These lanterns are not for sale.

492
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,609
If you want a lantern,

493
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:07,088
you need to solve the riddle on it.

494
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:08,529
Thank you.

495
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,888
Guessing lantern riddles.

496
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:29,409
What's the meaning behind it?

497
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,569
If you can't solve it, you admit
that you're not knowledgeable.

498
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,080
(He Zhaojun)
It'll be amusing for people

499
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,880
who are knowledgeable

500
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,769
to solve it.

501
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:36,809
Move aside.

502
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,008
You didn't have to push.

503
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,048
Tell me which one you want.

504
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,248
I'll get it for you.

505
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:50,529
I want the lantern on the top right.

506
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:51,569
Win it for me.

507
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,560
(Lou Yao)

508
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:59,008
I don't know how to solve the riddle.

509
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:00,848
Pick another one.

510
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:02,449
If you don't win this lantern for me,

511
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:03,769
I can ask someone else to win it for me.

512
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:08,769
Mr. Yuan,
do you have the answer to the riddle?

513
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:10,769
Mr. Yuan?

514
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,888
Mr. Yuan Shanjian here is
from Mount Bailu.

515
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:16,649
Mr. Yuan always places first
in the Lantern Festival every year.

516
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:19,848
How does Mr. Yuan look like?

517
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:21,008
He's naturally good-looking.

518
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:22,729
Here he comes.

519
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:25,409
The ladies can finally see
Mr. Yuan in person.

520
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:28,729
I can't wait to see Mr. Yuan.

521
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:29,809
The first one on the left.

522
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,248
It looks like the character "king"

523
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:34,888
vertically and horizontally.

524
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:36,529
People will collapse

525
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:37,769
without it.

526
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:39,168
Guess a word.

527
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:40,529
A word?

528
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:41,809
What word?

529
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:48,569
How boring.

530
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:51,649
Isn't it "paddy field?"

531
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:53,968
Mr. Yuan, how impressive.

532
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:55,208
You got the correct answer right away.

533
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,168
Win!

534
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:58,409
The second lantern from the left.

535
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:00,848
"Coming from the east,
dancing and traveling.

536
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:03,048
They don't enter through the door,
but go beyond the walls.

537
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:05,529
They play games in the courtyards
and enter the palace hall.

538
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:08,048
Clapping them
while the dead let them be.

539
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:10,409
Fight to the death
but master is unharmed."

540
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,329
Guess a thing.

541
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:14,128
I truly hate this thing.

542
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:15,609
It's the mosquito.

543
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:16,928
Win!

544
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,248
Let's take a look at the third lantern
from the left.

545
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,128
The third lantern from the left.

546
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,769
One thousand people borrowed money
at an interest rate of 30.

547
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:27,769
How much is the return
after payment is made in nine days?

548
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,609
Mr. Yuan, please give us your answer.

549
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,968
Six Qian, seventy li, and five hao.

550
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,489
Six Qian, seventy li, and five hao.

551
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:39,088
Win!

552
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,369
The first lantern from the right.

553
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:46,449
"Glory of jade and essence of stone.

554
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:47,848
Bright as the sun and the moon
and dark as the falling star."

555
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:50,409
The guessing lantern riddles is
pretty interesting.

556
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:52,329
Guess a thing.

557
00:29:53,128 --> 00:29:55,369
The twins sat across each other

558
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,288
wearing the same garments.

559
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:58,369
It's a pity

560
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:00,848
that one speaks, the other is mute.

561
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:02,288
Why is that?

562
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:04,128
It can only happen
when looking into a bronze mirror.

563
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:06,729
Win!

564
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,409
He answered correctly.

565
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:10,288
The second from the right.

566
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:12,409
There's a painting
of spring season on the lantern.

567
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:14,449
"The bird's shadow in the grass."
Guess a word.

568
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:15,809
That's the one I wanted.

569
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,888
Come on, think of something.

570
00:30:18,928 --> 00:30:20,968
"The bird's shadow in the grass."

571
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:22,409
What a painting of the spring.

572
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:25,048
There's no beginning and no end.

573
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,769
A fish without a backbone.

574
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:28,288
Can you solve this riddle?

575
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:29,888
It's the word "day."

576
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,649
Mr. Yuan, you win again.

577
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:33,928
It's your fault.

578
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:35,208
If you managed to solve the riddle,

579
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:36,609
my lantern wouldn't be taken away.

580
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,128
Who is this Mr. Yuan? He's amazing.

581
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:41,569
(Of course, he is.)

582
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,088
(He studied under Mr. Huangfu
at Bailu Academy.)

583
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:45,329
(Three years ago,)

584
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,128
(the royal court summoned great scholars
for a scripture debate.)

585
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,048
(Yuan Shen)
(Mr. Yuan who was 18 years old)

586
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:51,569
(became famous in the capital
for debating on his teacher's behalf.)

587
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:54,569
Don't tell me you never heard
of him before.

588
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,208
It's my first at the Lantern Festival.

589
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,569
It's only natural
I never heard of him.

590
00:30:58,008 --> 00:30:59,609
It turns out she lacks knowledge.

591
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:00,409
That's right.

592
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:02,888
No wonder there's no riddle
at the Lantern Festival

593
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:05,088
that can't be solved
by Mr. Yuan every year.

594
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,928
Imagine him coming to solve the riddles

595
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,369
at the Lantern Festival every year,

596
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,329
how bored he must be.

597
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,048
Lou Yao,

598
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,689
you studied at the Bailu Academy

599
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:16,729
for some time.

600
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:18,729
How can you so far behind
to Mr. Shanjian?

601
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:23,529
What are you looking at?

602
00:31:27,848 --> 00:31:29,409
Senior Yuan is a matchless talent.

603
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:32,409
I'm a mediocre.
So I naturally can't outrank him.

604
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:33,409
Putting me aside,

605
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,489
how many people
in the world can beat him?

606
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:38,489
Do you how much I despise

607
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:41,168
when you grow on people's ambition
and degrading your own?

608
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:45,649
I suppose Yuan Shanjian likes

609
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:47,689
to be in the public eye.

610
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:56,449
Should we deliver these lanterns back
to your residence?

611
00:31:57,168 --> 00:31:58,048
No need.

612
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:00,769
Just hang them anywhere

613
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,128
to make the hall brighter.

614
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:04,048
(Yuan Shanjian,)

615
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:06,489
(you're not kind enough for doing this.)

616
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:07,968
(We studied at the same academy.)

617
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,048
(It was hard to come up)

618
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,609
(with these riddles.)

619
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:11,609
(Look what you did.)

620
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:13,168
(You solved everything in one go.)

621
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:16,369
(Don't tell me it's
because the hall isn't bright enough.)

622
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,769
Do you have a problem with that?

623
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:22,208
(You could at least leave
some lanterns for others.)

624
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:23,288
(Now,)

625
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:24,449
(we're out of lanterns.)

626
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:25,609
(What riddles do you expect them
to solve now?)

627
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:26,649
(That's right.)

628
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:28,449
In that case,

629
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:31,529
why don't I come up
with a riddle for them?

630
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:34,888
Pray tell, Mr. Tian.

631
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:37,809
How deep is the well downstairs?

632
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,489
Since the lantern riddles
had been solved,

633
00:32:41,848 --> 00:32:43,168
the Lantern Festival
would come to an end.

634
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:44,168
How boring.

635
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:45,409
May I have your attention, please!

636
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:46,888
Everyone!

637
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,729
I'm the manager
of the Tian's Restaurant.

638
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:51,248
Mr. Yuan said

639
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,208
he won so many lanterns just now

640
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,369
and spoiled the festive mood.

641
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,409
So

642
00:32:56,569 --> 00:32:59,529
he'll especially prepare
a new lantern riddle for everyone.

643
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:00,449
So

644
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,769
our restaurant will add something
to make it more festive.

645
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,248
Anyone who can answer the riddle,

646
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:06,320
our restaurant

647
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,848
(Tian Shuo)
will give away a jar of Qianlizui

648
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:09,489
as a reward.

649
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,409
Yes!

650
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:12,529
Qianlizui.

651
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:13,928
(Yuan Shanjian.)

652
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:16,729
I wonder what will
Yuan Shanjian come up with.

653
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:17,649
Will it be a clause

654
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:19,048
or a rhapsody?

655
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,569
Senior Yuan will definitely come up
with an original riddle.

656
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:23,689
How can we even guess?

657
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,248
Can't you be more ambitious?

658
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:30,208
There is a well beside my restaurant.

659
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:33,529
Its diameter is two and a half feet,
but I don't know its depth.

660
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:35,569
Mr. Yuan's question is,

661
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:37,609
"What is the distance from the wellhead

662
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,288
to the water surface?"

663
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,008
To know how deep the well is,

664
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:43,329
you'll find out after you measure it.

665
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:44,369
That's right.

666
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:47,689
I have a-three foot ruler with me.

667
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,609
Young Lady, would you like to measure?

668
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:55,008
How can I measure
with such a short ruler?

669
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:56,848
No one can guess
the answer with that.

670
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:01,809
Let me try.

671
00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:04,369
If you can't answer it,

672
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:06,409
you'll have to admit
that you lack of knowledge.

673
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:07,489
There are bound
to be knowledgeable people

674
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:08,848
who find this interesting to answer.

675
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:11,609
Make way.

676
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,248
You...

677
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,529
She's only making it look mysterious.

678
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,529
She looks like a fool.

679
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:17,968
That's funny.

680
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:23,489
I asked you to measure the depth.

681
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,288
What's with all the gestures?

682
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:36,329
I have the answer.

683
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:41,689
The diameter is two and a half feet.

684
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:43,729
I put the three-foot ruler
on the well vertically.

685
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:45,329
It's one foot in diameter looking down

686
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,449
from this ruler to the bank.

687
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:47,529
So

688
00:35:47,848 --> 00:35:49,689
the distance between the wellhead
and the water surface is

689
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,769
four and the half feet.

690
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:52,529
Can you find someone
to verify the answer?

691
00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:59,409
This Young Lady answered correctly.

692
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,489
Not an inch less or more.

693
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:06,329
I'm impressed.

694
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:12,329
Young Lady, you're indeed impressive.

695
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:13,649
In that case,

696
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:15,529
can I have the Qianlizui?

697
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,769
Since you've answered
the riddle correctly,

698
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:19,489
of course you can have the Qianlizui.

699
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:21,848
Wait right here, I'll get it for you.

700
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:23,848
Thank you.

701
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,720
(Tian's Restaurant)

702
00:36:57,769 --> 00:36:58,729
I found

703
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:00,609
the person carrying a similar lantern
to Xu Jinzhong.

704
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:01,928
Can you guess who's that?

705
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:04,529
Prince Xiao.

706
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:08,168
How did you know it was him?

707
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,569
Xu Jinzhong is merely a blacksmith.

708
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:12,689
Yet,he became wealthy for no reason.

709
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:14,048
Even our men couldn't find out

710
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:16,048
how he managed to get elevated.

711
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:17,288
It must be

712
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:19,729
because someone covered up his past.

713
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:21,288
He's from Feng Yi County.

714
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:22,809
For someone

715
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:24,489
who can erase his past completely

716
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,088
must be someone influential

717
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:29,329
in Feng Yi County.

718
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:32,489
And Prince Yong is the only person

719
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,288
from Feng Yi Country
who rendered great merits.

720
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:38,369
But Prince Yong is not
in the capital now.

721
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:40,609
Only his son,

722
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:42,848
Prince Xiao is

723
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:44,888
in the capital.

724
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,820
(Prince Xiao)

725
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:52,409
Miss, be careful.

726
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:54,609
It'll be a pity

727
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:56,008
if you're scarred.

728
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:02,649
Thank you, Mister.

729
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:17,000
(Tian's Restaurant)

730
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:23,809
These were just my deductions.

731
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:25,848
But now I've seen him.

732
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:28,208
Everything is confirmed now.

733
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:30,848
Young Master, you managed
to make the right deduction.

734
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:33,569
We hid the news
that Xu Jinzhong committed suicide.

735
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:35,288
Then when the mastermind couldn't keep
in touch with him

736
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:37,048
and anxious in selling the armaments,

737
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:39,208
he would contact the buyer in person.

738
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:42,369
So we only need to keep an eye
on Prince Xiao.

739
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:45,848
to know who's the mastermind.

740
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:48,569
Prince Xiao has gone
inside Tian's Restaurant.

741
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,409
Let's go.

742
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:54,208
Yes.

743
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,489
General Ling! General Ling.

744
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,409
Please

745
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,208
save Princess Yuchang.

746
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:22,128
She has fallen into the water.

747
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:24,449
Move aside.

748
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:26,689
General Ling,
are you going to do nothing?

749
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:27,888
Even if you want to draw a line

750
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:29,369
with Her Highness,

751
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:29,968
but Her Highness is still

752
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,928
Prince Ruyang's only daughter.

753
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:33,769
If you don't save her,

754
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,729
Prince Ruyang will be lonely
in his old age.

755
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:38,048
If His Majesty hears of this,
he'll blame you for it.

756
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:45,569
After him.

757
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:31,689
Young Lady,

758
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:42,168
forgive me.

759
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:43,689
This embroidered ball...

760
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:45,208
Help!

761
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,369
Someone fell into the water!
Help! Hurry!

762
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:50,968
Take it back!

763
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:02,288
Who would have thought

764
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,609
the embroidered ball Yuan Shanjian
threw out for the first time

765
00:41:04,689 --> 00:41:06,008
would be returned?

766
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:10,449
It looks like
she's no average young lady.

767
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:24,888
Save Her Highness!

768
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:29,288
Help!

769
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:32,689
Help me! Ling Buyi!

770
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:35,208
Ling Buyi!

771
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:38,168
Ling Buyi. Help!

772
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:40,449
Hold on, Your Highness.

773
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:41,809
Ling Buyi.

774
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:42,569
General Ling,

775
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:43,649
please save Her Highness

776
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:45,449
under the eyes of the public.

777
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:50,609
Help!

778
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:53,369
Your Highness!

779
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:54,809
Hold on!

780
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:56,928
What should we do now?

781
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,888
Go and save her quickly.

782
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:01,888
Help!

783
00:42:03,128 --> 00:42:04,769
I can see mud in the water.

784
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:08,048
This water isn't deep.

785
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:16,928
Let me see.

786
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,088
What are you looking at? Get lost!

787
00:42:27,529 --> 00:42:29,329
Stop laughing at the princess.

788
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:30,649
Get lost.

789
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:37,008
Who? Who pushed me?

790
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:39,008
Who pushed me?

791
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,489
I was worried all day.

792
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:42,529
It was all for nothing.

793
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,128
Ling Buyi.

794
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,449
(Something bad had happened!)

795
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,848
(A fire broke out!)

796
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,888
(The lanterns at the Tian's Restaurant
are on fire!)

797
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:02,329
Tian's Restaurant?

798
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:04,168
My Qianlizui.

799
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:05,888
My wine!

800
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:07,928
Make way.

801
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:10,848
(This is bad. It's burning down.)

802
00:43:17,968 --> 00:43:18,809
Hurry! Hurry up!

803
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:21,208
Get the water and put out the fire!

804
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:22,689
Put out the fire!

805
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:25,489
A fire broke out.

806
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:27,329
Hurry!

807
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:29,729
Move it!

00:44:02,288 --> 00:44:03,128

Stay here.

Father.

819
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:31,248
Where were you?

820
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:32,729
I've been looking everywhere for you.

821
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,168
I heard you calling me just now.

822
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:35,489
I was looking for you too.

823
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:50,689
Are you all right?

824
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:53,208
I'm glad you're all right.

825
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:54,609
As long as you're all right.
