Cheng Shaoshang!

4
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:58,753
Lou Li,

5
00:01:58,753 --> 00:01:59,792
are you crazy?

6
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:01,152
Cheng Shaoshang,

7
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:02,872
you forced Lou Ben to suicide

8
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:04,553
and ruined my family.

9
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:06,473
I'm going to take your life today!

10
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,153
If you are willing to drink
that bowl of buttermilk,

11
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,392
that's an easy way to die.

12
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:14,272
But too bad.

13
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:15,073
Lou Li,

14
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:16,473
who is the mastermind behind it?

15
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:17,753
Who is the empty seat for?

16
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:19,153
There are a lot of people
who want you dead.

17
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:20,232
Why don't you ask Lou Ben

18
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:21,753
when you are in
the underworld?

19
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:30,633
Shaoshang.

20
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:34,033
Go! Quick!

21
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,033
Leave me alone!

22
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,272
Hurry up and leave!

23
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,712
Hurry up and leave!

24
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:38,992
Be careful!

28
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:49,633
He Zhaojun, take a look at the shrine.

29
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:51,313
Check if it's rigged.

30
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:52,232
Hurry up!

31
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,033
Quick!

32
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:03,153
Quick!

33
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:10,672
Shaoshang.

34
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,153
Hurry up.

35
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,232
Shaoshang, hurry!

36
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:20,473
Stop chasing.

37
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,272
Since she's in the secret chamber,

38
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:28,633
she's dead for sure.

39
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:37,712
Thank you so much.

40
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,073
For luring Cheng Shaoshang here.

41
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:52,433
Are you okay?

42
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:53,313
I'm fine.

43
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:54,193
Shaoshang.

44
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:11,712
Yuan Shanjian.

45
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,433
Why are you here?

46
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:17,032
I should be asking the question.

47
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:19,912
I'm assisting Crown Prince

48
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:22,553
to implementing the Land Distribution Order.

49
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,553
I found that someone purchased
a lot of kerosene

50
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,472
and hoarded them along the road
that Crown Prince will pass by,

51
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:30,073
the Guo Village.

52
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:33,832
I wanted to inform
Crown Prince about this.

53
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:36,352
But...

54
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,313
But I got caught

55
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,753
and they kidnapped me.

56
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:44,952
Shaoshang,

57
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:47,233
hurry up and find a way to escape.

58
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,912
We have to hurry up and inform them.

59
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,433
This chain lock is the most difficult.

60
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:57,512
You can't solve it.

61
00:04:58,952 --> 00:04:59,832
Hurry up and leave.

62
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:01,952
Don't give up your chance of living

63
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:03,553
for me.

64
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,472
In this world,

65
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:08,753
there's no lock that I, Cheng Shaoshang,
couldn't solve.

66
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,993
As long as you keep your mouth shut.

67
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,433
Since you've done all this,

68
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,712
you're useless to me now.

69
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:18,392
Lou Li,

70
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,553
I do hate Huo Buyi and Cheng Shaoshang,

71
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:25,392
but I hate your family even more.

72
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,592
I'll send you to reunite

73
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,272
with your parents now.

74
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:39,832
My...

75
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:43,673
My parents...

76
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:49,352
You killed my parents.

77
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,392
You.

78
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:54,032
You.

(Learn From The Great Man)

80
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:34,472
Be careful!

81
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:43,793
Get your weapon ready.

82
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:56,712
Young Master!

83
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:02,393
It seems like they are not going to stop

84
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,752
until I'm left alone.

85
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:07,793
They are making such a big deal.

86
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:09,433
Who are they?

87
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,553
It doesn't matter who they are.

88
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:16,153
What matters is

89
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:19,433
who is in the trap.

90
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:21,632
Kill them!

91
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:49,513
Be careful.

92
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:54,913
Go!

93
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:58,273
Get up.

94
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:10,952
What happened?

95
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,073
Hurry up.

96
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:13,832
Shaoshang, just leave us.

97
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:14,913
The door is closing.

98
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:16,033
Leave.

99
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:19,553
We are leaving together.

100
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,352
Shaoshang.

101
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:41,073
Are you okay?

102
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:42,592
It's you.

103
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:43,832
Why are you here?

104
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,232
I found out something was wrong
in Hua County

105
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:46,393
so I rushed here.

106
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,472
I guess the remnants of
Emperor Li are trying to

107
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:49,153
separate me from Black Armored Guard.

108
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:51,393
They tried so hard to lure me here.

109
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:53,712
The person in the trap
must be very important to me.

110
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,313
And the most important person to me

111
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:57,832
is you.

112
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:02,553
Are you dumb?

113
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,553
Why would you jump into a trap?

114
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:06,592
You should have asked for help first

115
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:08,313
and then thought of ways to avenge me.

116
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:09,472
If you aren't here with me,

117
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:11,513
what's the point of my revenge?

118
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:14,992
You staying alive

119
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,472
is the most important thing.

120
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,393
How could you be so dumb?

121
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:29,793
When you've done enough dumb things,

122
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:32,513
you wouldn't feel that dumb.

123
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:40,793
Shaoshang.

124
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,832
General Huo, that's very touching.

125
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,193
I was afraid
you wouldn't fall for it so easily.

126
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:53,632
Now it seems like,

127
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,112
when you are deeply in love,

128
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,992
even a hero will become stupid.

129
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:04,433
Wang Yanji,

130
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:06,913
stop acting all mysterious.

131
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:08,712
What do you want?

132
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:16,872
Hello guys,

133
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,433
it'd been a long time.

134
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:22,553
You are alive.

135
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:25,513
Well, of course, I wouldn't want to die

136
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:27,073
unless I've captured you.

137
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:30,433
I've been waiting for this day

138
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,033
for so long.

139
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,393
Do you go all out

140
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:37,992
just for this moment?

141
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:39,073
Yes.

142
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,033
Today, you are going to die

143
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:44,112
in this grave

144
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,352
that I've prepared for you.

145
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:01,352
Is she...

146
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:04,193
Is she going to die with us?

147
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:05,232
Yes.

148
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:07,592
From the moment I was rescued

149
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:09,112
when I jumped into that river,

150
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,472
I wanted to seek revenge.

151
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:17,513
The day is finally here.

152
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:22,433
Wang Yanji.

153
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,232
I understand if you want to
seek revenge on me.

154
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:27,153
But Shaoshang, it's because she
wanted to look for her father.

155
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:28,752
As for Yuan Shen,
he's carrying out his duty.

156
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,153
Why do you involve the innocents?

157
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:33,273
Innocent?

158
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:37,232
My husband is unappreciated,

159
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:38,793
and the world is unfair.

160
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,513
No one in this world is innocent,

161
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,352
except for him.

162
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:52,592
Cheng Shaoshang,

163
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:55,112
I think I've treated you well.

164
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,913
I protected you several times
in the Lou Family.

165
00:15:58,393 --> 00:16:00,752
But you caused the death of the person
that I cared about the most.

166
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:04,553
And you, Yuan Shen.

167
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,193
Blame it on the fact
that you know too many things.

168
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,273
Tried to ruin my plan?

169
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,313
Then you shall be dead.

170
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,793
Lou Ben deceived and
humiliated the Emperor.

171
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:17,632
He deserved it!

172
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,472
No matter whether my husband
is a loyal official, a great general,

173
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,153
or a rebel,

174
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,393
I don't care if he's in heaven

175
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,273
or the underworld,

176
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,673
still, he is my favorite person!

177
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:35,112
I don't care if you have great power

178
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,112
or you have reasons,

179
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,952
I'll come at you one by one.

180
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:42,752
I know you hate me,

181
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:44,393
Huo Buyi,

182
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:45,592
and the Lou Family,

183
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,232
I get it.

184
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,433
But what does it have to do
with He Zhaojun?

185
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:51,352
Why did you hurt her?

186
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:53,352
Yao didn't like her.

187
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:57,153
He wouldn't have married her
if it wasn't for the First Chamber.

188
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,673
All these years, no one knows

189
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:01,112
the pain in Yao's heart.

190
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:04,073
Before my husband died,
he was most worried

191
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,392
about his youngest brother, Yao.

192
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,672
As his sister-in-law,

193
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,672
I can only help him.

194
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:13,192
One can have kids with anyone.

195
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,632
As long as He Zhaojun is dead,

196
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:18,313
Yao can free himself from this cuff.

197
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:19,513
This is the only thing

198
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:21,112
I can do for him.

199
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,313
He Zhaojun,

200
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:26,912
don't listen to her nonsense.

201
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:29,233
Stay with us.

202
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:31,073
Yao is coming.

203
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:37,392
Is anyone here?

204
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:38,672
Who is it?

205
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:40,152
Is there a physician named Madam Chen?

206
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:41,233
No.

207
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,832
Is anyone here?

208
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:46,793
Who is it?

209
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:48,192
Is Physician Madam Chen here?

210
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:49,273
Wrong person.

211
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:51,953
Is anyone here?

212
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:55,073
Is anyone here?
Is Physician Madam Chen here?

213
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:56,592
I don't know this person.

214
00:17:58,152 --> 00:17:59,033
Official,

215
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:00,872
could it be Ms. Lou's mistake?

216
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:03,073
Maybe Madam Chen wasn't in Qing County.

217
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,872
Then go and get other labor doctors.

218
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:09,832
Go ask, one by one.

219
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:17,073
It's late at night and raining,
slow down.

220
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,352
Slow down?
My wife couldn't wait that long.

221
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:20,473
We are not familiar with Qing Country.

222
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:21,753
At least cover yourself from the rain.

223
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:26,793
Is anyone here? Is there any physician?

224
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,313
It's late at night.

225
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:31,713
Please,

226
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:32,793
I'm begging you.

227
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:33,553
Please save my wife.

228
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:34,392
My wife is in labor.

229
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,273
She can't wait that long.

230
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,233
Giving birth to a child is
a woman's matter.

231
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,912
Go and get a female physician.

232
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:40,233
After all, men and women are different.

233
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:42,313
Why do you even care
when I don't mind at all.

234
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:44,912
But it's late at night and raining,
it's dangerous

235
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:46,233
for us to rush there.

236
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:48,832
Nothing is more important
than my wife's life.

237
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:50,832
Even if I die,

238
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:52,632
I'll protect you and make sure

239
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,592
you save my wife.

240
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,473
Come with me!

241
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:55,473
This... It's dangerous.

242
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,112
Dangerous.

243
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:07,912
You colluded with

244
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,672
the remnants of Emperor Li to kill us.

245
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:13,473
Remnants?

246
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:16,753
If it wasn't for Tian Shuo,

247
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:21,273
I would have been dead by the lake.

248
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,033
I've been waiting for this day

249
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:28,313
for so many years,

250
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:30,832
I've planned everything.

251
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:33,392
Madam,

252
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:36,273
have you thought it through?

253
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,233
If you want to do this,

254
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,192
you'll be the enemy of your family
and the country.

255
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:42,313
Tian Shuo.

256
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:46,352
The storekeeper of Tian's Restaurant,
Tian Shuo.

257
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:49,513
I guess those suicide assassins
that lured me here

258
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:51,953
are his subordinates.

259
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,513
500 suicide assassins and 1000 soldiers.

260
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:57,073
Those are his confidants.

261
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:00,273
Thousands of liters of kerosene
were poured on

262
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:01,672
Crown Prince's way to the Guo Village.

263
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:02,872
Huo Buyi,

264
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:06,033
you can't go there now.

265
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:07,912
You're not going to save him.

266
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:12,073
Wang Yanji,

267
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:16,192
Lou Ben was not worth your life.

268
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,912
He took his ambition more seriously than

269
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,313
growing old with you.

270
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,513
Do you think

271
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:25,713
this kind of person is worth dying for?

272
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,632
Who are you to judge my husband?

273
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:30,033
Remember how did you treat
Cheng Shaoshang?

274
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:31,832
You went to seek revenge

275
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,713
on your own.

276
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:37,233
Do you know how hard it is for her

277
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,713
to stay in the capital alone?

278
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:40,872
I know.

279
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:43,192
After killing Ling Yi,

280
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:44,632
I regretted it immediately

281
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:46,073
when I laid my eyes on Shaoshang.

282
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:47,872
Husband and wife should be in one mind

283
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:49,953
and be with each other.

284
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:52,713
For all these years,

285
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:55,713
I've been regretting it.

286
00:20:57,672 --> 00:20:59,513
Even if the road to revenge
is getting difficult,

287
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:02,513
I should've married her first.

288
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:07,392
I should've walked the right path

289
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:11,473
with you.

290
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:22,352
If you can repent,

291
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,793
why can't he repent?

292
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:27,112
(Loving husband, Lou Ben)

293
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,513
(Loving husband, Lou Ben)
Why did he leave me alone in the world?

294
00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:30,412
(Loving husband, Lou Ben)

295
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:33,233
How do you know Lou Ben
didn't regret it?

296
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:35,793
He once gifted me a landscape painting.

297
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,152
He told me,

298
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:38,713
that in the future

299
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:40,793
if you are trapped in
a difficult situation,

300
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:42,592
look at the sky and the earth,

301
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:44,993
and never trap yourself in the heart.

302
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,473
Wang Yanji,

303
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,112
today

304
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:51,553
I'm telling you this.

305
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,912
Lou Ben enjoyed
the adventure in the forest,

306
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,832
(Loving husband, Lou Ben)
but you are doing the opposite.

307
00:21:56,993 --> 00:21:58,412
(Loving husband, Lou Ben)
You are ruining his favorite thing.

308
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:01,313
He made a mistake
for the sake of becoming famous.

309
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:03,553
But now,
you are colluding with the rebels,

310
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:04,872
putting everything on fire,

311
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,392
and letting him take the blame.

312
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:08,672
Do you think

313
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:12,073
he would want to see you again?

314
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,392
Even if he doesn't want to see me again,

315
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:18,513
I'll still go to him.

316
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:23,912
If he does hate me,

317
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:29,953
then he can question me.

318
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:26,672
Are you okay?

319
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:36,793
This is the Black Armored Guard's mask.

320
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:40,112
Here you go.

321
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:41,273
Shaoshang, I can't wear this.

322
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:42,352
Keep it for yourself.

323
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:43,553
Listen to me.

324
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,993
I've promised Yao

325
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:46,152
to protect you.

326
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:47,273
Wear it.

327
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,152
(Yanji,)

328
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,352
(I guess I can't accompany you
to the Eastern Sea)

329
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:08,192
(to visit the Penglai Fairyland.)

330
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,352
Young Master!

331
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:35,632
Save them!

332
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:36,513
Yes!

333
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:47,592
Come up!

334
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:00,432
Hurry up!

335
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:01,313
Come up!

336
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:03,872
Hold my hand.

337
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:08,592
Yuan Shanjian.

338
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:27,192
Hurry up!

339
00:26:27,912 --> 00:26:28,713
Hurry up!

340
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:44,793
Hurry up!

341
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:01,912
Hurry up!

342
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,513
Hurry up! Here.

343
00:27:14,152 --> 00:27:14,993
Zisheng.

344
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:15,953
Young Master.

345
00:27:15,953 --> 00:27:16,672
Zisheng.

346
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:17,832
Hurry up!

347
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:20,912
Quick!

348
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:25,632
Zisheng, hurry up!

349
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:32,392
Zisheng!

350
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:33,192
Young Master!

351
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:39,352
Hold it!

352
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:40,912
Everyone hold!

353
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:42,592
Zisheng is still inside.

354
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:43,392
Zisheng!

355
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,033
Young Master!

356
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:44,753
Zisheng!

357
00:27:56,713 --> 00:27:57,912
Pull!

358
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:06,513
Zisheng!

359
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:07,713
Take her away.

360
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:12,313
Zisheng! Zisheng!

361
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:13,872
Take her away.

362
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:17,152
Zisheng!

363
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:18,432
Young Lady.

364
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:19,832
Zisheng!

365
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:23,713
Zisheng!

366
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,912
Don't close the door! No!

367
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:36,993
Zisheng is still in there!

368
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:37,793
Young Lady!

369
00:28:37,912 --> 00:28:38,753
Hurry up, let's go.

370
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:40,192
Zisheng!

371
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:42,273
Zisheng!

372
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:43,192
Young Lady!

373
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:50,033
Hurry up! Let's go!

374
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:53,033
Hurry up! Let's go!

375
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:37,313
Young Lady.

376
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:38,713
No!

377
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:40,793
It's dangerous!

378
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,912
Danger!

379
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:42,832
Zisheng!

380
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:44,872
Zisheng!

381
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:47,233
Zisheng!

382
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,553
Young Master!

383
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:50,993
Zisheng!

384
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:54,192
Zisheng!

385
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,793
(Didn't you say you regretted it?)

386
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:30,713
(Didn't you say you are
not giving up on me?)

387
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:33,073
(Didn't you say you hurt me)

388
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:34,793
(and made me suffer,)

389
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:36,233
(and you will treat me well)

390
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,672
(in the years to come?)

391
00:30:38,513 --> 00:30:40,192
(I promise.)

392
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:42,912
(I forgive you.)

393
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:45,152
(Answer me.)

394
00:30:45,953 --> 00:30:48,192
(Please, answer me.)

395
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,392
Young Master!

396
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:24,192
Shaoshang,

397
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,912
are you forgiving me?

398
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:36,953
Don't deny it later.

399
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:44,912
How do you escape?

400
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,592
Since Wang Yanji can reach
the underground mourning hall,

401
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:48,872
I guess

402
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:50,793
there must be some passages that link to

403
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:51,912
the ground.

404
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,553
I'm in luck.

405
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:57,912
So I climbed out through the passages.

406
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:21,713
Zhaojun! Zhaojun!

407
00:33:24,993 --> 00:33:25,912
Zhaojun.

408
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,112
Please be fine.

409
00:33:30,473 --> 00:33:31,672
You promised

410
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:33,872
to grow old with me.

411
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:37,832
You promised to have kids with me.

412
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:40,073
You promised

413
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,112
to make Hua County your home.

414
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:46,832
Don't break your promise, Zhaojun!

415
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:48,953
Zhaojun!

416
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:50,152
Yao.

417
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:52,672
Yao.

418
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:54,753
Yao.

419
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,152
I'm here.

420
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:14,192
Yao.

421
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:18,092
(Learn From The Great Man)

422
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:26,073
You are alive!

423
00:34:26,993 --> 00:34:27,913
Luckily,

424
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:29,272
you are alive.

425
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:31,073
You have me in mind.

426
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:33,112
Great!

427
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:53,632
Are you done with all the lovey-dovey?

428
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,232
It's almost dawn.

429
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,792
Are we going to save

430
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,913
the Crown Prince or not?

431
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:11,873
If anything happened to the Crown Prince,

432
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:13,632
it would shake
the foundation of the nation.

433
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:15,033
It's a big deal.

434
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,353
(Hua County Station)
Just go and save the Crown Prince.

435
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:20,232
If Tian Shuo knows

436
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:22,112
the Crown Prince isn't hurt,

437
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:24,353
he will put fire on
the Guo Village to vent.

438
00:35:24,712 --> 00:35:26,393
The people in the Guo Village
are in danger.

439
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:29,232
You'll save the Crown Prince,

440
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:31,433
I'll protect the people
in the Guo Village.

441
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,192
Do you know how dangerous
this trip will be?

442
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,792
I have to go no matter how
dangerous it is.

443
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:43,232
I'm blessed

444
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:44,833
to be born at a peaceful age.

445
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,312
I'm blessed

446
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:47,993
to be born into a happy family.

447
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:51,232
There's nothing to be afraid of.

448
00:35:51,873 --> 00:35:53,433
I shall live my life to the fullest,

449
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,272
and listen to my heart.

450
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:00,712
Zisheng,

451
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:03,993
I'll protect the people
in the Guo Village for you.

452
00:36:05,152 --> 00:36:06,792
Compared to the galaxy,

453
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,192
we are just a speck of dust
in the universe.

454
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:11,433
Compared to the thousands of civilians,

455
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:12,672
and the world,

456
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,312
our love-hate relationship

457
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:17,592
is nothing.

458
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,192
Shaoshang,

459
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:25,393
you are the only one

460
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,513
who can walk alongside me in this world.

461
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:30,152
I will not stop you

462
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:32,033
from doing what you want.

463
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:41,492
(Hua County Station)

464
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:55,553
(We will do this)

465
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:57,632
(together.)

466
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:44,632
Third Prince,

467
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:47,353
it'd been a while.

468
00:37:47,913 --> 00:37:48,873
Tian Shuo.

469
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,873
It was a shame that we couldn't catch you

470
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:53,152
in the capital.

471
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,632
Today,

472
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,112
I'm not letting you go.

473
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:58,592
Take him!

474
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:30,792
Lad!

475
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:33,232
If you surrender,

476
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:35,592
I'll not dismember you.

477
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:37,953
As the Crown Prince,

478
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:40,033
I'll fight to the death

479
00:39:40,592 --> 00:39:41,913
and never back off.

480
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:44,232
I guess I have to do justice

481
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:46,953
on behalf of my master.

482
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:38,833
Huo Buyi!

483
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,192
You are alive!

484
00:40:41,913 --> 00:40:43,112
I will never die

485
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:44,993
before killing you.

486
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,953
Wang Yanji is useless!

487
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:03,513
