3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,720
General Wan, please stay.

4
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:54,361
General Ling,

5
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,001
are you not staying for a meal?

6
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,240
Our Young Master has never eaten
at other residences.

7
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,561
All right, it's for the best.

8
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,401
General Ling, I won't see you off then.

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,481
Uncle Wan.

10
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
Uncle Wan.

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,401
Uncle Wan.

12
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:27,120
I've been driven into a corner now.

13
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,320
You and Qiqi are all I can turn to
for shelter now.

14
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,600
Excuse me, Young Lady.

15
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,320
Which family are you from?

16
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,481
Are we acquainted?

17
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,401
Uncle Wan, stop putting up an act.

18
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,720
I seem to know you but you are...

19
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm Niaoniao.

20
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:44,200
Cheng Shaoshang of the Cheng Family.

21
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
You're Niaoniao?

22
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,280
How did you end up this way?

23
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:49,481
You don't have to tell me.

24
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,441
I know

25
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:52,041
it must be your mother who beat you.

26
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:53,921
Fear not.

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,881
I'll talk to your father about this.

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,441
It wasn't Mother who beat me.

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,361
But why do you look glad

30
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:00,680
that I was beaten?

31
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:02,720
No, I wasn't.

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,120
I just didn't recognize you
for a moment there.

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,841
Don't hold it in.
Just laugh if you want.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,280
Why did you laugh?

35
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,760
I wasn't laughing.

36
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:25,041
If Young Master said you did,
it means you did.

37
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:27,240
Niaoniao,

38
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,521
Qiqi is in the back hall.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,481
Why don't you go and meet her?

40
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,481
I'm occupied here.

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,760
Qiqi!

42
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,320
General Ling.

43
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:55,760
The door is...

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,041
It's getting late now.

45
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm afraid dinner is not prepared
at my residence yet.

46
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
So I can only continue

47
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,881
to trouble you, General Wan.

48
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:07,441
General Ling, I thought...

49
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,441
Would it be troubling you?

50
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:09,720
Of course not.

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,120
Please come in.

52
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:36,160
That wretched Wang Ling.

53
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:38,200
How could she beat you so viciously?

54
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,640
Look at what she did

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,041
to this pretty face.

56
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:43,841
I hope she...

57
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,081
I hope she'll suffer
from frostbite on her face.

58
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,200
Why don't you stay for several days
now that you're here?

59
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,160
(Old Madam Wan)

60
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,441
(Old Madam Wan)
You can go home after your mother is no longer upset.

61
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,200
Thank you, Old Madam Wan.

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,481
Qiqi's elder sisters are all married.

63
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,841
(Mrs. Wan)
Since she returned to the capital,

64
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,561
she has been idling all day long.

65
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,160
You and your friends

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,320
should start learning to read and write now.

67
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,041
I don't want to learn all those.

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,561
I want to teach Shaoshang
how to ride a horse.

69
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,001
Besides,

70
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:14,041
can't you see

71
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,081
Shaoshang's face is still bruised?

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,800
Do you write with your face?

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,001
Qiqi,

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
when are you going to stay put

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,320
to learn to read and write?

76
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,081
Also,

77
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,561
take off all your jewelry.

78
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Who are you showing
these jingling things at this late hour?

79
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,200
Don't you find them heavy?

80
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,401
Grandmother,

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,240
people in the capital dress
like this now.

82
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,720
Then bring me a lady

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,760
who dresses up this way.

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,240
Then I'll have

85
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,401
the exact jewelry ordered for you.

86
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,041
If you can't find one
who dresses up this way,

87
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,320
you'll have to give all of these to me.

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,200
Old Madam Wan,

89
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,760
it was a rough journey here.

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,680
My stomach is pretty much empty

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,200
and I'm starving.

92
00:05:58,561 --> 00:05:59,841
Is there any food?

93
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,961
Take Shaoshang to your room
and have a meal.

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,280
And change your clothes.

95
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:16,921
So based on what Shaoshang said,

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,240
she fought with them
because of a disagreement.

97
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
If that's what happened,

98
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,160
how is that a conduct of a lady
from a noble household?

99
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:25,160
Even if she has suffered injustice,

100
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,600
there are other ways to solve it.

101
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,760
There's no need to go to such an extent.

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Pray tell,

103
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:34,401
what can be done to solve this

104
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,600
in ways where she can vent her anger

105
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,320
while keeping the peace?

106
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,441
She can inform the elders.

107
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:45,841
Her mother was present at the time.

108
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,240
She didn't even speak up

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,680
to seek justice for her daughter.

110
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,800
There's no need to vent.

111
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,441
It's all solved if she bears with it.

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,680
Life is all about strength of character.

113
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,001
Losing it means it's all but dead.

114
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:06,800
If General Cheng is

115
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,001
someone who plays safe and is a patient person,

116
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:12,160
do you think I'd let Songbai be
his sworn brother?

117
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,841
In turbulent times,

118
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,001
what's the use of an ally

119
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,600
who won't step up to fight for you

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,481
at a critical time?

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,680
You're right, Old Madam.

122
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,521
Qiqi takes after Songbai.

123
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,401
Shaoshang takes after General Cheng.

124
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,800
They're both frank and care not
about trivial matters.

125
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,081
Making friends isn't just

126
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:49,361
about being sincere.

127
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,561
You must discern well.

128
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,561
I'm not young anymore.

129
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,441
I should be telling

130
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:00,680
these to my grandson

131
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,481
and teach him how to distinguish
and see through others.

132
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,561
Yet, I'm here nagging

133
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,081
at you here.

134
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,841
I'm to blame for not bearing
any male offspring.

135
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,961
General is not young

136
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,081
and he has no son.

137
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,001
Don't dwell on this matter anymore.

138
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:35,681
Who knows you might live longer
than Songbai and me.

139
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,641
There is nothing worried

140
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,921
once people die.

141
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,801
Old Madam Wan. Madam.

142
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,921
Master is drunk from drinking too much.

143
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:52,721
He rests in his study room now.

144
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,721
He won't be greeting you for the night.

145
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,320
I understand.

146
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,520
Has Ling Buyi left?

147
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,240
General Ling is still here.

148
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,520
I heard he's staying the night
in the guest room.

149
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,841
I guess he's also drunk.

150
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,120
General Ling didn't have a drink.

151
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,440
Here.

152
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,961
What do you think?

153
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,480
I got Qianlizui from my father.

154
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,280
It's good, isn't it?

155
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,961
It's strong enough.

156
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:37,841
Qiqi,

157
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,200
I'm curious about something.

158
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,681
What happened to your grandmother's ear?

159
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,480
Everyone knows about this.

160
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,400
Yet, you didn't know?

161
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,240
I don't know.

162
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,041
When my grandfather passed away,

163
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,001
my father was barely ten years old.

164
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,240
Then my granduncles came to the residence.

165
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,520
They insisted my grandmother would remarry

166
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,280
and let another man take

167
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,641
my grandfather's property.

168
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,400
No matter how my grandmother vowed,

169
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,120
those people wouldn't let the matter rest.

170
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,601
So my grandmother

171
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,320
cut off her left ear,

172
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,480
threw it directly at the person
who headed them there

173
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,801
and said she'd never remarry.

174
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,641
Old Madam Wan

175
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,480
is really impressive.

176
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,641
Grandmother also said

177
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,641
she comes from a humble background.

178
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
But my grandfather
was never mean to her.

179
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:40,280
He always respected her and loved her.

180
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,761
He used the most elaborated way to marry her.

181
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,360
He said

182
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:48,001
my grandmother is
the world's best woman.

183
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,240
Because of what my grandfather said,

184
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,440
my grandmother doesn't fear

185
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,601
even if she has to cut her flesh

186
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,641
piece by piece.

187
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,120
This is what we called,

188
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,761
"If the Emperor treats me
as the nation's pillar,

189
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,721
I shall contribute
as the nation's pillar."

190
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:16,841
Old Madam Wan is indeed

191
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,160
a heroine among women.

192
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,881
Do you think

193
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,961
we can find a great hero

194
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,721
to who we can entrust

195
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,961
each other's lives

196
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,881
in the future?

197
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:47,601
My mother never taught me

198
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:50,601
to pacify the army.

199
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,120
I supposed

200
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
that's because my future husband

201
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,601
won't be in the military.

202
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:59,721
My mother never taught me
about the aristocratic family either.

203
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,360
I supposed my mother knows

204
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,641
that I won't be marrying
into an aristocratic family.

205
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,881
So I can forget about heroes.

206
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,480
In the future,

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
it would be best

208
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
if I can marry into a stable family

209
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,480
and live a stable life.

210
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,761
How can you marry casually?

211
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,520
Would you be contented
with marrying an ordinary person?

212
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,160
Yes, I would naturally be contented.

213
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,641
Since I was born,

214
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,081
it wasn't up to me to decide
to feel discontent.

215
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,200
Yao,

216
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,310
(Lou Ben)

217
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,601
(Lou Ben)
you came home with Li.

218
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,001
Why aren't you resting in your room?

219
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:28,801
(Lou Yao, you shall be more brave.)

220
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,641
(You mustn't be lesser
to the Cheng's Young Lady.)

221
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,320
(At least, she dared to fight.)

222
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:34,921
Why are you standing at my door?

223
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:37,841
Brother Ben,

224
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,881
I came here to see you.

225
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:41,801
I...

226
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,841
I want to break off the betrothal
with He Zhaojun.

227
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,601
Ben,

228
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,961
we have opposite personalities
and it's hard to get along with her.

229
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,160
Besides,

230
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,520
everyone in the capital knows

231
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,240
about the relationship
between her and Prince Xiao.

232
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,560
I feel miserable

233
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,280
and it's better to break it off sooner.

234
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,881
I know you wouldn't agree to it but...

235
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:58,921
All right.

236
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:01,480
You...

237
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,001
You agreed?

238
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,801
With me running the second chamber,

239
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,280
I won't let you sacrifice for a marriage.

240
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:10,841
You're right.

241
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,520
It's better to be decisive in this matter.

242
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,681
No matter who you choose
to marry in the future,

243
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,360
I'll fully support you.

244
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:21,721
Thank you, Ben.

245
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:27,081
I agree with your sudden decision
to break off the betrothal.

246
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,001
You look so happy.

247
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,641
Do you have someone else in your heart?

248
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,041
No, I don't.

249
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
If I have one,

250
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:46,681
you'll be the first person I tell.

251
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:49,400
You can go back to your room now.

252
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,120
For your grandmother's
birthday banquet preparation,

253
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,881
I can hear knocking
from early in the morning.

254
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:11,961
So this is here.

255
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:13,641
Mister,

256
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,801
what's wrong with this bridge?

257
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,200
It's Young Lady and Fourth Lady Cheng.

258
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,360
Greetings.

259
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,961
This bridge is unsteady
and unsafe to walk on.

260
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,400
I'm looking for someone to repair it.

261
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
But this bridge is a little strange.

262
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:32,120
No matter which piece of wood is moved,
it'll affect other pieces.

263
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,801
So we can only demolish this bridge
and build a new one.

264
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:36,801
I'm planning to tell General about this.

265
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,601
Uncle Wan really spent a fortune

266
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,560
in repairing this house.

267
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Qiqi,

268
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,320
is the water flowing in the lake?

269
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,881
It flows from the outskirts
of the east side of the capital.

270
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,560
Father spent ten thousand cash

271
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,240
to construct the canal alone.

272
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:54,921
On Grandmother's birthday,

273
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,360
I'm going to show Wang Ling and the rest

274
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,801
that our mansion is not inferior

275
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,881
to Lord Ruyang's Mansion.

276
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,601
Niaoniao, what are you doing?

277
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:06,200
Follow me to the horse training ground.

278
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,240
Qiqi,

279
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
you know

280
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,801
I love building things the most.

281
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:11,280
I want to take a look

282
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,761
before they take down the bridge.

283
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:13,881
Come with me.

284
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,081
The bridge is going
to be taken down anyway.

285
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,001
I don't want to stare blankly at it.

286
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,240
I'll head to the horse training ground first.

287
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,400
Come over once you've finished inspecting it.

288
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:23,921
I'll teach you how to ride a horse.

289
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:25,560
I'll be there in a while.

290
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:20,841
(So that's how it's built.)

291
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,841
(I only need to pull this one out.)

292
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,001
(Then the whole bridge will...)

293
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:32,721
General Ling,

294
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,440
I want to apologize for last night.

295
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,801
I had too much to drink
that I left first.

296
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,480
I didn't take good care of you.

297
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:39,801
No matter.

298
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,240
It's just that His Majesty will travel
to the west soon.

299
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,400
Yet, I haven't found
the geographical map of Shu.

300
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,200
So I'm just concerned.

301
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,160
It was you who recaptured Shu back then.

302
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,240
General Wan,

303
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,200
have you never seen
that geographical map?

304
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,120
No.

305
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,801
I've never seen it.

306
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,120
General Ling,

307
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,160
look around Wan's residence.

308
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,841
We don't lack any treasures.

309
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,440
Why would I keep that treasure map?

310
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,961
Yes, it doesn't appear to lack anything.

311
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
I did say that, right?

312
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm grateful to His Majesty
for rewarding me with this huge mansion.

313
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,320
My family has ample food and clothing.

314
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,320
I can't thank His Majesty enough
for his grace.

315
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,641
So what can I do

316
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:28,001
with that map?

317
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,240
General Ling,
how about you take a look around

318
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,520
since you're already here?

319
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:44,801
General Ling.

320
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,400
General Ling, stop.

321
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,001
This bridge is dangerous.

322
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,721
It'll collapse if you walk on it.

323
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,761
Why don't you come this way?

324
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,360
The bridge is dangerous?

325
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,081
It turns out to be a dangerous bridge.

326
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,081
We should be cautious then.

327
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,081
Yes, we must be careful.

328
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,280
(Why is this fiend still here?)

329
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,440
(I can't seem to get away from him.)

330
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,480
Qiqi!

331
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:51,601
Shaoshang.

332
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,520
My father bought this horse recently.

333
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,360
It's docile and suitable for beginners.

334
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,400
If you like it,
I'll have someone send it over.

335
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,041
If you only have one,

336
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,280
it's better you don't give it to me.

337
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:07,001
My mother is a very fair person.

338
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,841
If you only have one horse,

339
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,280
she'll politely refuse to accept it.

340
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,520
Or she won't give it to me
even if she accepts it.

341
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,041
Good horse.

342
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:18,841
It's obedient, is it not?

343
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,200
Good horse.

344
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,560
Young Lady, Old Madam is asking for you.

345
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,240
All right.

346
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:28,480
Shaoshang,

347
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,721
why don't you ride it first?

348
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,560
Me? Ride it?

349
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:33,520
It's so bothersome.

350
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,721
When my grandmother asks me
to run errands,

351
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:36,081
she'd call for me several times a day.

352
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,961
I'll see what she needs
and you can ride it first.

353
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,320
All right, go on.

354
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:40,801
Let's go.

355
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:55,520
Come here.

356
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,280
Stay still.

357
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,801
That's more like it.

358
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,160
Stop. Stop.

359
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,120
Stay still.

360
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:53,761
I'll teach you.

361
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,240
All right.

362
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,360
It's all right now.

363
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,641
Don't take such a risk again next time.

364
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:44,440
A good horse knows human nature best.

365
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,200
If you fear it,

366
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:47,721
it'll pick on you.

367
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,681
If you're tenacious,

368
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,320
it'll fear you.

369
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:52,841
That's the way of handling a horse.

370
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:54,601
In this world,

371
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,721
the same thing applies to most things.

372
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,721
Why are you here, General?

373
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,320
If it weren't for me,
you'd have suffered serious injuries.

374
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,560
That's quite bold of you.

375
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,160
You have no knowledge of horse riding.

376
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,041
Yet, you have the guts
to ride a horse alone.

377
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,360
I'm not bold.

378
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,160
That happened

379
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:16,081
because man and woman
shouldn't be too intimate.

380
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,200
You were too close to me.

381
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:19,761
So I was scared.

382
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,200
Not because I'm scared of the horse.

383
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:25,200
You grabbed onto my arm tightly.

384
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,961
You were the one
who was too close to me.

385
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,360
Besides, if I was indeed too close to you

386
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,641
because I've admired you
for a long time.

387
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:34,001
Yet, you have no interest

388
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:35,801
in me at all.

389
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,681
Did you say you admire me?

390
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:47,641
General Ling,

391
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,041
I was speaking nonsense the other day.

392
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,761
Please don't take it to heart.

393
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:53,480
Besides,

394
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:56,081
didn't you come to our home
and tell my father

395
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,801
that I'm similar to the interrogators
at the Ministry of Justice?

396
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:00,721
Was I wrong?

397
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,801
Miss Cheng, you eavesdropped on
a military discussion under the bridge.

398
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:04,160
When you go to the Ministry of Justice,

399
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:06,480
you can only be a wanted criminal
under imperial order

400
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,560
and not an interrogator.

401
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:09,801
I didn't eavesdrop on
any military discussion.

402
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,761
General Ling,

403
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,480
even if I may have offended you
in some way,

404
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:13,881
you can't make a false accusation.

405
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,160
I admit I was under the bridge.

406
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,001
But I can't hear anything
from under the bridge.

407
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:19,480
Is that so?

408
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,280
Yes.

409
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,280
Ling... Ling Buyi,

410
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,001
I didn't hear anything at all!

411
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:33,560
I really can't hear anything
from under the bridge!

412
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:44,041
Young Lady Cheng is

413
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,560
all bruised and swollen
from being beaten.

414
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,001
It makes me want to laugh
when I see her every time.

415
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:50,681
You better don't let Old Madam hear you.

416
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,921
She'll punish you
for disrespecting our guest.

417
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,400
I think you can hear clearly

418
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,881
from here.

419
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,841
When I'm nervous,

420
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:05,001
I can't hear anything.

421
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,120
Are you certain
you didn't hear anything?

422
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,200
General Wan has

423
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,520
the geographical map of Shu
in his possession.

424
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,721
I'm here to obtain it
on behalf of His Majesty.

425
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,761
You wanted to tell me this yourself.

426
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,280
I never wanted to hear it.

427
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,601
It's about the armament case
your Granduncle was involved in.

428
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:33,081
That batch of armaments
may have been transported to Shu.

429
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
When His Majesty heard of this,

430
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,440
he decided to travel to the west.

431
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,560
By all means, we must have
the geographical map of Shu.

432
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,400
Yet, General Wan is hiding
this map in secret.

433
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:42,560
Young Lady Cheng,

434
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,160
you must think of the connection
in this matter.

435
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,160
Your father and General Wan
are close friends.

436
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,081
And your family member

437
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,921
is involved in this armament case.

438
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,560
If His Majesty finds out about this,

439
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,280
how would he punish the Wan Family

440
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:54,961
and the Cheng Family?

441
00:25:57,761 --> 00:25:59,160
How do you know

442
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,400
the geographical map of Shu

443
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,001
is in Uncle Wan's possession?

444
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,160
If I didn't know,

445
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,961
I wouldn't have stayed for the night.

446
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:10,081
Uncle Wan only loves wine and riches.

447
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,160
He would never be disloyal
to His Majesty.

448
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,721
He may think...

449
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:14,801
He might think

450
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,601
that was just a treasure map.

451
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:19,721
I thought so too.

452
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,681
General Ling, you're capable of doing anything.

453
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:25,881
I'm sure you know

454
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,001
where this treasure map is hidden.

455
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,280
I've searched every corner
of Wan's residence.

456
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:33,001
Only Old Madam Wan's chamber
is inconvenient for me to search.

457
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:34,761
So

458
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,120
I can only trouble you to do this task.

459
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,120
Why don't you search for it yourself?

460
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,081
Would you believe me

461
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
if I say I don't want
to act presumptuously

462
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,081
because I want to protect the lives

463
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:51,841
of the whole family?

464
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,801
If you help me retrieve the map,

465
00:26:57,841 --> 00:26:59,601
I'll be tight-lipped

466
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,761
about what you want to do.

467
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,560
What is it that I want to do?

468
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,961
Dangerous bridge.

469
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:13,601
So it's a dangerous bridge.

470
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:31,120
Then I shall await

471
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:33,081
your good news.

472
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:35,360
After you do me a favor today,

473
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
I shall fulfill

474
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:39,440
your wish in the future.

475
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:30,081
Old Madam, watch your steps.

476
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Qiqi,

477
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,881
you're not a child anymore.

478
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,961
Do you still want
to play hide-and-seek with me?

479
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:48,681
I'm exhausted.

480
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,641
I want to get some rest.

481
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,200
You can all leave.

482
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,841
Yes, Old Madam.

483
00:30:58,921 --> 00:30:59,881
Qiqi,

484
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,041
I forgot to remove
my pearl hairpin just now.

485
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,841
It was uncomfortable.

486
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:06,881
Come and take it.

487
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,560
And put it in the box next to the shelf.

488
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,440
Are you listening to me?

489
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm waiting for you!

490
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,041
Remember.

491
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,961
Put it in the fragrant rosewood box
with flower carvings.

492
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,560
Don't ever touch the box made
from red sandalwood.

493
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,360
Your father left this treasured object

494
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,160
with me for safekeeping.

495
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,841
If you make a mistake,

496
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,681
it's a much worst mistake
than stealing his Qianlizui.

497
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:09,320
Do you understand me?

498
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,721
I'm talking to you.

499
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,841
You can leave after you keep it.

500
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,041
I need some rest.

501
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,320
General Ling.

502
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:14,440
It's done.

503
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,001
Good.

504
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:22,160
Drink, General Ling.

505
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,681
Have another drink.

506
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:24,520
General Wan,

507
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:26,240
I've been nothing but trouble
for the past two days.

508
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,480
I think it's time
for me to take my leave.

509
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:29,400
General Ling,

510
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,320
we haven't had enough drinks.

511
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,801
I'll be sure to attend

512
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,480
the Wan Family's banquet
a few days later.

513
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:34,681
General Ling.

514
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,480
I shall get going now.

515
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,961
But...

516
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,081
Don't go.

517
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,400
General Ling!

518
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,721
They say you're hard to deal with.

519
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,520
So much for being cautious.

520
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,240
Mother!

521
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:07,440
Mother!

522
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,081
Mother,

523
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,160
can you guess what happened?

524
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,001
I've easily sent

525
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:13,560
that ill-fated person away.

526
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,280
Did he leave?

527
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,961
Yes.

528
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,721
Is he really gone?

529
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:16,721
Yes, he's gone.

530
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,280
Did he leave any word?

531
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:20,801
He said he'll be attending

532
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:22,601
the banquet here a few days later.

533
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:27,641
Thank you for helping the Wan Family, General Ling.

534
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:28,881
What are you saying, Mother?

535
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:30,641
Why do you need to thank that lad?

536
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,041
Mother.

537
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,240
Come here.

538
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:55,200
Come closer.

539
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:57,841
Mother.

540
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,601
I said closer.

541
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:02,681
Mother, what is it?

542
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:17,400
Shaoshang, why are you going home

543
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,280
when Aunt Yuanyi's anger

544
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,641
has yet subsided?

545
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:23,480
I missed my father terribly.

546
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:24,560
My father...

547
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,280
Mother!

548
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,081
Stop hitting me.

549
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:31,560
Why do you have to be so fierce?

550
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,200
Mother?

551
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,240
Father?

552
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,240
Father.

553
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,081
I'm sorry.

554
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:22,440
Even if Mother beat me
to death this time,

555
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,520
I'll never run away from home anymore.

556
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,681
Niaoniao has a fright

557
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,560
from Lord Ruyang's Mansion
several days ago.

558
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,520
Now she has suffered at Wan's residence.

559
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,120
Besides, she already knows her mistakes.

560
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,841
So please don't punish her.

561
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,280
Only she can do something
to shock others.

562
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,801
Who can shock her?

563
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,400
Do think she suffers at Wan's residence?

564
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,641
How is it not so?

565
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:45,961
It's only been a couple of days.

566
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,641
Look at her sunken face.

567
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,641
It's because her swelling has resided.

568
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,560
You said you were wrong.

569
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:55,841
What did you do wrong?

570
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,320
I used to think

571
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,560
everything outside is the best.

572
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:13,881
So I was eager to venture out.

573
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,961
But I've finally understand

574
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:17,721
that no place is better

575
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,041
than home.

576
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:21,761
Father,

577
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:23,801
I'll never go anywhere from now on.

578
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:25,360
I'll stay with you
and serve my duty as a child.

579
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,400
All right.

580
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:28,721
It's not over yet.

581
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,921
Tell me.

582
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,601
What happened at Wan's residence?

583
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,801
Ling Buyi was there.

584
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,120
What was he doing there?

585
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,520
He said he was searching

586
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:46,681
for the geographical map of Shu.

587
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:51,601
Mother,

588
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,520
I didn't cause any trouble
at Wan's residence.

589
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,240
I only came home

590
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,360
because I find Ling Buyi

591
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,681
is scary.

592
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:00,280
You're right about that.

593
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,520
When I talked to Ling Buyi,

594
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:03,641
I felt

595
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,601
a cold shudder all over my body too.

596
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,440
Is it that hard to stop

597
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:09,961
your habit of eavesdropping?

598
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,120
I overheard it by accident.

599
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,601
It was Granduncle's fault
for losing the armaments.

600
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:16,921
Ling Buyi suspects
that this batch of armaments

601
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,160
was sold to the Shu.

602
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
He thinks Shu has second thoughts.

603
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:21,160
That's why he was searching
for this map.

604
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Is this something

605
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:25,240
a young girl like you should be discussing?

606
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,480
I don't mind you talking about family matters.

607
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:29,120
But this concerns the nation.

608
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,120
General,

609
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:33,881
the monarchs and officials play different roles.

610
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,041
We must not discuss

611
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,480
this matter any further.

612
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,520
You have a point.

613
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,921
Niaoniao,

614
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,280
have you told anyone about this?

615
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,240
No.

616
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:53,400
I only told you and Mother.

617
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,280
I didn't tell a third person about this.

618
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,120
Niaoniao,

619
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,520
you must never speak of this

620
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:01,440
and tell another soul of this matter.

621
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:06,360
Helping to keep this matter
a secret is enough

622
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:09,120
to make up for your previous mistakes.

623
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,320
Go back to your room.

624
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,841
Where did she go?

625
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
I haven't started questioning her yet.

626
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,721
Dear, didn't you just forgive Niaoniao?

627
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,601
We'll just consider
that she has made up for her mistakes.

628
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:39,881
I never said that.

629
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,601
You just said so.

630
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:43,801
Don't you remember

631
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:45,320
what you said just now?

632
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,801
Dear.

633
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:48,641
Do you think

634
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,641
Shu will raise a rebellion?

635
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,080
(Geographical Map of Shu)

636
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,400
With this map,

637
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,801
we can deploy our troops in advance.

638
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,881
Then Shu won't be able
to cause any huge trouble.

639
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,160
But Young Master,

640
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,801
you already knew the map was hidden

641
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:14,120
at Wan's residence.

642
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,641
You can just retrieve it.

643
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,480
Why did you go through the trouble

644
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,801
and end up owing
Fourth Lady Cheng a favor?

645
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:21,320
Young Master thinks

646
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,881
General Wan would be charged
for the crime

647
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,841
of hiding the map

648
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,801
if we found the map
after searching his residence.

649
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,360
But it would be a different story

650
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,601
if Old Madam Wan gives

651
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:31,280
the map to us

652
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:33,520
through Fourth Lady Cheng.

653
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,001
So that's the reason.

654
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:43,120
His Majesty has a benevolent heart.

655
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:44,881
He thinks there's a misunderstanding

656
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,480
in this matter.

657
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,721
I'm afraid His Majesty's plan

658
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
to travel to the west

659
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,721
would raise an alert

660
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:55,041
to Shu.

661
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:57,320
If they restrain themselves

662
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,641
and not make any move,

663
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,881
it'll be harder for us
to find something to hold

664
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:01,881
against them.

665
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,400
We both know His Majesty's journey
to the west is mainly

666
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:07,280
to force them to yield
by showing our military strength.

667
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:09,721
But those who are afraid
of being exposed

668
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:11,841
may not surrender.

669
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,641
If they think His Majesty's journey is

670
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:17,360
to attack them,

671
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:20,881
what do you think they'll do?

672
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,440
They will be desperate and try to gain
the upper hand by attacking first.

673
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:25,560
Young Master,

674
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,641
what should we do next?

675
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:30,400
We'll round them up
and leave them no way to escape.

676
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,440
Let's make them feel anxious first.

677
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,961
Thief!

678
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,280
Catch the thief!

679
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:40,761
After the thief!

680
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,081
Search over there!

681
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Why are you just standing there?

682
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:44,601
Go that way!

683
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,120
Your Highness,

684
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,081
we searched the place.

685
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,641
That thief was too fast.

686
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:49,921
We failed to capture him.

687
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,841
Useless!

688
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:52,280
You can't even catch a thief!

689
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,440
What's the point of taking you in?

690
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:56,200
Your Highness,

691
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,081
we've inspected the area.

692
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,761
Nothing is missing from the residence.

693
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,160
Your Highness, something bad had happened!

694
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,440
Your Highness, something happened!

695
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:04,761
Ling... It's Ling... Ling...

696
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,761
Ling...

697
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:06,681
What Ling?

698
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:07,881
Speak properly!

699
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,041
It's General Ling!

700
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,841
He brought the black armored guard
and surrounded us!
