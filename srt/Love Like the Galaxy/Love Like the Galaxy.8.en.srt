=Episode 8=

3
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:20,947
Today,

4
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:23,907
the kitchen has especially prepared
golden dates as snacks for all of you.

5
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,988
It takes more than ten stages
to make it.

6
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,628
You can say it was done meticulously.

7
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:30,947
Why don't all of you here try it?

8
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:33,428
Cheng Yang, try it first.

9
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:38,628
I suppose it's your first time trying it.

10
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:40,428
Help yourself.

11
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,988
Aren't these just golden dates?

12
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,667
How is this rare?

13
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:52,548
I once killed a leopard with a knife

14
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:55,227
and dissected it myself to make wine
from its bones for my father.

15
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:56,428
What about you?

16
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,947
I supposed you've never had
a taste of it before.

17
00:02:58,348 --> 00:02:59,348
Wan Qiqi,

18
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,307
today is Princess Yuchang's birthday.

19
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:02,788
How can you talk

20
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:04,908
and behave like a savage?

21
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:06,587
At the imperial banquet,

22
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,068
Father presented the leopard-bone wine
to His Majesty.

23
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:12,068
His Majesty praised me
for being fierce like my father.

24
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:12,988
Why?

25
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:14,587
Are you trying to say

26
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,507
that His Majesty is a savage too?

27
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:18,667
I...

28
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,428
This date is indeed tasty.

29
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:25,068
You've mistaken.

30
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,908
What you tried isn't a real date.

31
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:29,507
The golden date

32
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:32,587
was steamed and fried
with honey-coated butter noodles.

33
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,147
It looks like a date. But it's not.

34
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:41,107
His Majesty is trying
to propose frugality to the nation.

35
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,107
But look at you trying

36
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,827
to belittle others with extravagance.

37
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:45,667
Stop trying to bring His Majesty
in every subject.

38
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:48,028
You should look at what you're wearing.

39
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,107
That's true.

40
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:50,468
If you're considerate
of the people's sufferings,

41
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:51,947
why aren't you wearing rags

42
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:53,107
and farming in the fields?

43
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:53,827
I supposed

44
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,908
you're reluctant to part
from your wealth.

45
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:02,387
Qiqi has fought in battle
with General Wan for many years.

46
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:04,267
They had to compensate families
of fallen soldiers.

47
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:06,427
It's not easier than farming.

48
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,348
Who would spend time making a snack

49
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:10,148
that requires more than ten stages?

50
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:11,387
Besides,

51
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,987
the soldiers had to fight and kill
on the battlefield.

52
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:16,427
Yet, you eat and drink
to your heart's content in the capital.

53
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,148
Families of military officers

54
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,308
like us can't bear to live

55
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:20,868
a luxury life like this.

56
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,547
It doesn't matter
if we don't attend this banquet.

57
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:24,987
Also,

58
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,427
all the delicious food
and drinks on table

59
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,947
are blessed by heaven

60
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:31,707
and His Majesty's continuous hard work
for the country.

61
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:35,107
Not forgetting soldiers
who fought hard on the front lines.

62
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,068
You're enjoying such blessings.

63
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,707
Here you are ridiculing
the descendants of military officers.

64
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,667
Don't you feel ashamed at all?

65
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,468
Your Highness, General Ling has arrived.

66
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,987
Miss Shaoshang, you have such a temper.

67
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,387
We were just being amusing.

68
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:08,628
Don't make a fool of yourselves
in front of distinguished guests.

69
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,947
Do we have distinguished guests here?

70
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:12,188
You?

71
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:13,588
You?

72
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,227
Or are you the distinguished guest?

73
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:17,628
Wang Ling,

74
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:19,547
stop trying to scare others.

75
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:20,788
It's Zisheng.

76
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,468
Zisheng is here

77
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,468
to celebrate Princess Yuchang's birthday.

78
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:29,308
I've forgotten about it.

79
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,028
I think Miss Cheng Shaoshang

80
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,068
was confined in the village.

81
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:35,227
She wouldn't have had the chance
to meet Zisheng.

82
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:39,348
How about this?

83
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,628
If you're obedient today,

84
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,348
you might be able to have a glance.

85
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:44,427
Wang Ling,

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,148
can you see the obsession on your face?

87
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:48,708
You can meet him alone if you want to.

88
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:50,708
Why are you dragging Shaoshang in this?

89
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:53,948
I was wondering who that is.

90
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:56,148
It's only Zisheng.

91
00:05:58,667 --> 00:05:59,867
I'll have to excuse myself, then.

92
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:04,948
Wang Ling,

93
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:07,948
Zisheng has admired me for a long time.

94
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,667
But I'm not interested in him.

95
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,508
It'll only make things awkward
to see him.

96
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:16,067
I shall take my leave, Your Highness.

97
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:50,908
You are...

98
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,667
I'm someone who has been admiring you
for a long time.

99
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:56,388
Yet, you show no interest in me at all.

100
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:58,348
I'm Zisheng.

101
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:13,588
There you are, General Ling.

102
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,588
Have a seat.

103
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:17,067
(Ling Buyi?)

104
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,348
(So Ling Buyi is Zisheng.)

105
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,067
(I'm dead.)

106
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:33,948
Qiqi.

107
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:35,307
Cheng Yang.

108
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:37,268
Yangyang.

109
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,067
I think the golden date is bad.

110
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:41,468
I don't feel well.

111
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:43,948
My stomach hurts.

112
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,187
Hurry.

113
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:53,747
I'm thrilled

114
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,028
that you accepted my invitation

115
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:56,468
to attend my birthday banquet.

116
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,067
I already regretted coming.

117
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,148
I see Lord Ruyang's Mansion

118
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,908
doesn't welcome military officers.

119
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,627
You rode to wars
and rendered military achievements.

120
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:06,067
How am I not welcoming you

121
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,348
when I can't admire you enough.

122
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,627
Miss Cheng Shaoshang
was only joking just now.

123
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,348
If we really look down on
the new general,

124
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,348
I wouldn't have invited them.

125
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:15,508
But I don't see anyone

126
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:18,788
from the military families.

127
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:20,427
I really did invite them!

128
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:22,508
Shaoshang and Qiqi just left.

129
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:25,187
Zhaojun is not here yet
because she has another engagement.

130
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,588
General Ling, where are you going?

131
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,867
The banquet is about to start!

132
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,028
Young Master went

133
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:33,067
to meet military officers
who knew nothing about golden dates.

134
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:44,067
Wait.

135
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:47,067
Zisheng is Ling Buyi.

136
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:49,667
Ling Buyi is Zisheng?

137
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,987
You don't even know
what Zisheng looks like.

138
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:56,067
Why did you brag that he admires you?

139
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,948
I was only trying to agitate Wang Ling.

140
00:08:58,348 --> 00:08:59,508
I didn't expect him to be there.

141
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,028
But why does General Ling seem

142
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:02,708
to know you very well?

143
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,828
Not at all.

144
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:06,547
Do you still remember
Granduncle being arrested?

145
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,148
When he was trying
to capture Granduncle,

146
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,148
I pointed him the way
through the curtain.

147
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,627
Who would have known that he repaid
my kindness with ingratitude?

148
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:14,388
He came to our residence

149
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,148
and told father a lot of things.

150
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:19,747
Do you know

151
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:22,747
Princess Yuchang likes Ling Buyi?

152
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:24,508
Do you know

153
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,987
about Princess Yuchang falling

154
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:26,747
into the water?

155
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:27,667
I know.

156
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,627
I went to join other spectators.

157
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,307
But I noticed Princess Yuchang

158
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,867
was pretending to drown
in shallow water

159
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,388
and let her evil servants stand
in the way.

160
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:37,427
So I kicked her servant into the water.

161
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:39,667
Who?

162
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,187
So her trick was exposed.

163
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:46,908
So you were behind that?

164
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,227
I heard

165
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,107
that Princess Yuchang tried
to lure Ling Buyi

166
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,828
by falling into the water.

167
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,028
I had no idea

168
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:56,627
you exposed her scheme with one kick.

169
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:58,468
When she returned home,

170
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:01,107
her eyes were red
like rotten peaches from crying.

171
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:03,148
Everyone in the capital looked
at her like a joke.

172
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,508
Qiqi,

173
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:09,307
this is a serious matter.

174
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,508
Don't ever tell anyone about this.

175
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,108
Don't let my mother know about this.

176
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:14,827
If she finds out, she'll skin me alive.

177
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:17,868
It's not a birthday banquet.

178
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:19,347
They obviously set up a trap for us.

179
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,148
It doesn't matter if we don't come.

180
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:22,908
I feel the same.

181
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:23,827
I hate mingling

182
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:26,427
with those pretentious aristocratic women.

183
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:28,988
I prefer those from the Cheng Family.

184
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,467
My father always talks about you.

185
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:33,628
You're completely different
from your mother,

186
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,388
who's rigid and conservative.
How tedious.

187
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,467
Do you and Mr. Wan

188
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,347
really think so?

189
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:42,268
Of course.

190
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,108
I do have

191
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,388
a feeling of regret

192
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:48,067
that I couldn't meet you earlier.

193
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:50,827
I think Qiqi has a good nature.

194
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:52,268
She's not what Song said

195
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:54,347
about trying to be the eldest
when she's the youngest.

196
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,028
Who tries to be the eldest?

197
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,148
I can't believe this Cheng Song.

198
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:00,827
He only knows how
to make up stories about me.

199
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,067
Where is he now?

200
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:08,427
I think Song is shooting arrows

201
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:09,707
with other young masters.

202
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:10,908
Come with me. I'm going to confront him.

203
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:12,067
Wait, Qiqi.

204
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:14,748
I won't be going.

205
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,908
You can go ahead first.
I'll look around.

206
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:18,148
Then you should be careful.

207
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:20,028
Those noble ladies appear weak.

208
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,028
But it's not easy to get along with them.

209
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,067
Yangyang, come with me, then.

210
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:24,868
Yangyang, come on.

211
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,947
This is upsetting.

212
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:29,268
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

213
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,508
I'm sorry, Song.

214
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,347
Slow down, Qiqi.

215
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:39,947
Prince Xiao, stop following me.

216
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,388
Zhaojun. Stop, Zhaojun.

217
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:42,268
Wait for me, Zhaojun.

218
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,667
Prince Xiao, stop it.

219
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,307
Zhaojun. Zhaojun.

220
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:46,947
Zhaojun.

221
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:47,788
Prince Xiao,

222
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,307
stop doing this.

223
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,067
What brings you

224
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,108
to Princess Yuchang's birthday banquet?

225
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:58,427
After spending time with you lately,

226
00:11:58,908 --> 00:11:59,988
I feel we get along very well.

227
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:01,947
I have the intention of asking
the He Family for your hand in marriage.

228
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:04,067
But you kept avoiding me.

229
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,988
Did I do anything wrong

230
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,067
that made you dislike me?

231
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:09,947
We had only known each other
for several days.

232
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,667
Don't you think it's too quick

233
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:13,908
to propose?

234
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,788
Besides,

235
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,467
I'm already betrothed.

236
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,028
Do you mean

237
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:22,628
the lad from the Lou Family?

238
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,307
Didn't you say

239
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:27,667
he's dull and speaks monotonously to you?

240
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:29,868
But if I break the betrothal,

241
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,748
Yao will be a laughingstock.

242
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:34,427
You are thoughtful of him.

243
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:36,587
Yet, he doesn't know how to cherish you.

244
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:38,268
He always upsets you.

245
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,108
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

246
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:59,268
Isn't that Fourth Lady Cheng?

247
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:08,228
Why are you

248
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,187
dressing up like an old dame today?

249
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,707
It doesn't concern you.

250
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:19,908
Even nanny doesn't wear
these colors.

251
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:21,427
It doesn't concern your nanny.

252
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:24,467
My teacher had received
Madam Sang's letter.

253
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,947
What does this have to do
with your teacher...

254
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,268
If you want to thank me, do it properly.

255
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:35,148
How can you say such infuriating words
when you see me?

256
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:39,228
Thank you, Miss.

257
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,868
My teacher was depressed
because he was troubled by this.

258
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,707
He feels so much better now.

259
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,707
I came especially to thank you.

260
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,228
What I said before still counts.

261
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,827
If you have any trouble in the future,

262
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,427
I'll lend you a hand.

263
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:54,547
All right.

264
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:56,427
I'll remember that.

265
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,028
But don't worry.

266
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,268
I won't ask you to rebel

267
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,947
or act in bad faith.

268
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:03,788
And I won't let you marry me.

269
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:05,748
Since it's settled,

270
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:07,067
we should bid farewell.

271
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:08,947
Who says I'm going to bid farewell?

272
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:10,187
You're really here.

273
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:21,427
Yao?

274
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,307
Yao.

275
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:30,748
Lou Yao.

276
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:32,427
Stop right there.
What are you planning to do?

277
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:35,228
I should be asking the same thing.

278
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:36,947
I've heard it loud and clear.

279
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:38,427
He plans to ask the He Family
for your hand.

280
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:39,587
Yes.

281
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,067
The Xiao Family has the intention.

282
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,667
But I haven't given my reply.

283
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:45,067
If you're willing to treat me better,

284
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,947
I'll ask father to turn them down.

285
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,988
After all, we were betrothed
since we were children.

286
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:52,067
I wouldn't want anyone to ridicule you.

287
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:54,748
You can just marry him.

288
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,028
I won't feel reluctant at all.

289
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,667
I tolerated you until this day

290
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,748
because the Lou Family honors
their promises.

291
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:00,707
Fine!

292
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,707
I don't care about it too.
We can just break it off.

293
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,508
I'll marry Prince Xiao as you wished.

294
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:06,347
He never upsets me the way you do.

295
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:07,467
He's considerate

296
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,307
and far much better than you!

297
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:10,667
Listen.

298
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:11,667
After we get married,

299
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:13,268
I'll move to Feng Yi County with him.

300
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,508
We'll travel to places
when we have time.

301
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,587
He had also built a villa in Shu.

302
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:20,388
He said he'll give it to me
in the future.

303
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,467
I don't know how happy I'd be with him.

304
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,667
Perhaps we may never see
each other again!

305
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:28,028
Fine, I'll take your word for it.

306
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:28,908
Fine!

307
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:32,347
Stop right there!

308
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:33,868
What are you looking at?

309
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,467
I'll gouge your eyes out!

310
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:40,388
Miss, I apologize on her behalf.

311
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:41,467
Don't take it to heart.

312
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,148
I'm not the only one here...

313
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:56,467
Yuan Shanjian,

314
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,628
you're a scum.

315
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,868
Why didn't you drag me along
when you went and hid?

316
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:02,908
People of the opposite gender
shouldn't be intimate.

317
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:06,187
Moreover,

318
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,947
didn't you bid farewell just now?

319
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,148
I want you to know

320
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:14,908
that this matter

321
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:16,908
doesn't end here.

322
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:20,908
Do you know who those two are?

323
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:22,388
That young man is Lou Yao,

324
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,067
the youngest son of the second chamber
of the Lou Family from Hedong.

325
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,108
The young lady is He Zhaojun,

326
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:30,268
the daughter of Cavalry General He Yong.

327
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,467
They were betrothed
since they were children.

328
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:32,587
I don't want to know.

329
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,427
This doesn't concern me.

330
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:37,988
You're not a child anymore.

331
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:39,748
Not only do you have to study,

332
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:41,067
but you must also study
the ancestry of the aristocratic family

333
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:42,547
and sacrificial rites.

334
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:44,667
You should start studying these
as soon as possible.

335
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,667
I don't think you're good at anything
other than quarreling.

336
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,268
Does your mother have no plans for you?

337
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,868
Is it because she just returned
to the capital

338
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:52,748
that she didn't have time
to find a female teacher

339
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:53,667
for you and your sister?

340
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,028
I can recommend one or two teachers.

341
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:56,467
Go away.

342
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,108
If the Xiao and He Family
become in-laws.

343
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:08,067
Many people will get involved
in this case.

344
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:09,628
We must solve

345
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:12,028
this case quickly.

346
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,388
Find out

347
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:14,947
if any officials from Shu came
to the capital

348
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,988
in the past six months.

349
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:20,628
Are you suspecting
Prince Xiao is colluding with the Shu?

350
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,187
Previous batches of armaments
were transported to Shu.

351
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:26,307
Shu has surrendered for many years,
and there are no battles.

352
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,388
Why are they buying
so many military weapons?

353
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:30,307
I'm afraid Shu has second thoughts.

354
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:32,388
We must prepare

355
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,628
in advance.

356
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:38,707
Yuan Shen

357
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:41,748
isn't normal.

358
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,067
It's Cheng Yang's handkerchief.

359
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,028
(Help! Help!)

360
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,347
(Third Lady Cheng has fallen
into the water!)

361
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:05,108
(Help!)

362
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,467
(Third Lady Cheng has fallen
into the water!)

363
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:12,028
Help!

364
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:15,307
Help!

365
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:16,148
Cheng Yang!

366
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:16,908
Help!

367
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:19,988
Help!

368
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:25,307
Help!

369
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,108
Niaoniao!

370
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:35,307
Cheng Yang, come to me.

371
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:36,307
Cheng Yang.

372
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:38,547
Careful.

373
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:47,907
How did you fall into the water?

374
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,748
I knew you did this.

375
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:57,587
Only both of you would resort

376
00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,547
to such lowly tricks.

377
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:00,387
Niaoniao,

378
00:19:00,428 --> 00:19:01,508
don't be upset.

379
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:02,748
Lest you'll disgrace the family.

380
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:04,827
Disgrace?

381
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,307
Not only did you ruin
Her Highness's plan,

382
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:08,988
you deliberately seduced Zisheng.

383
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,067
No one in this world

384
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,748
would stoop lower than you.

385
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:16,827
Well, it's not surprising.

386
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:20,627
Your parents abandoned you
when you were a child.

387
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,708
Your Second Aunt never raised you well.

388
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,907
What do you know of frankness

389
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:26,468
or etiquette?

390
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,948
Such sinister and immoral conduct

391
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,988
can only be committed

392
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:37,468
by a vulgar, illiterate
who has no parents like you!

393
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:45,468
Cheng Shaoshang!

394
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:50,147
I'm going to beat you to death!

395
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:54,188
How dare you bully Cheng Yang?

396
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:55,347
Stop it!

397
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:56,948
This is for bullying Cheng Yang.

398
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:58,468
How dare you bully Cheng Yang!

399
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,268
Stop it!

400
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,508
Why you Cheng Shaoshang!

401
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:05,107
I'm going to beat you to death!

402
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:05,867
Stop fighting!

403
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:08,468
Stop it right now!

404
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,067
How dare you pinch me?

405
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:09,827
I'm going to pinch you!

406
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:12,587
Help! Let me go!

407
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,147
Cheng Shaoshang,

408
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:22,867
are you mad? How dare you hit me?

409
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:24,827
You vile savage!

410
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:26,307
Fight?

411
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:28,228
They actually had a fight.

412
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,147
This Fourth Lady Cheng

413
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:33,067
sure is

414
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:35,627
unexpected.

415
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,748
It hurts.

416
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:44,948
Look at your pitiful state.

417
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,948
Why did you have to resort to violence
because of a disagreement?

418
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:51,508
Whose unruly daughter is this?

419
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:57,468
Young Lady Wang is
our distinguished guest.

420
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,708
How could

421
00:20:58,788 --> 00:20:59,200
a lady like you cause injury to others?

422
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,508
(Princess Consort Ruyang)
a lady like you cause injury to others?

423
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:00,720
(Princess Consort Ruyang)

424
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,188
They obviously hit her too.

425
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:04,468
You can't say Shaoshang was
the only one hitting them.

426
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:06,387
Your Highness, calm down.

427
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:07,907
Everyone is at fault

428
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,508
in this matter.

429
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,107
But no matter how upset we feel,

430
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:12,508
we must send for a physician

431
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:14,468
to check on the Young Lady
of the Wang Family.

432
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:16,347
It'll be too late to treat

433
00:21:16,468 --> 00:21:17,508
if there's any disfigurement.

434
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:19,708
Shaoshang suffers such serious injuries.

435
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,708
Young Lady Wang,

436
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:21,907
how hard did you hit her?

437
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:22,867
You...

438
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:27,347
I didn't hit her that hard.

439
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:30,188
She started it first.

440
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:32,428
She's a lunatic!

441
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:33,307
Do you have any evidence?

442
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:34,228
I...

443
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,028
Yes,

444
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:37,708
I started it first.

445
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:56,147
When I passed by the garden,

446
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:57,547
I noticed

447
00:21:57,988 --> 00:22:00,307
Cheng Yang who can't swim
was pushed into the lake.

448
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,508
They did that to lure me

449
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,788
and harm me.

450
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:06,988
They even called me

451
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:08,428
vulgar and illiterate,

452
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:10,627
who have no parents to teach me.

453
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,188
Even if I have no parents to teach me,

454
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:14,547
I'd never do anything

455
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:16,428
that disregards human life.

456
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:18,788
In that case,

457
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:19,907
today's incident is caused

458
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,668
by parents like us

459
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:24,147
who failed to teach our daughters well.

460
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,988
Ling always has a sharp tongue
but a soft heart.

461
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:29,547
She normally offends a lot of people.

462
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,708
Even if she said something wrong...

463
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,028
She didn't say anything wrong.

464
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:38,547
Everything she said is

465
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:39,948
the truth.

466
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:41,347
I can't refute

467
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:42,827
this matter.

468
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:44,627
But she tried to harm my family

469
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,147
by pushing Cheng Yang into the water.

470
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:47,587
I can't forgive her for this.

471
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:50,147
You shouldn't hurt others by picking on
their shortcomings in a fight.

472
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:51,188
Do you think

473
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:52,147
Shaoshang doesn't read well
or behave properly

474
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,708
because she's lazy or foolish?

475
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,788
You knew you were right
but insisted on rubbing on her wounds.

476
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,147
Is this the upbringing
of an aristocratic family?

477
00:22:59,028 --> 00:22:59,827
Today,

478
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:01,827
they even ridiculed the descendants
of the military families

479
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:02,748
for lacking knowledge.

480
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:04,668
But didn't they push Cheng Yang
into the water

481
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:06,307
despite her well-upbringing?

482
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,067
Yangyang, tell us. Did they...

483
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:11,587
Yangyang,

484
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:12,867
can you speak yet?

485
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,228
Cheng Yang can't say a word.

486
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,067
See how pitiful Yangyang is.

487
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:21,827
So what?

488
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:24,188
The ladies are just playing around.

489
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:26,627
How can you resort to violence
because of a disagreement?

490
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,748
If Madam Wen Xiu pursues this matter,

491
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,067
can all of you bear the punishment?

492
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,228
That's right.

493
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,228
It's only a group
of ladies playing around.

494
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:36,387
But one mustn't hurt innocent lives.

495
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:38,188
If Your Highness wants
to resort to punishment,

496
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,228
you must punish both of them.

497
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,387
The person who started
the fight should be punished.

498
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:46,948
It was Young Lady Wang
who pushed Cheng Yang into the water.

499
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,107
They even tried to make me fall
into the lake

500
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,587
by tripping me
with a horse-tripping rope.

501
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:52,307
That's slander.

502
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,508
You can't accuse without any evidence.

503
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:57,268
General Ling has arrived!

504
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:12,668
Niaoniao.

505
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:28,107
Ladies,

506
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:32,228
my bodyguard

507
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:35,428
found this horse tripping rope
in the garden.

508
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,587
(Prince)

509
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:37,880
There's also a family emblem

510
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:39,627
at the end of the rope.

511
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,708
If Your Highness wishes
to learn to investigate cases,

512
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,067
you'll need evidence.

513
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:49,067
And this is

514
00:24:52,147 --> 00:24:53,228
the evidence.

515
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,107
Zisheng, you're interesting.

516
00:25:00,587 --> 00:25:03,307
Why did you pick up
a pile of rotten ropes?

517
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:05,028
I said it's a horse tripping rope.

518
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:08,708
If Marchioness Chengyang
doesn't believe me,

519
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,587
you can inspect Young Lady
of the Lou Family's hand.

520
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:16,268
Not only her scheme had failed,

521
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:18,387
but the horse tripping rope
caused abrasion to her hand.

522
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:22,307
It's

523
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:24,188
a stupid move.

524
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,468
Zisheng, that's harsh.

525
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:37,107
It's a family matter.

526
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:38,468
This matter concerns a person's life.

527
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:40,188
If Your Highness can't try this,

528
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:42,307
I can personally try this case

529
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:44,708
at the Ministry of Justice tomorrow.

530
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,028
Excuse me.

531
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:22,307
I've already said

532
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:24,907
that it's only
a group of ladies playing around.

533
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:27,147
Is it worth it for elders like us

534
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:28,907
to blow it out of proportion?

535
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:31,067
Even the Ministry of Justice
is brought up.

536
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:34,867
I think we should let this matter rest.

537
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:37,867
Yes.

538
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,307
Young Lady Wang's mother, Madam Wen Xiu,

539
00:26:40,387 --> 00:26:41,428
isn't here today.

540
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:43,067
So naturally,
we'll let this matter rest.

541
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:44,147
Otherwise,

542
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,988
it wouldn't settle this easily.

543
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:48,107
What do you say, First Madam Cheng?

544
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:59,347
It hurts!

545
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,067
Niaoniao!

546
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:05,268
Niaoniao!

547
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:07,547
Niaoniao!

548
00:27:09,387 --> 00:27:10,147
Niaoniao!

549
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,307
Niaoniao!

550
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:19,347
It hurts.

551
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:20,387
Over here.

552
00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:23,668
I can't believe that Young Lady Wang.

553
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,867
You brought gifts
for a birthday celebration.

554
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:27,988
I can't believe
they beat you up like this.

555
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,547
They're too arrogant.

556
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:33,428
No, they didn't do this to me.

557
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:37,107
If only you could see

558
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:38,708
what I did to Young Lady Wang.

559
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,307
That's what I call tragic.

560
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:41,988
Don't worry.

561
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:44,067
I did this to myself.
I know when to hold back.

562
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:46,748
You did this to yourself?

563
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:49,347
Young Lady,

564
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:51,668
look into the mirror.

565
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:54,587
How can you say you held back
when you're in this state?

566
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:06,748
You don't say.

567
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:09,547
The bruises look symmetrical.

568
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:14,307
Lianfang, don't worry.

569
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:15,988
It may look swollen now.

570
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:17,708
It'll reside after two days.

571
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,468
But it's different for Wang Ling.

572
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:23,587
I pinched her waist

573
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:25,668
with this miracle technique of mine.

574
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:28,627
I assure you she can't get up from bed

575
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:29,988
and couldn't sleep every night.

576
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:36,587
Young Lady,

577
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:39,028
Madam asked you to head
to Jiuzhui Hall for questioning.

578
00:28:44,668 --> 00:28:45,387
Lianfang,

579
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:47,028
tell my brothers

580
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:48,627
to go to Jiuzhui Hall

581
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:49,547
to rescue me.

582
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,347
Yes, Young Lady.

583
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:51,107
Wait.

584
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:53,988
Open your eyes.

585
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:57,387
Wider.

586
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:01,827
Any tears?

587
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,147
That's it. Maintain it.

588
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,228
Tell them I won't survive long.

589
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:12,147
Go.

590
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:15,547
Keep it that way.

591
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:45,508
Father.

592
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:47,827
Mother.

593
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,067
Didn't you say it was just
a small fight?

594
00:29:57,988 --> 00:29:58,988
How dare that lass

595
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:00,867
beat you to this state?

596
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:03,988
Child,

597
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,067
does it hurt?

598
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:06,867
Can you see me?

599
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:08,748
Father, don't worry.

600
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:10,508
I'm all right.

601
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:12,668
Greetings, Father.

602
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:13,748
It's all right.

603
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:17,268
Greetings, Mother.

604
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,188
Over here.

605
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:21,668
Greetings, Mother.

606
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:24,387
Enough.

607
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:27,067
Niaoniao is not the only one who's hurt.

608
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:28,587
General,

609
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,508
don't just be concerned
about your own child.

610
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:33,668
Are you saying other ladies

611
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:35,028
were beaten in this state too?

612
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:35,907
Fine.

613
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:37,347
They were hit somewhere else.

614
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,188
When young girls fight,

615
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:43,708
they can't inflict serious injuries
because they're delicate.

616
00:30:44,188 --> 00:30:46,547
They can break a rib
or break a hand or leg.

617
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:48,307
The face is most important here.

618
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,188
Niaoniao has not been betrothed yet.

619
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:52,668
If she's disfigured,

620
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:53,788
I'm not going to settle with them!

621
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:56,668
Shaoshang,

622
00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:58,508
answer me this.

623
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:00,827
Do you know what you did wrong today?

624
00:31:01,387 --> 00:31:03,347
Why are you reprimanding her
when she was beaten like this?

625
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:04,387
I'm sorry.

626
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:08,547
All right.

627
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:10,748
Tell me what you did wrong.

628
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,028
From now on,

629
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:18,587
I'll never start a fight

630
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,028
no matter

631
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:21,708
who bullies Cheng Yang,

632
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:23,748
deliberately humiliates me,

633
00:31:24,587 --> 00:31:26,228
or slanders the Cheng Family.

634
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:29,188
Father. Mother.

635
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:32,347
Even if

636
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,067
anyone wants to kill me,

637
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:38,147
I'll never hurt other people
in the future.

638
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:41,468
Niaoniao.

639
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:42,428
Niaoniao.

640
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:44,508
Don't you act defiantly out of spite.

641
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:46,387
Don't you have elders in the household?

642
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:48,188
If you're reasonable,

643
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:49,907
why didn't you talk to the elders

644
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:51,627
but started a fight instead?

645
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,788
I don't care if you're apologetic.

646
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:55,948
Tomorrow,

647
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:57,867
you must go to General Wang's residence

648
00:31:58,387 --> 00:31:59,468
and apologize to Wang Ling.

649
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:00,188
I...

650
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:04,347
I can't go.

651
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,387
Wang Ling...

652
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,988
Wang Ling deserves to be hit.

653
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,468
That's bold of you.

654
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:20,347
I shall see

655
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:21,627
if you'll admit your mistakes today!

656
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:24,228
Guards!

657
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:28,587
- Mother!
- Mother, calm down!

658
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:29,748
What are you doing here?

659
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:30,988
What are you doing?

660
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:31,587
Mother,

661
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:32,668
Niaoniao has suffered
a lot of beatings today.

662
00:32:32,668 --> 00:32:33,948
You can't punish her anymore.

663
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:35,228
He's right. You mustn't hit her.

664
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:36,547
She's already in a pitiful state.

665
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:37,748
Niaoniao is so pitiful.

666
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:39,547
What are you doing?

667
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:40,668
Get off me!

668
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:41,827
Move aside!

669
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,307
Get out, all of you!

670
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:48,547
Look how

671
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,428
you've upset your mother.

672
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,827
Why are you still here? Leave!

673
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:54,387
Are you waiting to be punished?

674
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:55,508
Go! Get out!

675
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:57,067
Go now!

676
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:58,627
Leave now!

677
00:32:58,627 --> 00:32:59,347
You...

678
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:00,268
Go! Go! Go!

679
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,347
I didn't say she could leave.

680
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,867
I'm not done with her yet.

681
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:06,147
Didn't you tell everyone to leave?

682
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:08,508
So I told them to leave.

683
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:12,028
Why are you still here, then?

684
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:14,347
I dare not leave.

685
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:17,067
If I leave, I won't be able to return.

686
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:25,867
It's all right.

687
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:26,587
We're almost there.

688
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,428
You can put me down now.

689
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:29,948
There's no one behind us. I'm fine.

690
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:31,347
All right, we're here.

691
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:32,708
Stop. Stop. I feel dizzy.

692
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,587
You don't have to worry.

693
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:38,788
I'm fine.

694
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:40,547
I'm not hurt at all.

695
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:41,867
I'm all right.

696
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,748
If Shaogong and I were there,

697
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:46,347
you and Yangyang wouldn't suffer
this much.

698
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:48,107
Song, don't say that.

699
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:50,428
If you didn't come in time,

700
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:52,907
I'd have to suffer from beatings again.

701
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,147
As long as you're home,

702
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:56,547
you won't be able to escape
from this beating.

703
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,827
When mother wants to punish anyone,

704
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,228
she always succeeds.

705
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:02,827
Niaoniao,

706
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,387
what are you planning to do now?

707
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:06,827
How about you do what I always do?

708
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:08,788
Run.

709
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,067
This is indeed a good idea.

710
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,387
Every time Shaogong left the house

711
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:13,547
and came home after hiding for a while,

712
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,347
mother would consider
the circumstances of the situation

713
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,468
if she was no longer upset.

714
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:18,587
It doesn't work every time.

715
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:22,188
It may only work two out of ten times.

716
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,867
That's better than waiting hopelessly
for punishment.

717
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:29,107
How about you go back
and ask for forgiveness?

718
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:30,788
Are you asking me to get some beatings?

719
00:34:31,508 --> 00:34:32,627
I can never do such

720
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:34,228
a foolish thing in my life.

721
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:38,788
Niaoniao,

722
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:44,867
it's my fault.

723
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:47,228
If I wasn't careless,

724
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:48,948
I wouldn't fall into their trap

725
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:51,748
and wouldn't cause such a disaster.

726
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:53,468
Don't feel guilty about it.

727
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:55,307
Even if it's not for your sake,

728
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:56,228
I would find a chance

729
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,028
to teach them a lesson for my sake.

730
00:34:59,067 --> 00:34:59,948
Besides,

731
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:02,067
you're someone who's well-behaved

732
00:35:02,508 --> 00:35:03,867
in mother's eyes.

733
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,307
Even if you caused trouble,
it was beyond your control.

734
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:08,668
It's not the same for me.

735
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:11,748
Even if I caused trouble
by saving someone,

736
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:13,867
that's also intentional to her.

737
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,708
I've already decided.

738
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:18,708
Song's idea is good.

739
00:35:18,948 --> 00:35:19,988
I'll run away now.

740
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:21,867
I won't cause trouble

741
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:23,907
for Mother again.

742
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:24,948
If you're leaving,

743
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:25,907
I'll go with you.

744
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:27,988
He's right.
If you want to go, we'll go together.

745
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:29,387
Please don't.

746
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:31,907
If you leave with me,

747
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:35,788
the three of us will be punished.

748
00:35:37,147 --> 00:35:38,347
It's better I go alone.

749
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:42,867
Brothers.

750
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:45,307
Cheng Yang,

751
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,108
I'm leaving.

752
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:50,068
I'll go with you, Young Lady.

753
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,228
This is...

754
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,920
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

755
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:11,748
Young Lady,

756
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:13,748
you're not wearing enough clothing.

757
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,628
How about you go back
and apologize to Madam?

758
00:36:16,947 --> 00:36:18,507
It's better than freezing
to death out here.

759
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:19,387
It's also

760
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:20,907
my first time...

761
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:22,188
It's my first time running away
from home.

762
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:23,548
I didn't know

763
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:25,467
it was so windy out here.

764
00:36:26,347 --> 00:36:27,307
I'm still inexperienced.

765
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,548
I should have brought my fur coat!

766
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,588
Next time...

767
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,668
Next time, I'll be well prepared.

768
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:35,867
Are you going to do this again?

769
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:52,748
Dear.

770
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:54,907
Dear, let me give you a rub.

771
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:00,588
This...

772
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:05,108
All of you only care about Niaoniao.

773
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:06,668
Each of you tried to stop me
from punishing her.

774
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:08,628
Would I harm her?

775
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:11,068
Now you're trying
to get on my good side.

776
00:37:13,228 --> 00:37:14,588
Niaoniao is a girl.

777
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,068
You can't hit her like you do a boy.

778
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,027
You used to say a girl
and boy are different.

779
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:22,867
A boy should cause trouble

780
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:25,068
while a girl should marry.

781
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:26,907
In that case,

782
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,907
the punishment shouldn't be the same.

783
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:32,307
Are you saying these

784
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:34,788
to clear Niaoniao's wrongdoings
for the rest of her life?

785
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:37,268
I think

786
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:39,148
Niaoniao did the right thing today.

787
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,748
It was the Wang Family's daughter

788
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,148
who played with people's lives.

789
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,628
Do you think I don't know that?

790
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,347
I was upset

791
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:47,588
that Niaoniao didn't consider

792
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:49,027
where we were at the moment.

793
00:37:49,427 --> 00:37:51,427
That's Lord Ruyang's Mansion.

794
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,548
Lord Ruyang is His Majesty's uncle.

795
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:56,387
Lady Ruyang is known
to be unreasonable.

796
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:58,108
His Majesty still has qualms

797
00:37:58,307 --> 00:37:59,588
and feels restrained

798
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:00,827
when meeting this couple.

799
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:02,748
Can't she just bear with it

800
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,307
and cause no trouble
for the Cheng Family?

801
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,427
How can she tolerate it?

802
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:07,228
They already pushed Yangyang
into the water.

803
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:10,668
You only see Niaoniao's shortcomings.

804
00:38:10,827 --> 00:38:13,987
She's willing to protect Cheng Yang

805
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:15,628
from being bullied at a critical time.

806
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:18,708
If Niaoniao pretended not
to witness that,

807
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:20,347
that would be heartless.

808
00:38:21,347 --> 00:38:23,867
The Cheng Family has always cared
about family relations.

809
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:27,668
I can see that brat possesses
as this character.

810
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:28,668
But she...

811
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:30,668
But she shouldn't have started the fight

812
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:31,788
and let others use it against her.

813
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:32,748
All right.

814
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:35,068
Niaoniao has promised me

815
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,947
she won't fight with others anymore.

816
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:39,628
I never knew

817
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:42,148
I'd be worried

818
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,708
about my daughter getting into fights
in my life.

819
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:48,068
Fortunately,
General Ling handled this justly.

820
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:50,668
He came in time with evidence
to get us out of trouble.

821
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,188
Otherwise, I wouldn't know

822
00:38:52,588 --> 00:38:53,987
how this matter would end up.

823
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:55,027
General Ling?

824
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:57,268
Do you mean Ling Buyi?

825
00:38:57,947 --> 00:38:58,867
He was there too?

826
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,148
Where is Niaoniao?

827
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,467
I can't hear anything from her room.

828
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:12,788
I heard she left the house
with Lianfang to hide.

829
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:15,947
She can't do that.

830
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,268
It's very cold outside.

831
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:19,427
She's going to freeze.

832
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:24,148
I guess you're worried about Niaoniao.

833
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:27,507
I'm not worried about her.

834
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:28,708
She deserves to freeze out there.

835
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:29,987
Better yet, freeze her hand

836
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:31,867
so she can't hit anyone.

837
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:36,387
What were you thinking?

838
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:37,867
Why are you not properly dressed?

839
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:41,307
Is First Madam not willing
to give you any clothes?

840
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:43,228
If you want to live,

841
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:44,268
get in the carriage.

842
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:45,788
Young Lady,

843
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:48,148
we must not get on
another man's carriage.

844
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:51,027
It's in the middle of the night,
he may have bad intentions.

845
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,387
He doesn't have bad intentions.

846
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:54,427
He... He's too sick
to think of anything.

847
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:57,588
Come on. Let's go.

848
00:39:57,748 --> 00:39:58,268
Hurry.

849
00:39:58,347 --> 00:39:59,427
Young Lady.

850
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:18,467
Your bitter tricks

851
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,507
seemed to be pretty self-defeating.

852
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:23,108
What do you mean by "bitter tricks?"

853
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:24,668
Mr. Yuan,

854
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:26,548
you can't accuse someone
without basis.

855
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:28,867
You don't have to pretend
in front of me.

856
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:34,027
I heard

857
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:35,507
Wang Ling didn't even attend
Princess Yuchang's

858
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:36,588
birthday banquet tonight.

859
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,788
It shows she didn't suffer
a light injury.

860
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:40,588
Help! Let me go!

861
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:41,907
But

862
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:43,548
you didn't have to hurt yourself

863
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:45,867
to go up against her.

864
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:48,507
So what?

865
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:50,827
I'm not scared of her anyway.

866
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,947
Worse comes to worst, I can just decline

867
00:40:53,307 --> 00:40:54,548
all aristocratic family invitations.

868
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:00,668
My mother planned to invite you...

869
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:06,347
To invite all ladies of other families
to enjoy viewing plum blossom.

870
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:09,628
View plum blossom?

871
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,268
Could it be that you see me
as a prospect?

872
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,588
This concerns one's marriage.

873
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:27,387
As a young lady,

874
00:41:27,387 --> 00:41:28,548
can't you pretend to look shy?

875
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,668
Why would I feel shy
when I don't want to marry you?

876
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:32,708
Even if you wanted to,
I must be willing to marry you too.

877
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:35,708
My future bride will be the wife
of the Yuan Family's eldest son.

878
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,548
Of course,
she must be dignified, virtuous,

879
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:38,947
and compassionate to the weak and old.

880
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:42,068
Not to mention, handling rituals,
guests, and leading daughters-in-laws.

881
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:43,387
She mustn't be someone like you

882
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:45,907
who resort to violence
because of a disagreement.

883
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:53,588
Thank you for helping me.

884
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:56,148
You can take your time picking
your new bride.

885
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,628
Take your time.

886
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,108
We'll take our leave.

887
00:41:59,108 --> 00:41:59,907
Wait.

888
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:07,987
This Ziyu Ointment we rarely use
at home.

889
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:10,507
No need to thank me.

890
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:12,347
I just think your injury

891
00:42:12,788 --> 00:42:13,827
is unsightly.

892
00:42:22,827 --> 00:42:24,548
Would this disfigure me?

893
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:28,827
Do you think I need

894
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:30,827
to disfigure someone who looks like you?

895
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:33,228
You should go home now.

896
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:34,867
Stop hanging around in my carriage.

897
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:36,148
It's very cold outside.

898
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:37,867
With this look of yours,

899
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:39,947
don't come out and scare other people.

900
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:00,148
Young Lady.

901
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:14,788
- Brothers?
- Luckily, you didn't wander far off.

902
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:17,548
Whose carriage is that?

903
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:18,907
Father wants you to come home.

904
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:20,108
He says Mother agreed

905
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,148
to punish you to write.

906
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,108
She won't pursue the rest.

907
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:22,788
Write?

908
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,228
I'd rather she beat me.

909
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:26,548
I know where to go now.

910
00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:28,307
I'll ask Qiqi for help.

911
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:29,268
I'll go to Wan's Residence.

912
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:30,228
Brothers,

913
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:32,068
come and pick me up

914
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,387
after Mother is no longer angry.

915
00:43:34,188 --> 00:43:34,987
Lianfang,

916
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:36,228
go back with them.

917
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:37,987
I'll go now.

918
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,867
I wonder what brings you

919
00:43:52,907 --> 00:43:55,748
to my residence?

920
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:58,148
Do you really not know

921
00:43:58,588 --> 00:44:01,188
why I came here today?

922
00:44:03,628 --> 00:44:04,548
I think...

923
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,827
I think you learned

924
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:10,668
that I like collecting treasures.

925
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:12,307
So you're here to appreciate them.

926
00:44:13,188 --> 00:44:14,188
Well, that's easy.

927
00:44:14,628 --> 00:44:16,068
General Ling,

928
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:18,867
you can pick any treasure you like

929
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:20,068
from my collection.

930
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:21,507
The map of Shu.

931
00:44:22,347 --> 00:44:23,947
I wonder if you're willing
to give it to me.

932
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:27,148
What map?

933
00:44:29,307 --> 00:44:30,507
Erotic paintings?

934
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:32,148
I had no idea that you're...

935
00:44:32,148 --> 00:44:33,748
I said, the map of Shu.

936
00:44:38,027 --> 00:44:40,507
The map of Shu.

937
00:44:40,907 --> 00:44:44,268
If you're here for this map,

938
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,068
there's nothing to be discussed anymore.

939
00:44:46,548 --> 00:44:48,628
My first battle was in Shu.

940
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:52,548
If I had such a precious map,
I'd have presented it to His Majesty.

941
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:55,588
Is there a need for you to come
and inspect it if I had it?

942
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,907
Are you certain you don't have it?

943
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:57,987
Yes.

944
00:44:58,108 --> 00:44:59,307
Are you not handing it over to me?

945
00:45:00,387 --> 00:45:01,268
General Ling,

946
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:02,788
how can I hand it over to you

947
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:04,867
if I don't have it?
