=Episode 35=

3
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,410
You could say Ling Buyi
and Lady Cheng's betrothal was

4
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,451
barely a happy event.

5
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,290
Lord Ruyang

6
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,930
seems to be rejoicing.

7
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:04,651
What do you mean by barely?

8
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,171
Yuan Shanjian,

9
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,531
how obnoxious can you be?

10
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,290
Every time you're betrothed,

11
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,651
there's bound to be trouble.

12
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,931
Do you still find it a joyous occasion?

13
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,971
Tell me.

14
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,290
Do you regret leading on Ling Buyi?

15
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,450
Not at all.

16
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:23,931
It's none of your business either.

17
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:27,251
Ungrateful kid.

18
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,890
I was your teacher.

19
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,811
Is it wrong for me to be concerned?

20
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,410
Every time you're betrothed,
it brings trouble each time.

21
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:36,091
It shows the husband you choose is
inferior to the other.

22
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:39,051
Yuan Shanjian,

23
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,491
it's hard for me to figure out
what you're trying to say.

24
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,971
Don't tell me

25
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,091
you're jealous of me.

26
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,010
That's absurd.

27
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,371
There's nothing

28
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,410
about you that worth
for me to be jealous of.

29
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,371
It was because my luck is improving.

30
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,730
My previous betrothal may not work.

31
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,570
But I was betrothed again right after.

32
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,211
Unlike you, Mr. Yuan.

33
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:02,890
You're almost the same age as Zisheng.

34
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,850
But you still haven't found a fiancee.

35
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,170
Many young ladies
from aristocratic families

36
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:11,051
are attending my betrothal banquet.

37
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:11,931
How

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,371
about I find a match for you?

39
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,130
I guess when people get married,

40
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:20,170
they can't help
but make everyone get married too.

41
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,410
How vulgar.

42
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,450
What's his problem?

43
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,971
I, Wan Songbai greet Your Majesty.

44
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,531
General Wan, please rise
and take your seat.

45
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:46,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,730
I didn't expect

47
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,051
you'd return with a victory
this quickly.

48
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:53,010
I feel

49
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:54,931
so relieved.

50
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:56,331
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,010
those thieves aren't
even worth mentioning.

52
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01,771
I didn't have to use a lot of effort

53
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:03,690
to wipe them all out

54
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,651
and rescue General Wang.

55
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,170
He's now in my encampment.

56
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,091
Wang Long said

57
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,251
he left his post

58
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,130
because he received a military order
from his father, Wang Chun.

59
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,131
Your Majesty,

60
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,691
Wang Chun and his son had defied
the military order.

61
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:24,691
They should be punished severely.

62
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,290
Father,

63
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:31,651
this matter is suspicious.

64
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,091
We still need
to investigate this matter.

65
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,050
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,730
you can let the Ministry of Justice
investigate this.

67
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:39,131
I may be old now.

68
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,370
But I've recruited new talent.

69
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,771
Shanjian,

70
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,971
introduce yourself to His Majesty.

71
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,211
Attendant Gentleman
of the Ministry of Justice, Yuan Shen

72
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,531
greets His Majesty.

73
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:03,050
I remember you.

74
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,971
You're Huangfu Yi's last disciple.

75
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:07,891
When he was in office,

76
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:10,850
he recommended you to me once.

77
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,050
He said

78
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,011
you're the prodigy of the generation.

79
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:16,170
I don't deserve such a compliment.

80
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,451
I shall not deserve any merits
for my incompetence.

81
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,370
Hence, I'm willing
to serve Your Majesty.

82
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,211
Good.

83
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,571
Then Wang Long's case...

84
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,451
Your Majesty,

85
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,610
I started investigating
both father and son

86
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,131
after Wang Long was captured.

87
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,290
When General Wan returned
with a victory last night,

88
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:36,131
I inspected Wang Long's letter
that very night.

89
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,370
We found

90
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,610
that the military order came

91
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,170
from Wang Chun's wife, Madam Wen Xiu

92
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,730
who imitated Wang Chun's handwriting.

93
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,930
Even the seal was also forged.

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,930
All this was

95
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,011
because Madam Wen Xiu was
in urgent need of money

96
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,691
to support Junior Lord Qian'an
who's in Shouchun.

97
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,930
Only then did Wang Long take the risk.

98
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,370
This is the piece of evidence.

99
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,771
Please inspect it, Your Majesty.

100
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,891
Outrageous!

101
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,091
Madam Wen Xiu actually instigated

102
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,850
Junior Lord Qian'an to mint coins
without permission.

103
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,290
I

104
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,891
only grounded her as punishment

105
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,971
for the sake of Lord Qian'an's
accomplishment.

106
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,050
But she caused

107
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,250
so many troubles.

108
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:44,571
Fine.

109
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,651
Since she wants to die,

110
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,810
I

111
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,410
shall fulfill her wish.

112
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,850
Pass down my decree.

113
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,451
From now on,

114
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:53,930
imprison Madam Wen Xiu,

115
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,531
strip off her titles

116
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,211
and grant her death.

117
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,131
Your Majesty,

118
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,850
Madam Wen Xiu is after all
a narrow-minded woman

119
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,250
who knows nothing of military interest.

120
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,410
But Wang Chun allowed

121
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,891
his wife and children
to behave foolishly.

122
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:09,091
Thus, his action shows...

123
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,490
He's not fit to hold
any positions in court.

124
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:18,370
Zisheng,

125
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,091
it was a momentary oversight
from General Wang's side.

126
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,370
How can he lead the army
if he can't manage his household?

127
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:25,850
Even if he hides the army seal
under his pillow,

128
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:27,971
I suppose General Wang
will still lose it.

129
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,850
I wonder if someone
as muddle-headed as he

130
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,610
can protect the capital

131
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,610
and the country in the future?

132
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,250
That's right.

133
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,290
Low morality but wants a high status.

134
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,730
Not intelligent but wants to plan big.

135
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:44,011
People like these always end
with disaster.

136
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:50,810
Father,

137
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,370
I think

138
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,571
we should punish Wang Chun
and his son severely.

139
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,331
I've already given Wang Chun a chance.

140
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,410
But he never mends his ways.

141
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,050
His moral character is not worthy.

142
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,891
That means he can no longer be
the Cavalry General.

143
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:08,050
All right.

144
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,331
Pass down my decree.

145
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,891
From today on,

146
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,691
remove the Wang father and son
from their positions,

147
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,131
confiscate their properties,

148
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,490
and demote them as commoners.

149
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:23,370
Your Majesty,

150
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,331
Madam Wen Xiu acts recklessly
without fear

151
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:27,571
and Wang Chun
lets her behavior go unchecked.

152
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,850
If you ask me,

153
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,211
it's mostly due to someone's
poor supervision

154
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,331
when relatives are committing crimes.

155
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:47,130
Crown Prince,

156
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,811
do you have anything to say?

157
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:05,971
Father,

158
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,490
Wang Chun wasn't aware

159
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,610
of all these.

160
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,051
Madam Wen Xiu was only trying

161
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:11,971
to protect her younger brother...

162
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:12,890
That's enough.

163
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,331
There's nothing to discuss any further.

164
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,331
You're all dismissed.

165
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,010
Yes, Your Majesty!

166
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,060
(Chongde Hall)

167
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:31,971
General Wan,
you made another contribution.

168
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,250
It's worth celebrating.

169
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,411
Congratulations.

170
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,091
General Wan,

171
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:41,370
you're able to accomplish so much.

172
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,931
This time,

173
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,650
Madam Wen Xiu and her son's crimes are
announced to the world.

174
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,811
I guess the Xuan clan can feel

175
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:51,411
your loyalty and bravery.

176
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,650
Grand Tutor Lou,
I don't deserve such praise.

177
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,730
I'm merely a military general.

178
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,411
I'll only go wherever
His Majesty orders me to go.

179
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:01,291
The rest is none of my concern.

180
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:02,610
I'm just making a living.

181
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,411
Making a living.

182
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,091
The Crown Prince still keeps
his position.

183
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,451
Grand Tutor Lou,
you don't have to worry.

184
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,331
Unlike the Yue clan

185
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,890
who have to be dependent
on the whims of others.

186
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,211
It's such a hard life.

187
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,411
General Ling.

188
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,411
General Ling,

189
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,811
Lady Cheng asked me to deliver this,
especially for you.

190
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,171
While you were at the court assembly,

191
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,451
Lady Cheng has been watching the fire.

192
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,811
She said this bowl of soup
would be ready

193
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,610
by the time you're done
with the court assembly.

194
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,250
You can go now.

195
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,010
General Ling,

196
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,091
Lady Cheng sure

197
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,890
dotes on you.

198
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:43,530
It makes everyone envious of you.

199
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,211
Official Ji, let me take my leave.

200
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,411
Shanjian,

201
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,130
you're not young anymore.

202
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,931
Why aren't you married yet?

203
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:06,850
No matter what temperament a woman has,

204
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:07,890
one will get bored of it

205
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,130
after marriage.

206
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,490
I'm not interested in marrying.

207
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,691
Lady Wang,

208
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:26,130
I've told you so many times.

209
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,931
Her Majesty is not feeling well.

210
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:30,211
Are you trying to prevent
Her Majesty from getting proper rest

211
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,171
by making a scene
outside Changqiu Palace?

212
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,051
Lady Wang,

213
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,971
if I get the eunuchs to drag you out,

214
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:35,931
won't it be embarrassing?

215
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,530
You lowly servants used

216
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,811
to lower yourselves
before me in the past.

217
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,331
Seeing the downfall of my family,

218
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:42,691
you're all trampling on me!

219
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,730
What a bunch of opportunistic snobs!

220
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,331
Her Majesty is the head
of the imperial harem.

221
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,451
Changqiu Palace's servants don't need
to flatter anyone.

222
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,250
Even if the princes
and princesses are here,

223
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,490
they still show respect.

224
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:55,211
As the daughter of an official,

225
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,411
you're sure domineering.

226
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,171
Darn you, Cheng Shaoshang.

227
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:00,811
I knew you were a treacherous person.

228
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:02,211
Now that my family has fallen
into this state,

229
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,571
you can finally get what you wished for

230
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:05,451
and watch how I fall.

231
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,451
I will not leave.

232
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,971
I want to see Her Majesty!

233
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:10,171
Your Majesty!

234
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:11,770
Your Majesty, are you really going

235
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,370
to watch our family fall apart?

236
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,051
Aunt!

237
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,370
Aunt, help me!

238
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,411
Help me for the sake of being

239
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:20,811
my mother's close relatives!

240
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:22,250
Close relatives?

241
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,730
Madam Wen Xiu is only a cousin

242
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,890
from Her Majesty's maternal family.

243
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,370
Don't speak as if they're very closed.

244
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,130
Fifth Princess has arrived!

245
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,730
Wang Ling,

246
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,171
your mother caused a lot of mess.

247
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,171
She usually treats Mother
with disrespect.

248
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,411
You still have the cheek
to plead with Mother.

249
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:51,730
That's pretty shameless of you.

250
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,890
We always have close relationships

251
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,130
and I've waited upon you too.

252
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,091
How

253
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,490
about saving my family again?

254
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,691
I'm not as good-tempered as my mother.

255
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:03,650
You should leave now.

256
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,610
Or else I'll order the Director
of the Palace Domestic Service

257
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,730
to flog you to death under the crime
of causing havoc in the palace.

258
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,370
We shall see who'll speak up for you.

259
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:11,931
Fifth Princess,

260
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,691
no need to make a huge gesture
over a trifling matter.

261
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,530
I'll just scold Lady Wang away.

262
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,010
That's fine too.

263
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,691
I'll leave this matter to you.

264
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:22,971
I'll come back in a few days
to offer Mother's birthday gift.

265
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,850
Aunt!

266
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,291
Aunt, help!

267
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,411
If you don't want to die
from being flogged,

268
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,730
you better keep quiet now.

269
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,971
This is a grave matter
that involves too many people.

270
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,610
It's not something
that you and I can interfere with.

271
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:02,331
Your Majesty, Lady Cheng is here.

272
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:27,610
Lately,

273
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,051
you've been sending meals to Zisheng.

274
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,931
I reckon

275
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,411
your cooking has improved a lot.

276
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,211
That brat, Zisheng wasn't willing

277
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,130
to share with me.

278
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:42,211
Luckily, you're more sensible
than he is.

279
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,171
Your Majesty, what do you think?

280
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:54,331
This taste...

281
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,091
I haven't tasted it
for more than ten years.

282
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:01,530
At that time,

283
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,010
my uncle didn't have good teeth.

284
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,650
He loves eating tofu the most.

285
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,490
So I had a few tastes of it after that.

286
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,010
I especially learned
how to make this dish.

287
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,091
Speaking of tofu,

288
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,811
Shouchun's tofu is the best.

289
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,490
Your Majesty,

290
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,130
try this meat broth.

291
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,650
Why did you prepare

292
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,530
Shouchun dishes today?

293
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,091
Wang Ling sent
these ingredients to the palace.

294
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,091
I'm sure you also know

295
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,530
that her maternal grandfather's
family is from Shouchun.

296
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,250
So they naturally would prepare
these dishes.

297
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,610
Wang Ling will be married off
to Shouchun soon.

298
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:42,130
Of course, she'll get to eat
these dishes anytime.

299
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:44,051
But

300
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,051
if Madam Wen Xiu is no longer here,

301
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,051
it won't be easy for Her Majesty
to eat these

302
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,730
when she craves these.

303
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:51,971
That's why Wang Ling

304
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:54,331
specially taught me
how to cook these dishes.

305
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,811
She said if Her Majesty craves them,

306
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,211
I can prepare these dishes for her.

307
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,130
It can be considered as a way
to express her kind intention.

308
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:02,530
She's indeed a filial child.

309
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,971
It's just

310
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,211
that she has a muddle-headed mother.

311
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,051
In the past,

312
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,931
she was so mean to you.

313
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:16,331
Instead of implicating her more,

314
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,770
you went in circles to speak up for her.

315
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,411
I can't believe you see me

316
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,451
as someone petty.

317
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:32,530
I just want her to have
a better life in the future.

318
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,890
You have a kind heart too.

319
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:38,571
How about this?

320
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:41,770
I'll grant Wang Ling a handsome dowry.

321
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,451
Her marriage with Peng Kun

322
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,331
may be arranged by Madam Wen Xiu.

323
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,850
But Peng Kun

324
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,291
once saved Lord Qian'an's life

325
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,571
and took part in rescuing Gu City.

326
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,850
He's considered

327
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,171
to have made a great contribution
to my cause.

328
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,451
Now,

329
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,211
he's guarding Shouchun

330
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,291
and is considered a senior official.

331
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:05,530
He may not be in perfect health.

332
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,050
But she won't suffer as much

333
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,570
if she marries him.

334
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,250
I express my thanks to His Majesty

335
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,330
on behalf of Lady Wang and Her Majesty.

336
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:18,810
How is this matter related
to the Empress?

337
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,171
The Old Lord Qian'an

338
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,570
after all raised Her Majesty
for a while.

339
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,971
On normal days,

340
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:29,290
Madam Wen Xiu may be domineering

341
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,211
and disrespectful to Her Majesty.

342
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,290
But Her Majesty just endured her.

343
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,451
Her Majesty wasn't scared
of Madam Wen Xiu.

344
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,891
She sees her as an old friend.

345
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:40,211
But now

346
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,691
Madam Xiu Wen will die for her crime.

347
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,490
After Her Majesty heard of this,

348
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,891
she fell sick again.

349
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:49,730
I suppose she'll be sad for some time.

350
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:52,611
Zisheng

351
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,250
also told me the same thing.

352
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,730
The Old Lord Qian'an died

353
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,451
from trying to rescue Huo.

354
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,730
And Madam Wen Xiu and her brother are

355
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,851
his only direct descendants left

356
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:08,691
in this world.

357
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,851
Never mind.

358
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,810
She may have forged

359
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:19,371
a military order

360
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:20,891
which is punishable by death.

361
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:22,611
But luckily

362
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,290
there were no serious consequences.

363
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,490
I shall pardon her
from capital punishment.

364
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,570
Thank you Your Majesty
for sparing her life.

365
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,810
If Your Majesty tells
Her Majesty of this,

366
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,250
she'll definitely get better.

367
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:41,730
Let's go.

368
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:44,010
Follow me to see the Empress.

369
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:44,931
Yes, Your Majesty.

370
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,050
What are you doing here?

371
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,411
You have been close to your father

372
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,490
since you were young.

373
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,090
Are you here

374
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:35,810
to cry over my death?

375
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,211
You gave birth to me
after carrying me for ten months.

376
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,211
How could I not come and see you?

377
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,250
Besides,

378
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,411
I have something to ask you.

379
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,290
Did you know Uncle deceived you

380
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,371
and they were taking advantage of you?

381
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:56,931
Mobilizing troops arbitrarily

382
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,290
will have our property confiscated
and the whole family executed.

383
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,730
What do you mean by "they?"

384
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,290
They are

385
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:13,050
the descendants of the Qian'an Royalty.

386
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,211
Without the Qian'an Royalty,

387
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:20,171
you wouldn't have been born.

388
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:26,891
Mother.

389
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:30,530
I heard when Grandfather was alive,

390
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,530
Uncle always took you lightly

391
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,411
and treated you with disrespect.

392
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,371
Why do you have to destroy your life
because of him?

393
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,290
It's not just for your uncle.

394
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,530
It's

395
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,851
for the Qian'an Royalty's

396
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,891
reputation.

397
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:56,851
Someday,

398
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,931
you can also use Qian'an Royalty

399
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:04,010
as your support.

400
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,490
Forget about the so-called support.

401
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:07,931
Forget about Uncle.

402
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,250
Even if Grandfather is still alive,

403
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,770
you never get any benefit
from the Qian'an Family's glory.

404
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:14,611
Let alone a niece like me.

405
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:16,971
Can't you wake up?

406
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,451
Mother.

407
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,891
You unambitious evil thing.

408
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,691
Indeed,

409
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,490
you're stupid like your father.

410
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,490
All right.

411
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,570
Fine.

412
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:10,090
One more question.

413
00:22:11,971 --> 00:22:13,131
After all that had happened,

414
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,611
Father and Brother were implicated
in this matter.

415
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:21,851
Do you even care for us one bit?

416
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,730
For the Qian'an Royalty's great cause,

417
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:28,451
I

418
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:32,851
can't be worried about too many people.

419
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:17,770
Mother.

420
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,050
Do you know

421
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,891
Uncle wrote a letter to His Majesty

422
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,931
and puts all the blame on you?

423
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,050
He said he knew nothing of forging coins

424
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:40,171
and mobilizing any troops.

425
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,931
It was because his fief is poor

426
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,931
so he asked you for some money.

427
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,171
He only wanted his concubines
and children

428
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:50,290
to be well-off.

429
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:54,730
He said you did everything
on your accord.

430
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:58,010
Do you know

431
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,691
His Majesty planned to execute you?

432
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:04,490
But he changed his mind
because of Her Majesty

433
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:06,651
and decided to put you
under house arrest.

434
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,810
The person you've been cursing every day

435
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:12,451
ended up saving your life.

436
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,931
While the person you tried
so hard to protect

437
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:19,250
can't wait to see you die instantly.

438
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,131
Your uncle

439
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:50,891
is right.

440
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,131
There'll be hope

441
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,330
if one still lives.

442
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:00,290
He did it in the interest of everyone.

443
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,371
For the interest of everyone.

444
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,451
After I arrive in Shouchun,

445
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,050
I'll pray to heaven every day

446
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,171
to bless His Majesty and Her Majesty

447
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,010
with long life,

448
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:14,891
good health, and freedom from worries.

449
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,891
As for you,

450
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,050
you can protect your dream
that will never be realized

451
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,530
in this house for the rest of your life.

452
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,971
Mother,

453
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,810
you're finally all better now.

454
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,371
Father said he'll hold
a birthday banquet

455
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,691
for you on your birthday
to cheer you up.

456
00:25:58,171 --> 00:25:59,931
It's only been days
since I've recovered.

457
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,371
I still don't feel very well.

458
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,171
I don't wish to hold
the birthday banquet.

459
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:06,171
You don't have to do anything
about your birthday banquet.

460
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,530
If you let me take care
of the purchases,

461
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,770
my aides and I

462
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,411
can help share your burden of work.

463
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,131
Your father has said

464
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,971
to let Shaoshang take care
of the birthday banquet.

465
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,891
It hasn't been long since
Cheng Shaoshang came to the palace.

466
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,290
She had never attended
your birthday banquet before.

467
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:28,010
How is she supposed to know
how to organize it?

468
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,611
Mother,

469
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,570
please talk to Father about it.

470
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,691
I can definitely do better
than Cheng Shaoshang.

471
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,691
Are you sure you want
to share my burden?

472
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,570
You're clearly going to do
something that will worry me.

473
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,171
You'll be married
to Marquis Yue's son soon.

474
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:45,730
It's unreasonable for a princess
who's getting married

475
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:47,851
to manage the affairs
of the imperial harem.

476
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,691
Besides,

477
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:52,330
your father has been checking
the expenditures.

478
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,250
If you planned to embezzle money
from the imperial harem's expenditures,

479
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,371
you can stop thinking about it.

480
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:59,611
Mother, that's a harsh thing to say.

481
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,931
I have to manage
a huge princess's mansion.

482
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,490
How can I not find ways to make money?

483
00:27:03,851 --> 00:27:05,211
Your birthday banquet is
around the corner,

484
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:06,931
Father will definitely spend more on it.

485
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,250
If I help you manage it,

486
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,691
I can get some money from it.

487
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:10,851
What's wrong with that?

488
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:12,411
Are you doing this for the mansion

489
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,411
or to support your aides?

490
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,891
You'll be wedded off soon.

491
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,010
I suggest you

492
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,090
dismiss all those aides.

493
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,651
So as not to embarrass the Yue clan.

494
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,010
If it embarrasses them, don't take me in.

495
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,451
I don't even want
to marry into their family.

496
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:26,371
Besides,

497
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:27,611
the aides in my mansion are

498
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,050
all decent men.

499
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,570
They never fool around.

500
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:35,931
What's that smell?

501
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,770
Are you preparing food
for Zisheng again?

502
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:10,050
Lately,

503
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:12,611
you've been sending someone
to deliver food to Zisheng's carriage.

504
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,411
Many officials saw that.

505
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,290
Now everyone inside and outside
the palace is saying

506
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,810
that you're a virtuous person.

507
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:22,530
Is that true? Did they say I'm virtuous?

508
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,411
Just being virtuous to the fiance.

509
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,290
But not filial piety.

510
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,891
Are you saying we're not filial
to you, Your Majesty?

511
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,211
But we're toiling so hard

512
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,371
to make syrup for you.

513
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:36,250
The sweets in the palace are precious.

514
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,730
I came up with the idea

515
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,010
to make more sugar

516
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:42,211
so Your Majesty can have
sweet food every day.

517
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,250
So you'll be in a better mood every day.

518
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,250
Here, try this.

519
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:53,971
How is it?

520
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,770
It's really sweet.

521
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:59,371
It seems like

522
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:00,770
I can stop visiting

523
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,090
the Changqiu Palace every day.

524
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,691
There's someone

525
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:06,451
who knows how to please the Empress
better than I do.

526
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:07,490
Your Majesty.

527
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,770
I couldn't find you inside the palace.

528
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:14,490
It turns out you're with this lass here.

529
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,651
What are you up to this time?

530
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,290
Your Majesty,

531
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,211
if you mix this red bean dessert

532
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,050
with the syrup I made,

533
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,570
it tastes really good.

534
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:27,371
Your Majesty, try it.

535
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:38,090
The sweetness is

536
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,730
very different from that of the kitchen

537
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:40,851
in the palace.

538
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:41,490
That's right.

539
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,211
Do you know why it tastes different?

540
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:44,810
Because I asked someone

541
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,691
to buy sugarcane for me.

542
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:47,891
After I extracted the liquid,

543
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:50,451
I boiled it for a long time
until it became syrup.

544
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,651
This wooden liquid extractor

545
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:53,891
and this earthenware vessel
for boiling the sugarcane

546
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,971
were made one by one by the craftsmen

547
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:57,411
under my supervision.

548
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:01,250
Not bad.

549
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:04,490
It's too bad

550
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,371
that the country should not follow

551
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:08,691
this method of producing syrup.

552
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,250
Delicious food is

553
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:11,730
everyone's favorite.

554
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,250
But there are only so many human

555
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,211
and material resources in the world.

556
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,611
If this sweet food is

557
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,171
widely sought after
by rich and powerful families,

558
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:19,211
every family will start
growing sugarcane

559
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:21,411
instead of grains.

560
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,451
That would be a problem.

561
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:24,530
No denying that.

562
00:30:24,651 --> 00:30:26,371
Mother has always been thrifty.

563
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,530
Yet, someone always thinks
about being extravagant.

564
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:31,651
Your Majesty,

565
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,050
I understand what you mean.

566
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:35,090
A country's strength depends
on its amount of grains.

567
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,891
Of course, it needs to be used
in the right place.

568
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,131
Then do you know

569
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:39,891
where it should be used?

570
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:43,490
Food,

571
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:44,931
ironware,

572
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:46,490
and horses.

573
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:49,050
Not bad.

574
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:49,971
Your Majesty,

575
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,891
I never taught her these.

576
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,250
Her Majesty taught me these.

577
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,490
Her Majesty even taught me
to read "Discourses on Salt and Iron"

578
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,451
and Jia Yi's...

579
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,570
His...

580
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:03,530
His ancient texts.

581
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,451
In any case, I've read everything.

582
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:09,171
But I just don't remember them.

583
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:12,730
Unbelievable.

584
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,171
But Your Majesty,

585
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,371
you can rest assured.

586
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,971
The money used
to purchase these sugarcanes came

587
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,250
from my own pocket.

588
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,010
I didn't spend any
of the palace's budget.

589
00:31:20,851 --> 00:31:22,371
To make Her Majesty happy,

590
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:23,611
I spent almost

591
00:31:23,611 --> 00:31:24,810
all of my money.

592
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,651
All right.

593
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:28,810
I know you're devoted to the Empress.

594
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:29,971
Zisheng,

595
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,691
your fiancee is not bad.

596
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:33,490
I shall reward you
a fief of 200 households.

597
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,250
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

598
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:38,810
I feel assured
when Shaoshang handles things.

599
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,010
I'm sure you don't know

600
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:42,730
that even the most skilled
in settling accounts

601
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:45,131
in the palace isn't
as fast as Shaoshang.

602
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,090
Lady Luo will be married
to the Northwest soon.

603
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:52,651
I'm planning to let Shaoshang
take care of the harem's affair.

604
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:53,851
Mother.

605
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:55,570
Shaoshang is sharp, cheerful,

606
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,050
and tactful.

607
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,691
She can indeed carry
this responsibility.

608
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,851
The Empress's birthday banquet

609
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:03,651
will be your first important task

610
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,971
since you manage
Changqiu Palace's matters.

611
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,490
You must not take it lightly.

612
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

613
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,171
Fifth Princess.

614
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,250
Lady Luo,

615
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:30,971
you were my study companion
when I was young,

616
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,851
you've been serving Mother
in Changqiu Palace since young,

617
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,290
and helped Madam Zhai
with the palace's affairs.

618
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,451
But now,

619
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,211
Mother has entrusted the duty
to Cheng Shaoshang.

620
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:42,250
She has only been here
for not more than a few months,

621
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,050
and she has overtaken you.

622
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:45,810
Aren't you upset about that?

623
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,010
Fifth Princess,
you're taking it too seriously.

624
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,171
I'll be married off
to the Northwest soon.

625
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,090
As for Lady Cheng,

626
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,131
the palace is considered
her husband's home.

627
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,171
Now,

628
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,371
she's only doing her duty
to serve her aunt in advance.

629
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,451
She and I are different.

630
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,451
Why would I be upset?

631
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:06,250
What a pity.

632
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,971
I thought

633
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:10,570
Mother would arrange for you
to marry Zisheng.

634
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:11,931
Who would've known

635
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:14,010
someone outran you?

636
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:23,851
You're clearly going to be married off
after the birthday banquet.

637
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,810
Yet, Her Majesty wants us

638
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,330
to do as she says.

639
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,171
She's just good at currying favor

640
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,691
that Her Majesty lost her senses.

641
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:34,010
It's fine if you're not bothered
by this.

642
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,570
Why should I tolerate her?

643
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:40,490
Who can interfere

644
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,330
with Her Majesty's decision?

645
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:45,851
You should speak less.

646
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:47,330
We're both not lucky.

647
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,090
We can't blame anyone for it.

648
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,451
Your Majesty,

649
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,090
I don't understand one thing.

650
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,251
His Majesty can just compliment me.

651
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:26,251
Why did he reward Zisheng

652
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,050
and force me to stay in the palace?

653
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,771
What's his belongs to you too.

654
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,690
Are you going
to be bothered by this too?

655
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:36,811
Perhaps His Majesty rewarded
these 200 households

656
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,650
for your sugarcane expenses.

657
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:43,291
I'm not bothered by that.

658
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,851
It's just that Zisheng receives
all the credit

659
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,371
for the things I did well.

660
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,771
Then do you know

661
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,650
it was Zisheng who requested His Majesty

662
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,811
to grant you the commendation letter?

663
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,371
He requested it?

664
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:01,771
He was going on a war expedition
at the time.

665
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:04,771
Yet, he never asked for any grace.

666
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:08,170
He was worried others would treat
you coldly at Lou's Residence.

667
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:11,291
So especially requested His Majesty
to grant you the commendation letter.

668
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:13,331
At that time,

669
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,251
he already had a deep affection for you.

670
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:20,371
I didn't expect
he would do so much for me.

671
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,331
I just feel

672
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,170
everyone sees me

673
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,570
as Zisheng's fiancee.

674
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:34,851
But what about me?

675
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,010
No one acknowledges me for being myself.

676
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:39,371
If it's as you say,

677
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:42,251
then the soldiers and counselors

678
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,851
under His Majesty would have no place
for themselves anymore.

679
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:48,490
If the plan was good
and they won the battle,

680
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,010
it was to help His Majesty
to expand the country's territory.

681
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,090
Do you think the rest has nothing
to do with them?

682
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:55,971
If the plan fails
and the army was defeated,

683
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,210
would that be entirely
His Majesty's mistake?

684
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,891
But since ancient times,

685
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,170
under the starry skies,

686
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,291
the names of the famous generals
and counselors

687
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,570
who directed politics of the world

688
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,170
can still be seen shining brightly

689
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:12,971
in the galaxy.

690
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:25,130
Really?

691
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:27,291
Is this how it is after getting married?

692
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:29,650
What's his, is mine

693
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,411
and what's mine is his?

694
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,650
Both of us are one body?

695
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,570
You were so used to being alone.

696
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,331
So you always think of yourself
and growing up alone.

697
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:43,650
You mustn't behave this way
after you're married.

698
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,731
You must learn how to mediate.

699
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:49,210
If it doesn't work this way,
you can try another way.

700
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:51,090
After marrying Zisheng,

701
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,891
you may not be able to travel far
as you expected with Mr. Lou.

702
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:58,251
But does that mean

703
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:00,771
you can't be yourself here?

704
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,811
You're right.

705
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:13,210
If the husband is the scorching sun

706
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:14,931
that brightens the road
for thousands of li away,

707
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,130
then the wife

708
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,891
would be the stars,

709
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,731
the brilliant galaxy.

710
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:30,731
The sun, the moon, and the galaxy.

711
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,331
Neither is superior or inferior.

712
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,931
Not a single one can be cast aside.

713
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,090
Only by coexisting

714
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,210
can we create this world.

715
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:20,291
Song,

716
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:22,690
since when you have changed your taste?

717
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,650
Who are you going
to give these sweet glutinous snacks to?

718
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,210
I'm sure it's for Qiqi.

719
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:30,690
The Wan Family can forget about getting
my grandson to marry into their family.

720
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,771
I will never agree to this marriage.

721
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:33,170
His daughter can forget

722
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,690
about eating
these sweet glutinous snacks.

723
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,411
Song,

724
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,170
give it to me.

725
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:45,851
I love sweet food the most.

726
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,251
Speaking of which,

727
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,371
I still think fighting over food
with family

728
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:58,371
at the dining table

729
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,610
back in the village

730
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,210
makes the meal more enjoyable.

731
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:03,130
Every time we enter the palace,

732
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,050
Yuanyi and I have to eat separately.

733
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:07,331
It makes me lose my appetite.

734
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:10,731
I wonder if Niaoniao is getting used
to staying at the palace.

735
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:19,411
She hasn't come home for days now.

736
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,650
I suppose she's not willing to come home

737
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,771
because she's reluctant
to leave the palace.

738
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,130
If this goes on,

739
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:25,411
we don't have

740
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,371
to prepare for her birthday.

741
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,931
She can just celebrate it in the palace.

742
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,570
She's not like that.

743
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,650
I know Niaoniao's temperament well.

744
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,490
It must be Ling Buyi
who stopped her from coming home.

745
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,371
Zisheng,

746
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,570
where's Niaoniao?

747
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,371
Why didn't she come home with you?

748
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,451
His Majesty asked Niaoniao
to stay at the palace.

749
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:02,570
Today,

750
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,010
His Majesty asked Niaoniao to organize
Her Majesty's birthday banquet.

751
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,731
I think she won't be returning home
for some time.

752
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,010
For some time?

753
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,291
How long is that?

754
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,371
Until Her Majesty's
birthday banquet is over.

755
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:18,451
I come here

756
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,411
with a request.

757
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,291
What is it?

758
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,771
Do you need me to help you
with something?

759
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,530
I'm worried Shaoshang

760
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:27,170
might not be used to staying
at the palace.

761
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:28,411
So I came here

762
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:30,891
to take some items Shaoshang used
back to the palace.

763
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,731
That's easy.

764
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:36,931
Lianfang,

765
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:39,690
go to Niaoniao's room
and pick up the items.

766
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:41,130
Yes.

767
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:41,971
In that case,

768
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,650
I'll help myself.

769
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,371
Heavens...

770
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,371
How is this taking some items?

771
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,010
He's clearly confiscating everything.
