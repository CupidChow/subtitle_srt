=Episode 49=

3
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,880
You shouldn't have come.

4
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,919
Who on earth are you?

5
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,560
Ling Buyi

6
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
or Huo Wushang?

7
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,560
Regardless of who I am,

8
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,000
my heart for you will never change.

9
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,959
Why must it be today?

10
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,479
Why do you still refuse to tell me?

11
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Because I must avenge

12
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,239
the whole clan's massacre.

13
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,160
Shaoshang,

14
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,919
our wedding date has been set.

15
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,120
If I were to take revenge

16
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,759
only after our marriage,

17
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,880
it would surely implicate
the Cheng's Family.

18
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,040
The buck stops here with me.

19
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,759
I won't let the Cheng's Family

20
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,400
be implicated because of me.

21
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,919
Ling Buyi

22
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,600
used the tiger seal
without authorization,

23
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,239
disrupted the military defense,

24
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:01,919
and held the intention of treason.

25
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,239
These are unpardonable crimes.

26
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,919
Today,

27
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,440
if he dares take a step
through this door,

28
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,199
kill him without mercy!

29
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes, General!

30
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,919
Shaoshang,

31
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,400
I have no way out now.

32
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,879
I will pay

33
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,239
for my own wrongdoings.

34
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,239
We'll hereby bid each other farewell.

35
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,439
We won't be seeing each other again.

36
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,999
Young Master.

37
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Please stay alive.

38
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,400
Ling Buyi,

39
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,600
you deployed the army
without authorization.

40
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,479
I'm here to bring you to justice!

41
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,720
If you dare take another step,

42
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
you'll be killed without mercy!

43
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,679
Ling Buyi, how dare you
disobey the imperial edict!

44
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,498
If you dare take another step,

45
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,520
(Marquis Chengyang's Residence)
thousands of arrows

46
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,058
will take your life.

47
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,280
Bring it on!

48
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,679
Kill!

49
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,439
General.

50
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:21,959
Good job.

51
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,040
You live up to your identity
as my daughter.

52
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,079
Niaoniao, run quickly!

53
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,599
Run quickly!

54
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,079
General.

55
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,959
Why are you all still standing there?
Chase after him!

56
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:38,880
Yes, General!

57
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Chase after him!

58
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,959
Seize him!

59
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:48,319
Lady Cheng,

60
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,599
the traitor Ling Buyi

61
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,240
killed his father and deployed the army.

62
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,079
He has committed heinous

63
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,520
and unpardonable crimes!

64
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,079
If you refuse to surrender now,

65
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:02,799
then please don't blame me.

66
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,040
Don't be silly.

67
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,959
I need to walk this path alone.

68
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,319
You shouldn't have been

69
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,839
amongst my companions.

70
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,480
Fine.

71
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,959
Since you've never treated me
as your companion,

72
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,839
then tell me.

73
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
Why did we

74
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,880
swear our alliance

75
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,360
by biting the arm

76
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,640
before your mother's
memorial tablet then?

77
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,719
I've said

78
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,799
that you're not alone.

79
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,719
You don't have to be afraid.

80
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll live and die with you.

81
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,360
I have no choice.

82
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,599
You shouldn't have come.

83
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,199
But I came eventually.

84
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,400
The entire Cheng Family
came to save you.

85
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,679
You said you've never

86
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,520
truly felt loved since you were a child.

87
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
I've come to shower you with love.

88
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,640
You said you like the hustle and bustle.

89
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,520
My family has presented it to you.

90
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,079
Why can't you

91
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,040
let go of your hatred still

92
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,520
and be considerate of me?

93
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,839
Shaoshang,

94
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,280
for you,

95
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,760
it may be just
a 15-year-long national hatred.

96
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,839
For me,

97
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,959
I personally witnessed it.

98
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,520
It is a blood feud
stuck in my heart for years.

99
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,240
Did you know
that when I fall asleep at night,

100
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,679
I can hear the voices of grievances
of the Gu city's souls

101
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,400
and see

102
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,160
parents and siblings

103
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,559
dying tragically before my eyes?

104
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,040
This is a heavy burden on me.

105
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,160
It's way too heavy.

106
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,799
I can't let go.

107
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,719
And I won't let it go.

108
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,199
Shaoshang,

109
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,439
I know I've let you down.

110
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,439
I'm really sorry.

111
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
But I'm a criminal now.

112
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,880
Only my death

113
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,280
will not bring you and your whole family

114
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,439
any harm.

115
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,799
Ling Buyi,

116
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,959
if you dare abandon me today,

117
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,040
I, Cheng Shaoshang, swear to Heaven

118
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,799
that I will never forgive you.

119
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,919
I will never forgive you

120
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,959
for eternity.

121
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,599
I never dared expect your forgiveness.

122
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,160
Cheng Shaoshang,

123
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:29,679
our fate

124
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,240
is over.

125
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,719
Listen up!

126
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Draw your bow!

127
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,319
Obey my orders!

128
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,599
Kill him and Lady Cheng

129
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,199
without mercy!

130
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,040
Yes, General!

131
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Shaoshang,

132
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,400
live on well.

133
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,319
I'm sorry.

134
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,400
Ling Buyi!

135
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,480
Ling Buyi!

136
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,160
Ling Buyi!

137
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,839
Ling Buyi!

138
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:40,599
Ling Buyi!

139
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,018
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

140
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,640
Young Lady, drink up.

141
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,599
What should we do now?

142
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,360
Why can't she swallow the medicine?

143
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,360
Pass it to me.

144
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Lift her.

145
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,480
The lad Ling Buyi

146
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,040
is really despicable

147
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,559
for letting Niaoniao suffer like this.

148
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,079
If he hadn't jumped off the cliff,

149
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,559
I'd beat him up whenever I saw him.

150
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,679
First Madam,

151
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,559
the Third Prince
burst in with his people

152
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,040
and requested Young Lady
to be taken away immediately.

153
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,679
Aren't there many imperial bodyguards
standing guard out there?

154
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,520
How did he manage to burst in then?

155
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,880
He said those who dared stop him
would be killed.

156
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,400
He practically killed his way in.

157
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,680
What?

158
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,280
Where do they want to take Niaoniao to?

159
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,359
Third Prince.

160
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,000
Third Prince, please respect yourself.

161
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Although the Cheng Family
was detained on the spot

162
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,000
for attempting to save Ling Buyi,

163
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,319
you can't just walk
right over us arbitrarily.

164
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,359
This is the chamber of a lady.

165
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,760
No outside men are allowed to go in.

166
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
First Madam,

167
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,520
sorry for the offense.

168
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,879
I must meet

169
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,920
Cheng Shaoshang today.

170
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,559
If she doesn't come out,

171
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,159
then I won't leave.

172
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,799
Third Prince, don't go too far.

173
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,559
It's you all who have gone too far.

174
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,359
Everyone knows how good Zisheng

175
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,920
treats Lady Cheng.

176
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,480
Today,

177
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,159
she must help Zisheng
once more at any cost.

178
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,040
It was he who betrayed us first.

179
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,399
The Cheng Family has already done
all we can for him.

180
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,359
To save him,

181
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,960
we were willing to be thrown into jail.

182
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,680
But look at how he treated Niaoniao.

183
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,240
It was he who gave Niaoniao up first.

184
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,000
With me, Xiao Yuanyi, around,

185
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,639
I'll see who dares to touch my daughter.

186
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:31,480
Zisheng.

187
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,920
Zisheng.

188
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,240
Who on earth are you?

189
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,799
Ling Buyi

190
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,040
or Huo Wushang?

191
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,559
(From now on,)

192
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,639
(if you don't abandon me,)

193
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:07,359
(I won't)

194
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,440
(do so to you too.)

195
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,079
Do you have anything to say to me?

196
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,119
(Ling Buyi,)

197
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,799
(why do you still refuse to tell me?)

198
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,159
Ling Buyi!

199
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
Ling Buyi!

200
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,559
Ling Buyi!

201
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,520
If you want to enter
my daughter's chamber,

202
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,839
you have to kill me first!

203
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,000
We don't know whether Zisheng
is alive or dead.

204
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,639
And Cheng Shaoshang has only fallen ill.

205
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,599
Also, she's still alive.

206
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,119
Why can't she go and save him then?

207
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,799
Is he dead?

208
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,639
Niaoniao.

209
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,079
Cheng Shaoshang,

210
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,879
sorry for disappointing you.

211
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,319
It's good to hear

212
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,639
that he's not dead.

213
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,520
Your Highness is imposing your authority
at the Cheng's Residence.

214
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,440
There must be something else
Your Highness wants to say.

215
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,720
He has committed heinous crimes.

216
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,119
He killed his father,

217
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,399
deployed the army,

218
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,960
and used the tiger seal
without authorization.

219
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,720
He has shaken the royal court.

220
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,359
This morning,

221
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,720
eighteen high-ranking officials
have joined forces to impeach him

222
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,240
and intend to put him to death.

223
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,440
This is the path he has chosen.

224
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,599
What can I do?

225
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,200
What does Your Highness think

226
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,639
will become of him?

227
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,399
Be a fugitive?

228
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,280
Or conceal his identity?

229
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,799
Don't all lands in the world
belong to His Majesty?

230
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,720
Where can he escape to?

231
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,440
Or

232
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,680
looking forward
to the death of His Majesty?

233
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,879
And only show up when Your Highness

234
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,520
has attained great achievements?

235
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,920
Surviving in hiding and lying low?

236
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,960
I guess

237
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,079
he'd rather die.

238
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,520
If he dies,

239
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,799
I'll put all the blames on you.

240
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,399
If he dies,

241
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll accompany him.

242
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,760
What's there to be afraid of?

243
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,480
Third Prince, say no more.

244
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,559
Even if you didn't come over today,

245
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,720
I'd go to the palace myself.

246
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,440
Niaoniao,

247
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,359
you've not recovered.

248
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,280
You must not go.

249
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,680
Yes, it's not worth doing it
for that lad.

250
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,200
Why the concern for his life?

251
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:12,960
Mother,

252
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,599
Father,

253
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,359
there are imperial physicians
in the palace.

254
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,359
Don't you worry.

255
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,159
Besides,

256
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,040
Third Prince is waiting for my rebuttal.

257
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,440
He won't let anything happen to me.

258
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,520
When did Your Highness and Zisheng

259
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,960
become good friends?

260
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,399
I ran into someone

261
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:05,760
at the Yanhui Tower that day.

262
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,799
Was it you and Zisheng?

263
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,680
Yes.

264
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,559
Zisheng and I

265
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,440
weren't in a disagreement
as outsiders thought we were.

266
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,280
When Zisheng first got to the palace,

267
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,359
he was tricked.

268
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,720
I was passing by and rescued him.

269
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,079
Wasn't it the Crown Prince?

270
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,799
I still remember when Zisheng
first got to the palace,

271
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,520
he was withdrawn and asocial.

272
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,599
Actually, I was like him too.

273
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,280
I've been withdrawn and asocial

274
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,359
since I was a child.

275
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,319
At that moment,

276
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,920
I was hiding in a quiet spot.

277
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,280
When I found him,

278
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,000
I pulled him up.

279
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,000
So both of you

280
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,520
hooked up in childhood?

281
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,760
What the crap are you talking about?

282
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,159
Her Majesty and my mother

283
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,119
have been minding their own businesses.

284
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,440
To avoid suspicion,
I seldom interact with him.

285
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,000
It was my uncle

286
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,240
who persuaded Zisheng
to help me out at the Yanhui Tower.

287
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,440
But he didn't agree to it.

288
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,920
How did you know

289
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
that it was us

290
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
at the Yanhui Tower?

291
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,559
He ate almond cake that day

292
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:23,920
and was down with a fever.

293
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,799
He was in a confused state.

294
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,760
When I took care of him,

295
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,599
I found the other half
of the jade pendant

296
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,280
I'd lost at the Yanhui Tower.

297
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,119
I heard two voices

298
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,319
at the Yanhui Tower.

299
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,040
I thought there were
only two people there.

300
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,680
But it turned out to be
three people there.

301
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,960
And the third person

302
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:01,000
was Zisheng.

303
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,040
You guessed it right.

304
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,399
Zisheng didn't mean to hurt you.

305
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,480
He kept it from you

306
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,159
to keep you safe.

307
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,839
You all have been plotting it all along.

308
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:15,399
He took the Crown Prince's
lost tiger seal

309
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:16,879
and deployed the army.

310
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,399
I reckon

311
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,119
the Crown Prince will have a hard time
keeping his position safe now.

312
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,599
Should I congratulate Your Highness

313
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,000
for having your wish come true soon?

314
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,240
Zisheng

315
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,319
didn't mean to implicate you.

316
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,680
But that's what he did in the end.

317
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
That's how he is.

318
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
He's upright

319
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,240
but dismal.

320
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,520
He's brave

321
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
and thoughtful.

322
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,559
He'll go all out to save

323
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,119
and abandon me.

324
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Are you certain that you can
defend Zisheng?

325
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,879
I've said

326
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,399
that if he dies,

327
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,920
I'll die with him.

328
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,319
In the face of danger, you appear

329
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,240
logical and clear-minded,

330
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,639
like an outsider.

331
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Do you know what it means by
living and dying together?

332
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,639
And why concern can mess up one's mind?

333
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,040
I can brew wine.

334
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,319
My wines

335
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,040
are the strongest and purest
in the capital.

336
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,720
I can build a water wheel.

337
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,440
My water wheels

338
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,159
are even finer and simpler

339
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,520
than the craftsmen's.

340
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,599
Yet it can cut manpower
and animal resources by 30 percent.

341
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,639
I can build kilns and fire tiles.

342
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,240
My tiles

343
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,159
are as strong and durable
as those used in the palace.

344
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,159
Yet it can cut the manpower
and material resources by half.

345
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,399
Whether Ling Buyi is around or not,

346
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,559
I'm a lady who lives well.

347
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,879
I have my parents and sibilings to take care of.

348
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,319
But you shouldn't question me harshly

349
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:50,240
just because I'm a lady.

350
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,240
Your fiance is going to die.

351
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,200
Why didn't you die with him?

352
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,040
I shouldn't be kept in the dark

353
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,200
just because I'm a lady.

354
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,799
I don't even know

355
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,319
what my fiance's name is.

356
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,159
Two days before my wedding,

357
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,079
I managed to guess it right.

358
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,599
I was hoping he'd tell me instead.

359
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,599
But now,

360
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,440
I can't resent

361
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:18,799
and hate him

362
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,480
because doing so

363
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,799
is an act of indifference
and selfishness.

364
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,879
You said he treated me whole-heartedly.

365
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm willing to cut my body apart

366
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,200
and show him my heart

367
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:37,960
to see for himself whether
I've treated him whole-heartedly or not.

368
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,000
He saved my life,

369
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,799
and I'll repay him with my life.

370
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,280
If I can't save him today,

371
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,599
I'll take my own life.

372
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm not afraid of death.

373
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,639
If one day

374
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,920
I feel like dying,

375
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,720
that's because I'm tired of living.

376
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,839
It's definitely not because

377
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,520
I want to die with my only love.

378
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,720
Ling Buyi is the person I love most

379
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,079
in this world.

380
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,159
But

381
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,079
I am nobody but myself.

382
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:45,960
Your Majesty,

383
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,399
even if that lad
has committed heinous crimes,

384
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,119
considering Huo's entire clan,

385
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,799
I beg Your Majesty
to grant him a pardon.

386
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,799
If it weren't
for Ling Yi's heinous deeds,

387
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,440
he wouldn't have taken that move.

388
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,720
I beg Your Majesty to show mercy.

389
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,839
Show him mercy, Your Majesty.

390
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,879
Anger and contempt are one thing.

391
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,839
Murder and arson are another matter.

392
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,920
Even if Madam Huo felt aggrieved,

393
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,359
he shouldn't have killed his father

394
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:17,720
to avenge his mother.

395
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,799
This is totally unforgivable.

396
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,680
We haven't even gotten
to the bottom of the matter.

397
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,520
Official Zuo,

398
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,119
you've already concluded
that General Ling

399
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:27,559
has killed for Madam Huo's grievances?

400
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
Could it be

401
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,799
that Official Zuo already knows
the whole story?

402
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,920
Official Yuan,

403
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,119
what do you mean?

404
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,159
As a court official
at the Ministry of Justice,

405
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,040
are you looking

406
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,760
for a reason for the murderer
to escape his punishments?

407
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,280
Official Ji,

408
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,680
you're the Minister of Justice.

409
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,079
Are you going to look into

410
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,559
Official Yuan's partiality?

411
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,599
Official Zuo,

412
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,079
Ling Buyi has committed

413
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,200
the crimes of killing his father,
deploying the army,

414
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
and deceiving the Eastern Palace.

415
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,280
We, the Ministry of Justice,
will investigate each of these crimes.

416
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,399
If all of these are true,

417
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,399
he won't be able to escape

418
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,760
the law.

419
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,639
Are you all done yet?

420
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,559
Zisheng was raised
in the Changqiu Palace

421
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:19,159
and nurtured personally by His Majesty.

422
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,200
Who didn't

423
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,359
know

424
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,720
that his future is bright and boundless?

425
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,040
Had he gone crazy or been stupid

426
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,920
that he killed his father for no reason

427
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,599
so you all

428
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,599
could denounce him now?

429
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,079
It's the truth
that Ling Buyi killed his father.

430
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,280
Is this still excusable?

431
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,680
Ling Buyi didn't kill his father.

432
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,760
Official Zuo, you're righteous

433
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,559
but you've made a mistake
in your first sentence.

434
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,599
Miss Cheng,

435
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,440
Ling Buyi is your fiance.

436
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
Did you come here today
to intercede for him?

437
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,960
What can't Ling Buyi do?

438
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,440
He had even fought against the Censorate

439
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,119
for you back then.

440
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,319
Official Zuo, you're afraid

441
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,879
that no one knows you're taking revenge.

442
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,520
That's why you keep reminding us

443
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:06,280
about the fight.

444
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,280
You...

445
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,520
Your Majesty,

446
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,920
Miss Cheng was at the scene

447
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,440
with Ling Buyi.

448
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,440
I beg Your Majesty to take her
into custody for questioning.

449
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,200
What did you say?

450
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,000
Why did you say

451
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:26,559
that Zisheng did not kill his father?

452
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,399
Your Majesty,

453
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,119
Ling Yi isn't
Zisheng's biological father.

454
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,639
Zisheng's biological father

455
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,879
is General Huo Chong.

456
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:41,839
What?

457
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,639
What did you say?

458
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,639
You...

459
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,680
Please repeat yourself.

460
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,040
Zisheng is General Huo Chong's orphan,

461
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
Huo Wushang.

462
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,079
Cheng Shaoshang,

463
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,480
are you aware
of what you're saying here?

464
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,639
You may be Ling Buyi's fiancee,

465
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
but you shouldn't
say something so absurd

466
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,079
just to have him exonerated.

467
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,520
How could Ling Yi not know

468
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,639
whether Ling Buyi
is his son or not, right?

469
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
How could Huo Junhua not know, right?

470
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:28,200
Your Majesty,

471
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,240
Zisheng

472
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,119
couldn't take care
of Madam Huo all these years.

473
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,000
Did Your Majesty know the reason?

474
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,720
Then, does Your Majesty think

475
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,079
that Zisheng looks like

476
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,520
Marquis Chengyang?

477
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,159
Zisheng indeed
doesn't look like Marquis Chengyang.

478
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,240
He looks more like General Huo.

479
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,280
Your Majesty.

480
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,480
Get off.

481
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,040
Carry on.

482
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,319
Go on.

483
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,559
General Huo's son, Huo Wushang,

484
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,920
is allergic to almonds.

485
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,000
But Ling Yi's son, Ling Buyi,

486
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,079
loves almond cake the most.

487
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,159
That day,

488
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:14,920
Madam Huo had prepared
some almond cakes.

489
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,119
Come on.

490
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,359
Zisheng couldn't refuse, so he ate it.

491
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:22,040
That night, he had a high fever
and rashes all over his body.

492
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:23,680
From that day on,

493
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,960
I suspected something.

494
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,920
It wasn't until Marquis Chengyang's
birthday banquet

495
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,000
that he personally revealed to me

496
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,359
he was the late Marquis Huo's son,

497
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,240
Huo Wushang.

498
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,159
Your Majesty,

499
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,639
it was Ling Yi who led
to the destruction of Gu city.

500
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,240
He was the culprit
behind General Huo's tragic death.

501
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,879
All Zisheng did

502
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,879
was avenge his father.

503
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
Then, Junhua...

504
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,399
She...

505
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,399
Marquis Cui, do you remember

506
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,280
what Madam Huo said on her deathbed?

507
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,839
Never forget

508
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,159
our revenge.

509
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,520
Li,

510
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,559
I'm coming for you.

511
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Do you think you can convict
Marquis Chengyang for the crime

512
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,199
with your words alone?

513
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,079
Where's your evidence?

514
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,599
Since Official Zuo asks for evidence,

515
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,960
why don't

516
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,119
we quickly rescue Ling Buyi
from the bottom of the cliff?

517
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,679
What is true and what is not

518
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,360
will be known during the interrogation.

519
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,840
If you rescue him,

520
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,040
then what he says will be the truth?

521
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,719
I now know Zisheng's difficulties.

522
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,920
He not only has no evidence that Marquis
Chengyang conspired with the enemy

523
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,719
but also can't prove

524
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,880
his real identity now.

525
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,279
Marquis Chengyang is dead.

526
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:02,559
And a dead man tells no tales.

527
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,239
If Marquis Chengyang were alive,

528
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
he would assert

529
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,000
that he was Zisheng's biological father.

530
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,279
Zisheng wouldn't be able to refute it.

531
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,239
Your Majesty,

532
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:15,400
Zisheng was really desperate

533
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,719
that he made such a decision.

534
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,279
The evidence says it all.

535
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,040
What you said

536
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,079
sounded as if we were
being unreasonable here.

537
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,440
You're indeed being unreasonable.

538
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,840
Official Zuo, you're constantly
on the offensive

539
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,199
and attempt to put
all the charges on Zisheng.

540
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,199
Are you doing this
to vent your anger or for justice?

541
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,040
You know it better.

542
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,279
That's a pack of lies!

543
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:35,159
Silence!

544
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,920
Official Zuo,

545
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,480
are you an Imperial Counsellor
or a blabbermouth?

546
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,520
His Majesty is still in the hall.

547
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,559
Yet you keep babbling here.

548
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,320
Are you trying
to disrespect His Majesty?

549
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,679
Are you all done yet?

550
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,719
Whether he's Li or Zheng,

551
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,759
I

552
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,679
have my way to prove it.

553
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,320
I had seen Zheng

554
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,000
when he was a child.

555
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,520
He has

556
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,920
a special birthmark on his body.

557
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,400
It's a small tiger head,

558
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:16,520
but with three ears.

559
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:20,079
It's located half an inch
below Zisheng's waist.

560
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,159
I saw it

561
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,880
when I wiped Zisheng's body

562
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,279
during his high fever.

563
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,559
That's right.

564
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,759
It's a tiger head with three ears.

565
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,599
Hurry up.

566
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,199
Send someone

567
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,679
to lift that lad
from the bottom of the cliff.

568
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

569
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,679
Take a few imperial physicians along.

570
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
And some rations too.

571
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,800
The lad hasn't eaten
and drunk anything for two days.

572
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,440
When he returns,

574
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
I will

575
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
take him to his father's grave

576
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,320
and beat him up.

577
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,759
He has been so obsessed.

578
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,480
Why couldn't he talk it out clearly?

579
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,040
Why must he choose to take such a risk?

580
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,679
Your Majesty,

581
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,800
Ling Buyi committed the crimes

582
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,639
of carrying the Crown Prince's tiger seal

583
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,920
and eploying the army without authorization.

584
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,840
Will you

585
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,880
be satisfied

586
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,520
only when I atone

587
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,920
for Zheng's crime?

588
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
(Kill him and Lady Cheng)

589
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,920
(without mercy!)

590
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,800
(Yes, General!)

591
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,759
Your Highness.

592
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,440
What's the matter?

593
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,279
Let's talk after I've brought
Zisheng back.

594
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:50,520
Beware that someone might want

595
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,239
to harm Zisheng during the rescue.

596
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:54,599
When General Zuo
hunted Zisheng down that day,

597
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,559
he didn't plan
to persuade Zisheng to surrender.

598
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,759
He drove Zisheng to the cliff

599
00:37:58,759 --> 00:37:59,960
and ordered the release of arrows.

600
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,320
Otherwise,

601
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,880
Zisheng wouldn't have
jumped off the cliff.

602
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,279
I get it.

603
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,840
If they're disloyal,

604
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,000
I won't let them go.

605
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,040
Thank you so much

606
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,360
for today.

607
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,279
When Zisheng returns,

608
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,880
I'll make him bow and apologize to you.

609
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,320
Don't worry.

610
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,119
Zisheng loves you so much.

611
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,480
He'll surely obey you from then on.

612
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,480
