3
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:52,486
Your Majesty, have some ginger soup
to warm up your body.

4
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,845
Thank you for what you did today.

5
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:01,086
If you didn't plead for Shaoshang,

6
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:04,086
His Majesty wouldn't grant her
an audience with her.

7
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,926
It doesn't please me
to hear you say this.

8
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:08,725
Do you think

9
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:10,725
His Majesty granted Shaoshang
an audience

10
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,246
because of me?

11
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:13,966
That was

12
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,565
because His Majesty couldn't bear
to see you pleading in the rain.

13
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,806
He was worried
your health couldn't withstand it.

14
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,165
He did it because he worries about you.

15
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,245
You don't have to comfort me.

16
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,565
I know

17
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:31,406
you and His Majesty
are childhood sweethearts.

18
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:33,285
If His Majesty didn't form

19
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,845
an alliance with Prince Qian'an
for the people,

20
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:38,165
he wouldn't have married me.

21
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:40,046
He wouldn't have

22
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,366
dishonored your happiness.

23
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,605
It was the Xuan Clan
who had wronged you

24
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,925
and snatched your fiance from you.

25
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:52,326
You didn't snatch him away from me.

26
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,526
If His Majesty were unwilling,

27
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:57,085
no one could force him.

28
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,246
If I want to blame someone,

29
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,486
I should blame His Majesty
for betraying me.

30
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,246
You're not at fault here.

31
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,526
I'm not someone

32
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,005
who would blame another woman

33
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,486
if my husband marries someone else.

34
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,246
Besides,

35
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,046
I was upset with His Majesty
at the time.

36
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,925
I also hit

37
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,166
and scolded him.

38
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:20,126
When I wanted to vent my anger,

39
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:24,005
I even kicked him in bed.

40
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,205
But it was already 20 years ago.

41
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,845
I'm no longer angry anymore.

42
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:29,285
Your Majesty,

43
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:31,565
why do you still mind?

44
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,925
Even I like

45
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:36,686
your character.

46
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,606
It's no wonder His Majesty is

47
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,766
deeply in love with you.

48
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:48,805
Your Majesty,

49
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:50,925
I'm sure you know

50
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,566
I don't like to speak
on other people's behalf.

51
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:55,805
But it's frustrating

52
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,125
not to say what I have in mind.

53
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:01,286
You're right.

54
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,245
His Majesty and I are

55
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:06,085
childhood sweethearts.

56
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,645
But you and His Majesty

57
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,486
went through many hardships together.

58
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:13,965
Why do you insist on distinguishing

59
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:16,886
which is the true love
between husband and wife

60
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,886
and compare His Majesty's love

61
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:22,085
between both of us?

62
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,286
I never thought of that.

63
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,166
I'm glad that you don't.

64
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,566
His Majesty's love and respect
for you is

65
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:32,886
no less than mine.

66
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,205
You've at least been married

67
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:36,566
for so many years.

68
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,726
How can there be no love
between you two?

69
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:43,245
It's just that I'm used
to playing around with His Majesty.

70
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:46,645
Unlike you who see yourself
as his subject.

71
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:54,846
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,405
you must take care of yourself.

73
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,286
Don't let sadness affect your health.

74
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:03,085
Only when you're good,

75
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,886
His Majesty would be good.

76
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:06,925
When His Majesty is good

77
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:10,326
only then would Changqiu Palace
be in good hands.

78
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:19,326
Your Majesty,

79
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,365
Shaoshang has returned
to Changqiu Palace.

80
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:24,766
His Majesty ordered
to keep a close watch on her

81
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,766
and not to let her leave
without permission.

82
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,965
Thank you for attending
to me tonight, Heng.

83
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:33,245
I should return now.

84
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:40,205
Shen'an,

85
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,525
I see you

86
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,525
as an older sister.

87
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:54,125
I hope you can take care.

88
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:26,925
(We don't even know
if your father is still alive.)

89
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,966
(If we fail to clear our names,)

90
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,166
(you'll be the Cheng family's)

91
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,846
(last bloodline in this world!)

92
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,606
(Cheng Shaoshang,)

93
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,206
(listen to me carefully.)

94
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,526
(No matter what happens
to the Cheng Family,)

95
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,486
(you must live on.)

96
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,445
(You must continue to live.)

97
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:24,646
You can leave now.

98
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:53,726
Don't worry.

99
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:55,606
His Majesty and I

100
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:59,005
believe that your father
would never defect to the enemy.

101
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:01,325
It's just that His Majesty needs

102
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:04,565
some time to investigate the truth.

103
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:16,286
But I'm worried about my mother,

104
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,046
my father,

105
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:22,086
my brothers, and Yangyang.

106
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,726
I'm also worried about my grandmother

107
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,606
who mistreats me.

108
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,086
I want to go out of the palace
to see them.

109
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,005
I don't know

110
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:38,606
if they have enough food

111
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:40,365
or if they sleep well in the dungeon.

112
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:47,445
All right, then.

113
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,365
I'll write you a permit

114
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:52,325
so you can leave the palace to see them.

115
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:56,925
But His Majesty doesn't allow me
to leave the palace.

116
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,726
You'll be defying His Majesty's order.

117
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,885
His Majesty is only worried
about your safety.

118
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:04,646
It's only natural for you
to see your family.

119
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:07,765
His Majesty won't blame you.

120
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:33,365
If you cry this hard,

121
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,206
how sad would your mother feel

122
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,166
if she saw you like this?

123
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,805
Pull yourself together.

124
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:43,206
I'm sure you don't want your family

125
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,125
to see you like this.

126
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,565
Am I right?

127
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:53,046
Thank you, Your Majesty.

128
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:15,486
I shall never forget

129
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,005
Your Majesty's kindness my whole life.

130
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,285
You must take good care of yourself

131
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,285
and live a long life.

132
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,206
Your Majesty,

133
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:25,486
why do I feel uneasy?

134
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,405
Young Lady Cheng is only visiting
her family.

135
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:31,165
Why did she sound
like she was saying goodbye?

136
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:35,926
I'm afraid

137
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:37,765
she won't return anymore.

138
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:39,165
What?

139
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,566
I didn't only give her

140
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:43,365
a permit to leave the palace.

141
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:46,165
I also gave her checkpoint clearance.

142
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:49,966
Is Lady Cheng leaving the capital?

143
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,726
It's treason punishable by death.

144
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:54,765
Why didn't you stop her?

145
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,005
Shaoshang is

146
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,525
more determined

147
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,966
than we think.

148
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:05,885
After she makes up her mind,

149
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,285
no one can stop her.

150
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:10,566
Rather

151
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,365
than standing in her way,

152
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:15,606
why don't

153
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:17,926
I be her backup?

154
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:20,525
But you didn't hesitate

155
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,645
to defy His Majesty's decree for her.

156
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:25,566
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble.

157
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,045
As for His Majesty,

158
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,125
I'll seek forgiveness myself.

159
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:03,326
Your Majesty!

160
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,966
Your Majesty, look.

161
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:10,645
Aren't these the permit
and clearance you prepared?

162
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,680
(Shaoshang's action is authorized.)

163
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,926
Shaoshang didn't bring these with her.

164
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,606
Then how is she going
to pass through the checkpoint?

165
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:22,645
I saw a carving knife and wood flakes

166
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,446
on the table in her room.

167
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,606
She's obviously afraid
of implicating me.

168
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,606
What a foolish child.

169
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:42,765
Hold it right there.

170
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,606
This is a restricted area
of the Ministry of Justice.

171
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,005
No outsiders are allowed to enter.

172
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:48,206
I have a permit from Changqiu Palace

173
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:50,446
to see the prisoners
from Marquis Quling's residence.

174
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,765
Show it to me.

175
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:22,206
I've verified it.

176
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:23,606
Yes, Sir.

177
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:28,405
Come with me.

178
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:43,726
Did you just use

179
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:45,926
a fake badge from Changqiu Palace?

180
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:48,365
I can't believe you're trying
to bluff your way with it.

181
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,686
How did you know it's fake?

182
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,765
You made it in a hurry just now, right?

183
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:57,846
The ink is not even dried yet.

184
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:01,165
Are you tired of living now?

185
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:05,686
You won't be so lucky
to meet me next time.

186
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:06,966
There won't be next time.

187
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:09,326
Thank you for your help.

188
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:11,326
Where is my family locked up?

189
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:15,525
They're locked up at...

190
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:16,446
Thank you.

191
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:23,645
I'll wait for you here.

192
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:41,885
I'm not taking it.

193
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:48,566
You...

194
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:54,926
Are you trying to choke me to death,
you vicious woman?

195
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:58,686
Aunt, you sure have your ways.

196
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:02,926
In the past, I can let you act willfully

197
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,285
in Marquis Quling's Residence.

198
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,525
But we don't have free access
to physicians and medicine here.

199
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:10,206
You can't do as you please now.

200
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:13,926
I promised my husband

201
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:16,165
to take good care of all of you.

202
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:17,926
When he returns,

203
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,285
I, Xiao Yuanyi

204
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:21,206
shall return all of you to him

205
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:23,086
safe and sound.

206
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:28,285
You're merely saying that to sound nice.

207
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,645
You're obviously taking this chance
to take vengeance on me.

208
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:32,125
Why would I take vengeance on you?

209
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,966
For not raising Niaoniao well.

210
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:42,206
Why did Shi marry

211
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,405
a woman

212
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,606
who has no conscience like you?

213
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:50,885
You failed to choke me to death.

214
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,966
So you tried to disgust me to death

215
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:53,846
with this horrible soup.

216
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,045
You're such a vicious woman.

217
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:03,245
Old Madam,

218
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,726
I'm not a devout person.

219
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:08,765
If I wanted to take vengeance,
I would have done it earlier.

220
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,686
When my husband and I return from war,

221
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,365
I saw Niaoniao being raised

222
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:15,926
into such a perverse person

223
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:17,125
who refused to be disciplined.

224
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:19,165
I wanted to punish

225
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,365
you and Madam Ge.

226
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,846
But my husband is a filial son.

227
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:24,966
I respect and love him.

228
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:27,405
How could I mistreat his mother?

229
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,086
Old Madam,

230
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:33,285
you live an easy life
in the Cheng Family

231
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,885
not because I fear you.

232
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,165
It's all because you're
my husband's mother

233
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:41,926
that I raise you and am filial to you.

234
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:45,525
You and I were

235
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,765
never families in the first place.

236
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:49,846
If it weren't for this man,

237
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,005
we wouldn't even be family.

238
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,405
You and I were strangers, to begin with.

239
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:59,005
Why would I even fear you?

240
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:06,885
You're finally telling the truth.

241
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:11,525
You only respect me because of my son?

242
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:16,405
Have you ever done anything
that people respect?

243
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:17,285
Me?

244
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,165
In my life,

245
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,885
the most respectable thing I've done was

246
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,686
to raise three sons!

247
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:28,885
Tell me, who doesn't?

248
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:30,645
Who never gives birth to sons?

249
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,645
I have another daughter compared to you.

250
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,765
So what if you have three sons?

251
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,285
If you think giving birth to sons

252
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:40,005
allows you to be an arrogant woman,

253
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:41,686
what's the difference

254
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:43,806
between living like a mule?

255
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:44,686
You...

256
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:45,926
Why you...

257
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,765
You took the chance while my son was away

258
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,285
to scold me.

259
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:50,285
All right.

260
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,285
Fine.

261
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:52,966
When my son returns,

262
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:54,805
I'll tell him what you did.

263
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:56,325
You can go on and scold me.

264
00:18:56,646 --> 00:18:58,206
I really want to see
if you're faster in scolding me

265
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,486
or if my hands are faster.

266
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:01,926
I'll feed you as you open your mouth
to scold me.

267
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:02,765
Yangyang.

268
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:03,966
Yangyang!

269
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:08,406
I won't eat it!

270
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,486
You sound energetic.

271
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,206
I guess you're all comfortable

272
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,206
in this dungeon.

273
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,406
Niaoniao?

274
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:19,085
Didn't I tell you to forget about us?

275
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:20,686
Why did you come here?

276
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:22,325
Why must she forget about us?

277
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:23,926
Niaoniao,

278
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,486
you're marrying a general soon.

279
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,085
Can you think of a way

280
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,486
to save the Cheng Family?

281
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,886
Mother, Grandmother, Yangyang,

282
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:35,486
Song and Shaogong.

283
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:36,765
Don't worry.

284
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,285
I'll think of a way

285
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:39,646
to clear Father's name.

286
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,486
No!

287
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,285
You must not complicate the matter.

288
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:43,446
You must protect yourself.

289
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,166
I'd only feel at ease
if you don't get into trouble.

290
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,206
Mother,

291
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,646
I've already performed divination.

292
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,765
We may be in a threatening situation.
But it's not dangerous.

293
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:52,646
Niaoniao is the key
to turning the situation around.

294
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:53,525
Shut up!

295
00:19:57,245 --> 00:19:59,045
Niaoniao, come here.

296
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,686
Don't listen to your grandmother.

297
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:06,366
Go back to Changqiu Palace now.

298
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:08,325
I can watch them here.

299
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:09,966
We'll wait for your father to return.

300
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:12,285
Taking good care of yourself is
what matters most.

301
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:13,446
Do you understand?

302
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,285
Are you done talking?

303
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:19,926
Can I talk now?

304
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,005
Niaoniao,

305
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:29,126
let me see if you've lost weight.

306
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,085
Grandmother,

307
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,245
we were only locked up for half a day.

308
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:33,966
Even if Niaoniao is plump,

309
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,966
it's impossible for her
to lose weight that quickly.

310
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,765
Quiet! What do you know?

311
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:39,245
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

312
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:46,486
Niaoniao,

313
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:48,406
come closer to me.

314
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:50,085
I can't see you clearly.

315
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:53,406
Come here.

316
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:56,845
Niaoniao,

317
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:59,966
I've hidden some money.

318
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:02,926
Those are my life.

319
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:08,845
I want you to go back to the residence

320
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,565
and get the money

321
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,166
to save your father
and your uncles. Understand?

322
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,245
Grandmother,

323
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:20,245
I've misjudged you.

324
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,446
You're not a selfish person.

325
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,605
Save as many as you can.

326
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,646
But remember.

327
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:31,005
Save the men first.

328
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:34,726
The men.

329
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:39,605
We'll take this route.

330
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:40,845
No, we can't.

331
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:41,805
Why not?

332
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:42,886
This is the only route.

333
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,005
If we don't take this route,
what other route should we take?

334
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,206
The bandits are here.
How can we take this route?

335
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:49,726
Young Master,

336
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,045
there are numerous bandits
on this route.

337
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,726
If we take this route to Shouchun,

338
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:54,366
we must take care of the bandits first.

339
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,126
After all, there aren't only us

340
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,406
marching this time.

341
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,406
We still have those lads
from the aristocratic families.

342
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:01,045
If anything happens to them,

343
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,285
those officials

344
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:04,646
will put the blame on you.

345
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,646
It's troublesome bringing
these burdens along.

346
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,285
Young Master was
being considerate of them.

347
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:10,805
Yet, they took it for granted.

348
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:12,966
They said General Ling was a coward.

349
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,206
They even said we don't dare
to suppress the bandits.

350
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:16,486
It's all right.

351
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,166
I've already made an arrangement.

352
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,206
What arrangement?

353
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,126
Report!

354
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:26,406
General Ling,

355
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:28,126
those noble kids didn't heed our advice

356
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,765
and went to suppress the bandits
without permission.

357
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:18,765
We released the news
that the bandits had won

358
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,406
and captured the noble kids.

359
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:22,285
Peng Kun actually believed it.

360
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,486
So he took the chance
while we suffered from defeat

361
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,045
to plunder provisions back to the city.

362
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,926
We'll make sure
he never returns this time.

363
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:34,285
General,

364
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:35,845
Ling Buyi is not

365
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:37,366
as capable as they said.

366
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:38,765
At this time,

367
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,206
they must still be struggling
to save people.

368
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:41,525
They wouldn't have expected

369
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:42,845
that we already had
our hands on provisions.

370
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:45,446
It happened in a timely manner.

371
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,686
While they suppress the bandits,

372
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,486
we can benefit from it.

373
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:39,085
Ling Buyi?

374
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,765
General Liang,

375
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:42,926
it's as you said.

376
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:44,926
Benefit from the fight.

377
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:47,366
But we're the ones benefiting

378
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:48,966
while you are

379
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,726
the one on the losing end.

380
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,005
Ling Buyi,

381
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:11,085
you actually used
the noble kids as baits

382
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:12,045
to lure me!

383
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,686
Aren't you afraid
the bandits will kill them

384
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:17,285
and the officials blame you for it?

385
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,045
Who told you

386
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,845
that they fell into the bandits' hands?

387
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:23,126
What?

388
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:26,166
You killed them yourself?

389
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:29,045
You're shameless!

390
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:30,206
If I didn't order my men

391
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:31,646
to capture those noble kids,

392
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,926
how would I make Peng Kun believe

393
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:36,285
that our vanguard was defeated
and taken as prisoners

394
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:37,565
and I put

395
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:40,206
my energy into rescuing them?

396
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:41,285
Ling Buyi!

397
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:43,085
You're vile

398
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:44,525
and cunning!

399
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,886
Look at you putting on a chicken armor.

400
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,325
Do you call yourself a general?

401
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:51,845
You're not even qualified
to carry General Peng's shoes!

402
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:53,206
This isn't chicken!

403
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:54,926
It's mandarin duck armor!

404
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:56,166
It's obviously chicken armor!

405
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:07,886
It's mandarin duck armor.

406
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:09,805
It's not chicken armor.

407
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:22,686
But you were right about one thing.

408
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:25,085
If those noble kids find out

409
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:26,966
that we dressed up as bandits
and captured them to be used as bait

410
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,285
to lure you,

411
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,085
it's indeed hard to explain
to the officials.

412
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:35,446
So only a dead man is

413
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:38,206
trustworthy.

414
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:39,565
You can't kill me!

415
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:40,966
You captured me alive

416
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,005
because you wanted
to learn about Shouchun's state.

417
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:44,166
If you kill me,

418
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,245
you won't find out anything!

419
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:48,126
With Shouchun's current defense layout,

420
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:50,206
you wouldn't be able to capture
the city for more than a year!

421
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:52,805
But Shouchun has

422
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,926
no food supply anymore.

423
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:58,085
Shouchun...

424
00:26:58,245 --> 00:26:59,686
Shouchun doesn't lack anything at all!

425
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,085
If it doesn't lack anything at all,

426
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:03,206
Peng Kun can just stay in the city

427
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,486
and wait for us to take the city.

428
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:07,486
Why did he take the risk
by sending you out?

429
00:27:10,285 --> 00:27:12,285
The provision you brought back is

430
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:15,565
to replenish Shouchun's food supply,
isn't it?

431
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:23,565
If you can't give me

432
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,285
any useful information,

433
00:27:29,686 --> 00:27:31,525
there's nothing
I can help you with anymore.

434
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:34,565
Take him away.

435
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,000
(Shouchun City Defense Map)

436
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:48,166
Young Master,

437
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:50,805
Shouchun's city wall is defended
on all sides.

438
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,765
The city gate is a drawbridge,

439
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,126
which is raised and lowered with chains.

440
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,845
When it's lowered,
it's used as a suspension bridge.

441
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:57,565
There's a moat outside the city too.

442
00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:58,845
If the drawbridge is not lowered,

443
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,886
I'm afraid it'll be hard
for the troops to enter.

444
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:01,886
That's not a problem.

445
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:03,005
We have a moat crossing bridge.

446
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:04,126
Once we attached it to the other side

447
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:05,686
and let the Black Armored Guard cross,

448
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,045
we'll kill them all.

449
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:08,166
We must not send the cavalry.

450
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,366
They have deer horn wood
and punji stakes.

451
00:28:12,285 --> 00:28:13,565
The best way to attack is
by using strategy,

452
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:14,845
cutting down the enemy's communication,

453
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:16,565
and attacking them.

454
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:18,486
Attacking a fortified city is
a bad idea.

455
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,366
It's not worth
suffering heavy casualties

456
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:21,805
just to capture Shouchun.

457
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:24,406
Attacking what?

458
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:27,765
What did Young Master mean?

459
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:28,686
He meant

460
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:31,126
we'll suffer heavy casualties
if we station under fortified cities.

461
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,605
It's not a good idea to send the troops.

462
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:35,085
Young Master can't bear
to see that happen.

463
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:36,565
What?

464
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:37,726
Qi,

465
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:39,765
I don't understand what you
and Young Master are saying.

466
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,446
Just tell me if we're going
to attack or not.

467
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:42,206
No.

468
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:43,926
No?

469
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:46,726
Did we come all the way from the capital

470
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:48,406
to Shouchun not to fight?

471
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:49,206
The Black Armored Guard

472
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,126
had braved countless dangers

473
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,525
with Young Master.

474
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:55,085
Young Master doesn't want them
to die in vain in Shouchun.

475
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:02,166
Peng Kun will send someone out
to gather food supplies again.

476
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,966
We only need
to block their reinforcement.

477
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,926
Shouchun's defense will not last
for more than a month

478
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,646
and will collapse without any fight.

479
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,845
How many days would that be?

480
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,126
Young Master,

481
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:14,926
Lady Cheng is still waiting
for you to marry her.

482
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:17,605
Don't worry.

483
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,605
You'll attend the wedding.

484
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:26,045
Report!

485
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,005
News from the capital.

486
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:36,045
Tongniu County has been breached.

487
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:37,486
Official Yan and General Cheng Shi

488
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:38,726
had taken 2000 refined copper
and defected to the enemies.

489
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:40,406
Yan Zhong and Cheng Shi's
whereabouts are unknown.

490
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:41,966
His Majesty has imprisoned

491
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:43,245
all of the Cheng Family.

492
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,406
What about Cheng Shaoshang?

493
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:46,245
Lady Cheng escaped
from the capital all night.

494
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:47,605
Her whereabouts are unknown.

495
00:29:57,966 --> 00:29:58,966
Child, come here.

496
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:00,565
I'll tell you what happened.

497
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:03,206
That day,

498
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:04,966
Official Yan took his family

499
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,605
and General Cheng Shi

500
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,886
out of the city with a cart.

501
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:11,085
He said he would return on the same day.

502
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,245
Unexpectedly,
someone used Official Yan's

503
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,325
county magistrate seal
to open the city gate

504
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:16,605
on that same day.

505
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:18,845
When the gate was opened,

506
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:22,886
it was actually Ma Rong
from Shouchun's rebel army.

507
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:26,005
After Ma Rong seized Tongniu County,

508
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:28,085
he tied up and paraded
the deputy county magistrates,

509
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:30,565
Official Li Feng and Official Yin Lao

510
00:30:30,805 --> 00:30:32,805
who refused to surrender
through the streets.

511
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,486
If you must know,

512
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:37,486
Li Feng kept reproaching

513
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:40,325
Yan Zhong and General Cheng

514
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:41,486
had defected to the enemy.

515
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:43,765
All the onlookers

516
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:45,726
heard him very clearly.

517
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:47,245
Since Li Feng rather die than surrender,

518
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,206
why didn't Ma Rong kill him?

519
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,926
Well, he didn't kill him.

520
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:53,446
Ma Rong only paraded
Li Feng and the rest

521
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:55,166
through the streets.

522
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:57,245
After that, he imprisoned them.

523
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,726
I'm not sure if he'll kill them.

524
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:01,726
In that case,

525
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,166
after Ma Rong seized Tongniu County,

526
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,686
he didn't harm the people.

527
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,686
He only imprisoned Li Feng

528
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:09,366
who refused to surrender.

529
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:10,486
That's right.

530
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:12,085
I didn't expect

531
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,886
that Ma Rong is not a bad person.

532
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:19,926
Mister.

533
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:21,926
When you enter the city
to collect human waste,

534
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,486
do they inspect your cart?

535
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:31,726
Tongniu County is breached

536
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:32,845
and we have yet to capture Shouchun.

537
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:34,085
His Majesty has no time
to be distracted.

538
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:35,565
So the case was put on hold.

539
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:38,085
He only ordered to recapture
Tongniu County and question Li Feng.

540
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:39,366
But Official Zuo insisted

541
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,085
on saying Lady Cheng fled
to escape punishment.

542
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:42,325
Her action proves that Marquis Quling

543
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:43,845
had defected to the enemy to be true.

544
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:45,926
What nonsense.

545
00:31:46,325 --> 00:31:47,206
Young Master,

546
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:48,085
Official Zuo

547
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:49,406
uses his position

548
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:50,366
to slander Young Madam

549
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,646
out of a personal grudge

550
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:52,565
because you beat him up.

551
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:54,805
Why don't we attack the city
and end it quickly?

552
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:55,765
We can't.

553
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:57,886
Our brothers followed me to battle.

554
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:00,085
They also have families waiting
for their return.

555
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,605
I can't let them sacrifice their lives

556
00:32:02,726 --> 00:32:03,966
because of my family.

557
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:05,005
Young Master,

558
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,005
the longer we delay,

559
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:07,926
Young Madam's life would be
in even more danger.

560
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,406
We can't delay this anymore.

561
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,686
She's my future wife.

562
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:14,646
Her problem is my problem.

563
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:16,285
But even so,

564
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:18,325
I can't implicate the whole army

565
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:19,966
because of me.

566
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,005
I'll make another arrangement.

567
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:25,005
Go.

568
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,486
Bring Liang Yi to me.

569
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:35,206
What now?

570
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:37,245
Are you trying to make me tell you

571
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,686
Shouchun's defense layout?

572
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,565
I suggest you not waste your time.

573
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,565
I'll never betray the general!

574
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,166
I don't need you to betray anyone.

575
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,406
I only want you to answer one question.

576
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:56,966
What is it?

577
00:32:57,565 --> 00:32:58,446
Tell me.

578
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:03,406
Is this chicken

579
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:06,126
or mandarin duck?

580
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:07,966
Didn't I say it's...

581
00:33:09,646 --> 00:33:10,446
If you answer correctly,

582
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:12,406
I'll let you go.

583
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:14,605
If you don't answer,

584
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,005
I'll kill you.

585
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:24,605
Mandarin duck?

586
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:31,565
Release him.

587
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,800
(Shouchun City)

588
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:49,486
Over here.

589
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:50,966
Hey, what are you doing?

590
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:52,886
Do you know how many of my men died

591
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:53,926
to bring back the food supply?

592
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,206
You better don't ruin them!

593
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:58,805
Sir,

594
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,285
Ling Buyi is nearby

595
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:01,686
so we had to inspect thoroughly

596
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:03,525
to avoid any spy from entering Shouchun.

597
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,366
Everything is fine!

598
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:09,926
Sir, you may enter.

599
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:17,486
I want to ask you something.

600
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:22,926
Do chicken and mandarin duck

601
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:24,805
look similar?

602
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:26,486
Sir, they're not similar at all.

603
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:30,325
I think so too.

604
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,206
There must be something wrong
with this guy.

605
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:35,805
Sir, who are you talking about?

606
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:42,325
Move it!

607
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,520
(Shouchun County)

608
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:37,926
Who's there?

609
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:42,726
Huo Chong?

610
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,760
(Peng Kun)

611
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,366
Are you here to take my life?

612
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,085
It wasn't me.

613
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:50,926
It wasn't me.

614
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,246
I wasn't the one who harmed you.

615
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,685
Trouble eating and sleeping.

616
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,886
Sleepless nights.

617
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:01,005
General Peng, you're sure guilt-ridden.

618
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,486
You're not Huo Chong.

619
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:10,165
Who are you?

620
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:13,565
You've been hiding out
in Shouchun for too long.

621
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,525
Of course, you don't know me.

622
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,886
I'm Ling Buyi.

623
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:34,286
I didn't expect Emperor Wen

624
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,446
would send you to lead the army
to attack me.

625
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:42,565
I suggest you leave right away.

626
00:36:43,406 --> 00:36:44,525
If anything happened to me,

627
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:47,286
it wouldn't end well
for your father either.

628
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,766
What do you mean by this?

629
00:36:49,246 --> 00:36:50,246
General,

630
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,286
why are you still not sleeping
at this late hour?

631
00:36:58,326 --> 00:36:59,565
Dear, run for your life!

632
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:02,085
Guards! Assassin!

633
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:08,125
Assassin! Hurry!

634
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:18,446
Ling Buyi,

635
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:21,045
should I praise you for your boldness

636
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,846
or laugh at you for your foolishness?

637
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:26,926
I can't believe you break
into the city alone.

638
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,366
Do you not want to live anymore?

639
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,125
As long as I give out my order,

640
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:52,486
your body will be full of holes
from the arrows.

641
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,446
Even if you're highly skilled,

642
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:56,645
you can never escape from Shouchun city.

643
00:37:56,766 --> 00:37:58,045
Before they kill me,

644
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:59,406
my sword can be faster.

645
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,005
We can both die together.

646
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,446
Do you want to test me?

647
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,806
Didn't your father tell you

648
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:15,806
that we're on the same boat?

649
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:17,766
If I die,

650
00:38:18,645 --> 00:38:20,125
it won't benefit him at all.

651
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,125
What do you mean?

652
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:22,886
If you want to know the truth,

653
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:24,846
let me go.

654
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:28,806
If I die,

655
00:38:29,246 --> 00:38:31,045
no one will know

656
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:33,846
the truth of Gu City's downfall.

657
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:38,246
Attention soldiers of Shouchun city!

658
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:40,165
I rather die

659
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,645
with Ling Buyi.

660
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:44,725
As long as he dares to take
a step outside of Shouchun City,

661
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:46,645
kill him without mercy

662
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:48,005
even if I have to die!

663
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:49,005
Yes, General!

664
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,886
Black Armored Guard! Heed your orders!

665
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:56,246
Young Master is inside!

666
00:38:56,406 --> 00:38:58,725
Go in with me!

667
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:01,125
Attack!

668
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:09,725
Use the scaling ladder
and breach the city!

669
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:10,886
Attack!

670
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:14,005
Ling Buyi,

671
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:16,326
your brothers are just outside the city.

672
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,246
As long as I give my order,

673
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:19,886
all of them will die

674
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:21,005
along with me today.

675
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:23,286
Attention archers!

676
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:25,286
My life doesn't matter!

677
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:28,286
I want you to kill all those people
outside the city!

678
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:30,685
I want you

679
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:32,406
to kill each and everyone

680
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:33,926
who enters!

681
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:34,846
Yes, Sir!

682
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:52,446
Watch out for the arrows!

683
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:03,125
Brothers!

684
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:04,645
Young Master is inside the city!

685
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:06,205
Even if we die out here,

686
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:07,846
we must open the gate!

687
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,165
This gate is

688
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:11,645
a drawbridge.

689
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:14,045
It can't be opened from the outside.

690
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:16,286
You only have a blade in your hand.

691
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,446
How many can you kill?

692
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:46,205
Darn you, Ling Buyi.

693
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:47,806
Kill him!

694
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:28,045
Go and stop him!

695
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:28,926
Stop him!

696
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:49,966
Go and stop him!

697
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:52,806
Don't let him near the lever!

698
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:06,645
Attack!

699
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:08,926
Attack!

700
00:42:54,045 --> 00:42:54,926
Kill him!

701
00:43:19,406 --> 00:43:20,725
You useless things!

702
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,806
You can't even stop one person!

703
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:24,565
Attack!

704
00:44:23,645 --> 00:44:25,525
Young Master has opened the gate!

705
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:27,406
Brothers, attack!

706
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,205
Attack!

707
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:51,645
This soft armor is made

708
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:53,605
of copper wire mixed with hemp.

709
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:55,605
It's not only soft
but pretty resistant to blade attack.

710
00:44:55,846 --> 00:44:57,846
It can protect your life
at a critical time.

711
00:45:06,886 --> 00:45:08,326
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

712
00:45:09,326 --> 00:45:10,165
Fei.

713
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:15,806
Qi.

714
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:18,326
I'm not hurt.

715
00:45:23,205 --> 00:45:24,446
What are the casualties?

716
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:26,525
Luckily, you manage
to open the gate in time.

717
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:27,766
We didn't suffer a huge casualty.

718
00:45:30,966 --> 00:45:32,286
Escort Peng Kun back to the capital

719
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:33,886
for trial immediately.

720
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,846
Those with their hands stained
with our soldiers' blood

721
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,165
will be killed on the spot.

722
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:39,685
As for the rest,

723
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:42,725
if they don't kill our soldiers
and oppress the people,

724
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:44,286
spare their lives.

725
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:45,085
Yes, Young Master.

726
00:45:45,725 --> 00:45:48,125
After Young Master
has Young Madam in your life,

727
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:49,205
you've become a soft-hearted person.

728
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,045
Shut up.

729
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:52,246
Young Master,

730
00:45:52,446 --> 00:45:54,326
let's head back to the capital now.

731
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:02,286
No.

732
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:04,525
Attention Black Armored Guard!

733
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:05,645
Yes, Sir!

734
00:46:05,645 --> 00:46:08,045
We shall set out Tongniu County at once!

735
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:08,725
Yes, Sir!

736
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:10,286
I found out Peng Kun's deputy general,

737
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:11,366
Ma Rong has captured Tongniu County.

738
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:12,806
But within two days,

739
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:15,125
he surrendered after being persuaded
by Young Master Lou Ben.

740
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:16,486
General Cheng is missing

741
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:18,045
and everyone
in the Cheng Family is imprisoned.

742
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,286
Shaoshang will not sit by
and do nothing.

743
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:22,525
She didn't leave the capital
to flee from punishment.

744
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,366
She must have left
to investigate the truth.

745
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:26,565
So she must be in Tongniu County.
