1
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like the Galaxy=

2
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:01,343
I'm sure you can see now

3
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,184
how the second chamber
of the Lou family is being treated.

4
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:04,544
Let me ask you.

5
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:05,784
Have you regretted?

6
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:08,263
About what?

7
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:09,544
Nowadays,

8
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:12,544
every family has trouble
with their relationships.

9
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,544
Grandmother and Second Aunt are
not in a good relationship

10
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:21,664
but you still married here.

11
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:24,423
How can you compare that?

12
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:26,464
No matter how scary your grandmother

13
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:27,903
and second aunt is,

14
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,303
the family still relies

15
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,664
on your father's glory in battles.

16
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,743
I'm not afraid of this relationship

17
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:39,544
because your father is protecting me.

18
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:43,624
But Lou Yao
has a lowly position in the family.

19
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:45,584
How can he protect you in the future?

20
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:48,024
Forget about him for a moment.

21
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,584
Even his brother

22
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,223
also depends on the first chamber

23
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,184
and couldn't protect his own wife.

24
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:55,783
As a couple,

25
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:58,263
there's no saying that
one must protect the other.

26
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,343
I think Yao is quite nice.

27
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,863
He is loyal and honest.

28
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,743
He has none of the habits of
those prodigal sons in the capital.

29
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,343
He will be successful one day.

30
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:09,544
I've discussed it with Yao.

31
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,704
As long as he can become
a local magistrate,

32
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:14,104
even if it's not as comfortable
as the capital,

33
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,464
we can still enjoy a lavish life.

34
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:21,544
In that case,

35
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,263
I'm sure you can be relieved now.

36
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:24,343
This wife

37
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,504
will be good for Yao.

38
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:27,584
Before this,

39
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,263
I was worried
that this Fourth Lady Cheng

40
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:31,184
was as rude as they say.

41
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,223
It seems now

42
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:34,984
that my thinking was shallow.

43
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:39,464
Fourth Lady is
intelligent and open-minded.

44
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:40,903
After Yao knew her,

45
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:43,144
he became happier

46
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,144
and only wants to
become a local magistrate.

47
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:46,343
However,

48
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:50,064
Yao's thinking is still too naive.

49
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,303
I'm worried about Uncle.

50
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:53,823
Nothing is absolute.

51
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:55,504
Didn't you say

52
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:58,184
His Majesty yearns for talents
and is getting anyone he can?

53
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:01,184
You are wise in strategies
and intelligent as well.

54
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:02,943
I believe not long after,

55
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:04,903
you will definitely have
the opportunity to be successful.

56
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:11,224
Do you know why Lou Yao's brother

57
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:13,023
didn't become an official

58
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:16,304
even if he is good
in academics and martial arts?

59
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:20,544
Is it because

60
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,743
of the Lou family's first chamber?

61
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:24,704
His Majesty

62
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,823
wants to stop a family from
taking away all the official positions

63
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,664
from talented people who are poor

64
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:32,183
so there's a rule to stop every
family member from becoming an official.

65
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:34,823
Old Madam Lou

66
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:36,903
wants her own son to become an official

67
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:40,664
so she interfered with
the second chamber's son's future

68
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:41,983
and forced Lou Ben

69
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,624
to give up on becoming an official.

70
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:46,103
Until now,

71
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,704
Old Madam Cheng finally got her wish.

72
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,464
Unfortunately,

73
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:56,624
Grand Tutor Lou's two sons
are both disappointing.

74
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:58,183
They couldn't get His Majesty's favour.

75
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:03,783
She was too clever for her own good.

76
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:12,584
Young Master.

77
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:14,704
We just took down
some of Prince Xiao's partisans.

78
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:17,624
A few of them wanted
to take poison to commit suicide

79
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,504
but we stopped and captured them.

80
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,344
What should we do next?

81
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:22,464
Keep them alive.

82
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:23,743
Interrogate them

83
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,704
and see what clues
Prince Xiao has left behind.

84
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:26,143
Yes.

85
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,224
Report! Young Master.

86
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:33,544
Say it.

87
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:34,704
Young Master.

88
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:35,983
We've already seized the brothels

89
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,464
and theatres that Prince Xiao frequents.

90
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,103
We also searched all the businessmen

91
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,624
who are closely related to Prince Xiao.

92
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,743
These businessmen are so scared

93
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,264
that they packed all their valuables
and leave the capital at night

94
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:46,143
to hide in their hometown.

95
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,823
Set up roadblocks along the way.

96
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,224
Tell them

97
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:51,023
we won't trouble them

98
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,504
if they tell the truth.

99
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:53,983
Yes.

100
00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,943
I heard His Majesty has
summoned Lord Yong

101
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:01,743
back to the capital
with an imperial edict

102
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,224
but Lord Yong refuses saying
he has fallen ill as an excuse.

103
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,823
I believe something's wrong
in the imperial court.

104
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:11,863
Are you thinking...

105
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:14,823
Since the imperial court needs me,

106
00:06:15,664 --> 00:06:16,823
it's time

107
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:20,584
to meet my old friend.

108
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,341
Stop.

109
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:23,874
First Madam. Young Lady.

110
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:25,073
I think something happened in front.

111
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:26,273
The guards won't allow us to pass.

112
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:30,594
What is it?

113
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,073
Lady Cheng.

114
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:50,273
General Ling.

115
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:52,993
What happened in front?

116
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:54,754
It's just a routine check.

117
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,514
It's not safe along the way.

118
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:03,594
Allow me

119
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:05,353
to escort both of you back.

120
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,353
We won't trouble General Ling.

121
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,874
Since it's an important mission,

122
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:11,073
how can you leave your post?

123
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:12,954
I am conducting an investigation here.

124
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:14,273
Escorting both of you

125
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,393
is just something I can do on my way.

126
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:19,393
I think the capital
will be in chaos for a while longer.

127
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,153
Lady Cheng, it's better

128
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:23,554
to not leave your residence so often.

129
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:26,233
General, don't worry.

130
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,674
I'm just going to the Lou residence

131
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,914
to discuss the marriage recently.

132
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,393
General Ling.

133
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,393
We already have an engagement
with the Lou family.

134
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:38,674
In a few more days,

135
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,313
The Lou family will have a banquet.

136
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,754
Tell my youngest daughter

137
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:44,993
and the Lou family's second chamber
and her son about our wedding.

138
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,273
If General Ling is free,

139
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:48,674
you can go to Lou residence

140
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,193
and have a drink.

141
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,634
I am busy with my mission.

142
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:53,954
I might not be free.

143
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,313
What a pity.

144
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,113
In that case,

145
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,914
Yao and I will have to
visit you in the future.

146
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,834
Let me send both of you back.

147
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,193
It's getting late.

148
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,153
Let them through.

149
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,634
Yes. Let them through.

150
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,834
Prince Xiao's Residence
and Cheng's Residence

151
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,554
are in opposite directions.

152
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:52,754
How is it along the way?

153
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,794
We must be thorough
since we are investigating.

154
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:58,233
Young Master, are you suspecting

155
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,594
General Cheng and Prince Xiao
to be conspiring together?

156
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:12,782
What?

157
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:15,223
Mother actually
allowed Yuan Shen to teach all of you?

158
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:18,702
Not just us. You as well.

159
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,463
Mother said Shanjian is knowledgeable.

160
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,543
Listening to his lesson
is better than reading ten scrolls.

161
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:24,503
Grandmother said

162
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,862
since the gift was expensive,

163
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:27,102
it's not worth it
if he only teaches the boys.

164
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,822
So, all of us have to study.

165
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,982
The more the better.

166
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:31,263
Including you.

167
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,102
But... But I'm a daughter.

168
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,383
Even if mother wants to hire,

169
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:36,662
she should hire a female teacher.

170
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:38,143
You'll be married to Yao

171
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:38,982
and become his wife anyway.

172
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,303
there's no need to do anything

173
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:41,463
to avoid suspicion.

174
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:43,022
The Lou family prioritises rules.

175
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:45,902
Yao, don't worry.

176
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:47,862
I will definitely
not listen to his lessons.

177
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,343
No.

178
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,742
Even Uncle praises

179
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,183
Shanjian's knowledge.

180
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,143
Shaoshang.

181
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,543
Can I attend

182
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:56,982
Shanjian's lesson with you

183
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,022
to have a look?

184
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,143
At what?

185
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,503
At how domineering he is.

186
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,822
I've seen enough of that.
I won't be attending.

187
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:08,022
Niaoniao, just accept your fate.

188
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:10,062
I had a divination today.

189
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:12,543
You have no choice
but to attend Yuan Shanjian's lesson.

190
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,263
But don't worry.

191
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,583
I can give you a divination every day.

192
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,583
If it's a bad omen,
just pretend to be sick.

193
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,423
We will definitely cover for you

194
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,902
so you won't be embarrassed
when there are questions.

195
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,022
Do you even need to do that?

196
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:27,583
A person who knows nothing
against someone who is knowledgeable.

197
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:29,702
I predict it will be hard to watch.

198
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,503
Your divination

199
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,183
will definitely
be bad omens for every day.

200
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:34,702
Bad omens cannot be predicted.

201
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:38,822
I heard from a fellow student
from Bailu Academy

202
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,702
that Shanjian used to
takeover a lesson from Mr. Huangfu.

203
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,702
He has a lot of different punishments.

204
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:47,183
Don't worry, Shaoshang.

205
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,662
I'll accompany you if you get punished.

206
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:53,583
Niaoniao.

207
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:55,383
I have an idea

208
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:56,942
so you won't be the worst student.

209
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:00,782
You can

210
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,062
beg Mr. Wan

211
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:03,662
to send Wan Qiqi here.

212
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:05,982
With Qiqi at the bottom,

213
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:08,022
you won't be the one
who receive the worst punishment.

214
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:12,423
That's right.

215
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,223
Good friends

216
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,383
should suffer together.

217
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:21,702
But I will tell Qiqi

218
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:22,742
that this idea

219
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,583
was thought by Second Brother.

220
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,022
Good idea, Second Brother.

221
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:28,902
Thanks, Second Brother.

222
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:29,782
Let's go.

223
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,902
Where's your loyalty?

224
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:56,902
Is that made from gold?

225
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,143
There's so many.

226
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,022
That is nice.

227
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,822
We were in a rush

228
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:49,583
and can barely prepare for your arrival.

229
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:55,902
This is the tiger skin
that Mr. Wan hunted, right?

230
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,543
You used it as a cushion

231
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,383
and said you just barely prepared?

232
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,623
We only made a cushion out of it.

233
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:02,862
I haven't use gold threads

234
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,343
and put pearls on it.

235
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:06,263
This is so normal.
Of course, I won't even be interested.

236
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:07,942
Setting pearls on a cushion?

237
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:09,343
Won't it hurt you?

238
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:11,102
You spent so much money.

239
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,383
You will probably spend all

240
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:13,383
your future husband's family's money.

241
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:14,583
My future husband doesn't mind that.

242
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,503
Why do you care?

243
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:19,862
Why are only these three desks
decorated like this?

244
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:22,343
Those are for the maidservants.

245
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,583
You can make your own decorations.

246
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:29,102
Cheng Yang.

247
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:30,102
Where do you want to sit?

248
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:31,822
I'm fine.

249
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,343
Where is Qiqi sitting?

250
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:34,702
I'll sit in the middle.

251
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:37,022
You can sit on my left.

252
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,263
Shaoshang can sit on my right.

253
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:38,982
All right.

254
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:43,543
All of you, sit behind.

255
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,583
Qiqi prepared these

256
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,702
especially for Cousin and I.

257
00:13:58,022 --> 00:13:58,902
This candlestick

258
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:00,942
is so heavy.

259
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:02,742
It is made with real gold.

260
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:03,742
If you like it,

261
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:05,062
just take it.

262
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:07,263
It's shiny

263
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,503
even if it's not lighted.

264
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:11,143
Qiqi.

265
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:13,303
You are generous and meticulous.

266
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,543
With our families' relationship,

267
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:16,982
I'll definitely marry you

268
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,022
if you are a boy.

269
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,263
It's fine even if
Shaoshang doesn't marry to your family.

270
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:24,062
We have many boys at the Cheng family.

271
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:25,503
They can marry you, Qiqi.

272
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:26,423
Stop dreaming.

273
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:27,583
I won't marry you.

274
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,822
I'm not talking about me.

275
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:30,822
There's someone else.

276
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,223
Who do you mean?

277
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:40,223
Your eldest brother
has been married for many years.

278
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,383
He has a good relationship with his wife

279
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:43,662
and they are
guarding the borders together.

280
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,062
I can't ruin their relationship.

281
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:48,662
There's still my second brother.

282
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:00,902
I'd rather marry Shaoshang then.

283
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,782
Fourth Lady Cheng

284
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:07,343
is really popular.

285
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,383
Do you not mind
even if I'm a female now?

286
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:11,662
Fourth Lady.

287
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,102
As long as you study well,

288
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:15,623
you can marry any person you want

289
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:16,982
in the future.

290
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,782
Confucius answers Yan Hui's question.

291
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:33,263
There are four generations to a country.

292
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:38,583
Zizhang asks if the
next ten generations can be predicted.

293
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:51,503
A few days ago,

294
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:54,303
everyone in the imperial court
is discussing about Confucius.

295
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,742
They are arguing about this.

296
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:57,822
Someone said

297
00:15:58,263 --> 00:16:00,742
the policy of Zhou Dynasty
is a new policy from Confucius.

298
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:03,022
The ritual is just a fake.

299
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:04,862
Those who support the ancient studies

300
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:06,942
said if something were to happen

301
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:10,343
and all the rituals are carried out,

302
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,303
they will do it without
knowing the origins.

303
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,942
After studying Confucianism
for so long,

304
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:20,263
who do you think is right?

305
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:25,902
I think...

306
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:26,583
You.

307
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:29,662
You can answer.

308
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:44,303
Is it over?

309
00:16:58,303 --> 00:16:59,062
I...

310
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:02,623
I think no one is right.

311
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:04,902
Since he is a saint,

312
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:08,143
he should make
his words easier to understand.

313
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:10,463
When his words are easier to understand,

314
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:12,702
these people wouldn't have been confused

315
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:14,822
and there won't be an argument.

316
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,982
Madam.

317
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:28,782
I think Niaoniao has a point.

318
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:30,942
As a saint,

319
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,383
why didn't he make it clear

320
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,143
when his purpose was to spread
his teachings and solve confusion?

321
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:35,982
Speaking nonsense.

322
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,463
He was creating confusion
instead of solving confusion.

323
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,102
Like father like daughter indeed.

324
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,902
Niaoniao learned from you.

325
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:45,423
She even dared to question the saint.

326
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,662
The saint also said

327
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,942
to see no evil and hear no evil.

328
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:50,623
You brought me here

329
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:52,303
to eavesdrop.

330
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:53,982
I don't think
that's following the saint's teaching.

331
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:54,702
You...

332
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:00,543
If the Saint lives with both of you

333
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:01,742
for around a year,

334
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:04,143
I'm sure the Saint will be enraged.

335
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,702
The Lou family is a family of scholars.

336
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:11,543
They prioritise the Saint's teachings.

337
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:14,782
If you slack in your study,

338
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:18,543
how can you become
the Lou family's new wife?

339
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:28,822
Teacher, you cared too much.

340
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:30,583
Teacher.

341
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,022
Shaoshan's lack of knowledge

342
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,463
comes from the lack of education
when she was young.

343
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:35,583
She is very intelligent.

344
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:36,782
I'm sure she would be knowledgeable

345
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,942
if she was born in the Lou family.

346
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:40,782
Besides, it's not that
Shaoshang doesn't like to study.

347
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:43,303
She is more interested
in miscellaneous studies.

348
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,303
When she was in Hua County,

349
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:46,583
her craftsmanship

350
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,183
is way better than other craftsmen.

351
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,742
Yao knows me best.

352
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,303
First Madam asked me to teach you...

353
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:00,942
Come here.

354
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,982
Because she wants you
to marry into a family of scholars.

355
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:04,183
Why didn't Yuan Shanjian

356
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:06,183
ask Yangyang?

357
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:07,862
Yangyang is intelligent.

358
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:10,183
I'm sure she can answer it well.

359
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,022
These scholars

360
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:15,822
obviously have nothing to do

361
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:17,902
and study useless things like this.

362
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,822
They learned all these

363
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,383
but they can't make more crops grow

364
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:24,702
or more clothes
to be made in the winter.

365
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,303
It's not useful at all

366
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:28,102
for the people's daily lives.

367
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:30,183
There's no use even if they learn it.

368
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:35,303
Actually,

369
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:37,982
I think Master Yuan is right.

370
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,062
Qin Shi Huang burned the books
and buried the scholars

371
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:43,223
and caused
a break in culture and history.

372
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,702
We can see that

373
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:46,503
it's important to think.

374
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:49,543
It's not useless at all
to learn about these knowledge.

375
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:51,223
After all,

376
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,423
someone has to know about that.

377
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:57,623
Since Young Lady

378
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,423
thinks what I teach is useless.

379
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:01,463
Fine,

380
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:02,942
from today onwards,

381
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:05,223
I will talk about something useful.

382
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,503
Since you'll become someone's wife soon,

383
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:09,782
why don't I

384
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,022
tell you some couple stories

385
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,583
and learn some songs and poems

386
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:16,902
so your future husband

387
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,102
won't feel bored.

388
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:20,583
How is that?

389
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,503
Are you serious?

390
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:27,702
From now onwards,

391
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:29,463
I just have to listen to stories?

392
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:32,062
You'll choose.

393
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:33,902
Do you want to listen

394
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:37,623
about "Hiding One's Mistress
in A Golden House" and "Chang Men Fu"

395
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:41,463
or "Courting of a Phoenix"
and "To a Faithless Husband"?

396
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,662
The Golden House still exists

397
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,942
but the lover no longer
exists in Chang Men Palace.

398
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:11,702
It shows that every couple in this world

399
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,623
seemed like they were
meant for each other when they first met

400
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:18,022
and couldn't be separated
to make the marriage a success.

401
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:19,583
But in the end,

402
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,782
love will still fade.

403
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:24,782
Do you think becoming strangers

404
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:27,463
is the worst that can happen
to a separated couple?

405
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:29,102
Wrong.

406
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:32,143
Young Lady, you've never met

407
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:35,543
a couple with grudge
that can't wait to see the other die.

408
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:39,102
The person
who can hurt you the most in this world

409
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:41,263
is coincidentally

410
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:44,503
the partner you thought
you can live your life with

411
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:46,662
forever.

412
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:50,902
Keep searching!

413
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,742
We must find the consort

414
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:54,942
and the son of He.

415
00:21:55,902 --> 00:21:56,942
I want to find them no matter

416
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:58,183
if they are dead or alive.

417
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,383
Yes!

418
00:22:03,942 --> 00:22:05,062
Where is Zhaojun?

419
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,942
Where is Zhaojun?

420
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:10,822
Today is my wedding with Zhaojun

421
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:12,702
but she disappeared.

422
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:14,143
You are her wet nurse.

423
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,862
You watched her grow up.

424
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,702
I'm sure you are
as worried as me, right?

425
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,383
Quick. Tell me.

426
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:24,102
Where is Zhaojun
and her younger brother?

427
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:25,623
Mister.

428
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,583
I really don't know.

429
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:30,543
You don't know?

430
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:38,102
Zhaojun is my new wife.

431
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,223
I am her family.

432
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:42,183
As long as she returns to me

433
00:22:42,423 --> 00:22:43,543
to persuade father-in-law

434
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,183
to stand on the same side
with the Xiao family,

435
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:46,583
I won't treat Shaojun

436
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:49,343
and the He family badly

437
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:51,782
when my father becomes the emperor.

438
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:52,982
At that time,

439
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:56,343
the Shao and He family
will share the empire.

440
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,303
Isn't that wonderful?

441
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:00,862
The He family is upright.

442
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:03,102
How can they conspire with a traitor?

443
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:10,343
Fine.

444
00:23:11,263 --> 00:23:12,383
I want to see

445
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,022
if he can still be upright

446
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:16,343
when his son and daughter

447
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:18,782
is in my hands.

448
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,303
You traitor! Traitor!

449
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,583
I am a traitor!

450
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:28,102
I am a traitor!

451
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:31,742
I am a traitor!

452
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,543
Yes. I am a traitor!

453
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:35,463
I am a traitor!

454
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:36,583
Traitor!

455
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,143
Come. Gouge her eyes.

456
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:40,902
If she still won't talk,

457
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:41,942
cut off her limbs.

458
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:42,623
Yes.

459
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:43,862
I want to see

460
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,463
whether she will die first

461
00:23:48,623 --> 00:23:51,062
or He Zhaojun will appear first.

462
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:54,503
Traitor! You will die a horrid death!

463
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:57,423
Looks like she still won't say it.

464
00:23:57,982 --> 00:23:59,343
There's no use leaving her here.

465
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:00,583
Kill her.

466
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:01,543
Yes.

467
00:24:49,503 --> 00:24:50,902
I'm sure everyone

468
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:53,022
has seen
Feng Yi County's military report.

469
00:24:53,263 --> 00:24:54,822
I want to hear

470
00:24:55,423 --> 00:24:56,942
what you think.

471
00:24:57,423 --> 00:24:58,423
Lord Yong and his son

472
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:00,303
used the alliance marriage

473
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:02,223
to trouble General He's relative

474
00:25:02,223 --> 00:25:04,782
to threaten General He
to ally with them and stage a rebellion.

475
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:07,543
This is an obvious betrayal.

476
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:08,742
Father,

477
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:09,822
I think

478
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:12,223
we should send troops immediately to
Feng Yi County to counter the rebellion

479
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:13,623
to serve as a warning.

480
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:15,263
Third Prince.

481
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:16,662
Lord Yong is

482
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:19,102
an old official who was the first
to follow father in his great cause.

483
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:20,223
I think

484
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:21,742
we should get him to surrender

485
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,982
to show our father's benevolence

486
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:25,782
and not forgetting
their relationship in the past.

487
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:29,143
Everything is about peace

488
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:31,982
when it comes down to the Crown Prince.

489
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,662
Since Lord Yong

490
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,143
can carry out such an ungrateful act,

491
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:39,102
I don't think
he cares of benevolence anymore.

492
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:41,303
Marquis Yue is right.

493
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:43,102
If we want a stable imperial court,

494
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,543
we need to carry out a heavy punishment
to serve as a warning.

495
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,623
Lord Yong's courage
is no worse than Emperor Li.

496
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:53,102
Only the Huo family army
could be on par with them back then.

497
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:54,623
Third Prince.

498
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:57,062
It's easy to talk about
countering the rebellion

499
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:58,343
but who can we send?

500
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:00,022
You can no longer find

501
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:03,062
another Huo Chong in the imperial court.

502
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:04,383
Grand Tutor Lou.

503
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:05,982
Everyone.

504
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:09,702
General He's eldest son

505
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,503
perished in battle yesterday morning.

506
00:26:16,862 --> 00:26:17,702
What?

507
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:19,702
How did you know?

508
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,062
I have an old friend.

509
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:22,383
For many years,

510
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:24,263
he has been a close friend.

511
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:26,982
He has a good eye.
He wanders all around the world

512
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:28,662
and know many wandering warriors.

513
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:30,022
One of the warriors

514
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:31,822
risked death to send this news

515
00:26:32,263 --> 00:26:34,782
to him from Feng Yi County.

516
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,022
General He and his sons

517
00:26:54,183 --> 00:26:56,223
are good at battle.

518
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,623
How could he die in battle?

519
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,623
General He went to Feng Yi County

520
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:01,702
to attend his daughter's wedding.

521
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,503
He didn't bring enough soldiers.

522
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,543
When he found out
about Lord Yong's intention to betray,

523
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:07,062
he risked his life

524
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:08,423
to stop Lord Yong's army
in Feng Yi County.

525
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:09,742
Otherwise,

526
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:11,543
all of you won't be able

527
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:13,022
to discuss about this calmly.

528
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:14,062
Is it a war

529
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:15,742
or are we at peace?

530
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:22,263
Your Majesty,

531
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:25,062
I request for us
to send troops and support them.

532
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,383
I am

533
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:28,343
willing to lead the army.

534
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:34,662
Zi Sheng.

535
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:36,303
Do you know

536
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,982
how young Lord Yong was

537
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:39,782
when he started to fight in battles?

538
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:41,383
He knows war

539
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:42,702
like the back of his hand.

540
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,503
Everyone in the He family
was a fierce warrior.

541
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:46,623
They were still in danger

542
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:48,702
when they faced him.

543
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:50,303
This is a tough battle.

544
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:51,503
Looks like

545
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,702
we need to send some

546
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:55,343
experienced generals.

547
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:56,423
My experience

548
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,223
is indeed lacking
compared to the old generals

549
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,543
but my ability in battlefield

550
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:02,102
is second to none.

551
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:03,623
I won't refuse the responsibility

552
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:05,662
to take down Lord Yong.

553
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:08,102
Father.

554
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:10,742
I think General Ling is right.

555
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:13,383
When it comes to ability in wars,

556
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:14,702
no one is better

557
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,463
than General Ling in the imperial court.

558
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,303
A long discussion is needed about this.

559
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:23,742
I believed in Lord Yongin the past.

560
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:24,942
I've never asked him

561
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,902
for his region's map.

562
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:29,423
Without the guide of the map,

563
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,143
this battle

564
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,263
will be even tougher.

565
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:34,782
At ease, Your Majesty.

566
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:36,742
That old friend of mine

567
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:39,022
is familiar
with Feng Yi County's terrain.

568
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:40,383
He can

569
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:42,183
draw the map.

570
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:43,503
What old friend?

571
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:46,143
You have many talents around you,
General Ling.

572
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:47,822
A talent like him

573
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:49,662
should be recommended
to join the imperial court.

574
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:51,623
Why did you hide him?

575
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:53,822
I think so too.

576
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:55,982
He should not be kept hidden.

577
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:00,543
Your Majesty.

578
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:02,143
I think

579
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:04,982
we should send General Wu
to provide immediate support.

580
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,423
When I get the map of Feng Yi County,

581
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:08,822
I will meet up with General Wu

582
00:29:08,902 --> 00:29:10,102
to defeat the enemy together.

583
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:14,343
In that case,

584
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:15,263
fine.

585
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:17,902
I'll grant you 30,000 troops.

586
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:20,583
But I expect a triumphant return.

587
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:22,022
Yes, Your Majesty.

588
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:24,982
I will also

589
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:27,263
wish for
General Ling's triumphant return.

590
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,742
What a pity.

591
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,742
I had an engagement banquet
in my residence tomorrow.

592
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:33,942
I wanted

593
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:36,423
to invite General Ling
to attend and have a drink.

594
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:37,303
Now,

595
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,062
I'm afraid it's too late.

596
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:41,463
What a coincidence.

597
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:44,982
The friend I am meeting

598
00:29:45,463 --> 00:29:46,742
is in your residence.

599
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:48,902
I think I'm able

600
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:50,982
to attend the banquet.

601
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:55,223
General Ling,is that old friend of yours

602
00:29:56,982 --> 00:29:58,303
someone from the Lou family?

603
00:29:58,383 --> 00:29:59,183
That's enough.

604
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,062
That's all for today's meeting.

605
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:03,902
Everyone, dismissed.

606
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,702
Zisheng.

607
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:06,343
Stay here.

608
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:20,623
I've yet to congratulate
Grand Tutor Lou.

609
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:23,702
Another capable official
is born in your family.

610
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:27,303
My father will definitely
think highly of this person.

611
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,423
Look forward to the rising fame

612
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:31,022
of the Lou family.

613
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,183
The people of Lou family

614
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,343
are usually mediocre and useless.

615
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,543
What you said was absurd.

616
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:42,942
Don't be so humble, Grand Tutor Lou.

617
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:46,022
I didn't ask you to resign
and give your position to them.

618
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:47,223
Right?

619
00:30:58,062 --> 00:31:00,303
Which official
was the one you mentioned?

620
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:02,423
There's actually
such a talent in the Lou family?

621
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:05,022
Why didn't the Grand Tutor
recommend him before?

622
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:08,343
It's just a nephew in the family

623
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:09,742
who loves to wander around

624
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,022
and not join the royal court.

625
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:14,862
There's actually someone

626
00:31:15,662 --> 00:31:17,143
from a famous family who
doesn't want to join the royal court?

627
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,543
What a pity.

628
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:29,183
What an accurate

629
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:32,223
backstabbing that was.

630
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:35,303
You've just come back for a few days

631
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:37,143
and you're going to battle again?

632
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,022
Don't kneel down. Come.

633
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:41,623
Sit and talk with me.

634
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:43,662
You heard it just now.

635
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:46,263
This is a tough battle.

636
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:48,942
If something were to happen to you,

637
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:50,102
what would you do?

638
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:51,143
In the future,

639
00:31:51,183 --> 00:31:53,143
how can I explain to Huo

640
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:54,062
who passed away?

641
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:55,463
I've had my attention

642
00:31:55,902 --> 00:31:57,223
on Lord Yong

643
00:31:57,343 --> 00:31:58,463
since the armament case.

644
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:00,102
He started as an official.

645
00:32:00,423 --> 00:32:02,583
He should end as an official as well.

646
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:04,543
Your Majesty, don't worry.

647
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:05,583
I know

648
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,423
what I should do in this battle.

649
00:32:07,662 --> 00:32:09,183
How can I not be worried?

650
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:12,383
Did you see?

651
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:15,062
The grand tutor's nephew

652
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:16,223
is even

653
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,062
younger than you

654
00:32:18,822 --> 00:32:20,543
and he is already getting married.

655
00:32:20,543 --> 00:32:21,463
What about you?

656
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:24,782
If you don't want me to be worried,

657
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:26,782
you should get married soon

658
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:30,183
so you don't have to
fight in battles every day.

659
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:34,902
Lou Yao is kind and gentle.

660
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,623
Lady Cheng is intelligent and pretty.

661
00:32:37,942 --> 00:32:39,183
I only hope

662
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:41,303
they can have a harmonious

663
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:43,223
and long-lasting relationship.

664
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,102
They do have a harmonious relationship.

665
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:47,982
What about you?

666
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,662
You are being reckless

667
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:52,862
and doesn't value your life

668
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:54,183
because you have no one behind you

669
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,623
to let you value your life.

670
00:32:57,383 --> 00:32:58,183
Fine.

671
00:32:58,623 --> 00:32:59,662
In that case,

672
00:32:59,942 --> 00:33:01,343
I'll ask the queen

673
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:02,662
to choose a pair of Jade artifacts

674
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:05,102
as Mr. Lou and Lady Cheng's gift.

675
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:08,543
What are you looking at?

676
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:12,822
Your Majesty.

677
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:13,982
Since you are going to give a gift,

678
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:14,982
can you

679
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:17,062
grant Lady Cheng
another imperial favour?

680
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:27,188
Official Cheng is here.

681
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:29,589
Congratulations, Official Cheng.

682
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:30,308
Thank you.

683
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,348
Congratulations, Madam Cheng.

684
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:35,949
Madam.

685
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,589
All of you are finally here.

686
00:33:45,268 --> 00:33:46,148
Madam Lou.

687
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:47,188
General Cheng.

688
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:51,949
Shaoshang.

689
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:53,549
Come here.

690
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:00,949
Let me show you
to your elders in the family.

691
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,068
According to the seniority,
you should address her as

692
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,308
Grandaunt.

693
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,989
Grandaunt, I wish you well.

694
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:16,909
Come back.

695
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:21,949
A full bow is needed to greet the senior

696
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,308
for a new wife of the Lou family.

697
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,108
Someone, get the kneeling cushion.

698
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,549
There are really many rules
in the Lou family.

699
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:33,629
The Lou family
lives an extravagant life.

700
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:35,589
It is naturally different from

701
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,629
the family of lowly generals.

702
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,549
First Madam also said

703
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,589
to make a full bow
when I greet my seniors.

704
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:49,549
But I have yet to marry Yao.

705
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:51,068
How can you forget about that

706
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:52,789
when the Lou family
prioritises the rules?

707
00:34:58,709 --> 00:34:59,989
I was too anxious.

708
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:01,669
In my heart,

709
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:04,028
you are already one of our own.

710
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:05,909
You are right.

711
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,228
You've been separated from Madam Cheng
for many years

712
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:09,829
and couldn't learn all these rules.

713
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,348
In the future,

714
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:13,228
I'll have to teach you slowly.

715
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:16,549
I didn't realise that

716
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:18,669
Old Madam Lou

717
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,869
is also responsible for
teaching the second chamber's wife.

718
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:23,428
Newlywed wives

719
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,909
mostly don't know the rules
of the Lou family.

720
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,228
I have no choice but
to be troubled for that.

721
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,388
Seniors chatting

722
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,148
might be boring for the lady.

723
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,989
Shaoshang. Li and the rest are inside.

724
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,669
Go inside and take a seat.

725
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:46,749
Niaoniao.

726
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,989
Go inside with Yangyang.

727
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:02,428
Niaoniao.

728
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,468
Today is your wedding after all.

729
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,148
Don't get angry.

730
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:07,549
Yangyang, I know.

731
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:09,388
I will definitely
not argue with anyone

732
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:10,428
or hit anyone.

733
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:12,028
Qiqi.

734
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:14,509
Both of you are finally here.
I was so anxious.

735
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:15,629
Qiqi.

736
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:17,789
You need to calm down as well.

737
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:19,709
Look at the whole house of ladies here.

738
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:21,669
You can't fight them alone.

739
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:23,909
Sure.

740
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:25,869
Since you are the one who asked,

741
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:27,148
I won't

742
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:28,188
be arguing

743
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,869
with these ladies who have no manners.

744
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:30,909
Who are you talking about?

745
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:31,589
You.

746
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:33,949
Li.

747
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:36,829
You and Shaoshang
will soon be relatives.

748
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,509
You have to live
with each other for a long time.

749
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,188
There's no need to argue with her now.

750
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:42,909
Miss Wang is right.

751
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,428
In the future,

752
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:46,148
I have to teach the rules
of the Lou family

753
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:47,308
to my new sister-in-law.

754
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:50,068
Don't be so strict on her.

755
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:53,028
She has no parents
to educate her for more than a decade.

756
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:55,388
Her aunt raised her to be this useless.

757
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,308
All of you are talking about rules.

758
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,280
Do you follow them?

759
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,388
Do you follow the rules?

760
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,949
Do you know the rules?

761
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,549
General Ling is here!

762
00:37:16,388 --> 00:37:17,709
Zisheng.

763
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:22,629
I can't see him.

764
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:26,789
I won't be able to forget

765
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:27,949
Zisheng's face

766
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,428
even if I marry someone else.

767
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:32,068
I'll still feel sad

768
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:33,629
even if I marry three times.

769
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,068
They said the same thing

770
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:39,629
after they see Yuan Shanjian last time.

771
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:43,629
Cheng Shaoshang, what about you?

772
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:44,989
Didn't you say

773
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,388
Zisheng likes you?

774
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:47,669
Don't you care about him?

775
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,869
That was such a weird question.

776
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,949
If Shaoshang agrees,

777
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,829
you'll say Shaoshang

778
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:57,669
is disloyal to Yao.

779
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:00,509
If Shaoshang disagrees,

780
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:02,428
you'll say that Shaoshang

781
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,829
is arrogant.

782
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,709
She doesn't even care about General Ling

783
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:07,989
who has His Majesty's favour.

784
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:13,669
Miss Wan is overthinking.

785
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:16,829
All of us mentioned Zisheng

786
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,829
in a frank and open manner.

787
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:21,829
Shaoshang was the only one
who didn't make a noise.

788
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,228
Was she feeling guilty?

789
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:24,549
I wasn't bothered to reply to you.

790
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:26,268
Yes.

791
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,028
General Ling is young and mighty.

792
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,509
Everyone envies him.

793
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,228
But perhaps

794
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,829
I already have Yao

795
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,148
and is the first person
among you to get engaged,

796
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:36,909
so I didn't feel anything

797
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:37,989
when I see General Ling.

798
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:38,989
Right, Sister-in-law?

799
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:43,388
She keeps mentioning Yao.

800
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,308
She's not married to my brother yet

801
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:45,629
and she is already using him.

802
00:38:45,629 --> 00:38:46,468
Exactly.

803
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:48,669
Young Lady.

804
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:50,589
General Ling brought
an imperial edict here.

805
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:51,509
First Madam ordered me

806
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:52,669
to ask you to listen to it
in the front yard.

807
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,028
What kind of edict is it?

808
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:58,789
I don't know.

809
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,509
Every master of the house
is already there.

810
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:06,148
Let's go.

811
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:41,228
I, Cheng Shi,

812
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:43,509
is here with my family to attend
the banquet at Lou's residence.

813
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:46,829
I can't welcome
the imperial edict with a full ritual.

814
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,509
I hope General Ling can
explain to His Majesty for me.

815
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:50,468
It's all right.

816
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:52,669
Since this is the Lou residence
instead of the Cheng residence,

817
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,509
everything can be simplified.

818
00:39:56,348 --> 00:39:57,388
I'm here today

819
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:58,949
in place of His Majesty

820
00:39:59,268 --> 00:40:00,308
to say a few words

821
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:02,228
to Fourth Lady Cheng.

822
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:10,669
Fourth Lady Cheng.

823
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:14,789
Step forward to receive the edict.

824
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:24,829
Kneel.

825
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:44,308
Edict for Cheng Shaoshang,
daughter of Marquis Qu Ling.

826
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:46,549
Helping the weak.

827
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:48,068
Hardworking and virtuous

828
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:49,428
Kind and gentle.

829
00:40:49,629 --> 00:40:50,829
Knowledgeable.

830
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:52,348
Happy nature.

831
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,468
Helping the people of Hua County.

832
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,909
Dealing with the trouble of bandits.

833
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:00,108
An example of
an honourable family indeed.

834
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:04,348
Wishing for a happy marriage
for the Cheng and Lou family.

835
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:07,468
Is he talking about me?

836
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:08,829
A pair of jade artifacts

837
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:10,909
and ten brocades will be granted.

838
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,669
Bow!

839
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:15,749
Thank you, His Majesty!

840
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,428
Thank you to His Majesty's grace.

841
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:41,228
Receive the edict.

842
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:19,549
His Majesty.

843
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:20,629
Since you are going to give a gift,

844
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:21,549
can you

845
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:23,669
grant Lady Cheng
another imperial favour?

846
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:26,428
She has credit
for rebuilding Hua County.

847
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:27,869
Why not

848
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,308
praise her

849
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:32,028
in front of the guest

850
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:33,589
during the banquet at Lou's residence?

851
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:35,308
You'll be blessing the Cheng family

852
00:42:35,749 --> 00:42:37,268
and making the Lou family proud
at the same time.
