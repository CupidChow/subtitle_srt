=Episode 32=

3
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,159
Third Prince has
a bright future ahead of him.

4
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,440
We still have to rely on you, Marquis.

5
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,199
All of us are from the same hall.

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,199
It's only right
for us to help each other.

7
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,639
Don't worry.

8
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,360
It's getting late.

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,759
We won't disturb you any longer.

10
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,480
We will be leaving.

11
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,000
Sure.

12
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,239
Take care, everyone.

13
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,639
Take care.

14
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,320
The rumour of
replacing the crown prince

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,079
has yet to be verified.

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
These people

17
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,400
are really opportunistic.

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,920
It will happen sooner or later.

19
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,079
Right now,
the Yue Clan is very influential.

20
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,840
It's normal for the officials
to seek connections.

21
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,000
Mr. Tian!

22
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,199
Do you have any more Qianlizui?

23
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,279
I want to drink with them
until I'm drunk.

24
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,279
Your Highness.

25
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,880
I've saved all the Qianlizui for you.

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,880
Greetings,

27
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,679
Your Highness.

28
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,719
What a coincidence.

29
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,840
Let me introduce you to them.

30
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,199
He will be my future father-in-law.

31
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,199
Your Highness is
really enjoying yourself.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,000
I wonder if Changqiu Palace knows

33
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,719
that Your Highness is here today.

34
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,559
I have yet to marry into the Yue Family

35
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,520
and you're already trying to control me?

36
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,840
I am a princess, Marquis Yue.

37
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,199
The empire belongs to
the Wen Family and not the Yue Family.

38
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,520
The only one on par with the Wen Family

39
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,320
is only my mother's clan,
the Xuan Family.

40
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,159
Mr. Tian.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Marquis Yue.

42
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,679
I know you can hire musicians.

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,239
My son's future wife is unrestrained.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,199
She likes to make friends
with handsome men.

45
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,239
Since I'm her father-in-law,

46
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,679
I should prepare a gift

47
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,559
that suits her.

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,639
I understand.

49
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,599
Also,

50
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:36,440
she should know about

51
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,759
the rumours at the royal court.

52
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,279
After all, we'll soon become a family.

53
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,239
She should share our burden as well.

54
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,800
Don't worry.

55
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,920
I am not capable.

56
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,040
I only manage many restaurants

57
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,559
that have many guests.

58
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,279
News at my restaurants

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,880
spread faster than others.

60
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,159
Mr. Tian.

61
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,320
You are someone who is very capable.

62
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,639
The Crown Princess is here.

63
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,279
There are many princes
and princesses as well.

64
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Why did His Majesty
give all these troubling tasks

65
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,679
to me?

66
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,360
I think Father's decision was wise.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,559
I have to use a few days

68
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,199
to calculate the purchase expenses

69
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,119
but it only took you half a day.

70
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,800
Besides, birthday banquet of the Changqiu Palace,

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,159
only the Crown Prince,

72
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,000
Zisheng and Fifth Princess

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,159
are Mother's children.

74
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,600
Do you think Fifth Princess
can be depended on?

75
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,199
It's fine
if I'm just doing the calculations.

76
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,199
Why do I need to arrange the seats

77
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,040
of the officials' family members?

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't even recognise everyone.

79
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,599
Father and Mother

80
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,520
want you

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759
to be familiar with
everything in the palace.

82
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,880
That is why they have me to support you.

83
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:29,239
It's hard being Zisheng's future wife.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,440
It's harder than governing a county.

85
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
Now that I think back to

86
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,480
the rebuilding of Hua County,

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,559
it didn't trouble me as much as this.

88
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,239
I've never thought

89
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,800
my husband
would be the Crown Prince as well.

90
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,599
My mother's family

91
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,880
wanted to rely on me
to become successful

92
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,040
but they don't know I am powerless.

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
They are always saying

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,199
that I forget my roots
in front and behind of me

95
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,239
but none of them knows

96
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,599
the troubles I've faced.

97
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,279
Crown Princess, don't say that.

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,840
His Highness and you

99
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,480
are both benevolent.

100
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,880
All of them are just greedy.

101
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,920
His Highness helped
cover for General Wang

102
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,520
because he prioritised their bond.

103
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,679
But the imperial family is cruel.

104
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,880
Prioritising their bond

105
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,880
was actually wrong.

106
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,279
I don't get it at all.

107
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,079
How is that wrong?

108
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,599
It is only shameful

109
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,000
if His Highness loses his benevolence.

110
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,480
Everyone in this world

111
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,040
talks about principles

112
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,159
but I think

113
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,279
it's good enough

114
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,000
if we have a clear conscience.

115
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:40,719
Where is my brother?

116
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,159
I want to see him.

117
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,800
Your Highness.

118
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,520
His Highness
is meeting someone in his study.

119
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
He won't be seeing anyone today.

120
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Who are you to talk back to me?

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,040
Are you even fit to be here
in the Eastern Palace?

122
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,840
Get out.

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,559
Father ordered Shaoshang

124
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,440
to prepare
for Mother's birthday banquet.

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,279
I have to help her as well.

126
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,079
That is why Shaoshang is here.

127
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,759
The Eastern Palace's position
will soon be lost.

128
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,520
How can you still pretend
to be virtuous at a moment like this?

129
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,920
That's all for today's meeting.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,920
Brother.

131
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,279
Your Highness.

132
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,640
We will be leaving.

133
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,399
Fifth Sister.

134
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,319
Why are you making noise here?

135
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,399
Just let Wang Long die.

136
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Do you think it's worth it
to anger Father and get replaced

137
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,199
as Crown Prince
because of a plebeian like him?

138
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,199
Fifth Sister.

139
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,239
Wang Long is your cousin as well.

140
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,359
How can you say something so heartless?

141
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm heartless?

142
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,920
The Third Prince of Yongle Palace

143
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,840
has his eyes on
the position of Crown Prince

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,640
yet you're doing such a silly thing?

145
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,640
If you don't keep your place
as Crown Prince,

146
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,279
do we still have a foothold
in the future

147
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,560
as the children of Changqiu Palace?

148
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,279
Do you only have power and not family

149
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,600
in your heart?

150
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,119
If I only protect myself

151
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
without caring for my family's safety,

152
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
I'd rather not become

153
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,279
the Crown Prince.

154
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,600
Do you think
you are fit to become the Crown Prince?

155
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,319
If I am a man,

156
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,159
you won't even become the Crown Prince.

157
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,880
Your Highness, please mind your words.

158
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,720
You are saying this

159
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,359
because you know His Highness

160
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,680
will forgive you.

161
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,640
If His Highness is as decisive

162
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,760
as you said,

163
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,319
Fifth Princess,

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,199
you would have been convicted.

165
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,519
Fifth Sister.

166
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,000
You have been saying

167
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,720
His Highness should not anger Father.

168
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,319
Aren't you making Father angry

169
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,279
by refusing to get married as well?

170
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,720
His Highness never said anything
about your marriage.

171
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,880
Why did you get angry at His Highness

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
because your status is at risk?

173
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,279
Brother will definitely
not interfere with my marriage.

174
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,119
Didn't he marry you

175
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,720
no matter how reluctant he was?

176
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,439
Everyone in the palace knew

177
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,600
who Brother liked.

178
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,720
Brother pitied your family
for being poor

179
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,439
and you have nowhere to go
after your divorce

180
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,479
so you can become the Crown Princess.

181
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:16,040
You...

182
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,479
Fifth Sister, you should go back.

183
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,560
There's no need to come here

184
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,640
to the Eastern Palace
if there's nothing important.

185
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,239
When you marry into the Yue Family,

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,720
I will definitely prepare gifts for you.

187
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,640
You are really stubborn!

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,439
You just have to suffer
with the people of the Wang Family.

189
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,239
I'll go and find Mother!

190
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,439
How is Her Majesty?

191
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,600
Fifth Princess went inside

192
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,359
and angered Her Majesty
until her heart was palpitating.

193
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,519
She won't speak and eat right now.

194
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,479
I'll advise her.

195
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,840
But Her Majesty
doesn't want to see anyone.

196
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm afraid it's useless
even if Lady Cheng goes in.

197
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,519
When parents are sick,

198
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,399
they might say
they don't want to see anyone

199
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,239
but deep down,

200
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,079
they want their children to rush in.

201
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,920
Don't you believe me, Madam Zhai?

202
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
I have a way.

203
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,079
You've never eaten for a whole day,
Your Majesty.

204
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,720
Have some food at least.

205
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,720
Don't believe

206
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,119
the rumours out there.

207
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Your Majesty.

208
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
Look

209
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
what I brought you.

210
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,800
Her Majesty has a bad appetite.

211
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
She doesn't want to eat.

212
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm not here
to persuade Her Majesty to eat.

213
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,519
I'm here to seek Her Majesty's help.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,119
Your Majesty, look.

215
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,359
What is this?

216
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
This is...

217
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,040
I planted these cucumbers myself.

218
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,640
I finally grew them after a lot of time.

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,840
Cucumbers are tributes
from the Western Regions.

220
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:28,760
I've never eaten them

221
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,439
but Your Majesty did.

222
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,359
Please help me try them

223
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,479
and see if mine

224
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,800
is the same
as Western Region's cucumber.

225
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,680
Why is it so salty?

226
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,680
I marinated it with salt

227
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,040
but when I removed it

228
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,279
I added salt again.

229
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,439
I forgot about it.

230
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,199
Since it's that salty,

231
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,119
you should eat some porridge.

232
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,399
It's still salty, right?

233
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,800
Have some more.

234
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,800
Your cucumber

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,239
is really appetising.

236
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,319
I've eaten now.

237
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,720
You should be relieved now, right?

238
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,159
I'm not here to see you eat,
Your Majesty.

239
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,479
I'm here to seek your help.

240
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,159
You have yet to tell me

241
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,319
if my cucumber is better

242
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,880
than the Western Regions' cucumber.

243
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:55,920
You always have many wicked ideas.

244
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,560
How can I compare them

245
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,239
when it is so salty?

246
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,079
In that case,

247
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,119
I'll make

248
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,439
some sweeter ones later.

249
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,199
Why don't you try some sweet ones?

250
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,119
Sweet ones might not
balance out the saltiness.

251
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,159
Some sour ones then.

252
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,560
Sour ones will definitely do.

253
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:15,359
You are really shameless.

254
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,119
With your skills,

255
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,159
how much porridge do I need to eat

256
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,439
if I'm going to try them all?

257
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
I'm happy to see Your Majesty

258
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,239
willing to eat more porridge.

259
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,159
I still feel salty in my mouth.

260
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,439
Eat more porridge then.

261
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,680
Come on.

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,680
Let's go.

263
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,119
With Lady Cheng inside,

264
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,119
both of us should not disturb

265
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,199
Her Majesty's chat with Lady Cheng.

266
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,680
I didn't expect Her Majesty

267
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,119
to meet such a person
who can put her at ease.

268
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,479
Zisheng really got himself a good wife.

269
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,000
Lady Luo, why aren't you
inside serving Her Majesty?

270
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,640
Shaoshang is talking to Her Majesty.

271
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,920
Madam Zhai ordered us

272
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,640
not to disturb them.

273
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,680
This general's daughter
is good at making connections.

274
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,479
She only
entered the palace for a few days.

275
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,720
What?

276
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,479
Can we not step into the places

277
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,319
with her around?

278
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,519
We have yet to be married
to the Northwest

279
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,880
yet she is the one
to achieve a higher position instead.

280
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,359
Besides striving Her Majesty's favour,

281
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,479
even General Ling is...

282
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,680
If Lady Luo can marry General Ling,

283
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,920
we won't have to go to
a harsh place like the Northwest.

284
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,840
Chun Tiao, Shut up.

285
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,119
Don't speak about this again.

286
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,359
No matter how harsh the Northwest is,

287
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,119
it is still our fate.

288
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,800
Some people are born lucky.

289
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,800
They can marry a good husband

290
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,720
and receive
the imperial family's blessings.

291
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,880
Both of us can't complain about that.

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,000
Lady Luo.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,479
You have such a good temper.

294
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
None of the princesses

295
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,479
will forgive her easily.

296
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,840
She didn't even see

297
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,239
if Her Majesty's children would agree
before trying to make connections.

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,840
Your Majesty.

299
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,399
This cucumber will be
the appetizer for the banquet.

300
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,319
What do you think?

301
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,800
We should use something normal.

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,720
The palace is promoting frugality.

303
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,159
How can I

304
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,439
use these ingredients
from the Western Regions?

305
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,640
I've already studied the method

306
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,920
to grow these cucumbers.

307
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,359
We can grow them ourselves.

308
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,319
It won't cost a lot.

309
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,119
I can even ask Zisheng to help

310
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,199
plough the land and build the sheds.

311
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,920
We just need a plot of land
in the hall to grow them.

312
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,680
We should let the officials

313
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,680
taste the cucumber
of the Western Regions.

314
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,920
How is that?

315
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,199
In the future,

316
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,319
I have to learn how to educate
a caring and clever child

317
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,399
from your parents.

318
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,000
I failed

319
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,279
to educate my children

320
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,040
because I knew nothing

321
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,159
about being a parent.

322
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,439
Your Majesty.

323
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,359
You need to summon my parents

324
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,560
to the palace soon.

325
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,600
My parents

326
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,199
always think I'm incapable

327
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,560
and ignorant.

328
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,600
There's nothing good about me.

329
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:18,439
Your Majesty,

330
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,040
after summoning my parents,

331
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,000
you have to praise me

332
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,279
so they know

333
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,159
I'm not incapable

334
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,600
and it's because they don't know
how to cherish me.

335
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,359
They always
envy other people's children.

336
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Also,

337
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,840
you need to let them know

338
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
that a parent
who doesn't punish their children

339
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,359
like you

340
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,680
is a good parent.

341
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,920
No one uses the person in front of them

342
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,359
to replace their own parents.

343
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,519
However,

344
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,319
you are wrong.

345
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,159
Every parent in the world

346
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,239
is proud of their children.

347
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,319
Envying other people's children

348
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:58,560
is just a way to educate their children.

349
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,640
Just see if they are willing

350
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,720
to exchange you for someone else.

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,720
But making comparisons for a long time

352
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,239
will cause hatred

353
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,119
in children's hearts.

354
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,560
I'm sure parents

355
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,279
know such a simple theory.

356
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,519
However,

357
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,279
you only live once.

358
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,159
The responsibility of educating a child

359
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,119
is like sailing against the current.
You'll fall back if you don't progress.

360
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,239
There's no turning back.

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
Only when the child is stronger,

362
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,159
the parents can feel more relieved.

363
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,600
Forcing you

364
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,399
is actually

365
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,239
forcing ourselves in truth.

366
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,279
How is Mother feeling?

367
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,600
If Your Highness wants to know,

368
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,439
you can just go inside and have a look.

369
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,519
I am incapable.

370
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,880
Besides disappointing Father,

371
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,560
I even make Mother sad.

372
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,119
Father said

373
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,560
I appoint people by favouritism

374
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,680
and act emotionally.

375
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Perhaps

376
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,079
I'm really not suitable
to become the Crown Prince.

377
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,199
Does Your Highness think

378
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,720
Her Majesty feels sad

379
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
because you are not a good Crown Prince?

380
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,720
It's because you are sad,

381
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,600
lost,

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,079
depressed,

383
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,560
criticised

384
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,880
and can't get up after you fell.

385
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,640
That is why she blamed herself

386
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,079
and felt sad.

387
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,159
She feels
she didn't protect you well enough

388
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,199
as a mother.

389
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,640
Your Highness is the Crown Prince,

390
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,159
but you are still
His Majesty and Her Majesty's son.

391
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,199
You shouldn't help General Wang

392
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,920
as the Crown Prince.

393
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,439
However, you can help your cousin

394
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,519
as a son.

395
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
There's no crime

396
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,399
in helping a family member.

397
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,640
Perhaps,

398
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,239
His Majesty might be disappointed

399
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,519
by the lenient Crown Prince.

400
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,640
But as a father,

401
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,279
how can he be disappointed

402
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,600
by a righteous son?

403
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,439
Your Highness.

404
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,800
If you grow apart

405
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,680
from His Majesty and Her Majesty
because of this,

406
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,199
they'll be really disappointed.

407
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,040
They'll only think

408
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,680
it is their education's fault.

409
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,880
Thank you for the reminder, Lady Cheng.

410
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,439
I understand.

411
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,079
I have yet to do anything

412
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,680
but these officials

413
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,319
are already thinking of
replacing the Crown Prince.

414
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,800
All of them are very ambitious.

415
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,600
Your Majesty, calm down.

416
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,760
The officials are only

417
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,640
guessing Your Majesty's intention

418
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,800
to follow your instructions.

419
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,359
They are not qualified to judge

420
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,079
whether my son

421
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,920
can handle an important responsibility.

422
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,560
Your Majesty.
His Highness is asking for an audience.

423
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,600
This child

424
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,680
is finally getting anxious.

425
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,199
Call him in.

426
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,319
Your Highness.

427
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,600
Greetings, Father.

428
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,640
Stand up.

429
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,439
Do you have anything

430
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,519
to say to me

431
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,159
by coming here late at night?

432
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,840
Father.

433
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,399
I want to play chess with you

434
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,040
because I can't sleep.

435
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,560
You are quite in the mood.

436
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,119
Sure.

437
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,279
Speaking of which,

438
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,079
it's been a long time

439
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,560
since we played chess.

440
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,079
When you just started learning chess,

441
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,560
you were always moving
and wouldn't sit still.

442
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,199
I had to stop myself

443
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,519
from sticking you here
beside the chessboard.

444
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,159
Did something good happen today?

445
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,760
You look like you're in a good mood.

446
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,640
I wasn't feeling happy at first

447
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,560
but I solved a trouble

448
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,159
so I feel happy.

449
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,199
Third Princess was punished
during my uncle's anniversary of death.

450
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,760
Did it

451
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,800
make you happy as well?

452
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,279
Sorry.

453
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,600
I didn't destroy

454
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,479
General Huo's altar on purpose.

455
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,199
I was just...

456
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,680
You always get angry because I do things

457
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,119
without discussing it with you

458
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,040
but didn't you

459
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,119
act on your own will as well?

460
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,079
Niaoniao.

461
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,359
It worries me

462
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,159
if you keep doing things recklessly.

463
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,399
Aren't you scolding me?

464
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,119
If you believe in me,

465
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,359
you can leave anything you want to do

466
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,040
to me.

467
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,560
You don't have
a foundation in the palace.

468
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,119
You should leave

469
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,600
making enemies to me.

470
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,880
Although I said

471
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,199
I will protect you

472
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,319
no matter what you do,

473
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,040
you still need to give me a chance.

474
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,159
Actually, today...

475
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,600
What happened today?

476
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,399
Her Majesty was not in a good mood today

477
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,600
because there was a rumour about
His Majesty replacing the Crown Prince.

478
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:29,319
Oh.

479
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,000
Did you know who was the person

480
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,479
acting against His Highness
at Yanhui Tower that day?

481
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,359
Shaoshang.

482
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,199
Over the years,

483
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,439
His Highness has been too benevolent

484
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,040
and never restricted
the actions of the people around him.

485
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,439
That is why incapable people

486
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,119
can be in a high position.

487
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,519
Many people in the royal court
are not satisfied with this.

488
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,079
This issue involves many parties.

489
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,600
Remember.

490
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,359
Don't interfere with this.

491
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,399
You should go to

492
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:02,840
the Eastern Palace less.

493
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,680
Oh.

494
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,880
What was

495
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,479
the good thing

496
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,399
you mentioned?

497
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,600
Her Majesty had
another bowl of porridge today.

498
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,279
Father.

499
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,760
I lost.

500
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,119
You lost?

501
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,439
Do you think I didn't realise it?

502
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,199
You were giving me a handicap
halfway through the game.

503
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,439
What's wrong?

504
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,640
Have you

505
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,439
followed the ways of the sycophants

506
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,239
of flattering me

507
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,800
and dare not win against me?

508
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,359
Father.

509
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,159
Do you still remember

510
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,239
how I learn to play this game?

511
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,439
In the past,

512
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
Father had yet to go out to war

513
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,880
and I was not the Crown Prince.

514
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,040
Father was making the board

515
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,119
using stones to carve out words

516
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,000
at the old house

517
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,279
just to teach me the game.

518
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,560
Father always gave me a handicap

519
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,680
to get me interested in the game.

520
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,319
A child like me
who just learned the game

521
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,119
could actually win against Father
in every game.

522
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,920
Father could

523
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,600
win against me back then.

524
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,239
Why did you give me a handicap?

525
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
It was because

526
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,600
Father cared about my feelings

527
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,279
more than the result of the game.

528
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,199
It is the same for me today.

529
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,279
In my heart,

530
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,319
a family member's feeling

531
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:23,319
is more important
than the result of the conflict.

532
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,920
Even if I lose in the end,

533
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,760
I still

534
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,600
won't regret anything.

535
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,439
I understand.

536
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,319
It's already late.

537
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,040
Go back and rest.

538
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,880
Don't miss

539
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,079
tomorrow's morning assembly.

540
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,359
Yes.

541
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,560
I've read

542
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,479
all of your memorials.

543
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,279
The Crown Prince

544
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,199
is

545
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,079
forgiving, benevolent,

546
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,279
loyal and filial.

547
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,040
He was not as incapable

548
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,000
as all of you said.

549
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,199
I have decided

550
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,720
for Crown Prince to hold the tiger seal.

551
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,359
The three armies

552
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,359
will be under his command.

553
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,359
Grand the tiger seal to Crown Prince.

554
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,359
Thank you, Father.

555
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,760
I will never disappoint Father's trust.

556
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,680
Your Majesty.

557
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,279
I have something to say.

558
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,199
Wang Chun

559
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,760
allowed his son, Wang Long

560
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,720
to leave camp and suppress the bandits.

561
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,239
He put the army in danger.

562
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,319
Your Majesty.

563
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,079
They were

564
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,159
ignoring a military command.

565
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
Marquis Yue, you are wrong.

566
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,920
The bandits disturbed
the peace of the people.

567
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,199
As the defending general,

568
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:59,279
General Wang Long
had to maintain peace there.

569
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,119
How can suppressing bandits for the people

570
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,279
be said as ignoring a military command?

571
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,319
I'm not done talking.

572
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,079
Why are you interrupting me,
Grand Tutor Lou?

573
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,119
Did he go to suppress the bandits?

574
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,079
As far as I know, Wang Long

575
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:16,600
has already
fallen into the bandits' trap.

576
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,800
We don't even know

577
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,119
whether he's dead or alive.

578
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Your Majesty.

579
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,079
General Wang Long is in danger

580
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,640
because he was leading the army.

581
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,720
I don't understand

582
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,279
why Marquis Yue
is taking pleasure in his misfortune.

583
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,640
What do you mean?

584
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,600
They are just

585
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,439
some bandits
that we didn't eliminate in the past.

586
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,079
Wang Long is incapable.

587
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,000
What's the purpose
of judging whether he's right or wrong?

588
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,000
In my opinion,

589
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,600
we should send troops

590
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,119
and eliminate these bandits.

591
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,239
We can use this opportunity
to fill our treasury as well.

592
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,399
That's easy for you to say.

593
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,479
General Wu is retiring soon

594
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,079
and General Ling is getting married.

595
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,439
Who will lead the troops?

596
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,279
Your Majesty.

597
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,279
I'm willing to become the vanguard

598
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,519
and kill them all.

599
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,560
We are discussing

600
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,199
how to punish Wang Chun for his crimes.

601
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,399
You should stop meddling.

602
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,800
How am I meddling?

603
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,880
That's enough.

604
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,279
All of you have stated your opinions.

605
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,760
It's time for me

606
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,399
to say something.

607
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,079
The bandits

608
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,800
disturbed the peace of the people.

609
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,880
It was reasonable

610
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:27,119
for Wang Long
to send troops to suppress them.

611
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,199
However,

612
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,840
he was reckless

613
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,880
and caused his army
to be caught in a dangerous situation.

614
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:34,479
He is not fit to become a general.

615
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,880
However,

616
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,319
this is Wang Long's mistake.

617
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,279
How is it related to his father,

618
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,720
Wang Chun?

619
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,279
From today onwards,

620
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,119
the command of Wang Long's troops

621
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,279
will be handed over to his father.

622
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,359
He will be

623
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,840
demoted immediately.

624
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,600
As for suppressing the bandits,

625
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,279
Zisheng.

626
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,640
Yes.

627
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,119
You should discuss

628
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,640
with the other generals

629
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,279
and depart
when you have decided on a strategy.

630
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Crown Prince.

631
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,199
Yes.

632
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,239
I've handed the tiger seal to you.

633
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,319
When the time comes,

634
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:16,239
you will send the troops
on the Command Altar.

635
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,840
Yes!

636
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,199
Father finally agreed

637
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,760
to send troops to rescue Cousin.

638
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,319
Zisheng.

639
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,680
I've been thinking a lot

640
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,079
and I still think the tiger seal

641
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,199
is not safe at the Eastern Palace.

642
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,439
Why don't I

643
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,439
give it to you to keep it safe?

644
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,199
His Majesty handed over the tiger seal

645
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,239
proving His Majesty's trust
in Your Highness.

646
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,079
The tiger seal

647
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,319
needs to be kept by Your Highness

648
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,920
and not be given to anyone else.

649
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,439
When the time comes to send the troops,

650
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,119
Your Highness needs it
to command the troops.

651
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,079
But...

652
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:01,760
But I...

653
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,640
Don't worry.

654
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,680
The palace has tight security.

655
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:07,079
As long as you don't take it
out of the Eastern Palace,

656
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,479
no one dares to steal it.

657
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,319
I still have something
I don't understand.

658
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,000
His Majesty wanted
to punish General Wang at first.

659
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,640
I wonder how

660
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,920
Your Highness persuaded His Majesty.

661
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,000
It's all thanks to Shaoshang.

662
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,800
I had a game with Father yesterday

663
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:31,600
and spoke about my childhood.

664
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,519
Father decided to give General Wang

665
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,800
and me another chance

666
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,439
because of our family bonds.

667
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,800
Zisheng.

668
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,439
Both you and your wife

669
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,279
are really my lucky star.

670
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,560
Oh.

671
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,479
What was

672
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,040
the good thing

673
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
you mentioned?

674
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Why are you staring at me
without saying anything?

675
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,399
You asked His Highness

676
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,720
to express goodwill to His Majesty?

677
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:47,680
His Majesty will no longer
punish Wang Chun now.

678
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,479
Are you satisfied with that?

679
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,479
What do you mean?

680
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,680
Because of your plans
to help His Highness,

681
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,680
His Majesty has decided
to let the Wang Family go.

682
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,399
Shaoshang.

683
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,159
I've reminded you time and again

684
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,920
not to interfere
with the Eastern Palace's matters.

685
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,519
Don't involve yourself
in the conflicts of the court.

686
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,600
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

687
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,079
I just want to help Her Majesty out.

688
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
Do you want me to see Her Majesty

689
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,239
suffer all by herself

690
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,880
without helping her?

691
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:21,767
I don't care about

692
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:23,840
what happens to Wang Chun.

693
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,720
Her Majesty treats me sincerely.

694
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,600
I need to think for her.

695
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,560
What if the things you did

696
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,800
cause me trouble?

697
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,640
Her Majesty sees you as her own son.

698
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,479
His Highness sees you
as his own brother.

699
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:39,239
They raised you.

700
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:41,911
Why are you not happy
when His Majesty is no longer punishing

701
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:44,103
Her Majesty and His Highness?

702
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,119
Do you think what you did was right?

703
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:47,880
Didn't you see how Madam Wen Xiu

704
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,239
threatened Her Majesty?

705
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,079
Now that His Majesty

706
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,720
has forgiven the Wang Family,

707
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,199
all the officials of the court
will shift their hatred

708
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,119
to Her Majesty and His Highness.

709
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:03,840
Do you know

710
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,880
someone has been eyeing
the position at the Eastern Palace?

711
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:07,840
What you did

712
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,841
might harm His Highness

713
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,159
instead of helping him.

714
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:15,519
Not only will you harm him,

715
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:18,159
but you might also
involve Her Majesty in this.

716
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,159
You are putting them

717
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,760
in grave danger.

718
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,560
All of these...

719
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,560
I know nothing about all these.

720
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,239
I never thought so much about it.

721
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,720
Since you don't know,

722
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,159
you should stop doing things recklessly.

723
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,439
Shaoshang.

724
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm going to tell you again.

725
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,479
Matters in the palace

726
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,600
will be affected
even from a very trivial matter.

727
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
It is not as simple as you think.

728
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,920
The most complicated thing

729
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,840
in this world

730
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,159
is you.

731
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,720
You always say I don't understand.

732
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,760
But you've never wanted
me to understand.

733
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Your plans, your stratagems

734
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
and your thoughts.

735
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,159
You didn't tell me any of them.

736
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,760
How can I avoid them?

737
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,519
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

738
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,680
It's because all of these

739
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,920
are too complicated.

740
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,760
But...

741
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,119
But I don't have to care about

742
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,560
all these complicated things at first.

743
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,319
I could marry a normal man

744
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,479
and live a normal life.

745
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,040
The royal court,

746
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,439
the palace

747
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,680
and His Majesty

748
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,720
are none of my business. Ling Buyi.

749
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,199
You are the one
who dragged me into this.

750
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,880
We were supposed to be
people from both ends of the world.

751
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,760
I was flustered and hesitated

752
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,720
at the beginning of this marriage.

753
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,479
When I finally decided to be with you

754
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,119
and do something that I don't like,

755
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,640
you kept telling me

756
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,519
that your world
is too complicated for me.

757
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,119
A fool like me
is not supposed to get involved in this.

758
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm not teasing you, Shaoshang.

759
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,600
I just don't want you to be in danger.

760
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,359
I just want the best for you.

761
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
My mother used to say this to me too.

762
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,079
All of you want the best for me

763
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,399
because I'm not good enough,

764
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,159
right?

765
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,159
I really don't know

766
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,519
how I can satisfy you

767
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,479
and still stay who I am.

768
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,519
But this is who I am.

769
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:56,600
I don't care about the consequences

770
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,600
and only do things of my own will.

771
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,600
Sorry for disappointing you.

772
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,439
Shaoshang.

773
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,760
I will go back on my own today.

774
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,439
(Do you think what you did was right?)

775
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:46,600
(Now that His Majesty)

776
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,399
(has forgiven the Wang Family,)

777
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,800
(all the officials of the court
will shift their hatred)

778
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,560
(to Her Majesty and His Highness.)

779
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:55,800
(Do you know)

780
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,840
(someone has been eyeing
the position at the Eastern Palace?)

781
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,199
(What you did)

782
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,279
(might harm His Highness)

783
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,640
(instead of helping him.)

784
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,000
(Not only will you harm him,)

785
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,720
(but you might also
involve Her Majesty in this.)

786
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,680
(You are putting them)

787
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,239
(in grave danger.)

788
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,680
It's so troublesome
being married to Ling Buyi.
