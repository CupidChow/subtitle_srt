=Episode 42=

3
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,154
This hairpin looks more exquisite.

4
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,434
It'll complement your elegance.

5
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:57,115
You should wear this for the wedding.

6
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,234
You mustn't.

7
00:01:58,835 --> 00:01:59,995
White accessories are inauspicious

8
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,954
during joyous occasions as such.

9
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:04,835
You should wear
the golden hairpin instead.

10
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,675
Everyone in the capital

11
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:08,914
is concerned about Niaoniao's marriage.

12
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:10,634
We mustn't disgrace our family.

13
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:12,754
The golden hairpin
must be thick and heavy.

14
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,555
Only then, it can show
prosperity and good fortune.

15
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:15,675
Old Madam,

16
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:17,995
I think she should look dignified
and elegant instead.

17
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:18,914
What about

18
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:20,795
this sandalwood hairpin?

19
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:22,154
She's getting married here!

20
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,235
She's not trying to be a nun here.

21
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:26,314
We have a gem crown for her.

22
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,555
There's agate on top of it.
It's very valuable.

23
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,275
This accessory doesn't
fit her attire at all.

24
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:32,275
I do think

25
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,714
that we do not need
such luxurious accessories.

26
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,675
The key is to be elegant.

27
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:37,355
Look at how nice
this fan-shaped hairpin look on her.

28
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,154
Only a few ladies in
the capital wear this.

29
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,275
Ladies from the younger generation
like you all

30
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:42,675
have no rules at all.

31
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,474
A fan

32
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:45,034
signifies separation.

33
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,235
It's too inauspicious.

34
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:48,874
Here's a Dragon and Phoenix Hairpin.

35
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:50,275
Let me put it on for you.

36
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:53,355
All right.

37
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:54,395
Stop.

38
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:02,515
Mother,

39
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:03,795
Grandmother,

40
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:05,555
you guys don't need to be worried.

41
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,474
Her Majesty had already prepared

42
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:08,355
the wedding accessories for me.

43
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:10,714
They're all crafted by the craftsmen
in the palace.

44
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:11,955
They're top-notch.

45
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:13,154
Really?

46
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:18,235
That's great! We can save some money!

47
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,154
Not only can we save money,

48
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:23,075
but we will also be respected!

49
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:23,995
Niaoniao,

50
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,675
did Her Majesty prepare them
for you long ago?

51
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,874
I didn't expect Her Majesty
to be more thoughtful

52
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,714
than your mother.

53
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:36,795
That's not it.

54
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,474
It's because Her Majesty and His Majesty

55
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:40,995
always hoped that
Zisheng could get married.

56
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:42,754
That's why they would
buy them every year.

57
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,634
They've bought a lot of them.

58
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:45,914
They can finally
put them to use this year.

59
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,075
If everything goes smoothly,

60
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,714
I should be getting married
within the palace.

61
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,675
Her Majesty said

62
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,355
she had already
prepared a boudoir for me.

63
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:10,634
That's better.

64
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,355
That's the reward His and Her Majesty

65
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,275
are giving to the Cheng Family.

66
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:18,155
We've honored our family's name.

67
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:20,634
If so, we shall follow
Her Majesty's will.

68
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,434
You should get married
within the palace.

69
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,715
Why are you standing there
like a woman waiting for her husband

70
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:17,874
when you're engaged?

71
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,035
Why do you make no sound when you walk?

72
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:23,314
You're so annoying.

73
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,754
It's clearly because you were
too absorbed in your longing.

74
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,115
That's why you didn't
detect my presence.

75
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,514
Do you know how exhausting

76
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:31,995
these days were for me?

77
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:34,634
I had to try on the wedding dress
and accessories.

78
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,355
Jewelries that weigh over 10 jin

79
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:37,995
were placed all over my head

80
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:39,235
and my neck.

81
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,155
If you were in my shoes,

82
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:42,754
you would feel the soreness too.

83
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:44,274
Wait, you can't be in my shoes.

84
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,754
You're not getting married.

85
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:48,194
You wouldn't know how I feel.

86
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,874
What do you mean by
I don't need to get married?

87
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:53,754
What's the big deal
about getting married?

88
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,874
Don't tell me

89
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,314
that you think you're the only person
who can get married?

90
00:05:58,795 --> 00:05:59,715
Besides,

91
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:01,235
what's so good about getting married?

92
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,035
It's tiring and has no benefits.

93
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:04,475
Only a muddle-headed person like you

94
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:07,155
would cherish such an idea.

95
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,235
Look at you now.

96
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:11,274
You look worried and listless.

97
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:14,194
You looked much better in the past.

98
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:17,514
It's obvious that you don't understand

99
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,394
how it feels to be in love.

100
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:21,355
You also don't know

101
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,595
how it feels like to long for someone.

102
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:25,514
However, it'll get better
after the wedding.

103
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:27,235
After I get married,

104
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:28,434
I can see him every day.

105
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:30,115
I do not need to long for him again.

106
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:33,954
Don't worry.

107
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,634
I'll definitely get married before you.

108
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:39,795
I will find out how it feels like

109
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,634
to see my partner every day
faster than you.

110
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,035
Yuan Shanjian,

111
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:48,954
you don't have to get married
if you don't want to!

112
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:50,194
No one is forcing you!

113
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,074
Did you hear me?

114
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,235
This is what you meant

115
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,475
by a peerless noble lady?

116
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:07,314
Official Cai graduated
from Bailu Academy too.

117
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:08,595
But why is his daughter...

118
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:12,995
I heard that Lady Cai could
recite poems when she was three

119
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:14,715
and write rhapsodies when she was seven.

120
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:17,715
And, she was famous in the capital
for her intellect.

121
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:19,675
The matchmaker said
she was the best candidate

122
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:21,434
for you.

123
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,155
When did the matchmaker go blind?

124
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:25,954
How is Lady Cai

125
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:28,035
the best candidate for me?

126
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:31,834
I don't ask a lot for someone
to be the Yuan clan's madam.

127
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:33,754
Her brain

128
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,954
must not be slower than Lady Cheng's.

129
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,434
Her personality must not
be more perverse than Lady Cheng.

130
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,194
Understood.

131
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,634
Her looks must not be uglier
than Lady Cheng.

132
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:43,274
Young Master, your expectations

133
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:44,754
are still pretty high.

134
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:45,715
I...

135
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:50,595
I am

136
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,874
a rare male intellectual

137
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,155
who has both looks and intellect.

138
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:57,394
The Yuan Family is
a renowned family as well.

139
00:07:58,274 --> 00:07:59,274
Isn't it reasonable for me

140
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:01,314
to have higher expectations?

141
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:02,434
That's not it.

142
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:04,235
However, Young Master, why must
you compare your fiancee

143
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,715
to Lady Cheng?

144
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:15,915
I just don't want her
to look down on me.

145
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:17,595
You must pay great attention to this.

146
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:19,115
It's best if we can skip
the wedding gift process

147
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:20,475
and get straight to the marriage.

148
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,754
We will get married

149
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,274
on the day of Lady Cheng's wedding.

150
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:27,115
By then,

151
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:31,115
all those guests will come and
congratulate me instead of her.

152
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,034
I'll see what Cheng Shaoshang
can do about that.

153
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:40,754
He must be out of his mind.

154
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:43,595
I'm sure he's out of his mind.

155
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:02,715
Are you out of your mind?

156
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:05,595
Can't you tell

157
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:07,475
what's different about me today?

158
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,514
I can tell you're crazier than usual.

159
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:13,674
Today,

160
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,595
I'm betrothed.

161
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,115
Which lady is so desperate?

162
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,554
You're just envious of her good taste.

163
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:28,995
She's Lady Cai of Henan.

164
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,435
She's a perfect match for me.

165
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:31,595
She can

166
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:33,435
recite poems when she was three

167
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:34,955
and write rhapsodies when she was seven.

168
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:36,715
She's a famous figure.

169
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:41,154
What are you laughing at?

170
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:42,115
Don't look as if

171
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,514
you've rid yourself of a burden.

172
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:44,794
I've never

173
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:46,075
pestered you like this before, right?

174
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,514
I was laughing because I wanted you
to stop being pretentious.

175
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,715
You aren't a reckless person.

176
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,874
You always think twice before you act.

177
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:54,315
Since you're getting engaged,

178
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:56,315
I'm sure you've assessed

179
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:57,394
the Cai Family beforehand.

180
00:09:57,754 --> 00:09:58,955
And, this engagement

181
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,274
will produce the best result for you.

182
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:02,315
That's why you agreed to it.

183
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,835
This has nothing to do

184
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:06,995
with her talents.

185
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,595
Don't make me sound so sordid.

186
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,274
I got engaged

187
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:12,955
because I truly fancy her.

188
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:14,995
It's a pity...

189
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:15,955
Why?

190
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:17,914
Is it a pity that you can't afford
the betrothal gifts

191
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:18,874
that the Cai Family is asking for?

192
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,514
Why don't I ask my Zisheng

193
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:21,514
to lend you some money?

194
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:23,995
Nothing good comes out of your mouth.

195
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:25,914
I was taking pity on you.

196
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:27,034
From now on,

197
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,634
there's one less

198
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:29,914
dashing

199
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,514
and elegant bachelor in the world.

200
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:36,274
You just need two people to be in love.

201
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:37,914
Getting engaged isn't a business deal.

202
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,154
It won't be a pity
if you two love each other.

203
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,235
What's so good about loving each other?

204
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:43,435
My mother wasn't
married to my father initially.

205
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:46,475
Although we have parents,
it's as if we don't.

206
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:47,435
Initially,

207
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,514
I thought you would be like me.

208
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:50,435
I thought you would take your time

209
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:52,315
to find the most beneficial husband
for yourself.

210
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:54,195
I didn't expect you to...

211
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,274
You didn't expect what?

212
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,435
You didn't expect me to be so lucky

213
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:58,674
to encounter Zisheng, right?

214
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,514
If so, I pray

215
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,075
that you can meet someone
as good as him too.

216
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,394
Wait.

217
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:04,435
I forgot.

218
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,115
You're engaged.

219
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:09,235
It's a pity that you won't get
to encounter anyone else.

220
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,034
However, this is better for you.

221
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:12,754
At least it's a marriage
of equal status.

222
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,514
You should be grateful.

223
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,900
(List of guests)

224
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:55,754
There are so many guests
attending Fourth Lady Cheng's wedding.

225
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:57,835
However, you can actually remember

226
00:11:57,835 --> 00:11:58,914
all of their titles and ranks

227
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,154
without any mistakes.

228
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,554
I wonder

229
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:07,914
who's lucky enough to marry
an excellent lady like you?

230
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,195
Young Marquis Ban,
you're teasing me again.

231
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:14,274
Actually, I've made up my mind.

232
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,115
I'll stay single

233
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,315
so that I can
take good care of First Aunt.

234
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:22,435
You're the smartest lady
I've ever encountered.

235
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:24,195
If you're staying single,

236
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:25,995
I'm afraid some guys

237
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:27,634
will be heartbroken.

238
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:44,914
I wonder which guy will be heartbroken

239
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:47,315
that Yangyang isn't
planning to get married?

240
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,554
Is it you?

241
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,554
That's right, Young Marquis Ban.

242
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,835
You visit us all the time.

243
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,794
And, you're interrupting Yangyang
when she's preparing for the wedding.

244
00:12:58,674 --> 00:12:59,995
Could it be that
you harbor ulterior motives

245
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:01,874
toward Yangyang?

246
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:08,835
Marquis Ban went to Shouchun

247
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,315
with his troops.

248
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,514
He was worried about
Young Marquis Ban's safety.

249
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:14,914
That's why he told him
to visit us more often.

250
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,034
That's right.

251
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:17,435
My grandfather

252
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:20,154
told me to join you guys
during mealtimes.

253
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,115
So, you're just here to eat, huh?

254
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:25,914
The food here tastes great.

255
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:28,674
But the people here

256
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:31,034
are better, right?

257
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:42,235
This is bad!

258
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:43,274
It's an omen!

259
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,355
Such audacity!

260
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,435
I had high expectations of him.

261
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:53,955
However, he sold the country out

262
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:55,874
and caused great distress
to the people of Tongniu County!

263
00:13:58,154 --> 00:13:59,435
All these old fools

264
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:01,514
are useless!

265
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,835
They cannot write anything useful

266
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:06,554
except for things like eradicating
Marquis Quling and his entire clan!

267
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,115
Why should I keep them around?

268
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:20,595
Greetings, Your Majesty.

269
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:22,914
Attendant Cao,

270
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,554
please notify His Majesty for me.

271
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:26,195
I seek an audience with His Majesty.

272
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:28,874
Your Majesty,

273
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:32,195
we just received news that
Tongniu County had been taken over.

274
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:34,034
Some subjects had joined hands

275
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:37,794
and requested His Majesty
to punish Marquis Quling and his family severely

276
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:39,235
to serve as a warning to the public.

277
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:42,914
His Majesty has thrown a tantrum
for the last hour because of this.

278
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:45,394
He doesn't wish to see anyone today.

279
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:47,394
If so,

280
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:50,674
I shall wait outside the hall.

281
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:55,835
Your Majesty, it's cold outside.

282
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,835
Why don't you return
to Changqiu Palace for now?

283
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:58,794
Your Majesty, I shall notify you

284
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,995
once I receive any news.

285
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:01,835
It doesn't matter.

286
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:04,794
I will wait outside the hall.

287
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:07,634
This...

288
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,634
Your Majesty,
why aren't you heading inside?

289
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:26,315
Consort Yue.

290
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:27,995
Heng, great timing.

291
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:30,674
You should go and persuade His Majesty.

292
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:36,435
His Majesty hasn't taken his meals yet?

293
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,514
Yes, His Majesty said
he didn't have any appetite.

294
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,435
He didn't even want
to take a sip of water.

295
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,595
Such nonsense.
Does he know how old he is?

296
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:45,634
He really thinks that
he's made of iron, huh?

297
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,514
I'll check on His Majesty.

298
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:55,754
Consort Yue.

299
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:57,835
His Majesty said he wouldn't see anyone.

300
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:00,274
This is...

301
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,274
Didn't I say I wouldn't see anyone?

302
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:04,235
All of you, scram!

303
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:11,274
Heng, what are you doing here?

304
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:12,235
Were you hurt?

305
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:13,355
Hurry! Summon the physician here!

306
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:14,835
No need for that.

307
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:17,154
Your Majesty, you should continue.

308
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:18,075
Continue with what?

309
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,195
You can continue to throw objects at me.

310
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,475
You thought you were pretty cool,
didn't you?

311
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:26,634
We should summon the physician here

312
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:27,835
to see if you're hurt.

313
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,955
It'll be terrible
if your face is wounded.

314
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:37,315
Throwing things around

315
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:38,955
does feel satisfying.

316
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,075
Your Majesty,

317
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:41,514
if you think throwing
these memorials around

318
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:42,794
isn't satisfying enough,

319
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:44,754
I'll order the servants to bring us
some charcoal pots.

320
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:46,715
Isn't it more satisfying

321
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,955
if we can burn these memorials?

322
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:50,794
I know my fault now.

323
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:51,874
It's my fault.

324
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:54,514
I shouldn't have
vented my anger on them.

325
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,034
Let me see if you're hurt.

326
00:16:58,034 --> 00:16:59,674
Let me see.

327
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,635
I'm not that stupid.

328
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,554
I won't just stand there
and let you throw things at me.

329
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,635
Your Majesty, you haven't taken anything
since this morning.

330
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:15,675
That's why I was worried about you.

331
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:17,715
To repay the favor,

332
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:20,594
I have to make you worry about me.

333
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:21,995
Only then, we'll be even.

334
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:24,675
I'm glad that you're fine.

335
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:26,034
I'm glad that you're fine.

336
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,235
You're still the same.

337
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,155
You were always unwilling

338
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:33,955
to get the short end of the stick.

339
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:37,754
Are these snacks not sweet enough?

340
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,475
Or are these pastries not crispy enough?

341
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,074
Why are we having short sticks

342
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:42,875
when we have snacks here?

343
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:43,955
You're right.

344
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:45,875
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,834
The county magistrate of Tongniu County
and Marquis Quling had defected.

346
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,195
I understand why you were disappointed.

347
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:56,995
However, I know

348
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:58,314
that Your Majesty threw a tantrum

349
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:01,235
not only because of the lost county.

350
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:04,594
You also felt sorry for those
who come from a poor background.

351
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:08,794
Heng,

352
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:10,635
you do know me well.

353
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:14,675
Initially,

354
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:17,395
I planned to promote several students
who had a poor background.

355
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:21,114
However, I was always restrained
by those noble families.

356
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,314
They would rather practice cronyism

357
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:25,554
than selecting people
from poor backgrounds.

358
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,875
Cheng Shi and Yan Zhong,

359
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:29,235
both of them were selected by me

360
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:31,915
even though my subjects objected to them
as they came from a poor background.

361
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:33,754
But now,

362
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,395
both of them have
defected to the enemies.

363
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,074
I'm afraid it would be even harder

364
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:41,034
for me to promote those

365
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:42,514
from a poor background.

366
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:45,995
That spells the end of poor families.

367
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:49,475
Even so,

368
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:52,354
Your Majesty doesn't
need to be that angry.

369
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:53,995
Is there

370
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,395
a secret reason behind this?

371
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,114
Is it something inconvenient
for Your Majesty to announce in public?

372
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:02,195
Why don't you tell me about it?

373
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:05,475
Two deputy county magistrates

374
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,915
saw for themselves that
Cheng Shi and Yan Zhong

375
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:10,274
defected to the enemies together
with 2,000 jin of refined copper.

376
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,314
They have ironclad evidence
of their crime.

377
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:14,354
And now, we can't even locate them.

378
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:15,594
Even if I said

379
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,834
they were maligned,

380
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:19,715
it's hard for me
to prove their innocence.

381
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:23,114
If I do have to punish them both,

382
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:24,354
what should I do about Lady Cheng?

383
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,274
What should I do about Zisheng?

384
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:27,794
What should I do about their wedding?

385
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:28,955
It's going to be ruined again.

386
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:32,435
Your Majesty,

387
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:37,274
as a ruler, you mustn't be indecisive.

388
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,435
You can only convince
the people to trust your rule

389
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:41,955
by following the rules.

390
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,395
Your Majesty, I trust you.

391
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:50,274
I trust Country Magistrate Yan
and Marquis Quling too.

392
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:53,794
I'm sure there's more to this case
than meets the eye.

393
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,195
However, Your Majesty,
you don't need to be conflicted.

394
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,594
You just need to go by the book.

395
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:02,235
We can investigate the case
at our own pace.

396
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:05,395
We won't frame anyone

397
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:07,715
innocent.

398
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,274
Since His Majesty
is having his meal now,

399
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:21,834
I'm sure he's already appeased.

400
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:23,754
Your Majesty, if you're still worried,

401
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,274
why don't you head inside?

402
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:29,514
Since Consort Yue had already
consoled His Majesty,

403
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:31,955
I shouldn't head inside
and cause any trouble.

404
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:35,475
I think the edict will be out soon.

405
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:40,514
Attendant Cao,

406
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:43,514
how does His Majesty
plan to deal with Marquis Quling?

407
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:46,195
His Majesty said...

408
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:54,235
His Majesty said

409
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:57,834
that Marquis Quling's entire family
will be imprisoned.

410
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:59,155
His two siblings,

411
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,834
Cheng Cheng and Cheng Zhi, will be
removed from their posts and imprisoned.

412
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:03,875
The eldest son of the Cheng Family,

413
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,314
Cheng Yong and his wife,

414
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,715
will be detained in
the border area's military camp.

415
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:09,715
Marquis Quling is a patriotic subject.

416
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,875
There's no reason for him
to commit treason at this time.

417
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:12,715
Moreover,

418
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,554
even if Marquis Quling had defected
to the enemies,

419
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:15,955
it has nothing to do with his family.

420
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:18,114
Shaoshang lived in the palace
during the wedding preparation.

421
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:20,114
She has no idea about what happened
in Tongniu County.

422
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,675
Why must she be imprisoned as well?

423
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,754
Regarding Marquis Quling's defection,

424
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,514
His Majesty will definitely
get to the bottom of it.

425
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:27,995
However, the nation has its own rules.

426
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,034
His Majesty cannot practice favoritism.

427
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:31,995
As for Lady Cheng,

428
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:33,635
Your Majesty, you don't need to
worry about her.

429
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:34,995
His Majesty said

430
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:36,915
that since Lady Cheng
was engaged to Zisheng,

431
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,955
she could be counted as
part of the Ling Family.

432
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:41,715
His Majesty will spare her.

433
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,594
Your Majesty, you don't need to worry.

434
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,915
His Majesty is going
to spare Lady Cheng.

435
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:50,635
Your Majesty, this is bad.

436
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:52,475
Lady Cheng insists on leaving the palace

437
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:53,514
after hearing about what happened
to Marquis Quling.

438
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:56,514
She said she would
die together with her family.

439
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,875
What?

440
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:25,395
Stop!

441
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:36,235
Shaoshang,

442
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:37,475
get in my carriage.

443
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:38,875
Have you heard about it?

444
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:41,554
Official Zuo has already reported this
to His Majesty.

445
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:44,554
Now, everyone in the court knows that
General Cheng has defected.

446
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:46,195
You should return home for now.

447
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,235
I shall make an appeal for you
in front of His Majesty.

448
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:49,995
Even if I were to offend His Majesty,

449
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:51,834
I will do it.

450
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:53,594
Do you believe in my father?

451
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:55,794
When I was teaching in the Cheng Family,

452
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:57,715
I made acquaintances with General Cheng.

453
00:22:58,074 --> 00:22:59,554
No matter who believes
that he has defected,

454
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:00,435
I won't.

455
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:02,354
Moreover,

456
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:04,034
he's your father.

457
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:05,635
I won't just sit here
and do nothing about it.

458
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:08,995
Get in my carriage.

459
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:12,475
Thank you.

460
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,820
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

461
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:44,834
Who has the Cheng Family offended

462
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:47,114
for the Commandant
to send his men after us?

463
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:49,594
Cheng Shi

464
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:53,155
bewitched the county magistrate
of Tongniu County and defected

465
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:54,594
to the enemies with
2,000 jin of refined copper.

466
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,915
His Majesty has already issued
the imperial edict.

467
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,354
Madam Cheng, you should surrender.

468
00:24:00,514 --> 00:24:02,594
Are you trying to rebel here

469
00:24:02,594 --> 00:24:04,074
since your husband has defected
to the enemies?

470
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:05,915
You and your men
barged into our residence

471
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:07,195
indiscriminately

472
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:08,514
and humiliated our family.

473
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:09,754
Don't tell me

474
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:11,675
you want us to welcome you
with a warm hug?

475
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:12,554
Did you forget

476
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:14,195
that I was by my husband's side
during the warring period?

477
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:15,635
I've rendered meritorious deeds too.

478
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,274
If you wish to arrest my family,

479
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:19,635
you have to get through me first.

480
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,715
I'm here to seize
Marquis Quling's Residence

481
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:25,675
and arrest criminals like you all

482
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:27,675
under the order of the Commandant.

483
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:29,594
Madam Cheng, your deeds

484
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,715
are nothing in front of

485
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:33,594
His Majesty's imperial edict.

486
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:34,635
It's impossible

487
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:36,314
for my husband to defect to the enemies.

488
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:37,995
I'm sure there's more to this case
than meets the eye.

489
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,675
We can follow you to
the Commandant's Residence

490
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:40,915
and be interrogated.

491
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,794
(Virtue Flows Like Water)
However, we're not criminals,

492
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:43,995
and we won't yield to this defamation.

493
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:45,435
You don't get to say

494
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,635
if you all are criminals or not.

495
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,715
You guys are being overbearing here.

496
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:52,235
How will you face your fellow officials

497
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:54,195
if General Cheng comes back right now?

498
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:55,675
You!

499
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:57,875
If you dare to touch my family members,

500
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:00,274
I'll fight you until the end!

501
00:25:00,514 --> 00:25:02,034
If you dare to hurt my family members,

502
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:03,834
I shall make you all pay!

503
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:04,715
That's right.

504
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:11,195
If anyone tries to resist, kill them.

505
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:12,794
We'll report to His Majesty after that.

506
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:16,554
General,

507
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:17,955
His Majesty had always ruled the nation

508
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:19,915
with virtues and moral obligations.

509
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,995
He has never tortured his people.

510
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,074
The case hasn't even been
brought to trial yet.

511
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:26,675
The Cheng Family isn't convicted
of the crime yet.

512
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,314
But now, you're trying
to intimidate us with violence.

513
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:29,554
This is highly inappropriate of you.

514
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:30,955
Excellent words!

515
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:31,915
Highly inappropriate?

516
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,554
Today, I shall see

517
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:36,635
who thinks this is inappropriate.

518
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:41,195
Me!

519
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:02,675
His Majesty will decide

520
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,715
if the Cheng Family
has betrayed the nation or not.

521
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:07,475
But you're abusing your power
to exact revenge.

522
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,235
Are you tired of living?

523
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:11,514
What nonsense are you saying?

524
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:13,314
I'm executing His Majesty's order.

525
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:14,395
How am I abusing my power?

526
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:15,915
Your niece pushed me into the water.

527
00:26:16,395 --> 00:26:17,794
And I rewarded her with
a splash to the face.

528
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:19,875
Your brother, who was
working in the Censorate,

529
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:21,955
had one of his legs broken
by my husband-to-be.

530
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:23,155
What?

531
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,955
Do you think we're being unfair here?

532
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:26,915
Is that why you're asking for
a beating right now?

533
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:27,635
You!

534
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:32,514
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

535
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:35,675
Now that the Cheng Family
has lost its prestige,

536
00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:37,995
your husband-to-be

537
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:39,875
will no longer support you.

538
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,074
Are you guys dumb?

539
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,475
Take her and her family members down!

540
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:45,554
Stop right there.

541
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,354
(Pass)
According to His Majesty's edict,

542
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:53,114
Lady Cheng isn't involved with the case.

543
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:54,235
General Zuo,

544
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:56,514
are you trying to defy
the imperial edict?

545
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:06,475
Official Yuan,

546
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:09,274
as the Attendant Gentleman of
the Ministry of Justice,

547
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,195
are you trying to hinder me
from executing public duties?

548
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:16,554
His Majesty has issued another edict.

549
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:19,435
The Ministry of Justice
shall handle this case.

550
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:20,754
He has ordered me

551
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:21,995
to escort the kin of the suspect

552
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:23,915
to the Ministry of Justice
for interrogation purposes.

553
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:27,034
We're to escort them,
not to arrest them.

554
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:28,475
General Zuo,

555
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,955
do you understand
what His Majesty means?

556
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:41,074
Let's go!

557
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,675
His Majesty has ordered me

558
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,034
to interrogate you all
in the Ministry of Justice.

559
00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:05,435
I'm executing my duties here.

560
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:06,834
Madam, please pardon me.

561
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,034
Thank you, Official Yuan.

562
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,915
My sons and I only went against the edict

563
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:11,155
as I was too anxious.

564
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:12,754
However,

565
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,195
there's more to this case
than meets the eye.

566
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:15,955
In order to prove our innocence,

567
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:17,554
we're willing

568
00:28:17,715 --> 00:28:19,594
to be interrogated in
the Ministry of Justice.

569
00:28:20,314 --> 00:28:21,754
Why must the entire family be there?

570
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:22,995
Because General and I

571
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:24,635
are the loyal subjects of His Majesty

572
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,794
and the protectors of the nation.

573
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:27,715
Since we're paid by the nation,

574
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,915
we have to obey the rules.

575
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:31,195
We have to go!

576
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,554
Please.

577
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:43,794
Old Madam.

578
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,195
Yangyang,

579
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,435
bring your grandmother there.

580
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:57,955
Grandmother.

581
00:29:23,274 --> 00:29:24,395
Why are you following us?

582
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,875
His Majesty is treating you
as a part of the Ling Family

583
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:27,955
as you'll be married to Ling Buyi soon.

584
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:29,675
This case has nothing to do with you.

585
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:31,034
Return to Changqiu Palace immediately.

586
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:32,274
I'm the young lady of the Cheng Family

587
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:34,235
as long as I'm not married yet.

588
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:36,554
If my kin is convicted of this crime,

589
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:37,834
I shall suffer together with them.

590
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:42,754
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

591
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:51,715
First Aunt, calm down!

592
00:29:54,114 --> 00:29:55,794
Niaoniao did so because
she was worried about us!

593
00:29:58,155 --> 00:30:00,034
I slapped her because I was
angry at her ignorance!

594
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:02,955
We don't know
if your father is dead or alive.

595
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,034
If we cannot

596
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,875
clear our names,

597
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:08,435
you'll be the last descendant

598
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:10,034
of our family.

599
00:30:11,754 --> 00:30:12,715
Cheng Shaoshang,

600
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,235
listen up.

601
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:18,034
No matter what happens to
the Cheng Family,

602
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:20,114
you must live on.

603
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,675
You must survive.

604
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,675
If not, the ancestors of
the Cheng Family

605
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:28,034
will never forgive you.

606
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,155
Your father and I

607
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:34,554
will never forgive you.

608
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:40,235
Understood?

609
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:46,794
Official Yuan,

610
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:49,514
what punishment awaits those
who defect to the enemies

611
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:51,635
and sell one's nation to the enemies?

612
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:56,034
According to the law,

613
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:57,834
their entire clan will be massacred.

614
00:31:58,754 --> 00:32:00,074
Men will be tortured and executed.

615
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:02,794
Women will be banished
to the border areas.

616
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:05,955
I'm sure

617
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,594
that day will never arrive.

618
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:35,700
(Yongle Palace)

619
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:38,754
Lady Cheng, you should head back.

620
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:39,274
You!

621
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:40,155
You're putting His Majesty on the spot

622
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:42,114
by kneeling here.

623
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,955
His Majesty will never see you.

624
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,034
Your Majesty!

625
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:52,114
It's impossible for Father
to sell his nation out!

626
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:53,955
I know I'm insignificant.

627
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:56,715
However, this is
the only thing I can do!

628
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,834
Your Majesty, I request an audience!

629
00:32:59,114 --> 00:33:00,395
Lady Cheng,

630
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,995
it's pouring out here.

631
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:03,475
What should we do

632
00:33:03,475 --> 00:33:04,995
if you get sick?

633
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:05,995
It's best if I can die here.

634
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,354
My father had served the nation
and its people his entire life.

635
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:10,435
But now, he's framed for
such a ridiculous crime.

636
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,554
Even the heavens cannot stand this.

637
00:33:12,554 --> 00:33:14,074
The heavens are crying

638
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:15,995
because our family is maligned.

639
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:18,995
Due to that, it's snowing in the summer

640
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:20,794
and there is thunderstorm in the winter.

641
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,594
That's how it is.

642
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:25,635
Listen to her.

643
00:33:25,915 --> 00:33:27,114
What the heck is she saying?

644
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,715
It's snowing in the summer
and there is thunderstorm in the winter?

645
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:31,754
What does she mean by that?

646
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:33,794
It's obvious that she's saying
that I'm a fatuous ruler.

647
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:36,435
Your Majesty, if you're worried about
Lady Cheng,

648
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,235
you should summon her.

649
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,314
You're stretching your neck
just to hear her words.

650
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:42,354
I'm afraid your neck will be sore.

651
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,514
Who's worried about her?

652
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,354
She can get drenched all she likes.

653
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,155
I won't feel sorry for her.

654
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:50,475
This little lady,

655
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:51,915
how could she

656
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:53,034
have such a stubborn temper?

657
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:54,594
If she does fall sick,

658
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,395
Zisheng will be upset
when he comes back.

659
00:33:58,794 --> 00:33:59,995
I don't feel for her.

660
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:01,314
I just feel for Zisheng.

661
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,794
Your Majesty, if you don't
uphold justice for my family,

662
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,674
I'll seek justice from the gods
of Mount Taishan!

663
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:13,355
Your Majesty, if you're
not seeing me today,

664
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:15,315
I will kneel here until you see me!

665
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,835
Your Highness, great timing.

666
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:20,475
Please persuade Lady Cheng to stop.

667
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:22,634
Why are you kneeling as well?

668
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:23,915
You don't have an umbrella!

669
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,194
Your Highness.

670
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,835
I also don't believe that Marquis Quling
will defect to the enemies.

671
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:32,034
Since you're seeking an audience,

672
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:33,795
let me join you.

673
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,355
Your Highness, if you fall sick,

674
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:36,795
Her Majesty will be worried.

675
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:38,275
Besides, Your Highness,

676
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:40,074
you were only released from
detainment just recently.

677
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,955
If you get yourself involved,

678
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:44,315
what should we do if His Majesty
punishes you again?

679
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,355
Lady Cheng, you once risked your life
to investigate my case.

680
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:47,714
I will not turn my back on you.

681
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:50,795
Let us seek the gods
of Mount Taishan together.

682
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:52,475
Look at you guys!

683
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:55,995
What should we do about you two?

684
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,154
Your Majesty!

685
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:10,395
-Shield His Highness from the rain!
-Your Majesty?

686
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:10,795
Shield His Highness from the rain!

687
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:11,955
-Shield His Highness from the rain!
-Don't be afraid.

688
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:13,795
I will join you guys.

689
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,634
His Majesty is cold-hearted!

690
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:19,435
He will never see me!

691
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:21,674
Your Majesty, you should head back.

692
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:22,875
Please don't fall sick.

693
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:30,194
Why is the empress here as well?

694
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,755
Her body won't be able to take it.

695
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:36,714
She always takes a long time

696
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,795
to recover from her sickness.

697
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:40,475
And, what is the Crown Prince doing?

698
00:35:40,835 --> 00:35:42,074
He's not even afraid of detainment now.

699
00:35:42,395 --> 00:35:43,955
Her Majesty won't be able
to stand the harsh weather.

700
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:45,674
You should check on her.

701
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,435
I won't go.

702
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:50,755
Just go.

703
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:51,594
No, I won't.

704
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:53,395
Just go!

705
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:21,995
Enough!

706
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:24,154
Stop bowing!

707
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:25,714
Return to your palace!

708
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:28,034
Have some ginger soup
and warm yourselves up!

709
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:30,475
Cheng Shaoshang,

710
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:31,674
don't think that you can

711
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:33,234
threaten me

712
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:34,835
with your foolish behavior!

713
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:37,714
And you two!

714
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,875
On usual days,

715
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:39,995
you two

716
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:42,074
do not go against the palace rules!

717
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:43,114
What's wrong?

718
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,835
Are you guys influenced by

719
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:47,435
Cheng Shaoshang's boorishness
after she joined the palace?

720
00:36:47,714 --> 00:36:48,594
Your Majesty,

721
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:50,594
this is not Shaoshang's fault.

722
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:53,275
Even if Shaoshang wasn't here,

723
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:55,875
I would demand an explanation
for the Cheng Family too.

724
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:59,594
Your Majesty, please grant Shaoshang
her wish.

725
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:01,315
Marquis Quling has
defected to the enemies.

726
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:02,835
This case will be brought to trial.

727
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,714
I've already issued an imperial edict.

728
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:07,114
No changes are allowed.

729
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:10,074
You should stop trying
to plead for them.

730
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:12,995
I've already spared Cheng Shaoshang.

731
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,194
I've already done enough

732
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,955
to spare her from the case.

733
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:18,355
However, Your Majesty...

734
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:19,475
Your Majesty, you have a weak body.

735
00:37:19,714 --> 00:37:21,475
Why don't you join me in Yongle Palace

736
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,114
and have some ginger soup?

737
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:24,634
Your Majesty,

738
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,714
Lady Cheng isn't an ignorant lady.

739
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:28,795
She wouldn't

740
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:30,275
put you on the spot like this.

741
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:32,074
I assume she's just
worried about her father

742
00:37:32,074 --> 00:37:34,315
and that she wants to know more
about the case in Tongniu County.

743
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:35,114
Your Majesty,

744
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:37,074
you should grant her an audience.

745
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:39,194
Your Majesty.

746
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,355
Just grant her an audience.

747
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:51,475
Your Majesty.

748
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:54,395
Enough!

749
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:55,755
Cao Cheng,

750
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:57,355
get some ginger soup.

751
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:58,795
You may come in.

752
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:01,835
Thank you, Your Majesty!

753
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:53,315
Master?

754
00:38:56,355 --> 00:38:57,554
Are you here to visit us?

755
00:38:58,275 --> 00:38:59,475
Do you have news from Niaoniao?

756
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,755
Mr. Yuan, do you have any news
of my father?

757
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:03,714
Mr. Yuan, is Niaoniao doing okay?

758
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:05,114
She looked distressed today.

759
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:06,714
You should console her.

760
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:12,755
Official Yuan,

761
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:14,034
did His Majesty say

762
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:16,034
how he would punish
Cheng Cheng and Cheng Zhi?

763
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,594
Yangyang was implicated because of us.

764
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,755
Since His Majesty has spared Shaoshang,

765
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:22,995
can His Majesty

766
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,755
spare Yangyang as well?

767
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:25,755
First Aunt,

768
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:27,194
I won't leave.

769
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:28,835
I was happy

770
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:30,475
that I could be together with you all.

771
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:33,915
Although I'm not as witty as Niaoniao

772
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:35,674
and I can't think of a way
to save you all,

773
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:36,915
at least

774
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:39,435
I can take care of you and Grandmother
when I'm here.

775
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:41,955
I have no complaints.

776
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:43,154
First Aunt,

777
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,634
please allow me to stay here.

778
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:48,554
Don't worry.

779
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:49,955
Cheng Cheng

780
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:52,154
was only detained in Bailu Academy.

781
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:53,755
County Magistrate Cheng and his wife

782
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:55,795
were detained in Hua County.

783
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:58,395
Your eldest son and his wife
were detained in the military camp.

784
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,955
However, the military didn't make
things difficult for them.

785
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:02,755
Don't worry.

786
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:05,114
The Ministry of Justice will get to
the bottom of this as soon as possible.

787
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:06,674
As long as the truth is out,

788
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:08,554
you all will be released.

789
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:10,315
Sir!

790
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,674
Sir, was Zhi arrested as well?

791
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:15,435
Sir!

792
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:24,275
God! Open your eyes!

793
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:27,714
Sir, it's just 2,000 jin of
refined copper, right?

794
00:40:27,714 --> 00:40:29,315
How much are they? I'll pay for them!

795
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:31,755
I'll pay His Majesty for it, okay?

796
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:34,194
I'll pay for the amount
that Shi has taken!

797
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:35,875
I'll pay for everything!

798
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:36,714
Old Madam!

799
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:39,154
Do you know how much 2,000 jin
of refined copper will cost you?

800
00:40:39,795 --> 00:40:41,275
Do you think you can afford them?

801
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:44,435
Besides, this case isn't over yet.

802
00:40:44,435 --> 00:40:47,194
Why are you saying as if
my husband was guilty?

803
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:50,114
You jinx!

804
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:53,915
You shouldn't have brought my son
to the battlefield back then!

805
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:57,154
You just had to be a great general, huh?

806
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:01,355
I would rather he come back

807
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:03,755
and become a peasant!

808
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:08,755
Sir!

809
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:09,835
Sir!

810
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:13,154
How much do you need to free him?
Tell me.

811
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:16,114
This heartless woman
isn't willing to save her husband.

812
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,554
I will save my son myself!

813
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:23,074
Sir, I have all the money you need!
I'll save him!

814
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:23,915
Old Madam,

815
00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:26,435
His Majesty is handling
the case himself.

816
00:41:26,594 --> 00:41:27,995
I do not dare to abuse my power here.

817
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:29,275
I'm here

818
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:31,034
to deliver your meals to you.

819
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:32,514
Why don't you all have dinner

820
00:41:32,714 --> 00:41:33,955
before we talk about anything else?

821
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:39,674
I won't eat.

822
00:41:40,154 --> 00:41:43,594
Instead of being beheaded,

823
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,395
I would rather starve to death.

824
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:48,395
At least my corpse is complete.

825
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:54,875
Even if Old Madam doesn't want to eat,

826
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,514
we shall eat.

827
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,074
It takes time to get
to the bottom of this case.

828
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:01,714
We shouldn't starve ourselves to death

829
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:03,194
before our names are cleared.

830
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:07,755
Yes, Mother. I will eat.

831
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,154
Yes, me too.

832
00:42:09,435 --> 00:42:11,154
Keep some for me. I will eat too.

833
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:17,795
Open the meal box.

834
00:43:06,114 --> 00:43:07,755
I've lost my appetite

835
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:09,475
thinking about Marquis Quling's case.

836
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:12,634
But you do seem like
you're enjoying the ginger soup, huh?

837
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:16,755
A tragedy has befallen your family.

838
00:43:19,315 --> 00:43:20,755
I have to take good care of myself.

839
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,114
Only then, I will have the strength
to do something about it.

840
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:24,875
Naturally, I have to drink.

841
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:28,435
You turned yourself into a mess

842
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,114
after Zisheng left the capital
for a few days.

843
00:43:31,795 --> 00:43:33,074
Do you know that
you've let Zisheng down?

844
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:41,835
If I don't let Zisheng down,

845
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:44,995
that means I'll let my parents down.

846
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:47,315
I was just

847
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:48,955
going by the book.

848
00:43:50,234 --> 00:43:51,234
Instead of

849
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:52,795
speaking out against
your father's injustice,

850
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:54,714
why don't you ask him

851
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:56,955
why he defected to the enemies?

852
00:43:57,674 --> 00:43:59,234
I have something I don't understand.

853
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:02,514
Your Majesty, please explain it to me.

854
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,355
My mother, my brothers,
and I are in the capital,

855
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:07,475
leading a comfortable life.

856
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:10,514
And, I will get married to Zisheng soon.

857
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:12,755
My father doesn't lack anything in life,

858
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:14,074
and he has a harmonious family.

859
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:16,514
Why did he defect to the enemies?

860
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:17,634
That's right.

861
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:20,194
I wish to know the answer to that too.

862
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,554
I always treated your father nicely.

863
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,795
Why did he defect to the enemies?

864
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:26,995
I have no idea.

865
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:29,755
Your Majesty,
I assume you have no idea too.

866
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:32,194
It's obvious that Father

867
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:34,875
doesn't have a reason
to betray Your Majesty.

868
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,594
Therefore,

869
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:39,755
Father was surely maligned.

870
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:42,315
I've always treated Lord Yong

871
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,594
and Peng Kun nicely too.

872
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:45,074
Even so, they betrayed me.

873
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:47,275
Therefore, you cannot prove
that your father was maligned

874
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:49,995
with those words of yours.

875
00:44:49,995 --> 00:44:50,995
How could you compare those traitors

876
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:52,554
to Father?

877
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:54,875
Father isn't as stupid as them.

878
00:44:58,114 --> 00:44:59,395
Just look at you.

879
00:44:59,594 --> 00:45:00,475
I assume your father

880
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:01,835
isn't that much smarter than you.

881
00:45:05,315 --> 00:45:06,795
Your Majesty, you can insult me.

882
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:10,154
But you mustn't insult my father.

883
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,514
My father

884
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:13,995
is the person

885
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:16,154
who loves his children
the most in the world.

886
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:18,955
If Father was here,

887
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:21,714
I'm sure he wouldn't
let me get drenched.

888
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:30,594
If so, tell me then.

889
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,915
Cheng Shi headed to Tongniu County

890
00:45:32,915 --> 00:45:34,634
to assist the county magistrate
to allocate military supplies.

891
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,194
Why would he and
County Magistrate Yan Zhong

892
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:38,755
run away with 2,000 jin
of refined copper

893
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:40,835
if they didn't betray the country?

894
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:43,034
Even now, we have no news of them.

895
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:45,234
If so, why were
the deputy county magistrates

896
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:46,514
so sure

897
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:48,275
that both of them
had betrayed the country?

898
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:51,074
Shaoshang,

899
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:52,955
even if

900
00:45:53,395 --> 00:45:55,154
I trust your father,

901
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:57,234
I have to make my subjects
in the imperial court

902
00:45:57,234 --> 00:45:58,634
trust him as well.

903
00:45:59,995 --> 00:46:00,875
Now,

904
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:03,955
if we cannot locate the stolen
refined copper of 2,000 jin,

905
00:46:04,074 --> 00:46:05,154
I'm afraid

906
00:46:05,714 --> 00:46:07,395
I cannot ensure your family's safety.

907
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:12,674
Your Majesty,

908
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,714
allow me to head to Tongniu County.

909
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:17,475
I'll locate the 2,000 jin
of stolen refined copper for you.

910
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,234
Stop spouting nonsense.

911
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:22,154
Why would I send a little lady like you

912
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,475
to Tongniu County?

913
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:25,755
That county is close to Shouchun.

914
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:27,194
Peng Kun has taken over the county.

915
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:27,795
It's very dangerous.

916
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:28,755
I'm not afraid.

917
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,795
Back then, when we encountered
danger in Hua County,

918
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:33,514
I once defended the family
with our servants.

919
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:36,674
Zisheng taught me how to defend myself.

920
00:46:37,154 --> 00:46:38,194
I can ride horses

921
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:39,755
and create machines.

922
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:42,315
Your Majesty,

923
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:45,194
the longer my father is out there,

924
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:47,395
the more danger he'll be in.

925
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:49,594
Your Majesty, I beg you.

926
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:52,034
Please let me seek my father.

927
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:54,275
Say no more.

928
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:55,714
I will leave the case

929
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:57,755
to the Ministry of Justice.

930
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,514
You don't need to interfere.

931
00:46:59,755 --> 00:47:01,835
Just stay in the palace

932
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:03,234
and wait for Zisheng's return

933
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:04,475
so that you can get married to him.

934
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:09,154
Your Majesty, I beg you!

935
00:47:09,755 --> 00:47:11,755
Please let me seek my father
in Tongniu County.

936
00:47:11,755 --> 00:47:13,114
Your Majesty, please!

937
00:47:13,315 --> 00:47:14,554
Why are you so stubborn?

938
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:15,395
Cao Cheng!

939
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:17,554
Yes, Your Majesty?

940
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:20,514
Your Majesty.

941
00:47:20,995 --> 00:47:22,435
Bring Lady Cheng
back to Changqiu Palace.

942
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:23,514
Tell Her Majesty

943
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:25,915
that she's a sinner as well.

944
00:47:25,995 --> 00:47:26,755
From today onward,

945
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:28,674
she is not to leave Changqiu Palace.

946
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:30,074
Yes, Your Majesty.
