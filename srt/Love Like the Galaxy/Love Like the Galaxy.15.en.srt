3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,960
Fu Deng,

4
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
I want you to find some scrolls for me.

5
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
I want genres

6
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,120
that only teach people
about love and romance

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,480
and are not about persuading people

8
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,640
to be good.

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,840
Young Lady, you're an unmarried lady.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,960
Don't you think it's improper
to read such texts

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,200
instead of reading the classics?

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
Just do what I told you.

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
Or else I'll tell Lianfang

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,080
that you turned into an ingrate

15
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,680
and refused to listen to me
when I return to the capital.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,920
Just wait and see what she'll do to you.

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,680
Please don't.

18
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,800
Young Lady, I'll do whatever you say.

19
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
But please put in good words for me

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,720
in front of Lianfang.

21
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,320
As long as you can find me

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,640
the scrolls teaching how to be a couple,

23
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,720
I'll praise you

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,520
until it's out of this world.

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,420
(If husband's parents die,
his wife should offer condolences.)

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,760
This brat of a Fu Deng.

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,760
Where in the world did he get
all these obscene materials?

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,600
I can't. I just can't read it anymore.

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
Why are they so...

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,480
Shaoshang.

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,440
No, I wasn't...

32
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,200
What are you doing outside the window?

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
You frightened me.

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Fu Deng said you're studying hard.

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,480
So I brought some liquor to motivate you.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
At least you have some consciences.

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,240
Don't read it!

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,320
There's nothing to be scared of.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,920
Have you seen it?

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,760
Yes.

41
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
When we men get together,

42
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,520
we always read these.

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
Aha! You spilled the beans!

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,240
I didn't expect

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,200
you men would read such things

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,120
when you get together.

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,480
Confucius said
these desires are part of human nature.

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,600
How is this obscene?

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,480
Besides,

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
I don't always read them.

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,240
If it's what Confucius said,

52
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,360
there's nothing wrong with it then.

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,920
Why don't

54
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,440
we study together?

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,720
Very well.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
What are they trying to prove
with these images?

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
Intimacy with the husband,

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,080
be submissive,

59
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,920
and force yourself to have a good time?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Never!

61
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,040
A bunch of nonsense.

62
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
Why can't something like

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,920
expanding the country's territory

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,960
and building houses
with the husband

65
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,160
written in these books?

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,080
I agree with you.

67
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,960
All those written here are now in the past.

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,720
Now, ladies are hearty and competent.

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,120
Why can't they achieve great things

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
like expanding territories?

71
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,880
These

72
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,280
love-indulging scrolls

73
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,120
are bad influences on the ladies.

74
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
In my mind,

75
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
the best love in the world is

76
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,240
for both people
to walk side by side as equals

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,640
instead of having differences in status.

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Yao,

79
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,280
to have

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,880
our relationship this way is the best.

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,800
Well said.

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,720
There's no rules for love
in the first place.

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,000
It's good enough to get along
with each other.

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,160
Let's drink.

85
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
Shaoshang.

86
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,160
If your mother

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
is always against our betrothal,

88
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,920
are you still willing

89
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,760
to be with me?

90
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Yao, don't worry.

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
No matter how my mother is against it,

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll stand by you.

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
But now,

94
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,400
we need to think

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,600
about how to be in a relationship.

96
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,600
I thought

97
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,600
we were already in a relationship.

98
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
What is there to learn?

99
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,400
You're right.

100
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,240
Yao, every word you said is

101
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
what I wanted to say.

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
We're precisely in a relationship now.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,560
Why should we follow
what's written in the scrolls?

104
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,040
We can write one on our relationship

105
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
and let others learn from us.

106
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,440
Well said.

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,120
Let's drink.

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,560
If I followed my elder's advice

109
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,320
and married Huangfu Yi,

110
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
would I live a pleasant life now?

111
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,120
We may be her elders.

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,320
But things don't always turn out
the way we expected.

113
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
Only the wearer knows

114
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,240
if the shoes fit.

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,280
So only they know

116
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,480
who they're comfortable with.

117
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,920
Do you also think I shouldn't intervene?

118
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,600
Then tell me

119
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,360
what is it that you dislike
about Lou Yao?

120
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,920
When he heard you were too upset to eat,

121
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,840
he sent all kinds of foods.

122
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,080
Even if you wanted rare delicacies,

123
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,520
he would bring them to you.

124
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,160
Are you still not satisfied with this?

125
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Mr. Lou is polite,

126
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
considerate and meticulous.

127
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,720
But the position of the Lou Family's
Second Chamber concerns me.

128
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,400
I can't just watch Niaoniao
walk into suffering.

129
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,480
How about you think of this
from a different angle?

130
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,640
As Lou's Second Chamber is weak
and lacks family members,

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,600
the widowed mother and eldest brother
wouldn't mistreat Niaoniao.

132
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,400
Besides, Niaoniao treats others

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
with gentleness and thoughtfulness.

134
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,560
After they get married,

135
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,880
I'm sure they'll get along very well.

136
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,920
Sister-in-law,

137
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
what are you thinking about?

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,400
If Yangyang's future in-laws are not

139
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,400
as prestigious as the Lou clan,

140
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,400
I'm worried the Ge clan will resent us.

141
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Besides,

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,000
Yangyang is supposed
to be married off first as she's older.

143
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,520
If Niaoniao gets married first,

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,160
won't people talk?

145
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,680
Here you go again.

146
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
Why are rules

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,320
more important to you
than everything else?

148
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,040
I've told you before.

149
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,840
You can't manage your family
the same way you handle soldiers.

150
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,520
With Niaoniao's appearances
and temperament,

151
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,320
you can't hide them all.

152
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,280
Yangyang has her positive side.

153
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,040
She'll definitely be happily married
in the future.

154
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,320
If you hinder Niaoniao's marriage
because of these worries,

155
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,480
that's even worse.

156
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,920
Shunhua, stop persuading me.

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,240
I'll never agree

158
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
to this marriage.

159
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,160
If you insist on declining this betrothal,

160
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
you can't announce it publicly.

161
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,120
The Lou Family isn't
an ordinary family household.

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,480
If the news
of the marriage proposal being rejected

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,520
is made known to all
and caused an uproar like the first one,

164
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
that would bring shame
to the Lou Family.

165
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you think the Lou Family
would reconcile with us

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
as they did with the He family?

167
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,840
I know once you've made up your mind,

168
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
no one can make you change your mind.

169
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,320
In that case,

170
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
how about hear me out?

171
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,640
You sure have a lot of ideas.

172
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
What is it?

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,720
All couples are the same.

174
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
They may not be deeply affectionate
with each other.

175
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,520
But if their parents get in their way,

176
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
(they'd immediately feel)

177
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
(that they're a couple
with a cruel fate.)

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,440
(Then they'd be inseparable.)

179
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,160
(If you truly want
to test Niaoniao's sincerity,)

180
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,920
(why don't you
just let them get together first?)

181
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,840
(It may not take long)

182
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
(for her to change her mind
to marry Lou Yao.)

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,840
Nice.

184
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,280
You played nicely.

185
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,800
It's a nice song.

186
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,480
Young Lady,

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,240
are you Shunhua's niece?

188
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,040
Be careful.

189
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm Cheng Shaoshang.

190
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,680
How do you know my Third Aunt?

191
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm Huangfu Yi.

192
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,280
I want to thank you

193
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,440
for delivering my message to your aunt.

194
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,400
(So he's Mr. Huangfu,)

195
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,440
(the one who used every means
to deliver the message.)

196
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,800
"Spending my youth yearning
when it's not everlasting,

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,120
when will you return with success
on a chariot?"

198
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
A few days ago,

199
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,880
I heard your aunt was injured.

200
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,640
I was afraid it might not be convenient
for her to move around.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,920
So I especially built

202
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,560
this chariot and gave it to her.

203
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,520
Who would have thought

204
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,080
that your uncle would give
this chariot to you?

205
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,680
It was my Third Aunt

206
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,440
who gave this chariot to me.

207
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,640
Mr. Huangfu, you don't have
to worry about her injuries.

208
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,560
From bandaging,
and changing the fresh dressing

209
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,200
to sucking the pus and blood
from the wound,

210
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,080
my Third Uncle
didn't let anyone else do it

211
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
and did everything himself.

212
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
If there's nothing else,

213
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,720
we should get going now.

214
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,280
But the sky seems cloudy.

215
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,560
I'm afraid it's going to rain soon.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,840
Yao,

217
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
we have no place to take shelter.

218
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
Over this hillside is a courtyard

219
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,080
where His Majesty stayed
during his journey.

220
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,320
Lady Cheng,

221
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,720
would you like to visit?

222
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,880
Since I can't meet your aunt,

223
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
it's also nice to get together

224
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
and chat with you.

225
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,080
I didn't want to go.

226
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,080
But it's going to rain.

227
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,640
So I'll accept your invitation.

228
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,720
Thank you, Mr. Huangfu.

229
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,120
Please follow me.

230
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,760
Shaoshang,

231
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,680
we can still make it back

232
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,160
before it rains.

233
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,160
My Third Aunt didn't want

234
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,400
to tell me about her past in detail.

235
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,960
Why not take this chance

236
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,640
to hear about it?

237
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,080
Let's go.

238
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,120
Greetings, Master.

239
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
This is General Ling.

240
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
He was injured from suppressing rebels
and hasn't recovered since.

241
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,640
His Majesty let him stay here
to recuperate.

242
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,000
General Ling, is your injury better now?

243
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,560
General Ling, Shanjian.

244
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,120
I didn't expect to see you here.

245
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,280
I'm sure you don't know this.

246
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm in the middle of talks of marriage.

247
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,840
She's the one.

248
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,440
She'll be your future sister-in-law.

249
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,880
Prepare another bowl.

250
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,840
Yes, Young Master.

251
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,600
It has only been two months.

252
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,320
Lady Cheng,

253
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
are you getting married?

254
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,760
Allow me to congratulate you.

255
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,800
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

256
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,640
It's already raining.

257
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,320
How about we make a move

258
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,560
and leave for the courtyard.

259
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
The rain is heavy.

260
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
We shall go together.

261
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,520
Lady Cheng,

262
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,360
you can take my carriage.

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
Your chariot may have a parasol.

264
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,880
But it can't entirely block
the wind and rain.

265
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,000
I heard you just recovered from a cold.

266
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,160
It would be bad if you get sick

267
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,760
from the rain again.

268
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,000
Mr. Lou,

269
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
I have straw capes and horses.

270
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,440
If you don't mind,

271
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,120
we can ride the horses.

272
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,200
Thank you, Zisheng.

273
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,040
Shaoshang, you can go now.

274
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,400
I'll catch up with you.

275
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,280
Remember to be quick.

276
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,440
Young Lady, this way, please.

277
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,560
Thank you, General Ling.

278
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,960
No matter.

279
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,760
Fourth Lady Cheng, we've arrived.

280
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,080
Thank you, General Ling.

281
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,440
It's nothing.

282
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,120
Lady Cheng,

283
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,440
this courtyard was built
by craftsmen of the previous dynasty.

284
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,160
If you're interested,

285
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,200
I can show you around.

286
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,160
How far is this place from Hua County?

287
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
The rain is too heavy.

288
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,040
Even if you rush back,

289
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,440
the city gates would be closed.

290
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,920
You can stay here tonight.

291
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
I've sent someone

292
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,760
to Hua County to inform Official Cheng.

293
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,160
So no need to worry.

294
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
Thank you, General Ling.

295
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,200
Lady Cheng was in the rain just now.

296
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,360
Help her wash up.

297
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,040
I want to wait for Yao.

298
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
I can take care of Mr. Lou.

299
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,360
You should go now.

300
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,720
Young Lady, this way, please.

301
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,760
Shaoshang.

302
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,400
Yao,

303
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,640
I can't believe you're
in talks of marriage again.

304
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,680
You mustn't indulge in women's charms.

305
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,800
Don't forget

306
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
the teachings

307
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,560
of the teachers at Mount Bailu.

308
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,120
Of course, I won't.

309
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,560
I'm your eldest brother's classmate.

310
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,560
Today,

311
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,920
I shall do an eldest brother's duty
on his behalf

312
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,160
to test if you've fallen behind
on your studies.

313
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,720
You can't be serious.

314
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,920
There happens to be a study room
in the courtyard.

315
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,600
If you wish to study,

316
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,680
the study room is

317
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,160
the perfect place to go.

318
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,120
Are you going to test me now?

319
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,080
Two hours have passed.

320
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,360
Why can't we start now?

321
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,720
If you study hard all the time,

322
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
you won't be worried.

323
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
All right.

324
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,280
Shanjian, please test me.

325
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,360
I want to ask you.

326
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,040
Why did you suddenly come to Hua County?

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,160
You're even talking about marriage
with Fourth Lady Cheng.

328
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,760
These aren't in the books.

329
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,640
I never said I'd only test you
from the book.

330
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,640
I've admired Shaoshang for a long time.

331
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,760
I wanted to be close to her.

332
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,440
So I followed her here.

333
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,720
Admired her for a long time?

334
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,040
Did you admire her
because she's scheming

335
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,040
or full of tricks?

336
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,800
Shanjian, you've misunderstood Shaoshang.

337
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,520
She's just resourceful, smarter,

338
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,560
and more alert than other ladies.

339
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,920
Only a fool like you would fall
for her tricks.

340
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Another question.

341
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,040
How did she know Ling Zisheng?

342
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
When she ran into danger,

343
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,800
it was General Ling
who rescued Shaoshang from the rebels.

344
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
Shaoshang even treated his injury.

345
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,640
Treated his injury?

346
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,360
Does she even know
how to treat an injury?

347
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,080
A hero saving a damsel in distress.

348
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,960
How typical.

349
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,320
Wait a minute.

350
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,680
I think she used
the treatment in exchange

351
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
for Ling Buyi to escort all of you
to Hua County.

352
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,480
Shanjian,

353
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,560
I don't know what kind
of misunderstanding you two have

354
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,280
or what she did to offend you.

355
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,800
But

356
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
she's not as bad as you imagined.

357
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,560
Offended?

358
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,080
Not really.

359
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm not close to her.

360
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,560
Your brother and I are

361
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
classmates and good friends.

362
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,320
I just want to remind you

363
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,240
not to be tricked by her beautiful

364
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,680
and innocent appearance.

365
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,480
It's not easy

366
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
to deal with this lady.

367
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
Be careful not to ruin your family
and your reputation.

368
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,280
Mr. Lou. Mr. Yuan.

369
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,640
Dinner is ready.

370
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,440
General Ling invites you
to dine at the hall.

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,760
All right.

372
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,520
Lady Cheng,

373
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,720
this way, please.

374
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,800
Sitting there is more convenient

375
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
to talk to Master.

376
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,120
It's all right. Go ahead.

377
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,960
Have a seat.

378
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,200
May the war end

379
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,920
so we have peace in the world.

380
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,400
May we have no regrets

381
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,920
and despairs in the past.

382
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,760
It's been more than 20 years

383
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,200
since Emperor Li sabotaged me.

384
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,120
I was forced to leave home
and travel long journeys.

385
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
How time flies.

386
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,520
Lady Cheng,

387
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,800
since I'm an elder,

388
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,920
can I call you Shaoshang

389
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
like your aunt does?

390
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,400
As you wish.

391
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,760
It's fate that we meet.

392
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Shaoshang,

393
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm going

394
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,640
to tell you a story today.

395
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,000
What do you think?

396
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,360
Is it about yourself?

397
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,920
It's only a story

398
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
that doesn't depict actual persons.

399
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,520
Many years ago,

400
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,640
there lived a young man
of a noble family.

401
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,600
His father may have passed away early.

402
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,960
But he was exceptionally gifted.

403
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,600
Later, he became famous

404
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,440
and was sought after by all.

405
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,080
This young man

406
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,680
had a fiancée with who he had been
engaged since childhood.

407
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,040
Unfortunately,

408
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the young man thought

409
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,520
his fiancée wasn't worthy of him

410
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,280
because she looked ordinary.

411
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,120
Dear,

412
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,840
I've gotten a prescription
from Physician Sun.

413
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,000
He said it's used
for skin care and beauty at the palace.

414
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,360
Do you want to try it?

415
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,480
What's the use of using it
on my plain face?

416
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,000
Only you would notice
such things for me.

417
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,160
Do you regret marrying

418
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,840
an ugly woman like me?

419
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,800
If I had married for someone's looks,

420
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
I would've beautified myself

421
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,360
and married me.

422
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,000
I haven't met any woman

423
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,960
in this world

424
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,040
who's prettier than me.

425
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,520
Come on.

426
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,880
Unfortunately,

427
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,280
Huangfu Yi didn't think so.

428
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,800
He wasn't willing to marry me back then.

429
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,840
Dear,

430
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,360
can you please stop mentioning

431
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,280
that treacherous

432
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,320
and blind person?

433
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,720
That person

434
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,680
fled to faraway land
when his family was in difficulties.

435
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,320
You already did
the most humane way possible

436
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,880
when you didn't suggest breaking off
the engagement.

437
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,080
That fiancée's parents also tried
to persuade her

438
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,280
to break off the engagement
to avoid trouble.

439
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,320
But she

440
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
stood her ground

441
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
and refused to act in bad faith.

442
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,600
But that wasn't all.

443
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,840
The young lady

444
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
even took on the heavy responsibility

445
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,360
of taking care
of the young man's family by herself.

446
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So much so that

447
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,720
she had to face mistreatment
from her future mother-in-law.

448
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,040
Everything she did was

449
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,640
to wait for the young man
to return and marry her.

450
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,800
And she waited

451
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,760
for seven years.

452
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
With all due respect,

453
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,840
that young man

454
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,840
shouldn't have let his fiancée wait.

455
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,480
Lady Cheng has a point.

456
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,120
If heaven isn't fair,

457
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,000
people should follow their fate.

458
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,000
If heaven is fair,

459
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,720
it won't separate two lovers.

460
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,760
Lady Cheng is always mean to others.

461
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,080
May I know

462
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,360
if Mr. Lou was the young man
in this story,

463
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,880
would you wait for him?

464
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,320
Mr. Yuan, that's a mean question.

465
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,160
Fine.

466
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,680
Since you said I'm a mean person,

467
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
I shall ask you a mean question too.

468
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,960
If you encountered such a problem,

469
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,400
would you wait or not?

470
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,320
I asked you first.

471
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Please answer first.

472
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,160
I'm only asking you the same question.

473
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,600
Please answer then.

474
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,400
Shaoshang,

475
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,760
I won't let you wait.

476
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,920
I didn't say anything wrong.

477
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,520
Shaoshang,

478
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll never let you wait for me.

479
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,480
Lady Cheng,

480
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,000
you sure have found a good husband.

481
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,560
The young man was fatherless,

482
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,120
and he had a very skilled bodyguard.

483
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,800
Because he was indebted
to the young man's late father,

484
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,160
he offered

485
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
to escort the young man
to his exile in the south.

486
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,800
He died protecting

487
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,480
the young man

488
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,320
while they were on the way.

489
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,680
Before the bodyguard passed away,

490
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,600
he entrusted his orphaned daughter
to the young man.

491
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Who would have thought

492
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,640
it was this obligation

493
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,320
that ended his relationship
with his fiancée.

494
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,440
The fact that the obligation ended

495
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,000
the doomed relationship

496
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,120
may not be a bad thing.

497
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,640
He was supposed to return home

498
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,240
to celebrate my father's birthday

499
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,040
and marry me

500
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,920
after seven years of exile.

501
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Of all days, that orphaned girl chose
to kill herself with poison

502
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,040
on the day he was supposed to return.

503
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,320
If he didn't insist on
taking care of her

504
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,320
and delayed his return home,

505
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,840
I wouldn't be humiliated again

506
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,200
at my father's birthday banquet.

507
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,760
(His fiancée waited bitterly
all day and all night)

508
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,480
(on her father's birthday banquet.)

509
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,480
(Who would have known)

510
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,960
(that the young man didn't return
as scheduled?)

511
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,160
(The young man knew)

512
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,960
(his fiancée was overwhelmed with grief.)

513
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,840
He wanted to meet and explain to her.

514
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,200
He finally met her

515
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,720
after pleading for days.

516
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,640
Who knew

517
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,680
the first thing his fiancée said

518
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,920
was to break the engagement.

519
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,600
He knew she was upset.

520
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,200
So he wanted to wait several days

521
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,880
for her to calm down.

522
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,560
But who knew

523
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,240
all he waited for was news

524
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,360
of her marrying someone else.

525
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,440
(Since you could delay your return
for someone else,)

526
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,360
(why can't I marry someone else?)

527
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,120
(I must take swift action
to end this entanglement.)

528
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,520
(From now on,)

529
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,440
(I've cut off my past with you.)

530
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
The young man

531
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,520
still couldn't understand
after much thought.

532
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,600
His fiancée had waited for him bitterly
for seven years.

533
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,080
Why would she take offense

534
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,600
over one trivial matter like this

535
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,960
when it was already time to get married?

536
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,960
May I know

537
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
if the fiancée knew

538
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,840
that this young man

539
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,880
had always been bothered

540
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,640
by her appearance?

541
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,120
That was what he thought
when he was young.

542
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,440
He was moved by the deep affection
of his fiancée after.

543
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,320
Thus, he never had
such frivolous thoughts anymore.

544
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,440
What she wanted wasn't
for the young man to feel moved.

545
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,640
She only wished

546
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,080
that she had a place in his heart.

547
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,960
But

548
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
she didn't expect to meet

549
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,520
a conceited and fickle scum.

550
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,520
Master,

551
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,840
I have a question.

552
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
If you were that young man,

553
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
who should you save if your fiancée
and the orphaned girl

554
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,480
fall into the river at the same time?

555
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,560
Lady Cheng, how about putting
your question this way?

556
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,000
If the fiancée can swim a little

557
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,240
and she could float on the water
for a moment.

558
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,000
But the orphaned girl doesn't know
how to swim.

559
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,800
If Master is that young man,

560
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,840
who would you save first?

561
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,000
That's right.

562
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,520
General Ling,

563
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,440
if it were you,

564
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,680
who would you save first?

565
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,560
You're mean.

566
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Who's the meanest here?

567
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,160
It's you.

568
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
If I were that young man,

569
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,240
I would naturally save my fiancée first.

570
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,760
If I save the orphaned girl first,

571
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,160
my fiancée may get caught
by grass in the water.

572
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,960
She may be washed away by the current.

573
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,600
If that young man cared
for his fiancée

574
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,840
he wouldn't let anything happen

575
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,800
to his loved one.

576
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,880
Are we supposed

577
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,560
to watch

578
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,000
that orphaned girl die?

579
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,520
If it were me...

580
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,080
If I were that young man,

581
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,880
I would save Shaoshang first.

582
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,440
Yao, you're the best.

583
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,280
I knew

584
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,680
you wouldn't abandon me.

585
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,000
The fiancée didn't fall into the river.

586
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,320
So this assumption is invalid.

587
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,920
That orphaned girl didn't fall
into the river either.

588
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,360
She only took poison herself.

589
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,560
When a person dies,
that's the end of it.

590
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,640
He only needs to adopt a son
for the bodyguard

591
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
and to help him to be promoted
and rich in the future.

592
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
So he could carry on

593
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,680
the bodyguard's family line.

594
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,000
It's rather unfair to the bodyguard
who died tragically.

595
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,360
There's nothing we can do about that.

596
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
In life,

597
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,000
we can't satisfy everyone.

598
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,840
You have a point.

599
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,200
My father is also a military general.

600
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,520
In battles,

601
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
countless soldiers

602
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
were wounded and killed to protect him.

603
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,960
But none of their sisters
or daughters wanted

604
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,280
to marry my father.

605
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,720
So in conclusion,

606
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,000
everything would be all right

607
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
if only that young man sent

608
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,280
that orphaned girl away sooner.

609
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,680
That orphaned girl is only
a worthless scoundrel.

610
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Not even worth mentioning.

611
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,520
General Ling made a good point just now.

612
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,040
If heaven is fair,

613
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,480
it won't separate two lovers.

614
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,480
The fiancée doesn't believe

615
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,920
that the young man is
being indifferent

616
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
to her intentionally.

617
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,240
She also doesn't believe

618
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,800
the young man has
no feelings for the orphaned girl.

619
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,120
Since these two don't trust each other,

620
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,240
how can they be husband and wife?

621
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,800
After the fiancée understood
this reason,

622
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,400
she backed out of the engagement.

623
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,120
She spent seven years proving

624
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,480
her affection for the young man.

625
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,160
The reason she backed out
of this marriage was

626
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,960
to tell the young man

627
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,920
that she may look ordinary,

628
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
but her affection

629
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,720
shouldn't be insulted.

630
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,680
It's cold at night.

631
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,720
Don't catch a cold again.

632
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,760
You should put it on.

633
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,680
You should put it on, General Ling.

634
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,280
I'm well so I don't need it.

635
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,480
I think

636
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,000
that fiancée is someone of great wisdom.

637
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,880
She knew when to let go.

638
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,600
Once she sets her mind to it,

639
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,360
she doesn't hesitate to leave.

640
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,120
She has found the right man.

641
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,160
She's happy and safe
for the rest of her life.

642
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,880
Am I right?

643
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,720
Now,

644
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,600
she's happier than ever.

645
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,640
In human lives,

646
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,320
it's a blessing to be able

647
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,600
to choose the right person and path.

648
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,400
Are you sure

649
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,120
the one you chose is

650
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,720
the right one?

651
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,680
Shaoshang.

652
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,640
Shaoshang, I brought your cloak.

653
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,440
Be careful not to catch a cold.
