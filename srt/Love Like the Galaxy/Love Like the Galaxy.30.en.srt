= Love Like The Galaxy=

2
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,540
=Episode 30=

3
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,731
Ouch.

4
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,251
So, you know it hurts?

5
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:04,731
If so,

6
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,130
why did you stand
in front of Her Majesty?

7
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:11,691
If I didn't,

8
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,891
Her Majesty would've gotten hurt.

9
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:17,691
That Madam Wen Xiu is so arrogant.

10
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:19,211
How could Her Majesty
tolerate her actions?

11
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,851
Don't worry.

12
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,891
Even if you weren't
defending Her Majesty,

13
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,650
the candlestick wouldn't hit her anyway.

14
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:28,970
Although Madam Wen Xiu is dumb,

15
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,211
this is Changqiu Palace after all.

16
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:33,771
Naturally, she will act under restraint.

17
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,570
She would exert less force naturally

18
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,090
and pushed it in another direction

19
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,891
if you weren't standing there.

20
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,411
Are you mocking me right now?

21
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,211
Suit yourself then.

22
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,650
You can mock me all you want.

23
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:56,371
I just came to the palace not long ago.

24
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,731
How should I know about
the devious intentions

25
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,970
of nobles like you all?

26
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,251
Shaoshang,

27
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:04,691
in the future,

28
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,530
you shouldn't interfere

29
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,411
with things you shouldn't interfere.

30
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,050
What do you mean by that?

31
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:17,010
Madam Wen Xiu is
the daughter of Lord Qian'an

32
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,291
while Her Majesty is the empress.

33
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,130
What makes you think

34
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:23,170
that you need to protect the empress

35
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,691
when they argued?

36
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:27,211
If so, what makes you think

37
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:29,411
that the empress doesn't
need my protection?

38
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,090
That's right.

39
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,731
To you all, Her Majesty has
the highest rank of all women.

40
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,490
However, where were you and His Majesty

41
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,811
when Madam Wen Xiu was humiliating her?

42
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,811
What makes you think

43
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:43,851
that strong people
don't need any protection?

44
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,170
What about you then?

45
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,931
Shaoshang,

46
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,851
I know you're strong.

47
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,891
But what makes you think that
you don't need my protection?

48
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:58,170
We've arrived at
Marquis Quling's Residence.

49
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:04,490
Let's get off.

50
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,891
Cheng Shaoshang.

51
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,090
When I was 15,

52
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,771
I once saw the clouds on Mount Kunlun

53
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,811
floating between the sky
and the mountain peak.

54
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:49,891
It was so pure

55
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:52,170
that it penetrated
the depth of my heart,

56
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,811
just like how you looked at me

57
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,931
when we were at Hua County.

58
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,211
I love how unrestrained you looked

59
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,090
when you spoke to me.

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,050
It always makes me happy.

61
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,530
I also love that
you don't fear the powerful

62
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,970
and the difficulties you face.

63
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,331
Remember this,

64
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:19,931
you were the one who started this first.

65
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,771
- I don't give out my heart easily.
- I'm not...

66
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,891
However, once I do,

67
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:29,970
I will never turn back.

68
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:32,530
However, if you cannot

69
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,811
do the same as me,

70
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,170
I would rather take back my heart.

71
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,731
Uncle, it's all thanks
to your brilliant plan.

72
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,891
That Madam Wen Xiu

73
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,731
was indeed a fool who only knew
how to fight for her brother's benefit.

74
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,970
She fell for the mintage trick easily

75
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,170
after we left the bait outside.

76
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,450
I've already bribed her agent.

77
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,530
We can buy the fake coins

78
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,731
for a low price.

79
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,811
By then,

80
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,211
you can spend them in the fief.

81
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,570
That way,

82
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,891
you can be comfortably off.

83
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:39,691
However, we can be convicted of treason
by minting coins without permission.

84
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:40,970
Uncle, are you not afraid?

85
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:45,331
If they do pursue this matter,

86
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,731
the minerals are provided by Shouchun.

87
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:50,010
Junior Lord Qian'an is the one
who minted the coins.

88
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,251
Madam Wen Xiu is the one
who refused to comply with them.

89
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,371
At most, we'll be punished

90
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,931
for misusing counterfeit money.

91
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,731
Uncle, you're thoughtful indeed.

92
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,291
Here.

93
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,251
However,

94
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,610
you need to stay alert.

95
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,450
You know the character of your mother

96
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,691
and your third brother, right?

97
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,331
Especially your mother.

98
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,570
She doesn't like it when outsiders

99
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,891
bend the rules.

100
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,010
Coincidentally, you're someone

101
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,130
who likes to show off.

102
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:29,570
Listen,

103
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,130
regarding this matter,

104
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,331
if His Majesty punishes us

105
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:35,331
because we gave ourselves away,

106
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,731
it will spell huge trouble
for the Yue Family.

107
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,970
Uncle, don't worry.

108
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,291
If the person in Changqiu Palace

109
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,291
wasn't so stingy,

110
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:47,931
there's no need for me to risk my life

111
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,530
in order to make some money.

112
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,891
It's better for you to stay cautious.

113
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,010
Someone, serve us some liquor.

114
00:07:58,851 --> 00:07:59,931
Dear guests,

115
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,450
this is the new liquor we invented.

116
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,130
It's called Blooming Flowers.

117
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:06,691
You two must give it a try.

118
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,731
Mr. Tian, come in.

119
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,411
Blooming Flowers?

120
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,370
That's a great name.

121
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,651
Here, let me try.

122
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,891
In the future,

123
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,891
the Yue Family will strike it rich.

124
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,410
So what?

125
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,010
Even so, that Ling Buyi

126
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,090
is still too blind to fall for
a perfect woman like me.

127
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,891
Of all the girls he could choose,

128
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,531
he chose a rude brat.

129
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,130
Second Sister always persuaded me
to avoid trouble.

130
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,090
However, I feel angry

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,931
whenever I see her.

132
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,451
She better hope that she won't
encounter me alone.

133
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,851
If not,

134
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,891
I'll make her understand

135
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,571
how difficult it is to survive
in the Imperial Family.

136
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,980
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

137
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:06,210
Young Lady, why do you look

138
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,050
so listless?

139
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,330
Young Lady, could it be that
you couldn't sleep or eat well

140
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:14,970
because you missed General Ling?

141
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,491
Nonsense! Why should I miss him?

142
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,491
If so, why are you waiting by the gate?

143
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:21,250
Besides,

144
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,851
General Ling said he wasn't
picking you up today.

145
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:24,090
Why haven't you gotten on
the carriage yet?

146
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,010
I...

147
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:29,970
I was just waiting for Mother.

148
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,611
She would always come and nag me

149
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,811
before I went into the palace.

150
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,130
But now, she's ignoring me as well.

151
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,851
That was in the past.

152
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,611
Madam said she could feel at ease
since Her Majesty

153
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:44,010
was your personal mentor.

154
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,531
It feels great

155
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,771
to be free.

156
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:02,491
It feels great, huh?

157
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:15,531
Your Highness,

158
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:16,970
isn't that Lady Cheng?

159
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,370
Even the heavens are taking pity on me.

160
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,330
I finally encountered her alone.

161
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:34,731
Stop right there!

162
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,931
Such audacity!

163
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,090
How dare you not greet Third Princess

164
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,050
when you're in the palace?

165
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,970
Your Highness.

166
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:50,811
Did I order you to get up?

167
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:52,050
You got up without my permission.

168
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,410
All this time,

169
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,731
you've been learning the palace rules
from my mother.

170
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,050
Hasn't my mother taught you

171
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,290
that you mustn't get up

172
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,771
if no one

173
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:04,250
ordered you to get up?

174
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:05,491
You better kneel!

175
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,811
In the palace,

176
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,330
showing contempt to
the princes and princesses

177
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:24,370
is a violation of rites.

178
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:25,811
How should we punish her?

179
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,290
She deserves the death penalty.

180
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:29,170
Give her the rod punishment.

181
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,090
Your Highness,

182
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:34,451
you and I have no grudges
against each other.

183
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:37,290
Why must you aggressive on me?

184
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,611
Although there are no grudges
between us,

185
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,771
I hate people
who don't know their places

186
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,851
the most.

187
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:50,010
Who would've expected

188
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,970
Zisheng

189
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,931
to pick a wretch like you?

190
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:55,970
Since you've managed to enter the palace

191
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,691
and enjoy the fortune
that doesn't belong to you,

192
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:01,090
you should bear
the consequences of being greedy.

193
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:03,731
Someone!

194
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,931
Take her away and slap her!

195
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:08,410
Slap her until Ling Buyi
feels sorry for her!

196
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:09,451
Wait!

197
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,010
Your Highness, since you knew

198
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,891
that my future husband was Ling Buyi,

199
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,691
my father was Marquis Quling,

200
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,491
and I was attending training in Changqiu
Palace under Her Majesty's order,

201
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:20,290
not only were you aggressive on me,

202
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,170
but you were also trying to
execute illegal punishment.

203
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,491
Do you have no respect for
His and Her Majesty at all?

204
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:26,250
You have a sharp-tongued indeed.

205
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,451
It's a shame

206
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:30,370
that no one from the Changqiu Palace
is here.

207
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,491
No one can protect you today.

208
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,330
Lower your body.

209
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,250
Flatten your hand.

210
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,050
This is the position you should take
when you speak to Third Princess.

211
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:48,691
What are you staring at?

212
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,970
Someone, slap her.

213
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:00,811
What are you staring at?

214
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,130
Continue!

215
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,811
Stop!

216
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:13,250
Consort Chu, are you trying to stop me

217
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,290
from teaching this unruly servant?

218
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,290
We've agreed that Mother is the one

219
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,410
who will teach Lady Cheng
about the palace rules.

220
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,811
Third Princess, you're punishing her
for not obeying the rules.

221
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,531
Are you trying to humiliate Mother
by saying

222
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:26,210
that she didn't teach her well?

223
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,571
Consort Chu, that's not it.

224
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,330
Mother just asked me

225
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:32,050
where Lady Cheng was

226
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,571
when it's time for her
to serve her during lunchtime.

227
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,851
I couldn't just tell Mother

228
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,410
that it was because
you were punishing her

229
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,451
after she broke the rules

230
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,090
due to Mother's negligence,

231
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,691
right?

232
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:44,811
Consort Chu, calm down.

233
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:46,970
I was just joking with

234
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,811
Lady Cheng.

235
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,491
Since Mother needs
Lady Cheng to serve her,

236
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,210
she should go.

237
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:57,370
We can talk about it

238
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,731
during lunchtime.

239
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,931
It's lucky that your tendons
and bones weren't damaged.

240
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,491
Don't worry.

241
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,250
Mother and Zisheng will surely
uphold justice for you

242
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,731
if you tell them about it.

243
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,970
Her Majesty has
too many things to attend to.

244
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:35,931
I don't wish to trouble her.

245
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,691
I don't want to depend on Ling Buyi
for everything too.

246
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:44,090
At the end of the day, I still have to
depend on myself to survive in here.

247
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,531
You're too eager to prove yourself.

248
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,851
Third Princess only dares
to act arrogant

249
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,170
as she's the daughter of His Majesty's
favorite consort, Consort Yue.

250
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:56,451
And, she has a capable brother
like Third Prince too.

251
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,651
That's why she never showed any respect
for Changqiu Palace at all.

252
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:01,970
Moreover,

253
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,931
Third Princess was brought up
alongside Marquis Yue.

254
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,090
That's why she's so arrogant.

255
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,330
Does Third Princess fancy
General Ling as well?

256
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,290
When she was young,

257
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,370
she disliked the skinny Zisheng.

258
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,330
But she fell for him

259
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:20,891
after he grew stronger

260
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:22,851
and made a name for himself.

261
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,050
At the end of the day,

262
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:26,370
she might not be
in love with him at all.

263
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:30,170
She's just in love with
his looks and power.

264
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:37,691
My hands

265
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,330
weren't supposed to follow me
into the palace initially.

266
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:42,891
But they're unwilling to leave
due to their lust for power.

267
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:44,330
They've already been hurt

268
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,090
twice.

269
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,050
It's no wonder Zisheng fell for you.

270
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,531
You're much more interesting
than the others here.

271
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,250
I cannot shoulder General Ling's love.

272
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:57,771
I only came into the palace
and got myself

273
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:00,050
into trouble because of him.

274
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,731
Zisheng also wasn't respected

275
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,491
when he first entered the palace.

276
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,250
He was in more trouble

277
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,771
than you.

278
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,970
I remember that he almost died

279
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,931
after someone pushed him into the river.

280
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,611
Luckily, the crown prince rescued him.

281
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,250
Did you know

282
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,370
what Zisheng love to do back then?

283
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:23,090
He loved to have meals

284
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,531
together with his servants
and maidservants.

285
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,410
Since young, Zisheng

286
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:28,731
never had a meal

287
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,250
together with his family.

288
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,651
When he was young,

289
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:34,651
he would attend
the Lantern Festival every year.

290
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,891
He would stand under

291
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,691
the dimly lit lanterns

292
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,170
and observe the full moon

293
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,010
and the reunion of other people.

294
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:04,691
I've also heard about what Madam Wen Xiu

295
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:06,050
had done on that day.

296
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,651
General Wang Chun

297
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,571
requested me to apologize to you two
on his behalf.

298
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,090
Zisheng,

299
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:12,771
both you and General Wang Chun

300
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:14,531
are my trusted aides.

301
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,531
You two must not resent each other
because of women.

302
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:24,851
Your Highness, I'm not trying to pick on

303
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:26,210
the Cavalry General
because of personal grudges.

304
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,370
It's just that he's incompetent

305
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:31,210
and he does not deserve his position.

306
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,010
Your Highness, as the crown prince,

307
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,370
naturally, the state affairs
are your priorities.

308
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,410
You shouldn't practice cronyism.

309
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,931
And, Sun Sheng, Consort Chu's cousin,

310
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,651
not only was he lousy in martial arts,

311
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,250
but he also indulged himself
in worldly pleasures all day long.

312
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,571
He's an alcoholic as well.

313
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:46,611
How could

314
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:47,970
we let someone like him

315
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,731
be the leader of
the Eastern Palace's bodyguards?

316
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,531
Your Highness, it's best

317
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,250
for you to consider another candidate
as soon as possible.

318
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,491
But...

319
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,090
After all, they're members
of my wife's clan.

320
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,931
It's just an armchair job for him.

321
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,731
Today is General Huo's
death anniversary.

322
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,611
Changqiu Palace will hold a banquet
in the afternoon.

323
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,410
It's been a long time

324
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:09,250
since you and I had a meal together.

325
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,290
Why don't we...

326
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,170
No need for that.

327
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,090
I still have things to attend to.

328
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,250
Please pardon me.

329
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:21,130
However, Consort Chu

330
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,851
is having a chat with your wife
in the Eastern Palace.

331
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,410
Aren't you waiting for her?

332
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,691
Today is General Huo's
death anniversary.

333
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,651
We can return to
Changqiu Palace together.

334
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,410
We can still chat before the banquet.

335
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:42,491
Prepare the carriage.

336
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:43,571
Yes.

337
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:50,651
I need to assist Jitong.

338
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,891
I shall excuse myself...

339
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,771
Don't worry.

340
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,090
I know you're afraid to see
Third Princess again.

341
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:56,931
Zisheng will be there as well.

342
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,010
He'll surely protect you.

343
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,250
People here are unpredictable.

344
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:04,410
It's been a tough journey for him.

345
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,970
I'm sure he won't let you
suffer as he did.

346
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:08,330
Your Highness,

347
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,731
His Highness's wet nurse ordered me

348
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,651
to ask you if you had prepared the gifts
for the ministers

349
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,250
who will assume their positions
in the capital soon?

350
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,531
I prepared them long ago.

351
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,691
Just tell His Highness's wet nurse
to do the usual

352
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:28,050
and send the gifts to them.

353
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,811
Yes.

354
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,970
Stop.

355
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:36,250
Madam Liang and I are old friends.

356
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:37,931
You should give her this pearl hairpin

357
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,170
as my token of appreciation.

358
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,130
But Your Highness, this pearl hairpin
is a tribute offered by foreign envoys.

359
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:45,050
Since it belongs to His Highness,

360
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,691
it's most appropriate to give it

361
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,970
to subjects who have
contributed much to the nation.

362
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:50,491
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,330
It seems like

364
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:58,130
being the bride of the Imperial Family

365
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,731
is pretty difficult too.

366
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:02,771
Actually, I know

367
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,491
the palace is a hotbed of rumors

368
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,210
and that it's best for me
not to get involved.

369
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,010
However,

370
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,891
I have no choice
but to get involved now.

371
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,731
If I'm going to be his bride,

372
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,090
I have to understand his background.

373
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,370
This is the place where he grew up in.

374
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:16,571
I wish

375
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,851
to take the path he had taken before.

376
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,970
You're pretty bold, aren't you?

377
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:27,491
Your Highness.

378
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,090
Your Highness, you came here
together with Zisheng?

379
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,451
What a coincidence.

380
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:31,611
We can attend

381
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,250
the family banquet together.

382
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:34,731
Your Highness,

383
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,611
I just remembered

384
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,170
that I have something to tell Shaoshang.

385
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:40,571
Please allow me to make a move first.

386
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,250
Why did you get hurt again?

387
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,970
I thought you were going to
take back your heart?

388
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,651
Why are you looking for me now?

389
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,651
You appeared in the Eastern Palace,

390
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,050
and I bumped into you.

391
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,210
I wasn't looking for you.

392
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:22,451
Fine.

393
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:24,731
If so, General Ling,
I won't appear in front of you again.

394
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,531
Who hurt you?

395
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:39,691
It's just a minor injury.

396
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:41,410
It's nothing.

397
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:45,050
Since you're not willing to tell me,

398
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,491
I'll do my own investigation.

399
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:50,370
Shaoshang,

400
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,010
there's one more thing

401
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,370
you should remember.

402
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,771
You shouldn't visit
the Eastern Palace often.

403
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:57,771
You should stay away
from Consort Chu as well.

404
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:58,611
But why?

405
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:00,931
Consort Chu doesn't put on airs.

406
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,891
The only way to prevent
getting bullied here

407
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,370
is to stay in the Eastern Palace.

408
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,330
You have only entered the palace
for a few days.

409
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,611
How could you tell

410
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:12,891
who's not putting on airs

411
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,891
and who has influence over the palace?

412
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,970
Although I'm the daughter of a general,

413
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,410
my heart is true and sincere.

414
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,491
Consort Chu was born into a poor family.

415
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,250
Just like me,

416
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:25,531
she was hated by all the princes
and princesses.

417
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:29,651
The palace

418
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,050
isn't as simple as you think.

419
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,090
You cannot tell

420
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,170
one's personality at first glance.

421
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,410
Of course everyone will look kind

422
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,691
when profits aren't involved.

423
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:42,931
However, when it comes to profit,

424
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,250
everyone will act differently.

425
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,651
The Eastern Palace is
a hotbed of rumors.

426
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,691
I don't want you to be involved.

427
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,851
The Crown Princess said Crown Prince

428
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,210
saved you when you almost drowned.

429
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,891
How could you be so selfish?

430
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,851
Did you forget what happened
in Yanhui Tower?

431
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,771
This incident has a deep root,
and it involves many people.

432
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,170
You should stay away if you don't wish

433
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:06,851
to be implicated.

434
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,851
Ling Zisheng,

435
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,170
you always told me

436
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,370
to act like your bride.

437
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,851
If so, how could I stay away from this?

438
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,050
For your sake,

439
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:17,851
I'm trying to get used
to life in the palace.

440
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,531
It's because I know

441
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,090
that I will face the things

442
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,851
you're facing in the future.

443
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,531
That's why,

444
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,771
I will take my time

445
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,330
to understand your past in the palace.

446
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:32,771
I need to know

447
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:34,931
the kind of person my future husband is.

448
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:44,811
Are you saying

449
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,290
that you're doing all of this

450
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:50,571
for my sake?

451
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,010
No.

452
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,851
I'm doing it for my sake.

453
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,050
All right.

454
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,731
You can do whatever you want.

455
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:19,691
I will protect you.

456
00:25:08,891 --> 00:25:10,210
Greetings, Mother.

457
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,370
I've hired the best jeweler

458
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,090
in the capital to make this.

459
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,290
This peony hairpin is
a gift from the heavens.

460
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,691
Mother, it fits your
angelic look perfectly.

461
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:35,611
I regret

462
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,130
entrusting you to your third aunt's care

463
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,970
in order to follow His Majesty.

464
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,571
That's why you're behaving
like a moneybag right now.

465
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,731
That's how you end up liking these
uncultured accessories.

466
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,010
If only

467
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,451
you were half as sensible as

468
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:53,290
your second sister and third brother.

469
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,491
Didn't you just complain

470
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:58,410
about the empress
for cutting your pocket money

471
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,691
in order to reduce the palace expenses?

472
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:02,691
Where did you get all this money from?

473
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,170
Could it be that Prince Consort Xuan
was accepting bribes?

474
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,651
Mother, please don't tease me.

475
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,451
I was just doing business with my peers

476
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:14,731
and making some pocket money.

477
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:16,410
Even Prince Consort Xuan has no idea.

478
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:18,491
You don't even know how to count.

479
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,891
How could you do business?

480
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,491
I've bought some shares

481
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,370
of the restaurants in the capital.

482
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,210
They will share their dividends with me
if they do well.

483
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,891
Mother,

484
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,170
I'm already married.

485
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:32,410
It's not unreasonable for me

486
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,531
to own some properties
outside the palace, right?

487
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,651
I don't care if you're speaking
the truth or not.

488
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,891
But, let me give you a reminder.

489
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,651
Do not disgrace the Yue Family

490
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,731
because of worldly possessions
such as these.

491
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:45,691
And,

492
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,330
do not come to the palace

493
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,290
in these kinds of apparel.

494
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,210
You're a phoenix.

495
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,571
Don't dress yourself up
like a wild chicken.

496
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,090
If you have too much money
on your hands,

497
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,250
you should buy a big mirror
so that you can see yourself.

498
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,571
Don't dress up like a country bumpkin

499
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:02,970
and turn yourself into a laughing stock.

500
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,130
Mother,

501
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:05,771
you're criticizing me again.

502
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:09,891
Third Aunt has invited me
over for dinner today.

503
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,811
She said she would introduce
some old acquaintances to me.

504
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:14,731
I can't just dress myself poorly

505
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,210
and embarrass
the imperial family, right?

506
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:18,370
Look at you.

507
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:21,210
As a princess,

508
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,330
there's no need to put on airs
in front of merchants.

509
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,410
The prestige of the imperial family

510
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:29,130
is the best thing you can have.

511
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,010
Mother, please stop reprimanding me.

512
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,731
Now, the palace is cutting its expenses.

513
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:36,090
I'm leading a poorer life compared
with the wives of the merchants.

514
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:38,491
I'm only mingling with those ladies

515
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:40,531
all because the one in Changqiu Palace

516
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:42,090
convinced Father to be a stingy man.

517
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,731
I suggest you mind your words.

518
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,250
His and Her Majesty did so

519
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:49,571
in order to serve as
an example for their people.

520
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,370
Do you think
an uncultured person like you

521
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,651
has the right to laugh at them?

522
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:56,531
Enough.

523
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:59,330
Today is General Huo's
death anniversary.

524
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:02,611
They will hold a banquet
in Changqiu Palace this afternoon.

525
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,130
Your father will be attending
the ceremony personally.

526
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:08,651
You should pay your respect
in Fengxian Hall too.

527
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:10,250
Yes, Mother.

528
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,410
Stop right there.

529
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,931
Are you heading there just like this?

530
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,250
It's my fault for giving
your second sister

531
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,050
too much intelligence
when I gave birth to her.

532
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,851
That's why you ended up
being such an idiot.

533
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,170
You're trying to attend
the memorial ceremony in this getup?

534
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,210
Are you trying

535
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,651
to drag the entire Yue Family

536
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:36,931
to the grave with you?

537
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,931
Someone!

538
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:45,491
Get a plain dress for Third Princess.

539
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,811
Yes, Your Highness.

540
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,170
Lady Cheng, it's been some days
since we met.

541
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:03,330
Seems like you're doing well.

542
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,771
Your Highness, thank you
for the compliment.

543
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,170
It's been some days since we met.

544
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:11,691
Have you improved in your studies?

545
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:15,611
Father doesn't remember me anyway.

546
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:17,370
It doesn't matter
if I study hard or not.

547
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:21,771
You were already useless.

548
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,491
But now, you can't even study well.

549
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,531
You're just like me.

550
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:27,571
In the future,

551
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,290
His Majesty will have nothing to say

552
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,691
when he mentions you.

553
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:34,491
So what?

554
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:45,410
Zisheng,

555
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,330
actually, His Majesty is a great ruler.

556
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:52,451
However, it would be better

557
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,851
if he didn't consummate with Lady Cheng

558
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,370
and give birth to Fifth Prince

559
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:56,771
when he was drunk.

560
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,611
Even His Majesty isn't
a perfect individual.

561
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,050
He had tried his best
to compensate for his mistake.

562
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:06,651
Even since that happened,

563
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,330
His Majesty only brought the empress,
one consort,

564
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,571
and Attendant Cao together with him.

565
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:16,290
Shaoshang, since you're Zisheng's bride,

566
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:18,851
from now on,
you'll be a part of our family.

567
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,771
You should join us
in offering the toasts.

568
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,451
No need for that.

569
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,330
I'm in no mood to drink

570
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:30,090
whenever it comes to this occasion.

571
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,811
You guys can enjoy your meals.

572
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:34,410
Let me

573
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:36,851
be alone for a while.

574
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,451
Shaoshang,

575
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,290
you and I are close even though
we've just met.

576
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,090
In the future, you must visit us

577
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,491
together with Zisheng.

578
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:50,851
That's right.

579
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,340
We'll be a family from now on.

580
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:52,851
(Consort of Fifth Prince)
We'll be a family from now on.

581
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,370
You must visit us more often.

582
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:58,050
Third Brother, what are you laughing at?

583
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,330
I was just reminded of the past.

584
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:06,330
No one welcomed Zisheng

585
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:07,811
when he first entered the palace.

586
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,451
But now,

587
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,771
everyone is trying to lick his boots.

588
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:16,611
Zisheng was brought up by Mother.

589
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,050
Naturally, those who did not welcome him

590
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,931
would not be

591
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:21,691
those who were brought up by Mother.

592
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,811
They must be the consort's...

593
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:25,491
Wu, you're speaking nonsense again.

594
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,250
All of us grew up together.

595
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:30,130
Zisheng is just like one of us.

596
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,571
There's no difference between
Mother's side and the consort's side.

597
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,811
We're already lucky enough

598
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,330
to be the children of Father

599
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:37,970
who were born in this peaceful era.

600
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,571
We should make no distinction
between our siblings.

601
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:43,370
Peaceful era?

602
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,771
I do not dare to flatter myself
with that term.

603
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:48,811
However, this world

604
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,651
did obtain peace

605
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,370
after I became its ruler.

606
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:54,611
Regarding that,

607
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,010
Huo

608
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,571
was one of the major contributors.

609
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,891
It's all because General Huo
risked his life to fight for our nation.

610
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,731
Father also sacrificed a lot

611
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:07,571
for the sake of our peace.

612
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:11,130
Second Sister, although you and I
have the same mother,

613
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:12,491
I'm not

614
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,170
as eloquent as you.

615
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,731
It's no wonder Father favors you.

616
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,811
Your Majesty,

617
00:33:23,891 --> 00:33:25,811
Lady Ruyang has arrived.

618
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:31,451
Summon her.

619
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,891
Yes, Your Majesty.

620
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,010
Summon Lady Ruyang!

621
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,050
Aunt.

622
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,651
Someone, bring her to her seat...

623
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,451
Today is General Huo's
death anniversary.

624
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:11,330
Your Majesty, I knew you were
holding a family banquet.

625
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:13,130
That's why I came without permission.

626
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,491
This must be Zisheng's bride.

627
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,771
I must ask you

628
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:27,851
how you forced Yuchang

629
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,731
to become a nun in Sancai Tower.

630
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,611
Our marriage

631
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,851
was arranged by His Majesty himself.

632
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,250
And, both sides of the families
had agreed to it.

633
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:41,330
Old Consort,

634
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:43,571
what do you mean by this?

635
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,491
Both sides of the families
had agreed to it?

636
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:50,410
Cheng,

637
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:53,891
why didn't you visit
Marquis Chengyang and his wife?

638
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,691
My father had already
divorced my mother.

639
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:57,651
There was no need for Shaoshang
to visit Madam Chunyu.

640
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:01,451
Madam Chunyu is
her future mother-in-law.

641
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,130
Future mother-in-law?

642
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,851
Are you saying that
my mother had already passed away?

643
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,851
Today is my uncle's death anniversary.

644
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,891
Old Consort, please mind your words.

645
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,931
Did I say

646
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:15,050
anything wrong?

647
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,851
At the end of the day, she's your elder.

648
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:17,691
Cheng,

649
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,050
why didn't you pay her a visit?

650
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,210
Shaoshang hasn't visited my mother yet.

651
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:24,050
Why must she visit Madam Chunyu?

652
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,210
She doesn't deserve it.

653
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,891
You abandoned Yuchang

654
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,531
and defended Cheng.

655
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:31,691
Consort Yue has arrived.

656
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,210
Aunt,

657
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,851
this is my seat.

658
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,970
Please excuse me.

659
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,290
I thought you weren't coming?

660
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:05,330
You don't attend
family banquets usually.

661
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,731
It's because I missed you.

662
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,611
I heard that you were coming.

663
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:11,851
I was thinking

664
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:12,891
that you should have someone

665
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:15,090
you could share your thoughts with.

666
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:16,410
That's why

667
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:18,330
I rushed here.

668
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,170
Someone,

669
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:23,330
grant Lady Ruyang a seat.

670
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:15,611
At the end of the day,
I'm still your elder.

671
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,691
If you insist on
talking about seniority,

672
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,731
Aunt, you're His Majesty's elder.

673
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,170
Why don't you take
His Majesty's seat then?

674
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:33,050
I was late.

675
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:34,970
You didn't stir up any trouble, did you?

676
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,410
If you stir up any trouble again,

677
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,851
I will definitely ask His Majesty

678
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,771
to confiscate your manor and servants.

679
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:43,571
I'll see how you can act arrogantly

680
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,491
without any wealth or power.

681
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:49,851
Mother, Third Sister
already knew her fault.

682
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,771
Shut up.

683
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,090
If you try to defend her again,

684
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,531
I'll pray to Goddess Nuwa

685
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:57,210
so that you will give birth

686
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,851
to an idiot like your third sister.

687
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,050
Mother, you're wise indeed.

688
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:06,090
Father had already punished her
several times

689
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,851
before this.

690
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,771
Mother, please stop blaming her.

691
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,250
Consort Chu, I suggest

692
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,811
you focus on your own duties.

693
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:17,370
You can tell me what to do

694
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,491
when you do become

695
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,250
the empress in the future.

696
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:25,691
But don't worry,

697
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,010
I will surely leave
before that day arrives

698
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,611
so that you won't need to
waste your effort on me.

699
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,410
Why are you crying?

700
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,410
Mother, she was
just overwhelmed by your words.

701
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:41,491
Why are you crying? Keep quiet!

702
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:46,531
Yue Heng,

703
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,731
don't you think
you're being too mean here?

704
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:51,010
You've scared all those children.

705
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:52,691
Children of the imperial family

706
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:55,090
should put on airs when they have to.

707
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,811
You shouldn't discipline them
in such a strict way.

708
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,250
Children of the imperial family

709
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,931
are children of His Majesty.

710
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,090
As parents,

711
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,210
we gave birth to them and raised them.

712
00:39:09,811 --> 00:39:11,811
We don't expect them to be filial.

713
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,731
We just hope that they won't act unruly

714
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,370
and disgrace their parents.

715
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:17,451
Aunt,

716
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:20,691
is that too much to ask for

717
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,090
as their parents?

718
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,010
I guess so.

719
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,771
Your granddaughter

720
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,250
never cared about her parents' dignity.

721
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:31,731
She could cry over and over again
because of a failed marriage.

722
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,491
And now,

723
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:35,250
she has even become a nun in Sancai Tower.

724
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:36,691
You!

725
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:42,531
Are you Zisheng's bride?

726
00:39:44,811 --> 00:39:45,891
Raise your head.

727
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,771
Why do you look nervous?

728
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,491
Did you skip lunch?

729
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:55,250
Mother, you have good taste.
This Lady Cheng is...

730
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,130
Wu,

731
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:58,691
why do you still look
as ghastly as always?

732
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,170
Look at your dark eye circles.

733
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:02,891
Did you spend

734
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,250
the entire night chatting with

735
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,731
your aides again?

736
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,531
Look at your face.

737
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,250
Do you think you can be married
into the Yue Family with that face?

738
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,531
I'm afraid to even the wedding fans
used in the ceremony

739
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:12,931
cannot cover your dark eye circles.

740
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,731
You should spend more time alone

741
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:19,050
and take care of your health,
understood?

742
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,771
She left without bidding farewell.

743
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:34,731
She's an unruly brat indeed.

744
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,050
Forget it.

745
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:37,771
I shall leave her be

746
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,531
for some days before she gets married.

747
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:42,410
This is what I am.

748
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,290
I'm too soft-hearted.

749
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,571
I was always

750
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,250
lenient to my children.

751
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,451
How could you be so mean?

752
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,691
I was just educating my child.

753
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,170
Aunt, why did you say that about me?

754
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,050
Yes.

755
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,970
Aunt, I knew you didn't like me.

756
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,771
You only liked His Majesty.

757
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,571
But not entirely.

758
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,170
Aunt, you didn't like His Majesty

759
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:14,370
when he was young.

760
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,170
After that,

761
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,010
when His Majesty proved his capability

762
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,771
and started to earn fame and fortune,

763
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,010
that's when you started
to dote on His Majesty.

764
00:41:25,531 --> 00:41:28,170
After that, His Majesty became
the ruler of the nation.

765
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,170
By then, Aunt, you were

766
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,931
spoiling His Majesty with your love.

767
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,970
Yue Heng,

768
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:35,970
what do you mean by this?

769
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,330
Are you trying to drive a wedge between
me and His Majesty?

770
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:40,691
Consorts and prince consorts,

771
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,611
I'm not treating you guys
as outsiders here.

772
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:44,571
However, I'm going to
talk about the old tales.

773
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,970
Are you guys sure

774
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,571
you want to listen to them?

775
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,891
Just get straight to the point.

776
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,811
Back then, when First Princess
was pregnant and weak,

777
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:15,611
you weren't willing to lend her
any money to buy meat.

778
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,090
It was winter back then.

779
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,250
His Majesty had no choice
but to go hunting in the mountains.

780
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:25,330
He only hoped that he could obtain
some fur and meat for my sister.

781
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:28,330
When Huo Chong discovered His Majesty,

782
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,170
he had already turned purple
from the cold.

783
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:34,010
After that, Huo Chong was the one
who provided First Princess

784
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,050
with everything during her pregnancy,

785
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,731
and cured His Majesty of his cold.

786
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,451
It's a shame

787
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:43,090
that good people die young.

788
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,090
I didn't lend her any money?

789
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:51,050
Back then, your uncle didn't return home
for several months.

790
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,330
I had no choice
but to save up some money.

791
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:55,330
Besides, I...

792
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:58,010
I didn't know that His Majesty
was going to head into the mountains.

793
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:00,771
Zisheng,

794
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:03,370
your uncle died young.

795
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:05,330
You're the only descendant

796
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:07,931
of the Huo Family now.

797
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:10,050
His Majesty and I

798
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,090
hoped that you could get married
and give birth to offspring

799
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,731
so that your descendants could

800
00:43:15,931 --> 00:43:17,330
burn offerings
to your uncle and his family

801
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:20,811
and not let them
end up as wandering spirits

802
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,731
in the underworld.

803
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,210
If someone

804
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:27,050
doubts your bride,

805
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,330
just ignore their foolish attempt.

806
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,811
Yes, Consort Yue.
