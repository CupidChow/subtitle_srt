00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like The Galaxy=

2
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,680
=Episode 38=

3
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,159
Your Majesty.

4
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,999
Don't take everything

5
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:08,639
that was said today to heart.

6
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,160
Take care of your health.

7
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,959
I wonder what happened
to the Crown Princess today.

8
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,399
She was acting differently.

9
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,119
You can't blame her.

10
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,799
The Crown Princess
had a poor background.

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,559
She can be calm towards you

12
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,799
but if it involves

13
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,880
Fifth Princess who usually
looks down on her,

14
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,679
there's no way
that she can just ignore it.

15
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,760
Besides, during the banquet,

16
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,200
she saw Qu Lingjun

17
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,320
surpass her in terms of grace.

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,720
She would feel worried

19
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,480
and started overthinking.

20
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,839
Who is Qu Lingjun?

21
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:52,880
Actually,

22
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,600
Crown Prince had
someone he liked back then.

23
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,799
Qu Lingjun was better
in terms of background and character

24
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,440
compared to Crown Princess.

25
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,880
Before Qu Lingjun got married,

26
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,239
she always came to the palace

27
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,600
to gather and play
with the Crown Prince.

28
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,799
Both of them had feelings for each other.

29
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,399
All of us could see it.

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,399
But His Majesty made a
marriage arrangement in the rural area.

31
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,119
When he became the emperor,

32
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,639
he had to keep his promise.

33
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,959
So,

34
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:27,600
Crown Prince had to marry Crown Princess
according to the promise.

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,839
How nice would it be

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,880
if Crown Prince
did not honour the promise back then?

37
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,920
Someone also said the same thing back then.

38
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,600
Who?

39
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,000
Zisheng.

40
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,239
He was still young

41
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,519
but he came and said that

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
to His Majesty and me like an adult.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,480
It was not right
for the marriage to happen.

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,760
He said it would
harm Crown Prince in the future.

45
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,239
His Majesty wouldn't listen

46
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:59,519
so he went to advise Crown Prince.

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,639
His Crown Prince was generous

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,799
so he went to the Crown Princess.

49
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,839
But everything remained

50
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:09,760
on the date of the marriage.

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,839
Crown Princess still got married.

52
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,799
She wanted to marry
into the royal family.

53
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,239
It's not wrong.

54
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,319
But Qu Lingjun

55
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,480
already married someone else.

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,280
Crown Princess should be relieved now.

57
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,759
You might be able
to keep an open mind about this

58
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,160
but she can't.

59
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,679
When a woman falls in love,

60
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,439
she will start to be worried.

61
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,280
No one is like you

62
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,040
who has never
given your heart to Zisheng.

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Your Majesty, you wronged me.

64
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,239
When have I
never given my heart to Zisheng?

65
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,640
Let me ask you then.

66
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,720
Do you like Zisheng sincerely?

67
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,199
I do.

68
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,559
I used to

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,920
see him

70
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,600
as the moon in the sky

71
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,119
and the snow
on top of a faraway mountain peak.

72
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,480
But I realised now

73
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,879
that he is the same as me.

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,840
A person made out of flesh and blood

75
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,239
who can experience
happiness and sadness.

76
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,879
I like Zisheng.

77
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,199
Also,

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,359
I like him more than I used to.

79
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,799
His Majesty was worried

80
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,239
that Zisheng
wouldn't get married back then.

81
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,640
However, I was worried

82
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,920
whether someone would understand

83
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,280
who Zisheng really is as a person.

84
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,160
Thankfully, he met you.

85
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,280
Zisheng picked the right person.

86
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,080
Your Majesty!

87
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,960
Your Majesty, it's terrible.

88
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,840
Zisheng offended His Majesty.

89
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,679
His Majesty wants to beat Zisheng
at Xuanming Hall.

90
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,559
Lady Cheng.

91
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,280
You are finally here.

92
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,040
General Ling beat up
the male family members

93
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,480
of all eight ladies
who pushed you down the water.

94
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,879
Because of that?

95
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:28,087
All eight families?

96
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,280
He beat up every one of them?

97
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,759
He left the palace this morning

98
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,759
and it's not even time for dinner yet.

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,879
He beat up eight families

100
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,359
in such a short time?

101
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,160
He invited some of them here
to beat them

102
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,679
and he went to the residences
of those who were nearby.

103
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,879
Seriously.

104
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,119
His Majesty already
punished Fifth Princess severely

105
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,920
according to General Ling's request.

106
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,239
He didn't forgive

107
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,720
any of Fifth Princess' aides

108
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,439
but General Ling

109
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,160
still wanted to
teach them a lesson personally.

110
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,999
Look.

111
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,879
His Majesty is very angry.

112
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm afraid he won't escape punishment.

113
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,559
His Majesty is not being reasonable.

114
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,239
They were wrong.

115
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,960
Why does he have to punish his own son?

116
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,439
Lady Cheng, how can you say that?

117
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:15,280
General Ling punished them
without His Majesty's authority.

118
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,960
Is that right?

119
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,119
He is not wrong.

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,319
He just treated them

121
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,600
how they treated me.

122
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,239
How is that wrong?

123
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,040
Am I the one who is wrong now?

124
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,840
If she's not satisfied,

125
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,080
ask her to come in

126
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,319
and discuss it with me!

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,879
Wait.

128
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,280
Why isn't the door soundproof?

129
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,439
Come in!

130
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:38,640
Just go.

131
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
The door isn't even closed.

132
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:02,999
Tell me.

133
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,640
Tell me!

134
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
The Imperial Counsellor

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,559
from the Censorate
will be here tomorrow.

136
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,999
What do we do?

137
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:12,799
What do we do?

138
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,040
Your Majesty, please forgive him.

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,759
General Ling was reckless

140
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,319
but it was a reasonable act.

141
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,679
There's no need to ask for forgiveness.

142
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,400
I will get my own revenge

143
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,119
and get punished for my own crimes.

144
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,319
I don't need people to worry for me.

145
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,359
Is this your grudge?

146
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,920
It is obviously mine.

147
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,400
They didn't push you. They pushed me.

148
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,679
Do you have something
to get revenge for?

149
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,280
If you behave like that,

150
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,839
I will also behave the same.

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,679
You know my true colours now.

152
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,839
In the future,

153
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,319
you don't have to care about me.

154
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,599
What do you mean?

155
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,599
We are already engaged.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,520
You caused such big trouble today.

157
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,719
What was your purpose?

158
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
I know.

159
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,479
-I'm sure you don't want to marry me...
-I want to live in...

160
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,799
What did you say?

161
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,240
I want to resign

162
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
and live in seclusion.

163
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,640
Going back to the rural area
that you've always mentioned.

164
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,920
Shut up.

165
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,799
Resign?

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,920
Leave in seclusion?

167
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you want to quit?

168
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,479
Over my dead body!

169
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,520
Father's empire is thriving.

170
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,040
Zisheng.

171
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,599
Mind your words.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,760
I was

173
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:41,920
wrong.

174
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:45,920
Tell me.

175
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,920
I asked you to investigate
whether they've committed a crime.

176
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,719
You beat them up before the
Department of Justice convicts them.

177
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,400
If everyone does things like you,

178
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
why do we still need the law?

179
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,280
You have no restraint.

180
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,719
No respect for the law!

181
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,000
Arrogant!

182
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,280
To put it bluntly, you are mad!

183
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,520
Your Majesty is wise.

184
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,559
General Ling has always been cautious.

185
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,000
Why did he
do such a reckless thing today?

186
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,439
Don't you find it strange, Your Majesty?

187
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,880
Besides,

188
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,640
the Censorate is
an important place in the empire.

189
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,199
No one should trespass it.

190
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,839
Everyone knows that.

191
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,880
Everyone knows that?

192
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,719
Do you know it then?

193
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
If you know,

194
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,679
why don't you tell me where it is?

195
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,640
Can you be quiet?

196
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,400
Your Majesty.

197
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
Although I don't know where it is,

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,719
I know

199
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,799
every ministry

200
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,640
is an important place.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,559
It is something that even I know.

202
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,400
Why did General Ling
make such a mistake?

203
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,439
There's definitely a reason.

204
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,360
Yes.

205
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,799
Tell me then.

206
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,319
Why did he do that?

207
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
Because I...

208
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,719
I had a quarrel with General Ling.

209
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,880
He wanted to vent his anger so...

210
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,599
I knew it.

211
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,479
Zisheng will not

212
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,079
do such a serious mistake

213
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,959
for no reason.

214
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,479
Lady Cheng.

215
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,479
Can't you just learn

216
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,719
some of the Queen's gentleness?

217
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,199
Why do you have to

218
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:19,079
quarrel with Zisheng every day?

219
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
General Ling wanted to quarrel with me.

220
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,240
I didn't start it.

221
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
You didn't start it?

222
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,559
Why did you

223
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,839
always let Zisheng

224
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,679
quarrel with you every day?

225
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,000
You too.

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,521
If you trespass the Censorate

227
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,120
after a quarrel with Lady Cheng,

228
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,920
will you trespass my Chongde Palace

229
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,160
if you have a fight with her?

230
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,520
Tell me.

231
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
How do you want to settle this?

232
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,240
I'll accept
any of Your Majesty's punishment.

233
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
Father.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,240
Trespassing the Censorate

235
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
and beating up an official
in front of every counsellor.

236
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,640
He should be exiled

237
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,360
according to the law.

238
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,280
This is a reasonable punishment.

239
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,439
I'm willing to be exiled
along with General Ling.

240
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:02,360
Shut up.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,319
Exile?

242
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,719
That's too easy for you.

243
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,959
Beat him 100 times

244
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,799
before he is exiled.

245
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,920
100 times...

246
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,040
Your Majesty!

247
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,839
Kneel!

248
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,079
Your Majesty.

249
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,679
He will die if he is beaten 100 times.

250
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
Don't do it, Your Majesty.

251
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,760
Your fiance

252
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
went to the battlefield alone.

253
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,079
He isn't even afraid of
arrows piercing his body.

254
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,360
Do you think he can't take a beating?

255
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,439
Shut up.

256
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,079
Confused man
who doesn't know right from wrong.

257
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,799
You should read more.

258
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,360
It's called a fatuitous man.

259
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
I know.

260
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,959
-I
-Your...

261
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:38,160
accept.

262
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,599
Great!

263
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Go and get your punishment.

264
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,719
Ling Zisheng.

265
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,520
Let me tell you.

266
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,920
Go back to the Censorate after that.

267
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,520
I want you

268
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,000
to restore the place

269
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,319
back to how it was originally!

270
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:53,920
Yes.

271
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,799
Your Majesty.

272
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,000
Zisheng.

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,160
The punishment

274
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,439
-has been prepared outside.
-Kneel down.

275
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,319
Kneel down.

276
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:00,160
Go.

277
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,120
Your Majesty.

278
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,079
Ling Zisheng!

279
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,839
Lady Cheng.

280
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,000
He will be beaten soon.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,880
Well,

282
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
why don't you go out
and watch it together with me?

283
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,360
Your Majesty.

284
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,319
Zisheng is pitiful enough.

285
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,679
His father was bad
and his mother is ill.

286
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,079
He even got a reckless fiancee.

287
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,360
Yet Fifth Prince is still
gloating over this.

288
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
I'm not.

289
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,240
You are right.

290
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,079
My son has worked hard.

291
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,959
It's all thanks to you.

292
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
Without your help,

293
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,199
it wouldn't be easy for Zisheng

294
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,839
to gather all eight families.

295
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,007
Father. It's nothing worth mentioning.

296
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,199
I'm sure you've enjoyed watching

297
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,400
Zisheng beat up all of them.

298
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,719
I did.

299
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,559
Sure. Go along.

300
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,360
Get yourself beaten ten times.

301
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,000
No. Father!

302
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,280
That's... Ling Buyi forced me.

303
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,599
It was not my intention.

304
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,439
Go!

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,799
Father!

306
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,280
No!

307
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,120
Why am I always so unlucky?

308
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,079
Your Majesty!

309
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,880
One.

310
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,520
Two.

311
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,000
Three.

312
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Four.

313
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,319
Five.

314
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Six.

315
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,479
Seven.

316
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,199
Eight.

317
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,319
Nine.

318
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Ten.

319
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Eleven.

320
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,880
Twelve.

321
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:40,760
Thirteen.

322
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,760
Your Majesty.

323
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,760
You are really cruel.

324
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,319
Zisheng was pitiful since young.

325
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,640
He had parents but
it's like they didn't exist.

326
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,760
He sees Your Majesty as his father.

327
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,760
Zisheng did get angry because of me

328
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,079
and trespassed the Censorate.

329
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:56,679
But

330
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,679
his actions were justified
even though he broke the law.

331
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,199
Your Majesty can forgive him.

332
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,719
I beat him because of you.

333
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,319
Remember.

334
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,199
Zisheng is being beaten today

335
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,920
because of you.

336
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:15,000
Fine.

337
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,559
Since he got beaten because of me.

338
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,199
Why can't I stop it?

339
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
I know.

340
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,719
I didn't love him enough back then.

341
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,319
But it's different now.

342
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,679
I only have eyes for him.

343
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,760
This is my man.

344
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,640
I couldn't bring myself
to scold or hit him normally.

345
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,280
How can he suffer like this?

346
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,959
Twenty-five.

347
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,120
Twenty-six.

348
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,079
Twenty-seven.

349
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,040
Your Majesty.

350
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,839
Third Prince counted one less.

351
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,040
The slower he counts,

352
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,360
the more Zisheng has to be beaten.

353
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,400
Your Majesty, look!
Are you going to ignore it?

354
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,679
Shaoshang.

355
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
Don't cause trouble here.

356
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,199
Zisheng.

357
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,959
Let go!

358
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,040
Let me go!

359
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,360
Cheng Shaoshang,

360
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,352
you dare interrupt a punishment
by the imperial decree?

361
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,400
Zisheng!

362
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,240
According to the books,

363
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,079
the father is responsible
for his son's mistake.

364
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:31,760
Why?

365
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,079
Zisheng had parents

366
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,199
but he lived a life as he has neither.

367
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,439
He made a mistake
because no one taught him.

368
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:37,880
Isn't that natural?

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,280
I am the same!

370
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,520
Why do parents beat their child

371
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,559
when it's their own fault?

372
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,280
Your Majesty.

373
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,880
How can we do this

374
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,559
as elders?

375
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,199
Don't speak.

376
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,880
I can't hear her.

377
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,439
I thought

378
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:54,719
His Majesty will be different
compared to other parents.

379
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,120
Now that I see it,
you are just the same!

380
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:57,799
Move!

381
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,760
How dare you!

382
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,160
Are you questioning Father's decision?

383
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,400
Shut up!

384
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,759
You got Zisheng beaten
more than he was supposed to!

385
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,439
Don't think I didn't see it!

386
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,759
The more you beat him,
the more pain he will feel!

387
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,199
His Majesty didn't mention
how hard Zisheng should be beaten!

388
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,439
You are obviously killing him!

389
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,320
Look.

390
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,160
Shaoshang is really crying.

391
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,080
She is crying until she's hoarse.

392
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,519
Let go!

393
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,519
Zisheng!

394
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,199
Let me go!

395
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,239
In the military,

396
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,600
I heard

397
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,120
there are two types
of beating punishment.

398
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
There's a type where the person
would have no visible injuries

399
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,800
but he would be disabled

400
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,360
from broken bones and tendons.

401
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,840
There's another type
where the injury looks bad

402
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,320
but it is nothing serious in truth.

403
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,120
Your Majesty.

404
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,239
Which type of punishment are you using?

405
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,759
You saw through everything, Heng.

406
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,920
It's obviously the latter.

407
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,239
Ling Zisheng!

408
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,199
I guarantee

409
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,840
not to quarrel with you again.

410
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,479
You anger me

411
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,320
by doing that

412
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,600
and hurt yourself instead!

413
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,160
Is that worth it?

414
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,279
Let go! Ling Zisheng!

415
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,800
Let me go!

416
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,360
Cao Cheng.

417
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,239
Yes.

418
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:26,999
Go.

419
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,080
Ask the person stopping Shaoshang
to let go slightly

420
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,320
so Shaoshang can get closer to Zisheng.

421
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,560
I want her to see him closely
yet still too distant to touch him.

422
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,920
That will make her suffer more.

423
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,239
Yes.

424
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,239
Your Majesty.

425
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,039
Are you going to
lie to Shaoshang like that?

426
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,279
Shen'an, you know nothing.

427
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,800
In the future,

428
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,080
when they have many children

429
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,479
and live a harmonious life,

430
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,360
they will be grateful

431
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,880
of my lies.

432
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,400
Heng.

433
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:57,999
You were His Majesty's childhood friend.

434
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,080
Which feature of his attracted you?

435
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:02,959
His face.

436
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,120
His Majesty used to be

437
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,479
the most handsome man in Feng County.

438
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,160
In my opinion,

439
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
he is the most shameless man right now.

440
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,360
Ling Zisheng!

441
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,080
Let me go!

442
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:17,880
Let go!

443
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,759
Move!

444
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,880
Stop it!

445
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,719
Stop it!

446
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,999
Stop!

447
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,999
If you're still going to do it,
beat me instead!

448
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:02,479
Does it hurt?

449
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
I promise you.

450
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,920
I will talk to you
if I have any trouble in the future.

451
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,759
I won't act on my own anymore.

452
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,360
We will act as one as husband and wife.

453
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,080
From now onwards,

454
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,160
I will give my heart to you.

455
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,600
Don't act recklessly
because of me anymore. All right?

456
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,160
Actually, I already fell in love
with you back then.

457
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,759
Why don't you know that?

458
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,320
What is she saying?

459
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,160
What is she saying?

460
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,560
I can't hear her.

461
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,320
What did she say?

462
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,719
Your Majesty,
you are not only shameless.

463
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,279
You are also deaf.

464
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,279
Even if you can't hear her,
can't you see what she is doing?

465
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,719
It's obvious when you look at her.

466
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,400
She is saying that she loves Zisheng.

467
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,759
Yes. That's enough.

468
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,999
It's enough since she said that.

469
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you still going to beat him,
Your Majesty?

470
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,439
Why should I beat him
when she already said she loves him?

471
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:41,999
That's enough!

472
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,320
Someone, go.

473
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,759
Ask Third Prince to stop.

474
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,800
Take Zisheng

475
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,759
back to Changqiu Palace
and treat his wounds immediately.

476
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,759
Zisheng was the one who got beaten
but I am the one who is hurting.

477
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,400
Shen'an.

478
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,120
Shen'an?

479
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,199
Is my idea

480
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,640
not good?

481
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,600
It's good.

482
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,320
Being the emperor alone

483
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,360
is such a waste
of Your Majesty's talents.

484
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,759
Yes.

485
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:08,246
It's really...

486
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:11,920
Too difficult to be an emperor.

487
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,239
Do you think it's easy for me?

488
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,560
Your Majesty.

489
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,560
The snow is heavy today.

490
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,560
It is snowing, so what?

491
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,679
You've been busy for the whole day.

492
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:13,039
Zisheng has Physician Sun with him.

493
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,479
You should go to sleep.

494
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,160
I don't think there's a thick blanket
at Zisheng's place.

495
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,279
I wonder if it's cold over there

496
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,320
when it's snowing so heavily.

497
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,719
I will ask someone
to send a blanket there.

498
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,959
He doesn't stay
in Changqiu Palace often.

499
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm sure he won't be used to it.

500
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,759
I wonder if the height
of the pillow suits him.

501
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,880
Will his neck feel sore
after sleeping on it for a long time?

502
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,999
He grew up in Changqiu Palace.

503
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm sure he is used to the place
more than you do.

504
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,999
That was where he stayed
when he was a child.

505
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,479
It has been empty for a long time.

506
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,640
I wonder if it will be very humid there.

507
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,959
He is injured.

508
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,640
I don't want him to get sick
before his wounds have healed.

509
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,360
I should go and have a look.

510
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,640
Cheng Shaoshang.

511
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,800
I've ordered Madam Zhai

512
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,360
to prepare medicine
that calms and cools you down.

513
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,400
You cried for so long
and your voice is hoarse.

514
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,840
Drink it and go to sleep.

515
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,519
There's no need for you
to worry about other things.

516
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,400
The relationship between
His Majesty and Zisheng is good.

517
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,479
Go inside.

518
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,600
Go to sleep.

519
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,439
Let's go.

520
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,039
Who is it?

521
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,999
Young Master?

522
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,800
Young Master.

523
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,239
I'm here to visit you.

524
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,880
Young Master, are you fine?

525
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,080
I finally sneaked inside successfully.

526
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,479
Why are you here?

527
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,920
My brother forced me to come.

528
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:57,999
No.

529
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,719
I came here because I was worried
that there's no one

530
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,759
to take care of you.

531
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,199
Young Master.

532
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,679
You didn't know how dangerous it was.

533
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,560
I finally sneaked inside

534
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,959
and almost got found out
by the palace guards.

535
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,199
I almost become a eunuch.

536
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,999
There's a certain standard
to becoming a eunuch.

537
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,239
With your face,

538
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,479
you might not become one

539
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,080
even if you are castrated.

540
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,479
All right. Just go back.

541
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,959
I'm going to sleep.

542
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,920
Go and open the door.

543
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,719
Hurry.

544
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,320
Close the door.

545
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,080
Zisheng.

546
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,239
Shaoshang.

547
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:54,840
Why are you here?

548
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,880
Don't get up and stretch your wound.

549
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,640
I knew

550
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,999
the blanket here is the summer blanket.

551
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,320
It's thin and cool.

552
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,880
I brought you my blanket.

553
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,039
I've been heating it for a long time
by the fire.

554
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,479
It's still hot inside.

555
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,759
Is it warm?

556
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,600
Yes.

557
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,640
Life in the army
was way colder than this.

558
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,999
Even in the winter

559
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,519
when dripping water
turns into ice immediately,

560
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,279
Young Master still lived his life
with a thin blanket and a cold bed.

561
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,039
Are you cold?

562
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,080
Why did you wear so less?

563
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,279
Don't worry about me.

564
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,920
I came here with the blanket.
I'm not cold.

565
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,959
Good.

566
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,719
Fei.

567
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,959
Changqiu Palace does not allow
a male outsider to stay overnight.

568
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Go back.

569
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:49,999
Young Master.

570
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:52,400
I risk being castrated to...

571
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,080
Yes.

572
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,239
Young Master

573
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,320
is worried about my safety.

574
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,360
I will risk being castrated again

575
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,719
to leave the palace.

576
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,800
Close the door.

577
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:17,800
Yes.

578
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,400
I feel so sad.

579
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,279
Why did you get up?

580
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,719
We will do

581
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,120
what you want to do.

582
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,759
Lay down.

583
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,279
Did you stretch your wound?

584
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,400
Let me call the physician.

585
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,479
I'm fine.

586
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:06,679
Your Majesty.

587
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,360
He will die if he is beaten 100 times.

588
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,320
Don't do it, Your Majesty.

589
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,199
I

590
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,279
accept.

591
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,360
You faked your injury?

592
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,920
Why is my injury fake?

593
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,279
You want to achieve your goal

594
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,759
by making me feel bad.

595
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,439
Why do you feel bad

596
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,719
when I get injured then?

597
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,039
If you don't feel bad,

598
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,039
every plan of mine

599
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,800
would be useless.

600
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,880
I am extremely lucky

601
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,080
to make you feel bad.

602
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,279
Shouldn't we

603
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,759
do these things after we get married?

604
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,640
Shouldn't I be the one to say that?

605
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,880
Let's kiss again then.

606
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,239
This time, you will say it.

607
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,640
Dream on.

608
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,999
I brought medicine for you.

609
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:38,959
Lay down.

610
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Careful.

611
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,880
Is it bitter?

612
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,400
It's sweet.

613
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,279
Her Majesty said
it has a calming effect.

614
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,479
You will sleep well after drinking it.

615
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,199
I don't need it.

616
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,039
I only need you here.

617
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,360
When you are finished drinking,

618
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,880
I'll play the flute for you.

619
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,840
Why are you spacing out
while looking at me?

620
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,800
When I first saw your face clearly,

621
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,519
you were as pretty as you are today.

622
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,639
Do you still remember

623
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,079
the first time you saw me?

624
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,320
Of course.

625
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,200
It was the lantern festival.

626
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,959
You were looking at lanterns.

627
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,119
I was looking at you.

628
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,200
You were looking at me for so long.

629
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Why didn't you approach me?

630
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,920
Because I had something
that I had yet to achieve

631
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
and I was not
ready to propose to you yet.

632
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,200
You only saw me once.

633
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:03,119
Isn't it too early for a proposal?

634
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,360
Once.

635
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,760
Once was enough.

636
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,599
How was it

637
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,280
when you first saw me?

638
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:24,880
That day,

639
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:29,800
the sky was filled with lanterns.

640
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:32,360
You were running on the street.

641
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,680
There were many people

642
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,840
but I could only see you.

643
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,280
I thought about the saying,

644
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,760
looking once and
remembering for 10,000 years.

645
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,439
That's what it was.

646
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,200
After I met you once,

647
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,079
I already knew

648
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,119
you would be

649
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,079
in my life.

650
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,720
From now onwards,

651
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,599
if you don't lie to me,

652
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
I will

653
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,639
definitely not let you down.

654
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:10,079
Madam, why did you eat so less today?

655
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,479
Let the kitchen know

656
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,639
that there's no need
to prepare so much food anymore.

657
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,119
We have so much food but so few people.

658
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,079
It's such a sad sight.

659
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,639
Dear.

660
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,959
You might catch a cold in the winter.

661
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,200
This cloak

662
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,760
was given to Niaoniao by Her Majesty.

663
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,519
When Niaoniao received it,
she ordered someone to send it here.

664
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,320
She still cares about

665
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:44,200
her mother.

666
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,599
She said

667
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,360
she would come back
after the birthday banquet.

668
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:59,479
It has been so long
since the banquet was over.

669
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,320
Why isn't she back yet?

670
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,400
I know.

671
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,599
I was too strict towards her
in the past.

672
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,559
But there's no need
to abandon her own mother

673
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,760
after meeting Her Majesty.

674
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,439
You finally know

675
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:17,439
how important Niaoniao is to the family.

676
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,360
In the past,

677
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,599
she annoyed you by causing trouble

678
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,760
in front of us.

679
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,039
Now that you don't see her
for a few days,

680
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
you start to miss her instead.

681
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,800
Yes.

682
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,519
I miss her.

683
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,519
Does she miss me?

684
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,880
Niaoniao had no choice
since she is in the palace.

685
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,760
You shouldn't be so harsh on Niaoniao.

686
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,159
Not a single lady in the capital

687
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,559
is as capable as Niaoniao.

688
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,079
She didn't worry her parents
regarding her marriage

689
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,800
and always makes her family proud.

690
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,200
Like the brainless ladies

691
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,079
around Fifth Princess.

692
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,559
They caused trouble
during Her Majesty's birthday banquet

693
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,159
and even got
their fathers and brothers involved.

694
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,200
I was afraid

695
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,840
that Niaoniao
would cause trouble out there

696
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,280
and thought Ling Buyi could control her.

697
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:06,360
But I didn't expect Ling Buyi

698
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,159
to beat up the imperial counsellor

699
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,639
and got punished by His Majesty

700
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,200
because of her.

701
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,439
That's because Niaoniao is capable.

702
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,479
Dear.

703
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,840
Don't you think

704
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,119
Niaoniao is no longer

705
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,439
causing as much trouble
after getting engaged with Ling Buyi?

706
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,680
Yes.

707
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,320
Who would've guessed?

708
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
Ling Buyi

709
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,880
is actually more reckless than Niaoniao.

710
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,680
It's as you've expected, Young Master.

711
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,599
After you destroyed the Censorate,

712
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,360
His Majesty punished you

713
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,240
to repair the damage caused
to calm everyone's anger.

714
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,519
We took out

715
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,599
the Yue faction's
military report scrolls in secret.

716
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,400
Official Zuo did not suspect a thing.

717
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:51,439
In order to get these,

718
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,080
Young Master was beaten.

719
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,439
It was not supposed to be.

720
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,840
Didn't we already conclude

721
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,959
that Marquis Yue
delayed in rescuing Gu City?

722
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,039
Why do we still need to find the reports
at the Censorate?

723
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,079
Although Marquis Yue is greedy,

724
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:05,439
Consort Yue

725
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,039
is an open-minded person.

726
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,159
She never involved herself
in any disputes.

727
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,320
His Majesty will take care of Yue Clan

728
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,559
because of her.

729
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,639
Hence,

730
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,999
we need evidence.

731
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,959
The military physician who was
also the witness has died.

732
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,079
Han Wu also lost his life
because of this.

733
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
It's impossible for Young Master

734
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,959
to accuse Marquis Yue
in front of His Majesty empty-handed.

735
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,240
Han Wu said

736
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,920
the soldiers who were sent
to investigate the miasma

737
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
all died.

738
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,039
But their horses

739
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,280
were still in the army.

740
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,360
However, according to these reports,

741
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,760
none of them mentioned
how many of the horses were dead.

742
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,720
Back then,

743
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
war horses were very precious.

744
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,039
If they died because of the miasma,

745
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,680
it will definitely
be stated in the report.

746
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,479
So, it's proof

747
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,680
that the war horses didn't die
because of the miasma.

748
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,119
The miasma that poisoned
all the soldiers was also fake.

749
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:02,519
Marquis Yue

750
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,880
is lying.

751
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,800
Marquis Yue is well-known for being sly

752
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,159
among the Fengrao Heroes.

753
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,079
He never makes any mistakes
when he commits a crime.

754
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,280
We can't do anything

755
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,880
unless he admits it himself.

756
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,559
If he won't make a mistake,

757
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,800
we will force him to make one.
