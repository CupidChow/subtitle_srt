3
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:02,675
Marquis.

4
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:05,474
We've helped settle down
the members of the Ling Family

5
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:07,035
who're here to send you birthday wishes.

6
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,115
In the past years,

7
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:16,155
Zisheng would rather disobey His Majesty

8
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,595
and get called a disloyal son

9
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:19,794
than come home.

10
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:21,954
Marquis,

11
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:22,995
I wonder

12
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:25,234
what changed his mind.

13
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:28,914
It only happened because Huo Junhua,
the ignorant woman,

14
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,435
kept standing in our way
when she was still alive.

15
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,155
Because of her, I, as the father,
couldn't meet my own son.

16
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:36,354
The crazy woman was really brutal.

17
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:37,954
Luckily, she's dead.

18
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,234
Zisheng wouldn't call me his father

19
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,954
if she were still alive.

20
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:45,715
I've been waiting

21
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:47,995
for this day to come for 15 years.

22
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:49,275
From now on,

23
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:51,875
I won't allow anyone

24
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,234
to sow discord between me and my son.

25
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:57,555
I'm feeling a little nervous.

26
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,555
Zisheng's stare was rather intimidating

27
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:02,835
when he saw Marquis yesterday.

28
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:04,354
I'm afraid

29
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,634
that Junhua had told him the truth.

30
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:09,155
What you did to the Huo Family when
you were at Gu City many years ago...

31
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:14,875
Marquis.

32
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:16,914
What did I do to them?

33
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,435
I did nothing to them.

34
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:21,595
I'm warning you.

35
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,074
Ling Buyi is my biological son.

36
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,315
He wants to come home now,

37
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:27,875
so he will.

38
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,794
Do I really have to keep my guard up
when I'm with my son?

39
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:33,555
You can't carry out your duty as a wife
and can't bear me a son,

40
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:36,474
but you can't stop me from having a son.

41
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:39,395
Bear in mind.

42
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:41,875
Be careful what you say.

43
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:44,074
If you dare spout nonsense again,

44
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:46,234
I'll kill you myself,

45
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,754
so that you can reunite with Huo Junhua.

46
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,674
Marquis.

47
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,595
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

48
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:50,075
Ling Yi.

49
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,674
We've been married
for more than ten years,

50
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,234
and I've been taking care of you
with all my heart.

51
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:03,755
Yet,

52
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:07,114
you didn't even take our relationship
into consideration.

53
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:11,835
Back then, you insisted on marrying me

54
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:14,114
before you even found your first wife.

55
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,715
Because of that,
I was called a disgrace by others.

56
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,515
I don't mind others mocking

57
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,155
or shaming me,

58
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:25,674
but you should never

59
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:28,874
bully me.

60
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,874
I was assaulted by Huo Junhua

61
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:32,955
and lost my baby.

62
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:37,275
That's why
I remain childless until these days.

63
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,674
It's all because of you.

64
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:44,354
How could you

65
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:47,874
touch me on the raw?

66
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,794
You're too cold-blooded.

67
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,195
I've finally seen you through.

68
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,554
All you care about is your son.

69
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:03,874
Fine.

70
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,674
I'll give you what you want.

71
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:09,474
From now on,

72
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,395
you will get to stay together
as father and son.

73
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,195
I'll find myself

74
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,715
another way out.

75
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:33,380
(Changqiu Palace)

76
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:50,640
(Changqiu Palace)

77
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:53,595
No one expected Madam Huo
to pass away at such a young age.

78
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,955
His Majesty had no choice
but to issue a decree,

79
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,755
so that you can complete your wedding
before the mourning period ends.

80
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,794
Once the mourning period is over,

81
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,434
you'll need to wait for another
three years before you can get married.

82
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,195
I'm afraid that His Majesty

83
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:08,195
won't like to wait for that long.

84
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:11,395
However,

85
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,075
if you're getting married
during the mourning period,

86
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,715
it's better to keep a low profile.

87
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:18,874
I'm sorry you have to put up with this.

88
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,994
This looks really grand, Your Majesty.

89
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:23,275
Look at the dowries
Your Majesty prepared.

90
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,275
I live in a small house,

91
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,195
and I don't know if they can all fit.

92
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:30,914
Didn't you draw a floor plan
for the new house?

93
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:34,155
Zisheng is building a new residence
according to the floor plan you drew.

94
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,314
Don't worry.

95
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,674
It will be able to fit all your dowries,
however many they are.

96
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,874
Stop staring at the gate.

97
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:51,755
He won't be here today.

98
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:54,434
You are not supposed to meet
until your wedding day.

99
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:57,195
Meeting in private before your wedding
will bring bad fortune to you.

100
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:59,955
Hang in there for a few more days.

101
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:02,395
You'll get to live together
after you get married.

102
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:03,955
Then, you'll get to see him

103
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:06,035
whenever you want.

104
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:36,794
Zisheng, what brought you here?

105
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:17,674
Why are you here?

106
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:21,074
I'm here to send you off.

107
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:29,355
Her Majesty said

108
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:31,475
that we should stop seeing each other
for the coming few days.

109
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,155
I'll be waiting for you to pick me up

110
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:35,834
on our wedding day.

111
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,155
Do you have anything to say to me?

112
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:09,235
Zisheng, can't you stand not seeing her
just for a short while?

113
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:10,515
After you get married,

114
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:12,475
you'll get to see her every day.

115
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:14,235
Shaoshang.

116
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:15,515
You should get going.

117
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:57,755
(Ling Buyi.)

118
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,434
(Are you really not going
to tell me anything?)

119
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,794
Third Lady, this crown is really pretty.

120
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:27,834
Young Lady,

121
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:28,995
Her Majesty

122
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,314
found the best embroiderer
in the palace,

123
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,115
and he spent one month

124
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:34,434
making this wedding gown for you.

125
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:36,995
It's really pretty.

126
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:40,475
In fact,

127
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:43,674
Aunt Yuanyi has prepared
a wedding gown for you as well.

128
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,674
Too bad you won't be able to wear it.

129
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,914
You can wear it

130
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,035
on your wedding day.

131
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:54,954
Niaoniao.

132
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:57,674
Aunt Yuanyi prepared it
especially for you.

133
00:12:57,674 --> 00:12:58,635
Yangyang.

134
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:00,275
I appreciate it,

135
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:01,594
but I'm no longer the young lady

136
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,355
who takes my personal gains and losses
so seriously.

137
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,755
During the days I spent in the palace,

138
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:08,794
you were the one who took care
of our family.

139
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:11,035
Words alone can't express my gratitude.

140
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,074
Aunt Yuanyi and Ms. Qingcong

141
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,355
took care of the household.

142
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,635
I wasn't of much help.

143
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,674
Yangyang, you're so capable,

144
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:21,155
and you never fish for compliments.

145
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,635
Now I understand
why my mother dotes on you.

146
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:29,074
This is the best we can ask for.

147
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:31,714
With you taking care of our family,

148
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,995
my mother will not feel too upset

149
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,434
when she loses a daughter.

150
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:38,914
Niaoniao.

151
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:40,714
You're just getting married.

152
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,355
You're not leaving home for good.

153
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,635
How could you say that Aunt Yuanyi
is going to lose you?

154
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:48,954
After a lady gets married,

155
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:51,954
she belongs to her husband

156
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:54,755
for the rest of her life.

157
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,155
If anything happens to him,

158
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,554
I won't be able to come home too.

159
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:12,635
General.

160
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,475
You can cry if you want to.

161
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:15,914
Your heavy breathing

162
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:18,434
is making me feel suffocated.

163
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,115
Yuanyi.

164
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,115
I'm really sad.

165
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,995
That's enough.

166
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:33,515
Your daughter is getting married,

167
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:34,635
but for those
who have no idea about this,

168
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,434
they might mistake you for a debtor
who's being chased.

169
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:40,674
Niaoniao has barely stayed with me
for a year.

170
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:43,275
I've always wanted to make it up to her.

171
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:44,635
Who would've expected

172
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,674
that she would get married so soon?

173
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:52,314
As her father,

174
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,235
whenever I'm reminded of the fact

175
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:57,194
that I'm going to entrust my Niaoniao
to that brat, Ling Buyi,

176
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:01,074
I can't help but feel sad.

177
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:10,515
That's enough, General.

178
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:13,115
The wedding is
on the day after tomorrow.

179
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,515
Why don't you save your tears

180
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:17,314
for the wedding banquet?

181
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:19,475
Then, you can cry before Ling Buyi.

182
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:21,155
That...

183
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:22,794
I dare not do that.

184
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:24,714
Moreover,

185
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:27,434
it's really embarrassing to cry
in front of the guests.

186
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:28,554
I'm going

187
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,355
to cry all I want today,

188
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:34,074
so that I can hold my tears back
on the wedding day.

189
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:36,954
Dear.

190
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,194
If you have anything to say to Niaoniao,

191
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:42,115
you should say it today.

192
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,314
Otherwise,

193
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,194
it'd be very embarrassing

194
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:46,834
for both of us
to be sobbing on her wedding day.

195
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:59,115
Somehow,

196
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:02,554
my heart is beating really fast.

197
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,074
Whatever Niaoniao said
in the room just now

198
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:08,995
sounded like a farewell speech.

199
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:13,475
A daughter's wedding day is the day
she bids farewell to her family.

200
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,194
I know you're sad,

201
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,794
but if you miss her in the future,

202
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,475
you can always tell her to come home
and pay us a visit.

203
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:25,794
Yuanyi.

204
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,194
Thank you so much.

205
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,714
You gave birth to three sons,

206
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:35,434
and gave me Niaoniao,
such a clever and good daughter.

207
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,914
For me,

208
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,235
you're the best wife,

209
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:42,755
and the best mother for my children.

210
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,340
(Marquis Chengyang's Residence)

211
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:15,035
(Marquis Chengyang's Residence)
General Ling is here!

212
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,154
It's Marquis Chengyang's 50th birthday.

213
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,195
Madam Huo and I have prepared a gift

214
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,915
for Marquis Chengyang.

215
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:06,955
Zisheng.

216
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:11,794
What is this?

217
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:15,074
He was the gardener who worked at
the backyard of the Ministry of Justice.

218
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:18,394
I suppose Marquis Chengyang
remembers who he was.

219
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:20,154
After all, Marquis Chengyang
personally sent him

220
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:22,834
30,000 qian a few days ago.

221
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:25,915
You ordered him to blow petals
into Peng Kun's cell,

222
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:28,275
causing Peng Kun's death.

223
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:31,554
Today,

224
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,515
I returned the money and his head
to you altogether.

225
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:39,634
I wonder if Marquis Chengyang

226
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:43,035
is satisfied with this gift.

227
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,354
If you're not,

228
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:51,235
I'll send my regards on behalf
of the 3,000 dead men of Gu City

229
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:53,195
and wish that Marquis Chengyang's life
will end today.

230
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,435
You'll die at the age of 50.

231
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,074
What about that?

232
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:16,955
Niaoniao, aren't you going
to try this on?

233
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:19,275
You're going to keep wearing this
on your wedding day.

234
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:20,955
You should get used to it now.

235
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:23,794
There's no need to get used to it.

236
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,154
Marquis Chengyang is holding
a birthday banquet tonight.

237
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,794
Zisheng will be there
to send his best wishes.

238
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:32,594
Lianfang.

239
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:34,715
Prepare a present

240
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:37,634
and tell Fu Deng to deliver it
to Marquis Chengyang's Residence.

241
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:40,874
Now.

242
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,154
Right away.

243
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:48,794
Yes.

244
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:57,515
Zisheng.

245
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,475
It's been 15 years
since you last came home.

246
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,035
Are you home today

247
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,715
just to kill me?

248
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,634
Over the past few years,
I always thought

249
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,435
that I was raising
a son of someone else's.

250
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:21,275
Not only don't you share my beliefs,

251
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:24,235
but you also prioritize the Huo Family.

252
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:26,154
You're right.

253
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:28,235
I let your mother down.

254
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,955
The Ling Family can't catch up
with the Huo Family's achievement too.

255
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,715
However, you should take a closer look

256
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:37,114
at the ancestral tablet.

257
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,235
Are you a Ling

258
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,275
or a Huo?

259
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:45,634
Do you really want to know the answer?

260
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:48,235
I do.

261
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:52,675
If you are to kill me today,

262
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:55,195
I'd like to die knowing the truth.

263
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,235
What if I just don't want you

264
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:58,475
to find out the truth?

265
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:05,195
How dare you?

266
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,634
Who said that you could point
your swords at my son?

267
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:17,675
Zisheng.

268
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:19,995
You are my son.

269
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,794
Both you and your mother
have been reluctant to see me

270
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:24,874
after you returned to the capital.

271
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,715
You refuse to come home
however hard I try to convince you.

272
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:29,554
Everyone in the capital

273
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:32,715
is condemning you
for disobeying your father,

274
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:39,554
but I don't agree with them.

275
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:43,314
I know that
you're just throwing a tantrum.

276
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:49,314
You've always been a stubborn person
who speaks very little.

277
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,074
I wonder from whom
did you pick up that trait.

278
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,114
However, there are no long-standing grudges

279
00:22:58,074 --> 00:22:59,915
between a father and a son.

280
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:01,995
Zisheng.

281
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:08,154
You don't really want to kill me, right?

282
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:33,195
Zisheng.

283
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,874
I've lived a long life.

284
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,594
Of course, I won't burn all my bridges.

285
00:23:57,995 --> 00:23:59,594
If you've experienced all the battles

286
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:01,995
like what I did,

287
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,114
you won't underestimate your enemy.

288
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:23,554
After everything that has happened,

289
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:27,915
are you really not going
to tell me the truth?

290
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:30,035
When you reach the underworld,

291
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:33,354
the Huo Family

292
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:35,794
will explain

293
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:38,114
everything

294
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:39,794
to

295
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:41,915
you.

296
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:52,314
Young Lady.

297
00:24:53,154 --> 00:24:55,074
Before delivering the gift
to the Marquis Chengyang's Residence,

298
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:56,394
I was stopped by
the residence guards on our way there.

299
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,594
They said that there was a banquet
going on in the residence,

300
00:24:58,755 --> 00:25:00,354
and we couldn't enter
without an invitation card.

301
00:25:00,354 --> 00:25:01,995
But the Marquis Chengyang's Residence
seems really odd too.

302
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,915
There's an ongoing banquet, but
we didn't hear any firecrackers.

303
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,675
I had no choice but to leave.

304
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,154
I was right.

305
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:45,114
Niaoniao.

306
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:46,874
It's late at night.

307
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:48,235
Where are you going?

308
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:49,794
I have something urgent to attend to.

309
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:52,995
They have imposed a curfew.

310
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:54,955
The military is getting
into the defense position tonight.

311
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,114
Do you know what happened?

312
00:28:57,114 --> 00:28:58,235
Something happened to Ling Buyi.

313
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,354
I need to be there right away.

314
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,995
Niaoniao, you can't leave now.

315
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:06,554
If he's doing anything unlawful,

316
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,195
you can get a man to send the news
to the palace.

317
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:11,515
There's no need to put yourself at risk.

318
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:12,955
This is about him.

319
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:15,634
I can't just stand by and watch.

320
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:17,755
Niaoniao.

321
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:19,394
However big the matter is,

322
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,554
Their Majesties will take care of it.

323
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:23,475
I know that I'm powerless,

324
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:25,794
and nothing I do can change anything.

325
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:29,435
However, we only live once.

326
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,195
I have to try my best no matter.

327
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:17,074
Stop right there.

328
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:18,394
It's a decree sealed
by the Crown Prince's tiger seal.

329
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,915
Marquis Chengyang's Residence
is currently heavily guarded.

330
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:21,074
You shall not pass.

331
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:27,074
Niaoniao.

332
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:28,794
Go straight
to the Marquis Chengyang's Residence.

333
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,874
Father and Mother
will clear the way for you.

334
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,235
Listen.

335
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:34,035
Come at me, if you dare.

336
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:37,435
I'll fight with you, toe to toe.

337
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,435
Go now!

338
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:01,435
You're my son, and I'm your father.

339
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:03,554
You are now trying

340
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:05,915
to kill your own father.

341
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,915
Does His Majesty know about this?

342
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:12,634
Has it ever crossed your mind?

343
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:16,515
What will others

344
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,515
say about this?

345
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:24,634
Aren't you afraid that you'll get judged
by the others?

346
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,755
Your son?

347
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,235
Are you talking about Li, my brother?

348
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:41,715
I'm afraid that
you mistook me for him.

349
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:47,915
You killed Li a long time ago.

350
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,634
You were the one
who opened the city gate.

351
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,874
You let the enemy into the city.

352
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,275
You hung him at the wall of Gu City.

353
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,594
Have you forgotten about all that?

354
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:01,675
Uncle.

355
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:10,714
You lied.

356
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:14,594
That's not true.

357
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:17,674
How did you find out about this?

358
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:20,554
Who are you?

359
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,234
Not only do I know what happened,

360
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:29,515
but I also know that you were the one
who killed my father.

361
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:43,915
On the day Aunt and I

362
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,835
returned to the capital,

363
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:48,915
I decided

364
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,154
to kill you myself one day.

365
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:57,194
And today

366
00:35:00,554 --> 00:35:02,194
is the day.

367
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:12,515
Ling Buyi.

368
00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:18,074
Even if you're not Li,

369
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,875
on record, you're still my son.

370
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:28,035
If you dare kill me,

371
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,074
you'll lose your life too.

372
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:36,274
No one will be able to help you.

373
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:55,515
Lord Yong.

374
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:00,114
Marquis Yue.

375
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:04,355
Peng Kun.

376
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:12,035
I took one step at a time
and reached where I am today,

377
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,754
so that I can avenge the Huo Family.

378
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,674
I'll die with no regrets.

379
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:44,674
Also,

380
00:37:34,515 --> 00:37:35,634
remember this.

381
00:37:41,435 --> 00:37:42,835
My last name is not Ling.

382
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,315
My last name is Huo.

383
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:54,114
Call me

384
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:58,234
Huo

385
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:03,234
Wu

386
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:10,995
Shang.

387
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:14,355
