3
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,010
When I was traveling
around the country,

4
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,849
I was acquainted with General Ma Rong.

5
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,329
You can say he's an old friend

6
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,209
with some common interests.

7
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,009
It was in fact His Majesty's virtue

8
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,810
that made Ma Rong surrender

9
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,210
and be convinced with His Majesty.

10
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,970
I also heard

11
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,169
that Official Yan Zhong also

12
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,250
had an old friend.

13
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,009
And his friend is a son
of an aristocratic family.

14
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,129
It's just that Yan Zhong refused

15
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,729
to be said he submitted
to the aristocratic families

16
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,609
that he kept their friendship a secret.

17
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:31,770
They always kept their meetings hidden
from the people.

18
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,409
Lou,

19
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,889
do you know of this?

20
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,289
As expected,
nothing can get past your eyes.

21
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,490
The old friend you mentioned is

22
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,970
me.

23
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,009
When I first met Official Yan,
he was already an official.

24
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,689
He lamented that he had no chance

25
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,370
of fulfilling his ambitions.

26
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,370
His situation was similar to mine.

27
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,930
So we ended up being friends.

28
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,250
Yet, I didn't expect

29
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,409
he would actually defect to the enemy.

30
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,050
It really saddens me.

31
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,810
But I didn't want to vilify my friend.

32
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,569
That's why I never told anyone about us.

33
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,930
Then what do you think

34
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,930
about the letter Official Yan left?

35
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,129
I heard

36
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:38,889
you found the letter.

37
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:40,569
I guess

38
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,609
Yan can't bear

39
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,530
to see his family suffer.

40
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,449
So he had no choice
but to collude with Ma Rong.

41
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,050
So he used the 2000 refined copper

42
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,889
in exchange for his family's life.

43
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,970
Who would've known Ma Rong was ruthless

44
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,849
that he slaughtered the whole Yan Clan?

45
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,770
"I am ashamed of my greed."

46
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,090
I feel bad for Official Yan.

47
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,889
But if Official Yan didn't defect
to the enemy,

48
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,729
you wouldn't have the chance
to make such a contribution.

49
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,530
When you return

50
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:13,330
to the capital this time,

51
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,370
you'll definitely rise the ranks.

52
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,130
Allow me

53
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,729
to congratulate you in advance.

54
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,609
If I could choose,

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,330
I wish Yan

56
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,450
never made this mistake.

57
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,489
His Majesty has summoned me
to return to the capital.

58
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:34,890
I have to pack my things.

59
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,849
So I won't stay to chatter anymore.

60
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,169
Please excuse me.

61
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,409
You didn't make public on the discovery

62
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,809
of Yan Zhong and his family's bodies
at the post.

63
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,369
How did Lou Ben find out about it?

64
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,369
I'm sure he panicked and made the slip

65
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,690
because you were probing him.

66
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,090
I'm sure he's related

67
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:11,450
to Official Yan's death.

68
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,010
When I arrived at Tongniu County,

69
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,090
I had already started suspecting Lou Ben.

70
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,169
He doesn't hold any official position.

71
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,890
His words don't carry any weight.

72
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,770
It is impossible for him
to persuade Ma Rong to surrender.

73
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,929
That day in the dungeon,

74
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,970
Li Feng said something

75
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:26,570
about burning bridges before he died.

76
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,729
I'm sure he's talking about Lou Ben.

77
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,369
I'm sure he knows
my father's whereabouts.

78
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:34,289
I'm going to confront him.

79
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:35,249
Calm down.

80
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,409
We have no evidence now.

81
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:39,489
If you confront him,
he'll never admit it.

82
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:41,489
Besides, you'll alert him.

83
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,289
But he's returning to the capital soon.

84
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:45,369
If he returns,

85
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,489
how do I find out where my father is?

86
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:48,690
He won't be the only one.

87
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,409
My men reported

88
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,570
that the messenger to summon us
to return to the palace

89
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,690
was already on his way.

90
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,570
He'll arrive in Tongniu County soon.

91
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:57,450
Then are you returning too?

92
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:58,849
No.

93
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,330
I don't think Ma Rong is a fool.

94
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,890
It's likely that he left himself
a way out.

95
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,530
Tongniu County

96
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,450
should have evidence
of Lou Ben's crime.

97
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,570
What about His Majesty's imperial edict?

98
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,369
We can ignore it

99
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,289
to deal with an emergency.

100
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,489
My reading shows we'll be saved
from this situation.

101
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,650
Mother. Grandmother.

102
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,130
We'll definitely get out of here.

103
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,489
Your reading is not accurate at all.

104
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,530
You said I'll get married
before Niaoniao.

105
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:45,849
Look at me now.

106
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,169
I'm not even married yet.

107
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,090
But I'll die soon.

108
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,929
My poor Qiqi.

109
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,409
My poor Qiqi!

110
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,450
Song!

111
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,289
Song!

112
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,570
Song!

113
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:01,650
Song!

114
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,929
Song.

115
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,169
What are you doing here?

116
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:09,970
I heard you calling my name.

117
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,090
Did you miss me too?

118
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:13,849
Let me look at you.

119
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,489
Why do you look so haggard?

120
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:19,650
Look at yourself.

121
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:21,729
Look at the dark circles
around your eyes.

122
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:23,210
You overthink.

123
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,729
Song snores when he sleeps every day.

124
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:28,409
I'm the one who didn't sleep well.

125
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,330
Song,

126
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,570
it must be hard on you.

127
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:36,130
Qiqi,

128
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,570
why are you here?

129
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,770
You even dressed up like a boy.

130
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,409
Go home now.

131
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,690
My future husband is in the dungeon.

132
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,770
Can I not come?

133
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,929
I begged Father

134
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,169
to bribe the guard

135
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,169
to let me see you.

136
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,890
I'm not your future husband.

137
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:53,690
My mother

138
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,210
would never agree to me marrying
into the Wan Family.

139
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,049
You can just forget about it.

140
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,650
But you told me

141
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,090
that you'd take
your mother's words as rubbish

142
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,929
and you would listen to me.

143
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:12,809
I changed my mind.

144
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,450
I'm a filial son.

145
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,650
You're

146
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:18,970
fierce and savage.

147
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:19,770
Even your needlework is

148
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,530
no better than Niaoniao.

149
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:47,489
What are you doing?

150
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:48,729
We're at the dungeon now.

151
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:49,930
You must not behave recklessly.

152
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:51,769
Besides, Shaogong is here.

153
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:52,889
Restrain yourself.

154
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,930
I know your days are numbered.

155
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,050
From tonight on,

156
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,690
I, Wan Qiqi, marry you as your wife.

157
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:38,690
I shall never regret it in my life.

158
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,649
Do you know the circumstances
we're in right now?

159
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,090
The men will be beheaded.

160
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,369
That's why I came here.

161
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,849
If you unfortunately die,

162
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,369
I shall be your widow

163
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,050
and never remarry my whole life.

164
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,249
I never go back on my words.

165
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,450
If you refuse to accept me,

166
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:14,729
I'll cut off my hair and be a nun.

167
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,529
I'll never marry my whole life.

168
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,489
I give my consent.

169
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,050
I give my consent.

170
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,529
When the male members
of the Cheng Family are

171
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,849
about to be beheaded,

172
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,210
we unexpectedly have such
a loyal fiancee.

173
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:43,609
My life is

174
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,450
already worth it.

175
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,330
Qiqi,

176
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:55,930
on behalf
of the Cheng Family's ancestors,

177
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,609
thank you very much.

178
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,009
Thank you so much.

179
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,489
As long as both of you

180
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,570
love each other,

181
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:13,170
ignore what people gossip.

182
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,649
I shall decide

183
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,849
and let Song marry

184
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,330
into the Wan Family.

185
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:28,810
Qiqi,

186
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,249
come here.

187
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,769
Give me your hand.

188
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:57,729
Take this.

189
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,930
It's a gift from me.

190
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,849
Thank you, Grandmother.

191
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,410
This is solid gold.

192
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,129
Keep it well.

193
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,690
Thank you, Grandmother.

194
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:20,609
Yuanyi.

195
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,170
About this marriage,

196
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,609
do

197
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,690
you agree or not?

198
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,810
I'll let you decide.

199
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:58,529
You're...

200
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,210
You're not going to oppose me?

201
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,729
Old Madam.

202
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,090
We have always gone

203
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,930
against each other in the past.

204
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:16,450
Now, it looks like

205
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,050
no matter how we quarreled in the past,

206
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,330
we're the only ones
who are protecting the Cheng Family

207
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,769
and fighting for our children.

208
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,249
We're family.

209
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,489
Yes.

210
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,210
We don't bear grudges.

211
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,729
There's nothing that we can't overcome.

212
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,889
You're finally being sensible for once.

213
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,609
I'm not a petty person either.

214
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,649
All our resentment

215
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,489
will be wiped out.

216
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,889
I...

217
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:24,889
But

218
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,970
I still want the betrothal gift.

219
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,369
I've already prepared it long ago.

220
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,450
Your mother and I will take half each.

221
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,810
No,

222
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:39,970
it's all yours.

223
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:37,930
Ma.

224
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:39,889
Lou.

225
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,769
You managed to recapture
a city over a few words.

226
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,210
That's really impressive.

227
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,050
He's right.

228
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,769
I'll need your help
to guide me from now on.

229
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,729
Please do guide us the way,
Official Lou.

230
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:50,050
Thank you for your kind words.

231
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:50,970
Please have a drink.

232
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,769
Sure.

233
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:56,330
Please help yourselves.

234
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,009
Qin.

235
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,050
- Congratulations, Mr. Lou.
- I'm happy for you, Mr. Lou.

236
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:07,450
You have no idea
how capable my eldest brother is.

237
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,330
He persuaded the rebel army
to surrender himself.

238
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,769
Even His Majesty granted him

239
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:13,090
to be an official.

240
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,210
Look at this bronze mirror.

241
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,009
This is a love token he gave

242
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,810
to my sister-in-law back then.

243
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,090
He made it himself.

244
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:21,970
Have you ever seen

245
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,729
such an affectionate husband?

246
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,849
I never heard you talk

247
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,170
about your eldest brother's
achievements in the past.

248
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:29,970
I guess he's your cousin.

249
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,450
So what if he's my cousin?

250
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,529
Whatever the merits he rendered,
it's the Lou Family's honor too.

251
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,690
Li, stop showing
the bronze mirror around.

252
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,210
Ben won't like it.

253
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,170
Sister-in-law, you're here.

254
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:41,410
Come and sit.

255
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:43,489
What's wrong with showing it off?

256
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:44,769
He's only shy.

257
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,489
Come and drink wine with us.

258
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:47,369
Serve the wine.

259
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,769
I don't feel well lately.

260
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,129
So I'll just drink water.

261
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,210
All right.

262
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,810
Cheers.

263
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,729
Sister-in-law.

264
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:05,009
Are you all right?

265
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,210
What's the matter?

266
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,690
Are you not well?

267
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:10,930
I'll send the physician here.

268
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,809
I'm all right.

269
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,089
Don't worry.

270
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:18,009
After the guests leave,

271
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,850
I have good news to tell you.

272
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,489
What good news?

273
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,890
Don't ask.

274
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,130
We'll have two good news.

275
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,009
All right.

276
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,009
It's fine with me.

277
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:28,970
You can help yourselves.

278
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,170
You can get back
to attending to your guests.

279
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,249
Official Lou and Madam Lou are
so loving.

280
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:37,410
That's right.

281
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,970
We're so envious.

282
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,930
Of course.

283
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:42,450
My brother made

284
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,370
this bronze mirror himself

285
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:45,610
and even carved the poem "Jian Jia"

286
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,610
in ten different handwriting fonts

287
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,329
for my sister-in-law.

288
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:48,769
(Ten different handwriting.)

289
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:55,009
Shao...

290
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,650
Young Madam Lou,

291
00:17:58,809 --> 00:17:59,650
sorry to bother you.

292
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,049
Can you show me the bronze mirror again?

293
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,690
Shaoshang,

294
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,009
I'm glad that you can come.

295
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,769
I was worried you won't come

296
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:12,930
because of your father.

297
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,970
How dare a guilty person come
and attend a banquet?

298
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,769
Sister-in-law, why did you invite her?

299
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:17,850
Don't you find it unlucky?

300
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,049
Young Madam Lou,

301
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,249
I know the bronze mirror is

302
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,249
a love token from Official Lou.

303
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,450
Can you show me?

304
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,329
Cheng Shaoshang, you've seen it before.

305
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:26,970
Why would you want to see it again?

306
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,089
Why not? It's only a bronze mirror.

307
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,690
When you and General Ling get married,

308
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,610
I'll have someone make one for you too.

309
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,130
Ling Buyi. Yuan Shanjian.

310
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:19,370
It's a joyous event

311
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,170
for the Lou Family today.

312
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:25,009
Leading the troops here
in such a manner.

313
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,049
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

314
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,089
I, Yuan Shen as the Attendant Gentleman
of the Ministry of Justice

315
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,610
came here under His Majesty's order

316
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:33,610
to capture

317
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,489
the suspect who killed Tongniu's
county magistrate and his family.

318
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:39,769
I hope Grand Tutor Lou can understand.

319
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,769
We have many guests at present.

320
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,650
General Ling, your action

321
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,329
will inevitably frighten them.

322
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,370
How about we speak elsewhere?

323
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,049
Lou Ben colluded
with Peng Kun's general, Ma Rong

324
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,610
to trick Tongniu's
County Magistrate Yan Zhong

325
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,130
to entrust the refined copper
and his family,

326
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,850
then slaughtered them all.

327
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,580
(Tongniu County)

328
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:36,329
After that, he pretended
to persuade Ma Rong to surrender

329
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,009
and put the blame

330
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,289
on Marquis Quling, Cheng Shi,

331
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,970
which killed three birds with one stone.

332
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,970
That's impossible.

333
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:49,809
It's impossible.

334
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,450
It's impossible.

335
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,009
Brother would never do such a thing.

336
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,930
General Ling, I can understand

337
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,489
if you want to purge
Cheng Family's sins.

338
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,930
But if you want
to convict me of a crime,

339
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:03,569
you can't just make a guess.

340
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,610
Can you show me your solid evidence?

341
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,049
You're efficient.

342
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,569
The people involved in this were

343
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,930
almost silenced.

344
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:12,450
Even Ma Rong...

345
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,370
Did I also kill Ma Rong?

346
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,850
Ma Rong died in public

347
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,930
at the hands of Peng Kun's remnants.

348
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:21,850
Ma Rong,

349
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,690
General Peng Kun was kind to you.

350
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,970
I can't believe you betray him
for glory.

351
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,610
Die!

352
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,610
Watch out!

353
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,890
Mr. Lou,

354
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,729
you have many friends.

355
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,529
You went to Shouchun many times
and associated with Ma Rong.

356
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,410
How could you not know
Ma Rong's deputy general was

357
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,170
Peng Kun's foster son?

358
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,809
You may not have killed him.

359
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,729
But you helped
by using someone else to kill him.

360
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:49,729
You...

361
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:50,970
Assassin!

362
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,610
Someone!

363
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:54,049
Someone!

364
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,249
Assassin!

365
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,049
Official Yuan,

366
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,809
do investigations depend
on makeup stories now?

367
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,049
Who says I have no solid evidence?

368
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,890
Even Official Li's wife risked
her life to leave clues.

369
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,769
Why would you believe

370
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:25,130
that Ma Rong took
no precautions against you?

371
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:27,329
We've found

372
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,289
the evidence.

373
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:59,089
General Ling found

374
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:01,130
the letters you had written

375
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,210
to Official Yan all this while
in the county office.

376
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,009
From the moment you were acquainted,

377
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,690
agreeing to meet,

378
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,130
inciting Yan Zhong

379
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,769
to bring his family
along with General Cheng

380
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,650
to transport the military funds
out of the city,

381
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:13,890
and even the appointed time
and location.

382
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,650
Everything is written here.

383
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,569
I'm guessing

384
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,610
you wanted Ma Rong

385
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,930
to destroy all these letters
after he entered the city.

386
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:23,289
But you didn't expect him

387
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,089
to keep these on purpose

388
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,170
in case he landed in trouble.

389
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:43,769
General Ling,

390
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,089
if you look at the letters
we sent each other,

391
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:48,249
these aren't my handwriting.

392
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:51,850
But I know Lou Ben's handwriting.

393
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:53,610
It's not his handwriting.

394
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,650
Don't even try

395
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,729
to frame me in this matter.

396
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:01,249
What about the love token
you gave your wife?

397
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,729
On the back

398
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,890
of this bronze mirror,

399
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,009
there are many kinds
of fonts carved by you.

400
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:10,089
I remembered
what Second Madam Lou told me.

401
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,329
My eldest son is good at calligraphy.

402
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:14,049
He even carved

403
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:15,289
the poem "Jian Jia"

404
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,089
with different fonts.

405
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,809
Whether there's

406
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:23,890
the same handwriting

407
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,249
with the letter,

408
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,850
I'm sure you know better

409
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,249
than me, Official Lou.

410
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,729
Dear.

411
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:38,970
Dear,

412
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,850
is everything they told the truth?

413
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,329
Yes.

414
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:07,450
It's true.

415
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,729
Mother.

416
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,450
Why did you do such a thing?

417
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,529
Do you really have

418
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,170
to make such a feat?

419
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,650
I did it because we're suppressed
by the First Chamber,

420
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:31,249
for Yao's family,

421
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,610
for our future,

422
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,690
and

423
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,769
for my ambition.

424
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:44,410
Yanji,

425
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,650
I have no face to see you now.

426
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,249
You're still young.

427
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,009
It's not too late for you to remarry.

428
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,410
What are you saying?

429
00:25:57,809 --> 00:25:59,249
Don't you know what you're saying is

430
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:00,930
the same as taking my life?

431
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:05,289
Do you know

432
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,450
taking your life equals

433
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,370
taking my life?

434
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,210
General Ling,

435
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,610
everyone hopes
to be born during peaceful times.

436
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:30,289
Only I hated that I wasn't born
a decade earlier.

437
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,249
A group of warlords rose together

438
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,930
and generals gathered that year.

439
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,729
With your talents
and choosing the right path,

440
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,529
you'd definitely guide the country

441
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,370
and accomplish great things.

442
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:52,970
I'd like

443
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,769
to thank you

444
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:56,650
for knowing me well.

445
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,249
I'm well aware of your ambition.

446
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,610
But climbing the ranks

447
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,089
step by step is

448
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,210
the right way to become
the pillars of the country.

449
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,410
But

450
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,690
you've gone astray.

451
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,410
I was born with this temperament

452
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,130
that I can't be placed
under someone else.

453
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:29,410
If you want me to start from the bottom

454
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:30,769
and let my ambition fritter away

455
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:33,289
because I can't speak my mind

456
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,610
and waste my time
in unproductive circles,

457
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,450
I would rather not serve
the royal court my whole life.

458
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,489
Why did you take such means?

459
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,009
The Lou Family is not

460
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,569
an unknown family.

461
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:49,089
You always take your time.

462
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:50,009
Uncle,

463
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,450
stop pretending already.

464
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,769
Everyone says you're loyal.

465
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:59,089
But everyone at home knows

466
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,089
of your dirty tricks.

467
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,650
General Ling had recommended
me many times.

468
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,569
He said that I'm a great talent
for handling political affairs,

469
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,890
and I should have a chance
to show my strength.

470
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:11,930
The Crown Prince

471
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,890
didn't appoint me

472
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,410
because you deliberately suppressed me.

473
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:19,370
My good uncle

474
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:20,610
declined the recommendation

475
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,809
of the Crown Prince modestly

476
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:23,890
by saying I was young

477
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,049
and I should gain more experience
before taking office.

478
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:31,410
You see.

479
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,930
It was my fault

480
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,970
for letting your aunt's incitement
influence me.

481
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,569
Stop blaming aunt!

482
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:39,769
How could a man

483
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:41,289
push all the dirty responsibilities

484
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:42,210
to a woman?

485
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,529
I can't believe you did that.

486
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,089
If you sincerely recommended me
to the court to be an official,

487
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,850
can aunt do anything to you?

488
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:51,610
In fact,

489
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,769
you were secretly hoping that your sons

490
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:55,130
to make their marks.

491
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:57,410
It's too bad those cousins of mine are

492
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,410
a bunch of fools.

493
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,769
You are afraid that I will suppress
your sons in the future

494
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,690
if I achieve great things.

495
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,410
That's why you've been hindering
the Second Chamber's future.

496
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,170
Isn't that so?

497
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,850
This is pure slander!

498
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,249
Between you two,

499
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,289
one is scheming,
the other is discontented.

500
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,410
You caused the massacre
of Yan Zhong's family

501
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,289
and wanted to use this

502
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,049
as a stepping stone
for promotion to an official career.

503
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,450
You even killed Ma Rong and Li Feng.

504
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,410
Tell me.

505
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,650
Where's my father now?

506
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,089
If you want to know,

507
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,690
we should talk in private.

508
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,569
What do you think?

509
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,130
(Map of the Fourteen States)

510
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,249
What's the meaning of this?

511
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,769
I only want to know where my father is.

512
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:31,700
(Map of the Fourteen States)

513
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:47,610
I've seen vast mountains, rivers,
people's lives, and starry skies.

514
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,049
I've drawn the map of the country.

515
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,610
Now, I'm giving it to you

516
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,850
to atone for my mistake.

517
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:57,970
I hope you'll be like me

518
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,970
so you'll be able to see the world

519
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,089
and not trap yourself.

520
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,089
This is the country's border map
I have personally drawn

521
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:09,529
after traveling around the world
for many years.

522
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,930
All of the officials in court want

523
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,009
to have this map.

524
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:18,729
It's indeed a valuable thing.

525
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,610
If you present it to His Majesty,

526
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,650
I'm sure he'll forgive you

527
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,170
and spare your life.

528
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,769
If it's hard to get what you want,

529
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,049
it'll be hard to lose it.

530
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,970
If it's easy to get,

531
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:36,650
it's easy to lose it.

532
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,489
The degree of difficulty

533
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,610
depends on you.

534
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,410
The cause is the effect.

535
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,610
The effect is the cause.

536
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,009
It's the same with me

537
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:49,890
and

538
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,410
also the same with you.

539
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:08,650
Misfortune has fallen upon our family.

540
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:10,690
It's a misfortune.

541
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,970
I thought the Second Chamber had made

542
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,329
great contributions out there.

543
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:16,769
I didn't expect you would do

544
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,049
such a shameful thing!

545
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,410
Just admit that you have no talent.

546
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,009
What's wrong with living comfortably
like your cousin?

547
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,769
Why did you have to implicate others?

548
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:27,289
The Second Chamber

549
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:28,729
had committed such a grave crime.

550
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,210
Will it implicate the whole family?

551
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,130
Shut up!

552
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:33,450
Mother!

553
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,249
If you dare to insult my husband
and my mother-in-law again,

554
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,569
I'll spill your blood!

555
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:38,529
You actually dared to... How dare you...

556
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,580
(Map of the Fourteen States)

557
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,329
Stop right there.

558
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,930
Don't come any closer.

559
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:40,529
You defiant child!

560
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:41,089
Dear!

561
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,610
You treacherous man!

562
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,529
It's a misfortune.

563
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,410
Misfortune on the family!

564
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,569
Master!

565
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,130
Bring Master back to his room.

566
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,329
Brother.

567
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,729
Misfortune!

568
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,249
Take her.

569
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,250
You're a smart person.

570
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:31,009
Between us,

571
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:33,770
there's no need to bring
everything to ruin.

572
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:36,089
Let Shaoshang go

573
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,770
and tell us where Cheng Shi is.

574
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:40,609
I'll plead to His Majesty

575
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,330
to lighten your sentence.

576
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:43,489
What?

577
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,410
Plead?

578
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,129
It's a funny thing to say.

579
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:00,890
Over the years,
I've traveled all over the world.

580
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,370
Everyone knows I'm a learned scholar.

581
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,970
Yet, they don't know my ambition is

582
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,529
to make a difference
by joining officialdom.

583
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:10,489
It's a pity

584
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,489
that the Crown Prince always follows
my uncle's advice.

585
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,129
I have such high aspirations

586
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,489
but it's not put into use.

587
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,850
Yuan Shanjian,

588
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:25,890
I'm so envious of you.

589
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:28,089
You have a place
at the Ministry of Justice

590
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,529
at such a young age.

591
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,009
I'm no less talented than you.

592
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,009
Yet, I have nowhere to go.

593
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,529
A hawk can't soar under the eaves.

594
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:43,089
The mythical beast Kun Peng can't swim
in shallow water.

595
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:45,290
Since I was young, I've always wanted
to join the officialdom.

596
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,730
But I never wanted
to end up in this situation.

597
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,450
But I have no control

598
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,410
over timing and fate.

599
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,970
Son,

600
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:02,730
why are you doing this?

601
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:06,370
Must you be an official?

602
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,689
Mother,

603
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:12,689
Aunt bullies you and humiliates you
over the years.

604
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:17,290
It wouldn't happen if I was an official.

605
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,569
I'm the eldest son.

606
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,169
I should accomplish great things
for my family.

607
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:23,850
I don't want Yao and my descendants

608
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,330
to suffer such inferiority
and walk on shells!

609
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,609
Brother,

610
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,850
I'm already married.

611
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,250
I'm a grown-up too.

612
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,890
I no longer need to be
under your protection anymore.

613
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,129
Brother,

614
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,169
you don't have to carry
all the burden yourself.

615
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,009
Let Shaoshang go.

616
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:43,450
General Ling always keeps his word.

617
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,450
He'll definitely plead
His Majesty for you.

618
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:46,330
Yao is right.

619
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,529
I'm part of the Lou Family now.

620
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,009
With the He Family's support,

621
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:50,970
you'll never suffer
such grievances anymore.

622
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:56,450
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

623
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,290
But if I'm not willing
to drag my wife into this,

624
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:05,489
why would I want
to borrow your family's power?

625
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:10,450
Yao.

626
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,930
Since you're an adult now,

627
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,770
so don't cry anymore.

628
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,250
The Lou Family still needs

629
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:19,730
you to support them in the future.

630
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:21,049
Dear,

631
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,649
stop while you can.

632
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,330
We can still turn back.

633
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:27,290
We can forget about fame and positions.

634
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:30,049
I only want to live with you. Can we?

635
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:31,529
Yanji,

636
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:34,689
I may not be able

637
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,569
to accompany you to the East Sea

638
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:39,529
to search for Penglai's paradise.

639
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:44,569
I'm sorry.

640
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:31,770
Listen to me.

641
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,730
Wake up.

642
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:33,569
You...

643
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,049
I'm carrying our child.

644
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,810
How could you be so ruthless?

645
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,209
Please don't do this.

646
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:43,209
Get up.

647
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,810
Wake up!

648
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:50,049
No!

649
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,209
Get out of my way!

650
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,810
Get up.

651
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,009
Dear.

652
00:39:00,649 --> 00:39:01,689
Dear.

653
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,569
Lou Ben took his life out of guilt.

654
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:08,290
We have to bring his body back
to the Ministry of Justice.

655
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:09,609
Young Madam Lou,

656
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:10,890
please forgive me.

657
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:12,169
Get lost!

658
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:14,609
You made him kill himself!

659
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,730
Now, you want to take him away.

660
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,089
No! Get away from him!

661
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:18,649
Go away!

662
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,810
Dear.

663
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:22,930
Dear.

664
00:39:24,689 --> 00:39:26,649
You killed him.

665
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:29,129
It's your fault!

666
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,450
(Map of the Fourteen States)

667
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,209
(If it's hard to get what you want,)

668
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,450
(it'll be hard to lose it.)

669
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,890
(If it's easy to get,)

670
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,009
(it's easy to lose it.)

671
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,730
(The degree of difficulty)

672
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:16,810
(depends on you.)

673
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:20,330
The cause is the effect.

674
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,129
The effect is

675
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,529
the cause.

676
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,569
Where's your horse?

677
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,410
Outside the residence.

What do you want to do?

679
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,370
I want to find my father.

680
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:33,970
Just now Lou Ben told me

681
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,810
that the cause is the effect
and the effect is the cause.

682
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:38,009
Since the cause is
the 2000 refined copper,

683
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,930
that means the effect is also
in Tongniu's mine.

684
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:41,890
I'm sure they locked my father there.

685
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:43,609
I want to go and find my father.
