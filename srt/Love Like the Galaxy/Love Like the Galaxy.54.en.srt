00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like The Galaxy=

2
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,620
=Episode 54=

3
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:46,854
I remember how I used to

4
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,094
make maltose candy for Her Majesty here.

5
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:52,893
When His Majesty found out about it,

6
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,453
he rewarded you.

7
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,213
At that time, I was really upset.

8
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,374
I told Her Majesty

9
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,613
that since I engaged to you,

10
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:07,173
everyone saw me as your fiancee.

11
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:10,493
No one saw me
as Cheng Shaoshang anymore.

12
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:13,694
Her Majesty said

13
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:17,694
that I was brought up as
an independent lady.

14
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,213
I only cared about myself,

15
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,094
my personal gains and losses.

16
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:27,134
She said I should try
to be more amenable.

17
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:29,574
She said

18
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,854
I should try to be more flexible.

19
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:36,974
I once hated you for leaving me behind.

20
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,213
I hated you for going your own way,

21
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,094
and the fact that
you would rather jump off the cliff

22
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:44,933
than walk by my side.

23
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:48,893
I hated how I showed you
my true feelings,

24
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,414
but you repaid it with lies.

25
00:03:58,173 --> 00:03:59,534
It's been five years.

26
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:06,453
It took me a lot of effort
to let go of our past.

27
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:13,974
It's impossible for me

28
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:17,773
to show you my true feelings again.

29
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,293
Neither can I trust you again.

30
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:31,093
Shaoshang,

31
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,054
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,174
Whatever your decision is,

33
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,773
I'll always respect it.

34
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,653
My days in the Northwest

35
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:01,574
were filled with regrets.

36
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,293
I understand how you felt.

37
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:12,494
I knew

38
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,134
that you were scared
of getting left behind.

39
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:21,374
Yet, I chose to hurt you

40
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:23,653
in the most painful way possible.

41
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:32,614
I spent the first 20 years of my life

42
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:38,374
with hatred,

43
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,494
and I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

44
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,213
with regrets.

45
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,333
If I'm given the chance again,

46
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:59,574
I'll do whatever I can
to prove to you my sincerity.

47
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,853
But I know

48
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,614
I no longer have the right
to do that for you.

49
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:06,893
I once told Her Majesty this.

50
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:09,574
If men are the proud sun,

51
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:11,174
lighting the earth,

52
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,213
then ladies

53
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,814
are the stars,

54
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:18,174
embellishing the night sky.

55
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:21,574
They're as important as each other,

56
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:23,934
and they have to coexist

57
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,174
to sustain the planet.

58
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:36,853
I'll take good care of myself.

59
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,614
After I deliver Her Majesty's crown
back to her homeland,

60
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:46,494
I will travel the world
to witness its vastness.

61
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:51,054
One will learn invaluable life lessons
through traveling.

62
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:54,814
And you will take
good care of yourself too,

63
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:57,254
right?

64
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:02,374
After I am done carrying out
the Land Distribution Order,

65
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,293
I'll return to the Northwest

66
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:11,254
to guard the country's border again.

67
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,413
I wish to keep protecting
the beautiful galaxy on earth.

68
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,334
I'll take good care of myself,

69
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:42,533
and live a good life.

70
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,094
Her Majesty loved
the beautiful autumn season the most.

71
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,173
Young Lady, please stop grieving.

72
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:55,693
It's been 49 days
since Empress Xuan's passing.

73
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,134
She would worry about you

74
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:00,374
if you keep mourning her death.

75
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,933
It was just casual chatter.

76
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,653
I spent years with Her Majesty

77
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:11,094
and I knew her health condition
very well.

78
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,974
It was a chronic illness,

79
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:18,053
and I knew this would happen
sooner or later.

80
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:24,374
Fortunately,

81
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,454
her death was peaceful

82
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:31,214
and painless.

83
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,374
Seeing that

84
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,454
put me at ease.

85
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:47,813
Niaoniao.

86
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:52,374
Niaoniao.

87
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:55,134
I made your favorite sweet cake.

88
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:58,173
Let's taste it together.

89
00:11:58,773 --> 00:11:59,533
Let's go.

90
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:08,693
Here.

91
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:09,734
Have a taste.

92
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:27,974
What do you think?

93
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,293
Forget it.

94
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:41,813
I know I'll never be a good cook.

95
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,813
Dear, why are you being so harsh
on yourself again?

96
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:48,893
Niaoniao hasn't even said anything
about the food yet.

97
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:55,614
Good girl, Niaoniao.

98
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:57,254
What a good girl, Niaoniao.

99
00:12:57,454 --> 00:12:58,614
I woke up at dawn

100
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:00,933
just to make this for you myself.

101
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,773
Have some more.

102
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:05,374
Dear.

103
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,214
You should scold her.

104
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:09,854
You look more intimidating
when you're being so gentle.

105
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:10,773
General.

106
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,334
That's nonsense.

107
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,214
I don't mind putting up a facade forever

108
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,494
as long as it can make Niaoniao happy.

109
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,094
We spent 15 years

110
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,134
away from home.

111
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:31,134
I didn't even get to do this to her.

112
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:34,334
Then, Niaoniao moved to the palace

113
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,773
and stayed there
for the next five years.

114
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,053
I lost my chance to do this to her.

115
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:44,173
Niaoniao.

116
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,533
Just let me do this for you.

117
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:48,893
Please don't mock me

118
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:50,933
if one day I lose the ability
to keep doing this.

119
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:05,813
Niaoniao,

120
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:09,933
it was my fault.

121
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,734
After all, it was also my first time

122
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:17,214
being the mother of a lady.

123
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:20,334
I didn't know that raising a daughter

124
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,214
was so different from leading a troop.

125
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,773
I also didn't know

126
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:26,454
that daughters were
so different from sons.

127
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,014
I want to change,

128
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,653
but you're growing too fast.

129
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:39,334
I don't have enough time
to figure out how to make the changes.

130
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:43,014
I made a mistake,

131
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:44,214
Niaoniao.

132
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:46,974
If I were given another chance,

133
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,173
I would never leave you behind again.

134
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:54,533
Even if it would put both of us at risk,

135
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,494
I would keep you by my side too.

136
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:01,413
We're a family and we'll go through
all challenges together.

137
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,454
Your mother is right.

138
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,494
If we were given a chance again,

139
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:11,053
I would stand up against
your Grandmother and Madam Ge,

140
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:13,254
and insist on keeping you by my side.

141
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:18,014
General.

142
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:20,653
Do you really dare

143
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,533
stand up against Old Madam?

144
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:23,374
Of course.

145
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,053
Then, why don't you send these snacks

146
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,254
to Old Madam?

147
00:15:26,614 --> 00:15:27,933
Besides, you can also inform
Old Madam

148
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,214
that you're going to the State of Yu

149
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:31,854
to settle the civil disturbance
caused by the Land Distribution Order.

150
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:33,413
Let's see if Old Madam

151
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:35,773
will make a fuss out of it.

152
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,334
What's the point of bringing this up?

153
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,053
What if she decides to stand in my way?

154
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,813
There're only two people

155
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:44,334
I'm ever worried about.

156
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:45,334
No.

157
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,374
Three.

158
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:49,813
My mother,

159
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:52,094
Niaoniao,

160
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,614
and you.

161
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:58,494
Father.

162
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,293
Who's the worst?

163
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:03,693
Of course,

164
00:16:08,854 --> 00:16:10,173
it's your mother.

165
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,374
Let me send the snacks

166
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,014
to my grandmother.

167
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:11,053
Gods and Goddesses,

168
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:12,494
please

169
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,293
bless Zhi.

170
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,654
Please wish him a smooth journey ahead.

171
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,214
I gave birth to Zhi

172
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,414
at the best time.

173
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:37,734
That day,

174
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,773
the clouds in the sky

175
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:43,813
were first in the shape of a dragon,

176
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,613
then changed into the shape of a tiger.

177
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:46,454
That's right.

178
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:50,293
Third Master was a county magistrate,
and is now a provincial officer.

179
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:51,773
Soon,

180
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:54,974
he'll be posted to the capital
and get appointed as the great minister.

181
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,174
Zhi is really fortunate.

182
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:00,494
I did a good job

183
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:03,174
giving birth to him at the right time.

184
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,214
The Old Deity said

185
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:07,654
that Zhi...

186
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,773
Old Madam,

187
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:10,573
stop bringing up that man.

188
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,654
He made a mistake
during the fortune-telling

189
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:15,014
and forced Fourth Lady to stay behind.

190
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:17,773
That eventually sowed the discord
between Fourth Lady and First Madam.

191
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:20,454
They suffered for many years
because of him.

192
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:28,813
Is Grandmother eating well?

193
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:31,773
Young Lady, you stayed in the palace
during the past five years.

194
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,813
Now, you're finally back home.

195
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,613
Although Old Madam
didn't say it out loud,

196
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:37,133
deep down, she is very happy about it.

197
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:40,734
Back then,

198
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,533
I was blinded
by all the lies they told me.

199
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,894
I listened to Madam Ge's words

200
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:49,293
and all I wanted

201
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:53,293
was to manipulate Shi and his wife.

202
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:58,254
I caused so much trouble for Niaoniao.

203
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,414
If I got to do this

204
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:03,773
all over again,

205
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:08,414
I'd definitely take good care
of Niaoniao.

206
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:11,053
I would take very good care of her.

207
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:13,454
She's my granddaughter.

208
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:17,214
Niaoniao can marry

209
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:19,773
whoever she wants in the future.

210
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:21,254
It's fine even
if she wants to stay single.

211
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,293
I've told Shi about this.

212
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,053
I'll leave all my money and my jewelry

213
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,174
to Niaoniao

214
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:34,373
after I pass away.

215
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:37,894
Even if she is to stay single forever,

216
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,613
she'll have something to back her up.

217
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,014
That's enough, Old Madam.

218
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,293
That's enough.

219
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:47,494
That's enough.

220
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:50,494
I owe her a lot.

221
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:11,133
Lianfang.

222
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,533
Do you still remember

223
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,694
how I fell really ill

224
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:18,533
when we were living in the small hut
in the countryside?

225
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:21,813
If it weren't for you

226
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,934
who took really good care of me,

227
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,014
I would've lost my life

228
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,613
a long time ago.

229
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:31,934
It's destined that Young Lady
will live a long and healthy life.

230
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,494
You're always blessed with good luck.

231
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:35,734
Lianfang dare not take credit for that.

232
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:44,053
Back then, I had no idea what my parents

233
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:45,494
and my brothers

234
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,133
were like.

235
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,734
You were the only one

236
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:51,773
I could trust.

237
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,454
Those are all in the past.

238
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:58,454
Now, Master, First Madam,
and Young Masters

239
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:00,214
dote on Young Lady.

240
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:05,214
What happened in the past few years
feels like a dream to me.

241
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,254
In the past month,

242
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:11,934
I've been wondering

243
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:15,494
if I'll wake up

244
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,734
from this dream.

245
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:21,214
Young Lady, you must be really tired.

246
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:23,214
You took a long nap

247
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:25,053
and are probably feeling
a little confused.

248
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,813
In fact, I really want to reconcile
with my grandmother too.

249
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:50,214
I just find it very difficult
to bond with her.

250
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,894
Perhaps I'm still holding grudges
against her

251
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:55,133
for what she did to separate
me and my parents during those years.

252
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:57,694
I probably still blame her
for what happened.

253
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,133
Because of her, in that 15 years,

254
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:02,093
I haven't felt care and love

255
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:04,894
from my own family.

256
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,093
However, when the Cheng Family
was in a dire situation,

257
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,053
she came forward to help us

258
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:17,773
and tried her best to be my family.

259
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:22,654
However,

260
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,454
I still have no idea how to face her.

261
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:27,373
Young Lady, you've been through so much.

262
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:30,214
It makes sense that you find it
difficult to iron out your differences.

263
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:34,853
My mother used to say

264
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,133
that I was stubborn.

265
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:40,093
I didn't agree with her.

266
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,254
Now, I have realized
what she said was true.

267
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,414
First Madam has...

268
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:46,773
Lianfang.

269
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,093
You've said enough.

270
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,133
I understand
where my mother is coming from.

271
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,613
From now on,

272
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:58,694
I'll move on from the past.

273
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:01,254
I won't get bothered

274
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:03,373
by people who hate me

275
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:05,894
and dislike me.

276
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,333
Instead,

277
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,333
I'll always remember

278
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:13,174
the people who like me

279
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,573
and take good care of me.

280
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:20,694
When I'm reminded of them,

281
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:26,293
I'll have the courage to keep living.

282
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,494
We should always

283
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,414
look on the bright side.

284
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:45,174
There's still a long way to go.

285
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:51,214
This is what I should do
to live a good life.

286
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,293
I'm leaving tomorrow.

287
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,414
I'm here today

288
00:25:23,853 --> 00:25:24,654
to bid farewell.

289
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:27,293
I'm going to meet His Majesty

290
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:28,734
to inform him
about my departure as well.

291
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:31,613
To save my blood brother

292
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:33,813
two years ago,

293
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:36,613
my father jeopardized General Weng,
the head of the Army of Conquest.

294
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:38,813
Even death cannot atone for his offence.

295
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:41,014
To save my father,

296
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:43,014
Huo Buyi led his soldiers there
to help my father.

297
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:45,533
He almost lost his life because of that.

298
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:47,894
Thankfully, His Majesty was merciful.

299
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,613
His Majesty only removed my father
from his official position,

300
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,773
and sent my parents to Jiaodong
to receive their punishments.

301
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:52,894
On the other hand,

302
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:55,254
I'm also asking His Majesty
to post me to the countryside,

303
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:57,414
so that I can work on
the Land Distribution Order.

304
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,734
How are Official Yuan
and Madam Yuan doing?

305
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,773
They are better than ever.

306
00:26:06,414 --> 00:26:08,853
My father thought he had brought shame
to the Yuan Family.

307
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:10,414
He fell ill soon after that.

308
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:13,214
Since then, my mother has been
taking care of him.

309
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,694
She wishes to return to the hometown
together with my father.

310
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:17,654
I guess

311
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,573
that's a happy ending for them.

312
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:21,373
However,

313
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,293
they were still worried
about our marriage arrangement

314
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,214
before they left for the countryside.

315
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:38,773
Sorry, Yuan Shanjian.

316
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:41,214
In the end,

317
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:44,613
I still couldn't give you
what you asked for.

318
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,133
I have always expected this

319
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,734
to happen.

320
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:55,613
Don't worry about me.

321
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,414
I'll be appointed as one of
the most important officials in the future.

322
00:27:00,014 --> 00:27:01,333
All my descendants

323
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:03,093
will reach a high rank.

324
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:05,654
We will all be the officials
of the government,

325
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,853
and the Yuan Family will prosper.

326
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:10,694
What a pity.

327
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,734
You won't get to be

328
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,654
the wife of one of the most important officials.

329
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:18,654
I'm sure there's someone out there

330
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:20,333
who deserves this position
more than I do.

331
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:24,414
Shaoshang.

332
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,813
I always knew

333
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:32,093
that I would lose this game.

334
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:34,894
Although I lost,

335
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:36,494
I have no regrets.

336
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,014
Yes.

337
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:40,293
I lost the game,

338
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,894
but Huo Buyi didn't win,

339
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:44,813
right?

340
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:50,934
Over these years,

341
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:54,014
I've been waiting for you
to come to me.

342
00:27:58,533 --> 00:27:59,613
But this time,

343
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,654
I hope that you can leave
before I do.

344
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:07,894
Don't look back.

345
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,494
Otherwise,

346
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:14,133
I might regret my decision
to let you go with him.

347
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:30,573
Young Lady.

348
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:33,014
How have you been doing?

349
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:47,533
I know what's on your mind,

350
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:54,333
but I can't give you what you want.

351
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:09,974
Have you made up your mind?

352
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:14,773
I have.

353
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,093
You almost lost your life
while you were trying to save my father.

354
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:21,853
It'd be very shameless of me

355
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:23,734
if I were to keep fighting with you.

356
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:26,093
His Majesty is now pushing
the Land Distribution Order

357
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:28,813
at all the provinces.

358
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:32,533
I'll have to visit the states personally

359
00:30:32,934 --> 00:30:34,454
to keep an eye on the progress
of the Land Distribution Order.

360
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,494
Hopefully, what I do can contribute
to the development of the nation.

361
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,053
Then, I'll return to the capital again.

362
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:41,254
What about you?

363
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:43,773
I'm working on
the Land Distribution Order as well.

364
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,053
His Majesty has ordered the construction

365
00:30:46,254 --> 00:30:48,174
of the Prime Minister's Camp
at the State of Yu.

366
00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:49,533
I worry that there are still traitors

367
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,214
who wish to harm His Majesty.

368
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,573
I'm planning to go there

369
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,214
to back the Crown Prince up.

370
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:58,093
If I remember it correctly,

371
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:00,333
this is supposed to be
General Cheng's duty.

372
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:02,934
You're such a good son-in-law.

373
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:04,853
You are going to the battlefield
on your father-in-law's behalf.

374
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,133
But there's something
I don't quite get.

375
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,373
You helped Cheng Song kill
the traitors in Shu

376
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,573
because he's Shaoshang's
elder brother.

377
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:16,414
You escorted the Crown Prince to
the country on General Cheng's behalf

378
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,494
because he is Shaoshang's father.

379
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:20,974
It's something you should do.

380
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:26,853
However, why did you decide
to help us, the Yuan Family?

381
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:32,533
After all,

382
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,174
I still can't get over

383
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:36,533
Shaoshang.

384
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,174
You're still my love rival.

385
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:45,014
Other than your own family,

386
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:50,974
I'm the one who cares for you the most

387
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,533
across the capital.

388
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,813
It's true.

389
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:04,734
Be it in the past,

390
00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:06,974
or in the future,

391
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,494
Shaoshang won't be able to
put her mind at ease

392
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:12,214
if you don't do well.

393
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:16,894
Just like how I didn't get upset

394
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:21,454
when she nominated Lou Yao.

395
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:23,573
Although she appears cold
on the outside,

396
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:26,333
she has always been
a very caring person.

397
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:30,133
She can only put her mind at ease,

398
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:32,214
when those she cares for are doing well.

399
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,174
That's why I want to make sure
all of you are doing well.

400
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:40,694
Only then will she be able

401
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:46,093
to set her mind at rest.

402
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:51,934
I've always thought

403
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:54,373
that it's not a good thing
to get too invested in a relationship.

404
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:56,533
Because of the uncontrollable emotions,

405
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,214
my father felt dejected,

406
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,373
my mother lived her life in agony,

407
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:04,894
and I had no parents to protect me

408
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,934
when I was a kid.

409
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:09,573
I was left on my own.

410
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:14,934
Yet,

411
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:17,934
you take these feelings
more seriously than I do.

412
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:19,813
You're more foolish than I am.

413
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:22,894
That's why
you're more worthy of her love.

414
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:30,694
I wish

415
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:33,533
that the guy who eventually gets to stay
by her side

416
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,333
is the one who treats her the best.

417
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,093
It's only a dozen miles away
from Hua County.

418
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:24,133
Do you want to pay Lou Yao a visit?

419
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:31,693
Yao is a very generous guy.

420
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,253
He puts the people
before everything else.

421
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:35,974
Now that he's been appointed
as the county magistrate,

422
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:38,573
I'm sure he will manage Hua County
really well.

423
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,573
It's nice seeing how well
he and He Zhaojun are doing.

424
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:46,253
I think I should leave them alone.

425
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:03,133
Stop!

426
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:08,053
Lady Cheng.

427
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:09,974
A young lady is asking to see you.

428
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,414
Lady Cheng.

429
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:27,894
It's been a while.

430
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:31,014
Lou Li.

431
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,014
Yao heard
that you were passing by this area,

432
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:37,173
and he sent me here to invite you
to Hua County for a meal.

433
00:35:38,173 --> 00:35:39,294
Thanks for the invitation.

434
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:42,053
I'm delivering the Empress's crown
back to her homeland.

435
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:43,733
It's not that convenient
for me to drop by.

436
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:47,494
Yao sent me here,

437
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:49,414
hoping that his old friend

438
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,974
can take a look at how Hua County
has flourished.

439
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:52,814
He wants to tell you

440
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,014
that Hua County is no longer
the shabby place you once knew.

441
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,294
The people of the county
are living a peaceful and happy life.

442
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:57,894
No one can separate the families again.

443
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,014
Unfortunately, Zhaojun's
pregnancy is due soon,

444
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:01,093
and he can't excuse himself.

445
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,894
Otherwise, he'd be here
to invite you over personally.

446
00:36:03,814 --> 00:36:04,774
Lady Cheng,

447
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,613
are you really not going to drop by?

448
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,454
Go ahead.

449
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:21,334
All right.

450
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:22,934
I'll come with you.

451
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:29,814
Zhaojun's pregnancy is due soon.

452
00:36:30,494 --> 00:36:32,774
Yet, you're carrying
the late Empress's belongings with you.

453
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:34,414
I'm afraid...

454
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:40,774
Shaogong.

455
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,653
You should stay here
and keep an eye on the items.

456
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:44,974
I'll be right back after dinner.

457
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,294
Sure.

458
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:53,573
I'll come with you.

459
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,220
(Posthouse of Hua County)

460
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:28,374
Lady Lou,

461
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,133
your attire...

462
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:35,093
Some time ago,

463
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:37,974
my parents were dead
back at home.

464
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:41,093
I'm still mourning their death.

465
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,053
Please forgive me, Lady Cheng.

466
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:45,814
Lady Cheng.

467
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:47,374
This way, please.

468
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:56,053
It seems like
there are lesser bodyguards

469
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,093
guarding the city than before.

470
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:01,573
His Majesty implemented the Land
Distribution Order at the State of Yu.

471
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:03,814
Many villages nearby are interested
in the new law.

472
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:06,213
Yuan Shanjian has been patrolling
the border of the city.

473
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:07,133
Lou Yao

474
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,213
has dispatched his guards there
to back him up.

475
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:11,213
That's why we don't have many men left

476
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:12,693
in the county office.

477
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:16,133
Why?

478
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:18,093
Has Lady Cheng gotten used to

479
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:19,733
being surrounded by your servants?

480
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:21,974
Are you feeling uneasy

481
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:23,014
because we don't have
enough servants here?

482
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:43,374
Come at me.

483
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:22,974
Tell me now.

484
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,213
Who sent you here?

485
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,653
He was carrying poison in his mouth,
and he's dead.

486
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:45,494
Search the place.

487
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:46,253
Yes.

488
00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:47,653
Come with me.

489
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:48,613
Yes.

490
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:54,733
I didn't expect Shaoshang's
unannounced visit.

491
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:55,894
Please forgive me
for the lack of hospitality.

492
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,093
I met Lady Cheng on my way home,

493
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:04,294
and it hit me that it's been a while
since you last met.

494
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:06,133
Therefore, I invited her over
for a meal.

495
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:08,294
Yao.

496
00:42:08,974 --> 00:42:10,014
Zhaojun.

497
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:11,733
You won't be upset by what I did, right?

498
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:13,454
Of course, not.

499
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:16,414
Shaoshang.

500
00:42:16,974 --> 00:42:19,053
Something happened to Lou Li's family
over the past few years.

501
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:21,334
Please don't take her words

502
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,894
to heart.

503
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:29,253
On my way here,

504
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:30,653
I can tell

505
00:42:30,894 --> 00:42:32,613
that Yao and Zhaojun

506
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:34,053
have managed Hua County really well.

507
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:35,533
The street looks much busier

508
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:38,093
than before.

509
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:41,294
I learned many tips from you

510
00:42:41,414 --> 00:42:43,014
on how to build houses.

511
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:48,414
Shaoshang,

512
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,653
I'm so sorry.

513
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:53,014
I shouldn't have vented my anger on you

514
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:54,053
when my brother committed suicide.

515
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:55,974
However, at that time,

516
00:42:57,014 --> 00:42:58,454
I had no news about Yanji.

517
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:00,974
I was too nervous, so...

518
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,414
The Lou Family used to be
a reputable family.

519
00:43:07,774 --> 00:43:09,573
Look at what we've become now.

520
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:11,053
We can only blame it on the person

521
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:13,334
who took the Lou Family
as a stepping stone.

522
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:15,414
All she wanted was a bright future
for herself.

523
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:16,454
Lou Li.

524
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:18,014
The Lou Family only ended up like this

525
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:20,053
because Lou Ben made a mistake.

526
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:21,334
We can't put the blame on someone else.

527
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:26,573
Let's eat.

528
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:42,014
This seat is for...

529
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:43,894
That's for...

530
00:43:43,894 --> 00:43:44,814
Lady Cheng.

531
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:49,733
This buttermilk is rare in Hua County.

532
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,573
Give it a good taste.

533
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:01,334
Thank you.

534
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:50,173
Zhaojun.

535
00:44:52,053 --> 00:44:53,653
Zhaojun, what's the matter?

536
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:57,014
Yao, my belly hurts.

537
00:44:57,934 --> 00:44:59,053
I might be going into labor.

538
00:44:59,414 --> 00:45:01,294
Didn't the physician say
the due date was a month from now?

539
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:02,253
Why is this happening?

540
00:45:02,253 --> 00:45:04,533
The only female physician in Hua County
who can help now is Madam Chen.

541
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:05,253
However, I heard

542
00:45:05,253 --> 00:45:07,133
that she has gone to
Qing County with her husband

543
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,294
to visit their relatives.

544
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,774
I'm going to get her now.

545
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:12,093
Zhaojun, hang in there.

546
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:14,093
Li, I'll leave this to you.

547
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:15,133
You can count on me.

548
00:45:15,454 --> 00:45:17,334
I'll be back really soon.

549
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:20,414
Someone send Zhaojun

550
00:45:20,414 --> 00:45:22,173
to the family temple.
It's more spacious there.

551
00:45:25,253 --> 00:45:27,053
Lady Cheng, you're a woman too.

552
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:28,173
Please help us.

553
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:33,053
I know that you weren't on good terms
with Zhaojun,

554
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:34,294
but please do this for Yao.

555
00:45:34,294 --> 00:45:35,294
Please help her.

556
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,133
I can't hold on any longer.

557
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:42,053
Sure.

558
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:43,133
We found something,

559
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,213
Young Master.

560
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:45,974
We searched the place

561
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:47,053
and found tens of corpses

562
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:48,613
abandoned in the drains nearby.

563
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:50,374
Some of them were wearing the armors
that belong to the guards of Hua County,

564
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:51,374
while some of them...

565
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:56,934
Judging from their attire,

566
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:58,894
they seem to be the household troops who
served the residence of Official Yuan.

567
00:46:06,173 --> 00:46:07,294
Black Armored Guard.

568
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:08,173
-Yes.
-Yes.

569
00:46:08,454 --> 00:46:10,133
Follow me to Hua County now.

570
00:46:10,693 --> 00:46:11,613
-Yes.
-Yes.

571
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,340
(Temple)

572
00:46:25,053 --> 00:46:25,894
Get in there.

573
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:29,693
Let's go. Be careful.

574
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,370
(Learn From The Great Man)

575
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:37,533
(Learn From The Great Man)
Why is there a family temple in the county office?

576
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:39,454
Is anyone cultivating here?

577
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:46,894
You're dismissed.

578
00:46:46,894 --> 00:46:47,894
Close the door
when you're on your way out.

579
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,133
Yes.
