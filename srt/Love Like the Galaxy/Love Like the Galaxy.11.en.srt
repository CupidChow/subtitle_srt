3
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,068
Niaoniao is indeed strong-minded.

4
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,068
She didn't make a sound

5
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,549
when she was punished.

6
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,549
It's a pity that she's a lady.
If she were a man,

7
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,349
she'll achieve great accomplishments.

8
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,989
I've examined Niaoniao's injuries.

9
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,269
They're all bruises
without any flesh wounds.

10
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:50,989
The degrees of swelling
and bruising aren't serious either.

11
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:52,749
So

12
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:54,989
Sister-in-law didn't really put
much strength into it.

13
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,549
She followed Elder Brother
to every battle expedition.

14
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,588
If she truly meant to punish Niaoniao,

15
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,308
would Niaoniao even be alive?

16
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,029
Both mother and daughter

17
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,749
are sure stubborn.

18
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:13,989
Sir. Madam.

19
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:16,068
There's a riding man following us.

20
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,389
It's Grand Tutor Lou's nephew.

21
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:19,549
His name is Lou Yao.

22
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:20,708
He wants to meet Young Lady.

23
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:26,068
Stop the carriage.

24
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:27,349
Stop the carriage!

25
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:47,148
I'm Lou Yao, paying my respect to you,
Official Cheng.

26
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:48,389
Mr. Lou,

27
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:50,068
what are you...

28
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:52,988
I've met Miss Shaoshang
on several occasions.

29
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:54,709
I truly admire her character.

30
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:57,548
I heard she'll be following you
to Hua County.

31
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,749
So I want to follow along,

32
00:03:58,869 --> 00:04:00,788
hoping I can keep
Miss Shaoshang safe along the way.

33
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,189
Mr. Lou, look around you.

34
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,508
There are many
of us traveling together here.

35
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,149
We can keep Shaoshang safe ourselves.

36
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:07,589
So, no need to trouble you, Mr. Lou.

37
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,068
Besides, we heard you just broke off

38
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,189
your engagement with the He Family.

39
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:12,309
If you tag along with Shaoshang,

40
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:13,869
it might cause a misunderstanding.

41
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,149
I conduct myself properly,
so I have a clear conscience.

42
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,228
Mr. Lou,

43
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:19,828
can I speak to you in private?

44
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,948
What's the reason
for you coming with us?

45
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:41,388
I...

46
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,388
I wanted to say you're good.

47
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:46,309
That day,

48
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:48,429
you did nothing wrong
by making them fall off the bridge.

49
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,189
I sincerely admire you.

50
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,668
What nonsense are you talking about?

51
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:03,508
I happened to pass by

52
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,508
and saw you sneakily remove the wood.

53
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,668
Don't worry.
I didn't tell anyone about this.

54
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,469
Mr. Lou,

55
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:12,668
to tell you the truth.

56
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,149
I didn't leave home because I was ill.

57
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,948
My mother expelled me from the capital

58
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,029
after she punished me
under military paddle punishment.

59
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,469
Such punishment was already too much
for me to handle.

60
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,149
What else do you want, Mr. Lou?

61
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:24,668
Miss Shaoshang, you've misunderstood me.

62
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:26,149
I'm not holding you accountable.

63
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:28,548
Wang Ling deserved it
in the first place.

64
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,108
You shouldn't be punished severely.

65
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,068
Say no more.

66
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,828
If there's nothing else,

67
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,268
we shall bid each other goodbye here.

68
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,749
Miss Shaoshang.

69
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:37,149
If you didn't stop me

70
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:38,548
that day,

71
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,068
I would have fallen off the bridge too.

72
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:43,029
This is who I am.

73
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,709
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

74
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:45,909
If it weren't for you,

75
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:47,189
I'd do the same.

76
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:48,349
I would never involve innocent people.

77
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,068
Miss Shaoshang,
you indeed have a kind heart.

78
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,228
You draw a line between love and hate.

79
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,149
It's the first time

80
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:54,309
for me to meet

81
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,589
someone like you in my life.

82
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:56,869
At the Lantern Festival,

83
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:58,749
you were defensive of me too.

84
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,788
You've mistaken.

85
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:00,668
I just find

86
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,308
your fiancée too overbearing.

87
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,909
So I only wanted
to help you teach her a lesson.

88
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,628
She's no longer my fiancée.

89
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,868
I've broken off my engagement
with He Zhaojun.

90
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,509
So I don't have
a marriage prospect for now.

91
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:11,868
What does it matter to me

92
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,909
whether you have
a marriage prospect or not?

93
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,308
I just don't want you to misunderstand.

94
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:18,988
He Zhaojun will marry

95
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,349
into Lord Yong's Mansion next month.

96
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:21,829
It doesn't concern me

97
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,509
whether He Zhaojun is marrying
into Lord Yong's Family.

98
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,349
Mr. Lou,

99
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,428
you can't blame me

100
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:27,149
that your engagement was broken off.

101
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:27,868
Yes,

102
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,149
I indeed got entangled
with you and your fiancée.

103
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,349
But you can't come and pester me.

104
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:34,349
I've never spoken
anything bad about you.

105
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:35,308
I never did.

106
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,269
But you can't threaten me

107
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:39,909
with my misdeed.

108
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:42,149
No, it's not like that.

109
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,949
Miss Shaoshang, you got it wrong again.

110
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,308
I just feel we're like old friends

111
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,909
when we first met.

112
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,548
I can't forget you
after meeting you again.

113
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,269
So

114
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:52,748
I came to follow you.

115
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,428
I didn't misunderstand anything.

116
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:03,469
But you did.

117
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,509
For you...

118
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,589
I...

119
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,108
Farewell.

120
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:11,469
Fudeng!

121
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,069
Fudeng!

122
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,188
Yes, Young Lady.

123
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:16,668
Let's make a move.

124
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:18,709
Miss Shaoshang.

125
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:21,868
Mr. Lou.

126
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,589
Set out!

127
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,349
Miss Shaoshang.

128
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,108
(Even if I misunderstood,)

129
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,228
(I truly like you.)

130
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,748
(It's just that you have
no feelings for me.)

131
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:03,548
(No.)

132
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:04,308
(Lou Yao,)

133
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:06,829
(didn't you admire her courage)

134
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,228
(and tenacity?)

135
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,149
(How can you easily give up)

136
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:11,428
(before fighting for her?)

137
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:53,868
Madam.

138
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:04,949
Niaoniao.

139
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:19,709
Fudeng.

140
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:24,149
Yes, Sir?

141
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,628
Give this to Mr. Lou.

142
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,269
Mr. Lou.

143
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,268
Let's rest here.

144
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,549
Everyone, get some rest!

145
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,268
My dear, watch your steps.

146
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:49,429
Third Aunt!

147
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:51,189
Yes, Niaoniao.

148
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,908
Dear, are you hungry or tired?

149
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,028
I've prepared buttermilk
and some snacks for you.

150
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,709
Maybe you were tired from the journey

151
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:58,309
that you lost your appetite.

152
00:10:58,628 --> 00:10:59,628
Let me help you.

153
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,069
You must be tired too.

154
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:08,669
Have some snacks.

155
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:34,549
Dear,

156
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,789
the sun is blazing hot.

157
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,309
Let me shade you.

158
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,748
Enough already.

159
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:45,908
Niaoniao's upset because of your behavior.

160
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,709
You must be tired from the journey too.

161
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,108
Go and get some rest.

162
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:50,189
Dear,

163
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,469
you've suffered a lot for me
because of Mother.

164
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,829
It's only right that I repay you
for your sacrifice.

165
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:56,429
Dear,

166
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:58,908
you only cherish me
when we are away from home.

167
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:00,549
Every time we return home to visit Mother,

168
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,469
you'll shirk like a rat sees a cat.

169
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:03,669
One is my mother,

170
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,228
and the other one is my wife.

171
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:07,228
Both of you are the cats.

172
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,189
I'm the only rat.

173
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:12,148
A rat, like Third Uncle should have left

174
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,628
the house earlier.

175
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:16,268
That way, he can be played
by one cat all day long.

176
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,868
Shaoshang,

177
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:29,908
the weather is awfully hot.

178
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,069
Let me shelter you from the heat.

179
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,669
I wanted to prepare some food for you.

180
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:38,349
But I didn't have enough time
because I left in a hurry.

181
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:55,589
Shaoshang.

182
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:05,028
Shaoshang.

183
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:16,709
During this peaceful time,
there are more cats than rats.

184
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,469
Only he is like me

185
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,508
who's willing to play with one cat.

186
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:22,469
Enough.

187
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,829
Why don't you ask Mr. Lou

188
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:26,549
what is it that he wants?

189
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:27,949
As you wish.

190
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:32,469
Dear, be careful.

191
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:35,189
Mr. Lou,

192
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,429
can I speak to you?

193
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:43,908
You've been following us
for several days now.

194
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,508
What exactly are you after?

195
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:47,069
Official Cheng,

196
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:50,349
I feel a sense of closeness
when I first saw her.

197
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,228
She may ignore me now.

198
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,748
But to me,

199
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,228
she's different from other ladies.

200
00:13:58,388 --> 00:13:59,108
Official Cheng,

201
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:00,228
what do you think

202
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:01,829
I should do?

203
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,028
Don't worry.

204
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:09,669
I'll ask your uncle to send him away.

205
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:11,549
Niaoniao,

206
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,268
there's an empty hunting lodge
at the top of the mountain.

207
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,189
It was a temporary camp for the army
while they were on the march.

208
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,549
Do you want to take a look?

209
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:23,549
Shaoshang,

210
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:28,868
my elder brother used to travel around
in his early years.

211
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:30,349
He had been to Qing County
and Hua County.

212
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,189
He also drew a topographic map himself.

213
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:34,669
I knew we were going
to pass by this area.

214
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,069
So I stole his map.

215
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:37,748
I can be your guide.

216
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:41,148
It's all right.
I don't want to go anywhere.

217
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,069
Shaoshang,

218
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,189
Mr. Lou likes you

219
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,388
and he's very attentive to you.

220
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,949
Since Niaoniao has no feelings for him,

221
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,628
why don't you use your wisdom and talent

222
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,228
to send Mr. Lou away?

223
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:10,789
I understand.

224
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:12,868
Thank you, Third Uncle.

225
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:14,949
Come with me.

226
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:21,349
Sit.

227
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:31,949
What I look for in my future husband is

228
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:33,949
someone like Third Uncle

229
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:35,988
who's gentle, considerate, and obedient.

230
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,949
When I say something,
he'd never disobey me.

231
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:40,069
He'll be my supporter
in whatever that I do.

232
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:41,268
Someone of my disposition

233
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:42,789
could never be an obedient wife.

234
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:44,748
My husband will have to obey me.

235
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,189
The truth is,

236
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:50,748
I never thought
of marrying your Third Uncle.

237
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:52,669
At that time,

238
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,829
I was betrothed to someone else.

239
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,268
Then...

240
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,949
That's quite indecent of Third Uncle.

241
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:03,388
Your uncle and I never did

242
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:05,549
anything shameless.

243
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,028
My marriage prospect left
for seven years

244
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,388
to escape from trouble.

245
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:11,189
After he's broadened his horizon

246
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,349
and experienced different things in life,

247
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:17,228
that's how our betrothal was broken.

248
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:19,228
Third Aunt,

249
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,228
could this person be

250
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:22,789
Yuan Shanjian's master?

251
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,069
No wonder he always speaks

252
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,549
in a few isolated words.

253
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:29,789
Sure enough,

254
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,469
the master is fickle-minded

255
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:32,669
while the disciple is devious.

256
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:10,508
If you don't focus,

257
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,228
(Huangfu Yi)
you'll only hurt yourself.

258
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,500
(Huangfu Yi)

259
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,148
Master.

260
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,268
Shanjian.

261
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,469
It should have been you and me traveling

262
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,748
with His Majesty.

263
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:35,949
But

264
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:38,028
with this sickly body of mine,

265
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,429
I can only stop and recuperate here.

266
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:42,988
You had to stay as I recover

267
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,028
instead of serving His Majesty.

268
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,028
You must have felt unhappy.

269
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,228
You know my character.

270
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,268
I dislike traveling long distances the most

271
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:53,908
nor do I like to humor people.

272
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,069
I like staying here with you.

273
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:57,309
Besides,

274
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,349
the scenery here is beautiful.

275
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:00,988
Doesn't it feel more at ease

276
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,069
to play zither and flute here?

277
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,709
The scenery here is

278
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,189
indeed beautiful.

279
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:12,148
It's not far

280
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:13,789
from Hua County either.

281
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:15,868
I heard Cheng Zhi will take office

282
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:17,949
as the County Magistrate of Hua County.

283
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:20,189
Do you think

284
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:21,868
Madam Sang

285
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,589
will come with him?

286
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:28,189
Master,

287
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,508
she's now someone's wife.

288
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:33,309
In my opinion,

289
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:35,868
you should forget about her.

290
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,189
Lest you'll be more heartbroken.

291
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:45,709
Until this day,

292
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,108
only the sound of zither
and flute is still around.

293
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:49,589
People

294
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,868
are indeed passers-by

295
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:55,708
who are on a long journey

296
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:59,668
in this world.

297
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,749
Third Aunt, you lost seven years

298
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,309
because of an unworthy person.

299
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:30,829
The more I think about it,
the more I feel it's a big loss.

300
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,549
If I didn't waste my time
on an unworthy person,

301
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,509
how would I realize

302
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:39,628
there's someone more deserving?

303
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:48,188
I don't think of it that way.

304
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:49,708
I'm ill-fated since young.

305
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:51,549
So if I miss the opportunity
to find a husband,

306
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,188
I may not be able to find a better one.

307
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,029
So once I meet someone I like,

308
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,789
I must hold on to him tight.

309
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,549
Otherwise, I'll never find a good husband.

310
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:01,108
So do you find Mr. Lou

311
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:03,188
to be a good prospect?

312
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:06,468
I don't know him that well.

313
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,908
How do I know if he's a good prospect?

314
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,749
We must first experience it
to believe it.

315
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:12,349
That's how I, Cheng Shaoshang want it.

316
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,029
Official Cheng,

317
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,868
you managed to marry the daughter

318
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,148
of Mount Bailu's Master.

319
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:20,269
Can you give me some suggestions?

320
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,749
Shunhua and Niaoniao have
different personalities.

321
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,749
So are we.

322
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:30,948
You'll lose your strong points
if you imitate me blindly.

323
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,589
I'm talented and dashing

324
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:36,829
while you're clueless and timid.

325
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:38,029
But that's beside the point.

326
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:39,388
The point is

327
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:42,069
my beloved Shunhua loves me.

328
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:43,708
But Niaoniao doesn't...

329
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,388
Shaoshang will develop feelings
for me in the future.

330
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,309
Mr. Lou, you're so...

331
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:55,428
Yet, you have such high self-confidence.

332
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,188
I'm truly impressed.

333
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,829
You should eat more.

334
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:00,989
After you finish eating,

335
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:02,509
you should go home.

336
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:06,188
Official Cheng,

337
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,108
please teach me.

338
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:15,069
What are these drawings?

339
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,868
Why are the shapes so strange?

340
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:18,749
These are the mechanism traps I invented.

341
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,789
Look.

342
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:21,789
This is the device and this is the trap.

343
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,029
Fortunately, there are
these old military books

344
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,468
in Third Uncle's carriage.

345
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:26,908
Otherwise, I'd be bored to death

346
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:28,108
on this long journey.

347
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:31,069
Your mother said you were not like her.

348
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,829
But I think you two are so similar.

349
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,628
If you married a military officer
in the future,

350
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:37,468
you can also be
a female general and follow him.

351
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:38,269
Please don't.

352
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,668
I'm not marrying a military officer.

353
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:41,668
I'd live a lifetime of fear

354
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:42,749
instead of having a peaceful life.

355
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,708
Please spare me from that.

356
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:46,708
But scholarly families are particular
in choosing a prospect.

357
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:48,509
The one must be proficient in the four arts

358
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,868
or at least know some knowledge of them.

359
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:51,388
But you...

360
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:56,349
Then please teach me well.

361
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:57,708
Teach me one by one.

362
00:21:58,069 --> 00:21:58,868
For instance,

363
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:00,428
we can start by playing the flute.

364
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,749
Look at you.

365
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,069
If you ask me,

366
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:09,789
Shaoshang always puts up her guard.
But deep in her heart,

367
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:11,549
she needs love and care.

368
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:12,269
If you can treat her

369
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:14,868
sincerely all the time,

370
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,188
she'll feel it.

00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:20,549
Who's singing?

387
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:26,789
Young Lady,

388
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:32,269
I'm Miao.

389
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:33,668
Surprisingly,

390
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:35,349
not only the female guards

391
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:36,349
Mother arranged are skilled
in martial arts,

392
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,108
but they also sing beautifully.

393
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,309
Naturally,

394
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:41,789
your mother will pick the best for you.

395
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:46,668
Third Aunt,

396
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,589
this is the life I want.

397
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,789
To play the flute in the mountain,

398
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:54,349
sing harmoniously,

399
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:56,509
and live a carefree life.
How nice that would be.

400
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,029
Look!

401
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:03,628
That hawk is huge!

402
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:08,148
I've never seen such a huge hawk.

403
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,108
It spreads its wings
and soars in the sky.

404
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:13,148
I want to be like it.

405
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:15,668
To live in the vast world

406
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:17,708
without restraint

407
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,229
and soar in the sky.

408
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:24,749
In the future,

409
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:26,789
you'll see even more things.

410
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:55,948
Third Uncle,

411
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:57,989
I put it aside that you made a detour

412
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:00,108
to Qing County to visit your old friend.

413
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:01,269
Why did you lie

414
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:03,269
that Qing County is
the most bustling place?

415
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:04,509
From what I see,

416
00:25:05,188 --> 00:25:06,229
it looks desolate.

417
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,229
We can see everything clearly

418
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,708
even if a bird flies in the sky.

419
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:14,589
No, this is strange.

420
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,989
Something is not wrong.

421
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:17,229
Shunhua,

422
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,509
I want you and Niaoniao
to get on the carriage

423
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:19,589
and go straight to Hua County.

424
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,749
What about you?
Are you entering the city alone?

425
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,269
I'm afraid something bad happened
in Qing County.

426
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:24,309
I must go and check it out.

427
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:25,589
You can't.

428
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:27,229
I'll come with you.

429
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:28,229
Shunhua,

430
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:30,668
it's all right for you to come
if the city is safe.

431
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:31,229
If something bad happened,

432
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,108
it'll be convenient to move about
with a few people.

433
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,749
I only need to bring a servant with me.

434
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:37,148
It'll be more convenient to move about.

435
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:38,708
The rest of the servants
and female guards will stay

436
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:39,829
and protect you.

437
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:42,948
Fudeng, prepare the horse.

438
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,269
Yes, Sir.

439
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:46,989
Official Cheng, rest assured.

440
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:48,509
Leave Madam Sang and Shaoshang to me.

441
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:50,269
I'll protect them with my life

442
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,668
and make sure they're safe.

443
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,468
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

444
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,269
Third Uncle.

445
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:57,708
But...

446
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,989
Niaoniao, say no more.

447
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:01,029
You must listen to your Third Aunt

448
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:02,428
and don't wander off.

449
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:03,029
I think...

450
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,868
Shunhua,

451
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:06,388
don't worry or be afraid.

452
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:08,868
I only need to get a closer look.

453
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:10,989
If something is wrong, I won't enter.

454
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:12,269
Then be careful.

455
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:19,989
Third Uncle.

456
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:58,708
If you're worried about Third Uncle,

457
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:00,428
we can turn back

458
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:02,388
and go to Qing County with Third Uncle.

459
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,108
Father told me

460
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:06,589
that Third Uncle is a blessed man
since young.

461
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:08,108
So he has a great amount of luck.

462
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:09,229
But I'm not.

463
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:11,829
I was cursed with bad luck
since I was born.

464
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,148
That's why I feel

465
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:14,628
it's safer

466
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,229
if we're with Third Uncle.

467
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:19,188
Stop talking nonsense.

468
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:20,908
Shaoshang, don't be scared.

469
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,309
His Majesty's imperial carriage
has passed through this way.

470
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,428
The brave Yulin Guards are also
in his company.

471
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:27,468
General Ling's black armored guards
are also with them.

472
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:29,589
Even if there are bandits
scattered around,

473
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:30,948
they wouldn't dare to attack us.

474
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,708
Besides, I've promised Official Cheng

475
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:33,708
that I'll protect

476
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:34,908
and escort you to Hua County
with my life.

477
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:38,509
Ling Buyi?

478
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:41,989
Why is this fiend here?

479
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:56,708
Miao!

480
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:10,388
I'll go and see what happened.

481
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,069
These are the marks of military horses.

482
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,628
Logically, it shouldn't appear
in a remote place like this.

483
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:57,868
Oh, no.

484
00:28:58,428 --> 00:28:59,148
Fudeng.

485
00:28:59,229 --> 00:28:59,948
We must turn around

486
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:00,989
and take a different route.

487
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:34,349
Third Aunt!

488
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:35,388
Madam Sang!

489
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:36,309
Third Aunt!

490
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:37,108
Madam Sang!

491
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:37,668
Third Aunt!

492
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:38,349
Niaoniao...

493
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:39,388
Third Aunt!

494
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:42,829
Protect the women!

495
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:46,309
Attack!

496
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:14,989
Young Lady,

497
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,069
it's been solved.

498
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:19,628
Shaoshang,

499
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:20,948
I brought some medicinal herbs from home.

500
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:22,948
Why don't we use it to treat Madam Sang?

501
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,708
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

502
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,309
It's not safe to stay here.

503
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:27,428
I'm worried

504
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:29,428
they might be the bandit's scouts

505
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:31,188
and there will be more coming.

506
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:32,509
It's an open space here.

507
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:33,829
If we stay here,

508
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:35,188
we'll be attacked on both sides.

509
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:37,029
So we must leave this place now.

510
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:38,628
Mr. Lou,

511
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:40,749
you said your elder brother gave you

512
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:42,108
a topographic map
of a nearby mountain road.

513
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,148
Can you show me?

514
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:58,908
We're outnumbered.

515
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,188
I'm afraid it'll be hard
to take on them.

516
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:01,069
So please go

517
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,589
to the nearest magistrate for help.

518
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,428
All right.

519
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:06,628
Miao.

520
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:07,428
I can't go.

521
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,269
I promised Official Cheng
to protect you with my life.

522
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,628
I can't leave you alone here.

523
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:12,628
Besides,

524
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,668
I want to die with you

525
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:14,749
if we die.

526
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:15,829
No one is going to die.

527
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:16,948
I don't want to die.

528
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,549
I told you to ask for reinforcement

529
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:20,829
because you're a better horse rider.

530
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:21,428
I...

531
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:22,229
One word.

532
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,428
Are you going or not?

533
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,948
I don't mean it this way, Shaoshang.

534
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:26,428
Fine, I'll go.

535
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,468
But promise me

536
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,789
that you won't act impulsively.

537
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:29,708
You must be cautious.

538
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:31,829
If the reinforcement arrives in time,

539
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:33,789
I won't act rashly.

540
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:38,628
Go now!

541
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:42,908
Miao, this is the medicine.

542
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:44,428
After you help Third Aunt
into the carriage,

543
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:45,509
apply this medicine on her.

544
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:47,428
Also, all women should ride
the carriage.

545
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:48,628
If there's not enough carriage,

546
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:49,908
throw away the bags.

547
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:50,509
But

548
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,029
General prepared
all those things for you.

549
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:53,349
Is possession more important than life?

550
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:54,229
I shall obey.

551
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:57,309
Third Aunt.

552
00:31:58,188 --> 00:31:59,029
Third Aunt.

553
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:01,948
You must be careful.

554
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:06,188
Fudeng.

555
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:06,908
Prepare the horse.

556
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:07,708
Yes, Young Lady.

557
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,060
(Mount Jie, Mount Fu, Xiqiao, Taizhou)

558
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:35,269
Young Lady,

559
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:36,428
which way should we go?

560
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,229
Third Uncle said

561
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:40,708
there's a hunting lodge nearby.

562
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:42,468
We can hide in the hunting lodge.

563
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:43,349
All right.

564
00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:48,829
A good horse knows human nature best.

565
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:50,708
If you fear it,

566
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,188
it'll pick on you.

567
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:54,188
If you're more tenacious,

568
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:55,829
it'll fear you.

569
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:48,108
What is taking you so long?

570
00:33:48,148 --> 00:33:48,908
Young Lady,

571
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:50,668
the carriages are too heavy
for the horses to pull.

572
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:52,188
Then abandon all possessions.

573
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:53,908
Everyone must protect themselves.

574
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,069
I forbid you to die.

575
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:55,908
- Yes, Young Lady!
- Yes, Young Lady!

576
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:27,309
Third Aunt.

577
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,468
Watch your step.

578
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:38,749
Luckily Young Lady ordered us

579
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:40,069
to abandon those possessions.

580
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:41,948
Those bandits were after money.

581
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:43,628
That's why we managed to escape.

582
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:45,549
I think they won't come after us

583
00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:47,589
after they get what they wanted.

584
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:50,108
It's fine if they're only after
our possessions.

585
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:52,349
But what if they have other intentions?

586
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,549
I think we must be prudent.

587
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:56,349
Fudeng.

588
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,029
Bring some men to gather bamboo sticks.

589
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,589
Build a mechanism
according to my instructions.

590
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:00,349
Go now.

591
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:00,989
Yes, Young Lady.

592
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:05,229
Let me help you.

593
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,549
Young Lady,

594
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:07,829
there are some items in this house.

595
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:08,868
Please see if there are of any use.

596
00:35:26,148 --> 00:35:26,948
These are useful.

597
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:28,309
We can use everything here.

598
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:58,749
Young Lady,

599
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:00,028
do you think our defense structure

600
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:01,789
can hold them out when they come?

601
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,309
We'll stall while we can.

602
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:07,428
If we can hold out
until the reinforcement arrives,

603
00:36:08,428 --> 00:36:09,669
only then we'll be able to survive.

604
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:14,349
Niaoniao,

605
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:16,189
why are you standing in the open?

606
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,669
That's too dangerous.

607
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:19,109
What if the bandits come here?

608
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:20,468
Third Aunt, what are you doing up here?

609
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:21,508
It's not safe here.

610
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:23,309
I'm worried

611
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:25,588
our whole journey will be
this dangerous.

612
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:28,068
I wonder if your uncle is safe.

613
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:30,669
If I knew,

614
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:32,669
I wouldn't have agreed

615
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,028
to take the detour to Qing County

616
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:35,709
and gone straight to Hua County instead.

617
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:37,309
I think Qing County closed its gates

618
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,948
because they knew
it was not safe outside.

619
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:41,189
So they closed the gates
to protect themselves.

620
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:44,028
Third Uncle is in the city.

621
00:36:44,548 --> 00:36:45,988
So he's safe.

622
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:47,109
Now,

623
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:50,068
we should worry about ourselves.

624
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:19,829
Young Lady,

625
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:21,189
there are too many of them.

626
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:49,548
Attack!

627
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:32,229
Get off the horses.

628
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:41,789
Release the arrows!

629
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:10,149
The traps are all used up, Young Lady.

630
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:29,868
Those who come forward will die!

631
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:31,988
I shall see who will die first!

632
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:45,789
Young Lady, watch out!

633
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:58,868
Miao!

634
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:00,269
Let me go!

635
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:01,309
They're prepared!

636
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:01,948
Retreat!

637
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:46,189
Niaoniao,

638
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:48,309
we can only avenge Miao

639
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:49,669
if we hold out

640
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:52,068
until reinforcement arrives.

641
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:54,629
They caught Miao

642
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,309
because they want to force me
to submit to them.

643
00:41:01,229 --> 00:41:03,149
They won't kill her, right?

644
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:19,428
Today,

645
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:21,829
you've done well.

646
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:24,988
Stop blaming yourself because of Miao.

647
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:27,028
Even if your Third Uncle is here,

648
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,508
he may not be as thorough.

649
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,189
When Mother followed

650
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:45,269
Father to go on war expeditions,

651
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:50,068
did they often encounter such situations?

652
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,189
They put their lives on the line.

653
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:55,868
People around

654
00:41:57,508 --> 00:41:58,988
might lose their lives at any time.

655
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:01,068
In troubled times,

656
00:42:02,548 --> 00:42:03,789
people hold little regard
for human lives.

657
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:06,468
To protect a person for yourself.

658
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:09,309
To protect hundreds of people
for fellow villagers.

659
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:11,948
To protect thousands of people
for the country.

660
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:14,789
It's also because your parents
cherish people's lives

661
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:18,709
that your parents left you

662
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:19,868
to rush to the Gu City's rescue.

663
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:23,709
It's just because they have
a heavy responsibility

664
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:26,428
to end the turbulent days.

665
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:44,508
Young Lady, it's as you've expected.

666
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:45,588
I went to scout the area.

667
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,948
They've rescued
all their injured comrades.

668
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:56,149
Those bandits

669
00:42:58,028 --> 00:42:59,548
attack and retreat in an orderly manner.

670
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:02,468
They don't seem like bandits.

671
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,789
We've abandoned
all our possessions by the roadside.

672
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:08,508
Why are they still after us?

673
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,669
They're not bandits.

674
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:14,669
They're soldiers.

675
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:16,109
If they're soldiers,

676
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:18,588
why are they after our lives?

677
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:22,068
It's about the armament case
your Granduncle was involved in.

678
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:24,309
That batch of armaments
may have been transported to Shu.

679
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:26,709
When His Majesty heard of this,
he decided to travel to the west.

680
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:32,908
I remembered Ling Buyi told me

681
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:35,789
that the armaments of the armament case
Granduncle was involved in

682
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:37,309
may have been transported to Shu.

683
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:38,988
Shu has surrendered for many years.

684
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:40,388
They're accumulating armaments.

685
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:42,109
They must be planning
to raise a rebellion.

686
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:44,868
Now His Majesty travels to west.

687
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:47,028
They'd rather do it or call it quits.

688
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:48,669
They are going
to assassinate His Majesty.

689
00:43:49,028 --> 00:43:50,388
I'm guessing we must have run

690
00:43:50,388 --> 00:43:52,109
into their scouts on the road.

691
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:53,789
So they want to silence us

692
00:43:55,028 --> 00:43:56,428
because they're scared
they might be exposed.
