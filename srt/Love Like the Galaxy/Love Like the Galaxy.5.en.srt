=Episode 5=

3
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,660
Young Master,

4
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,260
we've searched all forge shops in the city.

5
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,180
But we didn't find anything related
to the armaments.

6
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,980
Could it be that Xu Jinzhong destroyed

7
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,380
all the evidence after knowing

8
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,980
Head Armorer Dong was captured?

9
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,820
It's only been several days
since Dong Cangguan was captured.

10
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,180
Even if he managed
to destroy all the letters,

11
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,060
he couldn't have destroyed
the armaments.

12
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,740
He's anxious to sell them out.

13
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,340
So he'll definitely contact the buyers first.

14
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
People will leave trails,

15
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,780
and carriages will leave track marks.

16
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,900
So long he makes a move,

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
we'll definitely find out.

18
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,940
What do you mean
by saying people or carriages?

19
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,980
Carriage? That carriage.

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,940
This carriage looks familiar.

21
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,140
It's the Cheng Family's carriage.

22
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,420
Young Master,

23
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,500
what is it that's mesmerizing you?

24
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,820
It's snowing.

25
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,100
It's going to be the New Year soon.

26
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,860
Have we ever prepared
the New Year's goods

27
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,740
for our brothers in the army?

28
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,780
Prepare New Year's goods?

29
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,220
Prepare some dried fruit snacks.

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,300
This will also be

31
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,340
our first time celebrating
New Year's Day in the capital.

32
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,060
I thought Young Master

33
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,780
never celebrated any
of these reunion festivals.

34
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,700
Young Master, you haven't visited
Marquis Chengyang

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,540
since you returned to the capital.

36
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,380
Officials are starting to talk
in your behind.

37
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,660
I heard Marquis Chengyang presented
memorials requesting His Majesty

38
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,300
to invite you to return home
for a reunion on New Year's Day.

39
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,220
I'm not going.

40
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:09,360
(Cheng's Residence)

41
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,580
Mother, you're here just in time.

42
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,740
The auspicious hour has arrived.

43
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,340
We were just waiting for you
to start the offerings.

44
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,300
Shi, you must be freezing
in this cold weather.

45
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,180
It doesn't matter
when we perform the offerings.

46
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,500
Why must we insist on waiting
for the auspicious hour?

47
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,260
We dare not start with the offerings

48
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,420
if the elder of the Cheng Family
is not here.

49
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,020
Heaven and earth forbid

50
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,860
disrespectful and unfilial behaviors.

51
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,740
Mother, here you go.

52
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,940
We live close to here.

53
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,140
It only takes a few steps.

54
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,860
Why did we have to wake up so early?

55
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,420
The day is still so cold.

56
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,860
This is torturous.

57
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,940
We should be ceremonious

58
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,500
when moving into a new home.

59
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,900
We mustn't treat it so casually.

60
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,340
What's the matter?

61
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,700
I feel cold.

62
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,860
Shi.

63
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,760
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

64
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,380
The auspicious hour has arrived.

65
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,540
The auspicious hour has arrived.

66
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,350
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

67
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,620
It feels good.

68
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,420
This place makes me feel so good.

69
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,500
How sturdy.

70
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
This table is

71
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,740
so smooth.

72
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,100
Shi,

73
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,620
we've moved into such a huge house.

74
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,340
We must invite more guests

75
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,220
to make things merrier.

76
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,660
The Cheng Family

77
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,940
isn't a big household.

78
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,540
There are too few men.

79
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,820
So it's not lively enough.

80
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,940
Old Madam,

81
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,620
Master was only given the title of Marquis.

82
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,660
He hasn't been promoted yet.

83
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,340
Won't it be more glorious for you

84
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,660
to hold a banquet and invite the guests

85
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,380
when the Master is appointed?

86
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,260
I like the sound of that.

87
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,620
When he's appointed,

88
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,660
we'll receive more monetary gifts.

89
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,060
When that happens,

90
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,900
we'll hold the banquet
for three days and three nights.

91
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,380
I'll invite all of my friends
from the village

92
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,020
and show them

93
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
how great the Cheng Family has become.

94
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,980
Hu,

95
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,740
take me to my room.

96
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,620
I want to see how big it is

97
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,300
and see how many gifts it can store.

98
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,340
She's finally gone.

99
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,660
Help me sit.

100
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,660
I'm so exhausted.

101
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,540
I need to sit.

102
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Sit in a proper manner.

103
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,140
You complained of being tired
because you waked up early only today.

104
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
You've been lazy

105
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,100
all this time.

106
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,300
Look at Yangyang.

107
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,660
She wakes up early to study everyday.

108
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,140
When has she ever complained
that she's tired?

109
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,780
Niaoniao just recovered
from her illness.

110
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,500
She should get more rest.

111
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,980
Mother woke Niaoniao up

112
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,540
before midnight.

113
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,380
So it's normal for her to feel tired.

114
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,620
Put Niaoniao aside.

115
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,060
I accompanied with Mother all day today.

116
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,940
It's more tiring
than a day's military drill.

117
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,780
How I wish I could go
and rest in my room.

118
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,940
Father,

119
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,180
you must get proper rest
for these few days.

120
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,900
It's going to be hard when you leave
for your expedition in a few days.

121
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
How did you know?

122
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,860
I didn't tell her.

123
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,740
Yangyang,

124
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,700
why don't you check your room?

125
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,100
You can tell me

126
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,780
if there's anything that you don't like.

127
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,220
Yes.

128
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,780
How did you know

129
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,780
about the royal court's military order?

130
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,300
Answer me!

131
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,620
I made a guess.

132
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,180
Father was granted a title and wealth.

133
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,460
Yet, he was not appointed to
any position in court.

134
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,900
Besides, Father doesn't look like

135
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,340
he was being ostracized
at court either.

136
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,020
So I'm guessing

137
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,460
His Majesty has arranged
something else for Father.

138
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,980
Father,

139
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,220
our family no longer lacks anything.

140
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,580
Decline it if you can.

141
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,380
It must be arduous. So it doesn't matter
if you don't go.

142
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,940
My daughter is indeed wise.

143
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Rest assured.
It's not a war expedition this time.

144
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,260
We'll only set out after the New Year.

145
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,500
It's not a war expedition?

146
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,260
You're leaving after the New Year?

147
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,820
-Niaoniao,
-If so...

148
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,300
your courtyard is over there.

149
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,220
You're not fully recovered yet.

150
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,860
So go back and get some rest early.
Don't get sick again.

151
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,700
How clever.

152
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,820
She takes after you.

153
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,500
You always protect her.

154
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,260
Young Lady,

155
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,780
I've never seen such
a beautiful courtyard.

156
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,420
This courtyard is really beautiful.

157
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,620
Miss Lianfang.

158
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Young Lady.

159
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,780
Young Lady, look at this.

160
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,740
Young Lady,

161
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,740
it's such a huge courtyard.

162
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,420
Are they really letting us stay here?

163
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,180
Lianfang,

164
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,540
what's that pile of things?

165
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,660
I think they're some old things

166
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,300
Old Madam cleared out
from her courtyard.

167
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,900
She's piling them up here
before throwing them out.

168
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,580
Don't throw them out.
I have some use for them.

169
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,780
But these things look so old.

170
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,980
What can you do with them?

171
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,820
I'll tell you later.

172
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,820
You always compliment Yangyang

173
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,300
and yell at Niaoniao.

174
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,260
The more you're behaving this way,

175
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,300
the more she's unwilling
to listen to you.

176
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,700
Doesn't Yangyang deserve compliments?

177
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,260
Her birth mother is a useless fool

178
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,900
and an embarrassment.

179
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,420
But she never

180
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,260
complains or resents it.
She's neither inferior nor arrogant.

181
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,740
She only does her part.

182
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,980
But look at Niaoniao.

183
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,340
What's wrong with Niaoniao?

184
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,980
Yangyang has her Aunt to teach her.

185
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,420
But no one taught Niaoniao before.

186
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,140
I'm teaching her, am I not?

187
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,220
You don't need much effort
to teach Niaoniao.

188
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,260
She picks up very fast.

189
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,020
Once she understands it,
she'll learn very quickly.

190
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,180
So

191
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,180
one must marry an intelligent bride.

192
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,060
Niaoniao takes after your intelligence.

193
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,380
What's the point of being intelligent?

194
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,700
Being upright is the most important.

195
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,020
Have you forgotten about me?

196
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,580
I'm an upright man.

197
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,100
Niaoniao is intelligent like you

198
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,500
and upright like me.

199
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,460
So it's perfect.

200
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,140
What's that sound?

201
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,420
It's coming
from your daughter's courtyard.

202
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,980
I think she's trying
to destroy the house.

203
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,380
If she is, let her be.
Don't yell at her.

204
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,580
Don't agitate yourself.

205
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,780
Young Lady,

206
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,460
if your mother finds out,

207
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,540
she'll scold you
for having improper conduct.

208
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,500
There's nothing to be scared of.

209
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,420
You still have me if the sky falls.

210
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,380
Besides,

211
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,420
don't you want a swing?

212
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,900
I do.

213
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,180
All these are for building a swing?

214
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,820
Young Lady, you can even build a swing?

215
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,940
Of course.

216
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,940
When Grandmother renovated the yard,

217
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,540
I watched the carpenters do it,

218
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,180
and I even secretly helped
them several times.

219
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,700
Look.

220
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,220
I'll make two openings there

221
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,580
and fix them by wedging them

222
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,900
with a piece of wood.

223
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,820
When our swing is completed,

224
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,700
I'll build a rack

225
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,460
and grow vines on top of it.

226
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,780
How comfortable it will be

227
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,180
to sit on the swing and admire the moon

228
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,780
on a long summer night.

229
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,140
What are you doing?

230
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Young Lady is building a swing.

231
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,180
Madam, look.

232
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,940
You're a lady,

233
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,300
not a carpenter.

234
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,300
If you spared your interest in reading
instead of pleasure,

235
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,180
I wouldn't worry about you.

236
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,860
Since you have time to play
with these useless things,

237
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,620
I guess the books aren't enough
for you to read.

238
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,500
I've instructed Qingcong

239
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,780
to borrow some ancient texts and books

240
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,140
from your cousin.

241
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,940
From tomorrow on,

242
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,060
you shall study in my room every day.

243
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,740
Just next door.

244
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,700
Mother,

245
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,180
I still don't know that many words.

246
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,300
Won't it be too soon for me

247
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,740
to study ancient texts?

248
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,940
No, it won't.

249
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Your father said you're intelligent
and pick up very fast.

250
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,220
Naturally, you'll learn faster

251
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,500
and learn more than others.

252
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
If you're not willing to study,

253
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,380
don't ever think
about going out of the house.

254
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,180
Why did my mother

255
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,580
have that look?

256
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,300
Impressed with you.

257
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,820
You've done well.

258
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,300
Zhi!

259
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,420
You're finally home.

260
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,700
Watch your steps.

261
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,500
(Cheng Zhi)

262
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,380
(Cheng Zhi)
Mother.

263
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,140
My son,

264
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,740
you're home.

265
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,700
You're so heartless.

266
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,140
You're finally home, Zhi.

267
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,100
I missed you dearly.

268
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,620
(Anyone who doesn't know)

269
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,740
(he's your son would think)

270
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,300
(your lover has returned.)

271
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,260
Your attitude changed too quickly.

272
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,820
(Cheng Shaogong)
Beware. Mother is looking at you.

273
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,020
Who are you?

274
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,660
It doesn't matter who I am.

275
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,980
I'm afraid you'll be punished today

276
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,020
after reading a fortune.

277
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,900
Why would I be punished?

278
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,900
Stop scaring Niaoniao.

279
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,220
Niaoniao, I'm your brother.

280
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,820
Greetings, Second Brother.

281
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,780
Greetings, Third Brother.

282
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,220
(Cheng Song)
How do you know I'm your second brother

283
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,180
(Cheng Song)
and not eldest brother?

284
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,180
Just like third brother,

285
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,580
I read a fortune.

286
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,380
Just like third brother,

287
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,620
he knew who I was
without me saying a word.

288
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,420
Is there a need
to read a fortune for this?

289
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,780
Judging by your age and attires,

290
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,340
you're either Niaoniao or Yangyang.

291
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,420
But Yangyang is well-behaved

292
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,820
and wouldn't come out like this.

293
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,020
The truth is,
I didn't read a fortune on this.

294
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,940
I heard eldest brother is a genteel talent

295
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,820
from Mount Bailu

296
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,340
and he is now with the military.

297
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,180
While second brother is
a mighty military man.

298
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,100
Someone with such a frail body

299
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,780
must be third brother.

300
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,500
You...

301
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,340
Shaogong has found a nemesis this time.

302
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,900
Niaoniao's eloquence is

303
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,100
no worse than yours.

304
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,860
Cautious.

305
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,740
Mother is looking at us.

306
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,100
No need to trick me.

307
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,180
Mother is...

308
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,860
You haven't greeted Grandmother yet.

309
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,740
Niaoniao,

310
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
you should pay your respect to
your Third Uncle and Third Aunt.

311
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,460
Yes.

312
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,100
-Greetings, Grandmother.
-Greetings, Third Uncle.

313
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,380
Greetings...

314
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,580
My lovely grandsons.

315
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,260
My child.

316
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,700
Are you Song?

317
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,460
Grandmother, I'm Shaogong.

318
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm Song.

319
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,780
This is so comforting.

320
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,780
But our family doesn't have

321
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,780
enough men.

322
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,060
Zhi,

323
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,580
you must put in more effort.

324
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,220
Help yourself with more flatbread later.

325
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,660
You'll have more strength
to produce offsprings

326
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,740
for the Cheng Family
when you're satiated.

327
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,220
Mother, must you speak of this

328
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,700
in front of the youngsters?

329
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,580
You're so tall.

330
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,420
As expected
of the Cheng Family's male offsprings.

331
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,300
Niaoniao.

332
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,780
Greet your Third Aunt.

333
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,780
Greetings, Third Aunt.

334
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,550
(Sang Shunhua)
She's indeed as smart

335
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,540
(Sang Shunhua)
as what you wrote in your letter.

336
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,140
She behaves in a conceited manner.

337
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,620
While Yangyang is waiting patiently
for her elders in the hall.

338
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,980
She came out first

339
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,500
without having proper manners.

340
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,620
It's better for a young girl to be lively.

341
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,980
Is brother-in-law still
in the courtyard?

342
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,580
We should go inside

343
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,500
and not let him wait.

344
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,220
All right.

345
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,700
Old Madam.

346
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,260
Let's go inside.

347
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,220
Yes, of course!

348
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,260
Come, Zhi.

349
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,460
Come and have some flatbread.

350
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,020
I've prepared everything for you.

351
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,300
Buttermilk too.

352
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,180
I've prepared a lot of delicious food.

353
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,940
-You must help yourself.
-Yes.

354
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,620
Mother, take care.

355
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,740
All right.

356
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,300
Brothers,

357
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,100
do you have any strategies
to face Mother?

358
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,020
Honestly,

359
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,060
I made a knife pen that carves
three characters at the same time.

360
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,620
Do you really have such
a wonderful object?

361
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,940
Niaoniao, you mustn't keep it
for yourself.

362
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,060
Make one for each of us.

363
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,540
Tell me.

364
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,780
Well,

365
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,780
pretend you're ill
when she physically punishes you.

366
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,060
I have one.

367
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,220
When she starts scolding you,

368
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,260
lower your head

369
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,100
and pretend not to hear anything at all.

370
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,980
After she has reprimanded you,

371
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,220
lift your head and say,

372
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,100
"Mother, I'm sorry."

373
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,220
What else? Tell me more.

374
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,300
Also...

375
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,820
Zhi.

376
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,460
- All right.
- Let's drink.

377
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,700
-Zhi.
-Mother.

378
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,340
My son,

379
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,420
I missed you so much.

380
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,460
Mother.

381
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,740
You do love buttermilk, don't you?

382
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Here.

383
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,700
I've warmed it up for you. Try it.

384
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,460
All right, Mother.

385
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,620
Here, open your mouth.

386
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,020
Does Grandmother disapprove
of Third Aunt too?

387
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,860
Third Uncle requested
to marry Third Aunt himself.

388
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,820
She's the daughter
of the Master of Mount Bailu.

389
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,460
The truth is this marriage elevates
our family's status.

390
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,380
But Grandmother still doesn't think

391
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,060
Third Aunt is compatible
with Third Uncle.

392
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,140
I'm afraid only matching
a beautiful fairy

393
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,020
for Third Uncle

394
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,220
would make Grandmother happy.

395
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,220
Second Uncle

396
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,220
laid low for more than ten years

397
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,300
for the sake of the family.

398
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,820
But Grandmother has

399
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,540
no sympathy at all.

400
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,900
Everyone says

401
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,700
people are snobbish.

402
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,420
But who would have thought

403
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,540
some parents

404
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,620
would treat their children that way?

405
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,460
If parents judge their children

406
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,220
based on appearance and potential,

407
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,660
why should I respect them

408
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,380
as a junior?

409
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,660
Who are you criticizing

410
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,780
in secret there?

411
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,900
Mother,

412
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,580
I was asking Niaoniao.

413
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,660
We're obviously twins.

414
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,180
But why don't we look similar at all?

415
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,180
That's right.

416
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,740
Both of us are not as

417
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,060
pretty as Niaoniao is.

418
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,780
Niaoniao,
we've been apart for many years.

419
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,180
I've brought you many delicacies
and interesting things.

420
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,020
Don't just dote on Niaoniao.

421
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,220
Yangyang is also your sister.

422
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,900
There must be no fewer gifts for her.

423
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,340
It's getting late now.

424
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,660
I suppose it's time
for Old Madam to get some rest.

425
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,940
I'm still sober.

426
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,300
Why should I rest earlier?

427
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,700
Zhi and I have many things to talk.

428
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,100
Mother,

429
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,660
I haven't slept

430
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,060
because I've been on the road for days.

431
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,700
You should get some rest then.

432
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,900
Zhi,

433
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,820
I'll show you the way to your room.

434
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,540
It's all right.

435
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,420
I'll send Zhi myself.

436
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,660
My son.

437
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,380
It's done. You can come down now.

438
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,620
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

439
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,420
(Marquis Quling's Residence)
Careful.

440
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:12,820
Look.

441
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,980
Someone set off firecrackers.

442
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,260
(Virtue Flows Like Water)

443
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,780
Careful.

444
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,780
Hand it over to me.

445
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
All right. Align it to the left.

446
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,620
Perfect.

447
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,260
First Aunt.

448
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,060
Third Aunt.

449
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,540
Yangyang,

450
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,580
you can leave these chores
to the servants.

451
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,780
You should get some rest.

452
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,460
It's been a tiring day for you.

453
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,300
I'm not tired.

454
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,420
You're more tired than I am.

455
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,940
You trust me

456
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,540
and give me a chance to manage
the household duties.

457
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,900
I would naturally do my best

458
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,700
not to let you down.

459
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,220
I know your intention.

460
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,460
You should go and rest now.

461
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,060
Yes.

462
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,020
If Niaoniao is half sensible
as Yangyang,

463
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,740
I wouldn't have to worry.

464
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,220
Yangyang is making the arrangements

465
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,100
for this year's New Year's feast.

466
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,900
I was concerned she wouldn't be able

467
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,820
to manage the offering ceremony
at the ancestral hall today.

468
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,900
Surprisingly,

469
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,740
she made no mistake at all.

470
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,060
This is the behavior

471
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,980
of an unmarried young lady should have.

472
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,460
Just like what you said.

473
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,820
That enormous bridge.

474
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,300
Yangyang is clever and gentle.

475
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,780
Niaoniao is lively and smart.

476
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,580
They have their merits.

477
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,620
You can't always praise Yangyang

478
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,140
and belittle Niaoniao.

479
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,020
I'm not partial to either of them.

480
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,860
I was only complimenting
those who do well.

481
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,380
Yangyang is a sensible girl.

482
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,980
I'm willing to teach her

483
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,300
everything I know.

484
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,740
Niaoniao is smart too.

485
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,540
Why aren't you teaching her these?

486
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,060
She should correct
the bad behaviors influenced

487
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,220
by Madam Ge first

488
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,540
before learning business matters.

489
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,580
How can she learn to manage a household

490
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,300
when she doesn't have proper conduct?

491
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Niaoniao, why don't we go
and watch firecrackers?

492
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,140
I have no interest
in watching firecrackers.

493
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,540
I should probably go back to my room.

494
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,860
The New Year is a day for reunion.

495
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,220
Please save

496
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,100
your proprieties for today.

497
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,260
Help yourselves with the drinks.

498
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,700
Zisheng has returned to the capital,

499
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,700
(Madam Chunyu, Ling Yi)
and Princess Yuchang is waiting to marry him.

500
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,740
I suppose

501
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,860
it'll be a double blessing
for Your Lordship this year.

502
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
All right.

503
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,940
Let's have a toast

504
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,060
for Zisheng's marriage.

505
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,980
Zisheng,

506
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,420
we were just mentioning your betrothal.

507
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,460
Come.

508
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,820
Take a seat beside me.

509
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,740
I come bearing His Majesty's decree

510
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,700
to come forward and reunite
with Marquis Chengyang.

511
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,340
Everyone, please feel at ease.

512
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,620
I stand here

513
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,380
to dine with you.

514
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,900
Princess Yuchang has arrived!

515
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,740
(Princess Yuchang)
Greetings, Princess Yuchang.

516
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
General Ling.

517
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,140
I still have some official matters
to attend to.

518
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,660
So I shall not stay further.

519
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,980
Zisheng,

520
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,020
there's no need to rush.

521
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,420
You still need to eat
no matter how occupied you are.

522
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,860
You can't handle your affairs
with an empty stomach.

523
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,180
That's right, Zisheng.

524
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,500
Princess Yuchang wants

525
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,460
to celebrate the Lantern Festival with you.

526
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,740
You mustn't decline.

527
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,780
Zisheng,

528
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,140
marriage should be dictated by parents.

529
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,100
Would we do anything harm to you?

530
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,580
Parents' orders?

531
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,180
Where's my mother now, pray tell?

532
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,860
She's

533
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,740
a nobody.

534
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,700
Your Highness,

535
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,300
I must make this clear to you

536
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,380
in front of everyone here.

537
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,820
The bride I seek is

538
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,900
to know she's the one

539
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,700
at the first sight.

540
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,220
My life and my heart will belong to her.

541
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,100
If I can't find such a woman,

542
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,460
I would rather not marry
in my whole life.

543
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,900
And Your Highness

544
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,140
is not her.

545
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,380
Excuse me.

546
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,510
(Xinghua Courtyard)

547
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,900
Young Master,

548
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,100
we've taken down all the lanterns.

549
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,580
The new servants didn't know better

550
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,260
and hung the lanterns
on New Year's Eve in the courtyard.

551
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,140
Madam had a great shock

552
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,060
that she clamored all night
about Gu City on fire.

553
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,300
She didn't even have her dinner.

554
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,740
You haven't taken your meal either.

555
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,140
Why don't I reheat the dishes for you?

556
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,220
No need.

557
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,140
I have no appetite.

558
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,100
Go

559
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,740
and bring all the lanterns
from Xu Jinzhong's forge shop to me.

560
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,900
Yes.

561
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,100
Is there anything unusual
about the forge shop's lanterns?

562
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,940
I do recall
other shops hanging lanterns too.

563
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,020
You're right.

564
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,420
But the lantern frame of other shops

565
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,020
is made from bamboo.

566
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,100
But every lantern
from Xu Jinzhong's forge shop

567
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,580
has a round iron ring fixed

568
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,060
at the bottom of the lampshade.

569
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,980
Ordinary lantern shops

570
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,700
don't have such forging skills.

571
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,300
The reason Xu Jinzhong's lanterns

572
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,220
are different from others is

573
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,740
that he made them himself.

574
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,180
Why would a blacksmith

575
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,540
like him make lanterns?

576
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,500
We didn't find any leads

577
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,980
in his secret room that day

578
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,460
because he had hidden the leads

579
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,820
in places we would overlook.

580
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,780
That is

581
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,020
the lantern used for lighting at night.

582
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,840
(There was a beautiful
whose face I can't forget.)

583
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,580
Your Highness,

584
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,780
it's cold.

585
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,820
Why don't you wait in the carriage?

586
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,140
To avoid me,

587
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,620
he rather comes
to a cold place like this

588
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,820
than stays in a warm place.

589
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,340
Why don't

590
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,020
we go inside?

591
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,900
Your Highness.

592
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,180
I'm not this accurate every time.

593
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,140
You left without having your meal

594
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,500
because of me.

595
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,420
I came here because I felt apologetic.

596
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,260
Putting that aside,

597
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,780
do you have any spare time

598
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,380
on the day of the Lantern Festival,
General Ling?

599
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,580
I made this lantern myself.

600
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,340
I'm occupied.

601
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,260
Whether you'll go or not,

602
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,700
I shall wait patiently
at the Lantern Festival Show.

603
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,440
(There was a beautiful
whose face I can't forget.)

604
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,900
Young Master,

605
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,340
this is the lantern
from Xu Jinzhong's secret room.

606
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,220
Nothing out of the ordinary.

607
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,700
Young Master,

608
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,860
Princess Yuchang is completely besotted
with you.

609
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,100
Do you see what's written
on this lantern?

610
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,220
"There was a beautiful

611
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,740
whose face I can't forget."

612
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,500
I did hear

613
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,980
the lanterns at the Lantern Festival Shows

614
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,300
would usually be in pairs.

615
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,980
Did you say "in pairs?"

616
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,980
Xu Jinzhong is really an old fox.

617
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,020
He hid the lead in the lantern.

618
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,380
If the buyers wish
to correspond with him,

619
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,820
they will only need to leave
the other pair of lanterns.

620
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,620
This would allow them to communicate

621
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,900
without meeting each other.

622
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,220
We shall also go

623
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,100
to the Lantern Festival Show.

624
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,460
This room doesn't look like
a lady's room.

625
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,780
There's nothing else but books.

626
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,220
It looks rather shabby.

627
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,740
Father put a lot of effort

628
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,140
to find these ancient texts.

629
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,700
No amount of money can get these.

630
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,260
How are these shabby?

631
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,380
It has been an endless day for you.

632
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,300
You should get some rest.

633
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,940
Young Lady,

634
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,780
you're too sensible.

635
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,220
It'll only bring you
to your disadvantage.

636
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,180
Madam Xiao has sent your mother away
from Cheng's residence.

637
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,020
No one can protect you now.

638
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,740
If you don't fight for it,

639
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,820
you'll be suffering losses
in the future.

640
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,980
Mother returned to the Ge family

641
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,860
because she was at fault.

642
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,620
First Aunt treats me better

643
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,140
than she treats Niaoniao.

644
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,860
She's generous
with my food and clothing.

645
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,780
How is that a loss?

646
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,460
Do you consider this generous?

647
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,860
What did First Madam say?

648
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,620
First Madam said

649
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,300
we could take anything we need
from the storehouse.

650
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,820
She certainly knows
how to conduct herself.

651
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,340
We know Old Madam is more partial
to males than females.

652
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,660
The first chamber's sons have returned.

653
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,540
With Third Master being
Old Madam's favorite son.

654
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,660
Our Young Lady

655
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,660
has no position
in this residence anymore.

656
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,980
No one is taking charge
of the second chamber now.

657
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,180
There will be no place
for us in the future.

658
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,060
We must vie for everything.

659
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,380
We must first establish our authority.

660
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,500
So others wouldn't dare to humiliate us.

661
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,540
Come and see the interesting things

662
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,140
we've brought for you.

663
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,580
I'm afraid

664
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,340
you've brought your entire wealth here.

665
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,500
What should I give you in return?

666
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,100
But I'm sure you know

667
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,700
I don't have much money
from staying home

668
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,380
all these years.

669
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,460
How about I give you
my weaved grasshoppers

670
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,500
for each of you?

671
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,340
You can give it to Song.

672
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,740
Giving gifts is nothing more
than one's intentions.

673
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,380
I'm contented

674
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,780
that you have such intention.

675
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,100
Niaoniao,

676
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,580
come and take a look at this first.

677
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,580
What is this?

678
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,220
Bamboo texts.

679
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,060
I'm sure you find these more interesting

680
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,860
than the ancient texts
that Mother gave you.

681
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,340
If you learn from these,

682
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,660
you'll learn faster.

683
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,380
Song,

684
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,860
where did you find this treasure?

685
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,300
It couldn't be any better.

686
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,380
Song didn't like to study

687
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,060
back in the day.

688
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,980
Eldest brother especially made
these bamboo texts to teach him.

689
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
Our eldest brother carved

690
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,500
all the paintings and scripts
of the heroic stories

691
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,260
of the battlefield himself.

692
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,860
Our eldest brother is so kind.

693
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,620
This bamboo text is also good.

694
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,380
When I first started studying,

695
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,700
Second Aunt said I mustn't be wasteful.

696
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,260
So she ordered me
to wash off the bamboo scrolls I used.

697
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,620
Then I would air them out,
dry them in the sun and by the fire.

698
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,380
I would stitch them together
with hemp thread to reuse them.

699
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,340
But everything split after several days.

700
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,700
That's absurd.

701
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,420
Our family doesn't lack money.

702
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,100
Father and Mother sent

703
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,020
trunks of money back home every year before.

704
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,740
There aren't many people
in the household.

705
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,580
It would still be enough
to eat a lavish meal every day.

706
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,300
How could she treat you ungenerously?

707
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,420
Rest assured.

708
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,460
If you need anything in the future,
you can tell me.

709
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,900
I will even pick stars in the sky

710
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,300
if you want them.

711
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,220
Niaoniao,

712
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,980
is this the bamboo scroll you mean

713
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,420
you've been reusing?

714
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
What about this writing desk?

715
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,700
That's my cousin's old desk.

716
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,580
It should be used by a child obviously.

717
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,620
You're all grown up now.

718
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,060
This is too low for you.

719
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,460
Is that so?

720
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,940
I never noticed.

721
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,620
You never noticed

722
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,140
because you're already used to it.

723
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,020
Let's put this aside for now.

724
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,900
I'll teach you how
to play with it in a while.

725
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,540
Eldest brother gave me

726
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,980
a writing desk in the past.

727
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,460
It's a rosewood writing desk
with qilins carved on four corners.

728
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,980
Since I'm no longer using it,

729
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,620
you can have it.

730
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,100
Thank you, Shaogong.

731
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,060
You're welcome.

732
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,660
I'll have someone send
it over right now.

733
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,820
You can spare the trouble, Shaogong.

734
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,060
Lianfang,

735
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,100
go and get it.

736
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,260
Yes, Young Lady.

737
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,780
Let me teach you how to play this.

738
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,420
Let me show you.

739
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,100
Be careful.

740
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,380
Lianfang.

741
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,140
Lianfang.

742
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,860
Where are you going
after making a huge display?

743
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,540
The Third Young Master is giving

744
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,460
a writing desk to my Young Lady.

745
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,460
He said he felt bad seeing
the state of her writing desk,

746
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,820
so he wanted her to study comfortably.

747
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,460
This writing desk is beautiful.

748
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,460
Lianfang,

749
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,940
my Young Lady wants

750
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,500
to custom make a writing desk too.

751
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,580
But I don't know anything
about the styles.

752
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,820
I wonder if you can take the trouble

753
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,900
and carry this writing desk
to my Young Lady's place

754
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,180
to show her the style.

755
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,900
We'll just make one similar to it.

756
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,500
You're asking the right person.

757
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,820
The Eldest Young Master custom made

758
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,780
this writing desk

759
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,340
for Third Young Master back then.

760
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,380
This style is rare.

761
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,740
Help her carry it.

762
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,140
Yes.

763
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,180
That's courteous of you.

764
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,860
Yangyang,

765
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,740
you've met the shopkeepers of shops.

766
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,460
If you have any questions,

767
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
you can ask them.

768
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,260
Thank you, First Aunt.

769
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,300
Lianfang and Changpu are fighting
in the courtyard.

770
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,500
You can do it.

771
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,580
First Madam.

772
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,860
Young Lady.

773
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,580
First Madam spent efforts in teaching you.

774
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,380
Why don't you invite her
to have some tea inside?

775
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,140
Spare the trouble.

776
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,740
It's no trouble at all.

777
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,420
Only when you're here,

778
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,740
does our Young Lady's courtyard
feel merrier.

779
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,860
Since Madam Ge left,

780
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,740
people in the household
have been treating us lightly.

781
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,180
No one is willing to come.

782
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,780
Young Lady has always been alone

783
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,900
without anyone to rely on.

784
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,820
She doesn't cry or complain.

785
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,580
Who can she talk to

786
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,340
when she needs to express her feelings?

787
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,300
First Aunt,

788
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,740
don't take what she said to heart.

789
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,220
You had a long day today.
You should get some rest.

790
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,620
I don't feel tired today.

791
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,180
So I'll come in for tea.

792
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,140
That's great.

793
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,300
Let's go. Don't just stand there.

794
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,900
You started it!

795
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,660
This belongs to my Young Lady.

796
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,900
Why your Young Lady owns this

797
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,980
while my Young Lady can't have one?

798
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,340
You should ask Third Young Master.

799
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,820
This belongs to my Young Lady.

800
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,860
It's now in our study room,
so it belongs to my Young Lady.

801
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,820
That's absurd.
It belongs to my Young Lady...

802
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,580
You hit me first.
Yet, you still want to argue.

803
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,100
That belongs to my Young Lady.

804
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,100
What are you doing?

805
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,100
Stop it, Lianfang!

806
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,660
Who gave you the right to hit her?

807
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,740
Changpu, what are you doing?

808
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,460
What's wrong?

809
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,860
Changpu! Wake up, Changpu.

810
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,260
I didn't even hit her that hard.

811
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,940
Changpu, wake up!

812
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,660
Open your eyes!

813
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,060
Changpu!

814
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,300
Why hasn't Lianfang returned yet?

815
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,540
Shaogong's room isn't that far away.

816
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,540
Perhaps she's hiding somewhere dallying.

817
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,580
That's not possible.

818
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,300
Lianfang is certainly not
that sort of person.

819
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,980
She's always honest and responsible.

820
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,100
Besides,

821
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,540
you may not know this.

822
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,780
But if it weren't for Lianfang
who stayed to take care of me,

823
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,420
I wouldn't be able
to survive until today.

824
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,100
Ms. Qing.

825
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,940
Young Lady,

826
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,860
