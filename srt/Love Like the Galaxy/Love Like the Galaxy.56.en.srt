=Episode 56=

3
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,071
Hurry, move it over there.

4
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,071
Now, move the kerosene away.

5
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:00,990
Remember,

6
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,751
it's highly flammable.

7
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,191
Do not place it under direct sunlight.

8
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:04,391
Yes, Young Lady.

9
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,551
Young Lady,

10
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:08,510
I've followed your instruction

11
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,950
and located the well of the village.

12
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,990
However, there's only one well here.

13
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,711
And, the pond here isn't deep.

14
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,351
If the village does burn,

15
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,110
I'm afraid we won't be able to keep it.

16
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,150
Although Guo Village
is located in the mountains,

17
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:29,351
it's always known
as the world's granary.

18
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,870
One year's worth of grain
produced by this village

19
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,110
can sustain several capitals.

20
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,150
Since they have crops here,

21
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:34,951
why would they have no water source?

22
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,271
I'm sure they're located
somewhere we don't know.

23
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,751
Qi.

24
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,391
Young Lady.

25
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,110
Send someone to inquire about
where the villagers obtain water

26
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,271
to irrigate their crops.

27
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:45,590
Yes, Young Lady.

28
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:46,951
Wait.

29
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,831
Yes, Young Lady?

30
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,750
(He has already hidden 100 stones'
worth of kerosene on the road)

31
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,230
(as Crown Prince
makes his way to Guo Village.)

32
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,111
Huo Buyi,

33
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,271
you won't be able to split yourself.

34
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,310
You can never provide help in time.

35
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,030
Since Tian Shuo has prepared
100 stones' worth of kerosene,

36
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,551
I'm sure he's not just going
to target one village.

37
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:12,911
According to the ancient records,

38
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:16,230
the wind is produced by the flame.

39
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,590
It travels upward and downward.

40
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,191
Once something gets on fire,

41
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,790
the wind will blow toward high ground

42
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,191
and spread the fire.

43
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,230
By then, the crops in Guo Village

44
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,510
wouldn't be the only things
that would catch on fire.

45
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,551
Tian Shuo is trying to jeopardize

46
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:32,670
the harvest of the State of Yu.

47
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,150
He wants the people to run out of food

48
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,150
and ruins the foothold of the nation.

49
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,111
Watch out!

50
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:10,831
I'll seek out the enemy!

51
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,431
I'll put out the fire.

52
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,030
What's going on?

53
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,470
We discovered kerosene inside

54
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,590
the jars villagers used to
make preserved vegetables.

55
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,630
They're everywhere!

56
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,231
Young Lady.

57
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,150
Someone!

58
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,391
Bring us water!

59
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,511
Save him!

60
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,431
Use the sand!
Put out the fire with sand!

61
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:30,750
Bring the sand here!

62
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,150
Hurry! Bring the sand here!

63
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,590
Huo Buyi,

64
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,511
you didn't expect this, right?

65
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,150
You thought you'd predicted
every possible scenario, huh?

66
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,470
Actually, everything goes
according to my plan.

67
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,510
200 of my men and 100 stones of kerosene
are in Guo Village right now.

68
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,190
All the people in the world have to die

69
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,070
when I ruin their excellent crops!

70
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:09,710
Your emperor is a virtuous one, right?

71
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,911
If you abandon the people

72
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,431
to save his descendants,

73
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,870
I would like to see

74
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,270
how you could face

75
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,190
the people of the world!

76
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,950
Zisheng, forget about me.

77
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,190
Go and save Guo Village.

78
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,710
Save the crops and its people.

79
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,431
Shaoshang is in Guo Village.

80
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,351
Guo Village will be fine.

81
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:29,231
Since Cheng Shaoshang is in Guo Village,

82
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,870
you should save her.

83
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,510
You've let her down once.

84
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:33,870
Now, she's in danger.

85
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,991
If you abandon her again,

86
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,991
I'm afraid she'll never forgive you.

87
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,390
Will you lose her again

88
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,270
and regret it all your life?

89
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:04,870
Get up!

90
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,310
Watch out for the fire arrows!

91
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,270
Ladies and the elderly
should evacuate first!

92
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,911
The others, follow me
and put out the fire!

93
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:16,390
Watch out!

94
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,870
Young Lady, you should retreat.

95
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:27,630
There are too many of them!

96
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,390
Just go!

97
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,151
Run!

98
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:40,870
Huo Buyi,

99
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,231
you think you guys
are a virtuous bunch, huh?

100
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:44,630
I thought you served
the nation and its people?

101
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,111
In the end, you forsook the people
because of the nobles!

102
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,510
Run!

103
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,231
Hurry! Just go!

104
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,870
In order to please Emperor Wen,

105
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,911
in order to save this useless crown prince,

106
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,111
you're forsaking the woman you love!

107
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:01,591
You guys are truly pretentious!

108
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,591
Zisheng, you should head to Guo Village
and save Shaoshang.

109
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:09,710
I trust her.

110
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,431
Shaoshang and I
have come to an agreement.

111
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,070
The world will be our priority.

112
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,270
We shall share our burdens
and defend against our enemies together.

113
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,151
With Shaoshang's intelligence,

114
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,270
I'm sure she can protect Guo Village

115
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:26,830
and weather the storm.

116
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,351
Protect Young Lady and evacuate!

117
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,031
I won't leave!

118
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,791
I believe that she's different
from the person she was five years ago.

119
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,870
This time, she will
never blame me for this.

120
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,431
I trust her.

121
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:44,791
I trust her.

122
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,671
Zisheng trusts me.

123
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:50,911
Even if I die,

124
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,510
I will protect the people behind me

125
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:55,151
and the crops.

126
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,271
Come on!

127
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,431
Kill me!

128
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,511
Ling Buyi,

129
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:29,631
you're such a pitiful soul.

130
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,710
The entire Huo Family
suffered a tragic death.

131
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,230
However, Emperor Wen actually promoted
the culprit instead.

132
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,350
In order to seek revenge,
you went against everyone

133
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,950
and fell out with your beloved.

134
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,110
You're just a lackey to those in power!

135
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:01,070
To die by your hands

136
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,110
is a virtuous ending!

137
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,151
You want to provoke me
so that I can kill you, huh?

138
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,230
I heard that all famous officials

139
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,590
and people in the palace
were buried together with Emperor Li

140
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,031
when he passed away.

141
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,911
You're only able to survive until now

142
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,950
because you are unknown.

143
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,070
You are as insignificant as an ant!

144
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,031
Shut up!

145
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:24,950
I'm deeply indebted to Master!

146
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,470
Why would he see me as an ant?

147
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,310
Master

148
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,190
didn't want me to join him in his grave

149
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,190
and allow me to stay alive

150
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,310
so that I could avenge him!

151
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:34,151
Are you sure he wanted you
to avenge him?

152
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,990
Or did he never remember your name
in the first place?

153
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,990
That's nonsense!

154
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,190
Of course Master remembers me!

155
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,310
I'm his favorite subject!

156
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,551
Now, the world will be destroyed by my hands!

157
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:46,990
I've already fulfilled his dying wish!

158
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,830
Everyone in the world
will remember my name!

159
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,230
Stop deceiving yourself.

160
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,590
You always thought that
you were one step faster than me.

161
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,830
But in the end,

162
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,431
you still achieved nothing.

163
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,391
This empire won't fall.

164
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:10,710
No one in this world

165
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,230
will remember you.

166
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,551
Head to Guo Village!

167
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:23,791
Yes, sir!

168
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,830
Stand back!

169
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:03,631
Young Lady!

170
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,511
No one shall lay a hand on Niaoniao!

171
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,350
Niaoniao,

172
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:08,031
I'm here to aid you.

173
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,710
Father, Mother,

174
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,271
handle the enemy for me

175
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:14,190
and create an opportunity.

176
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,391
I'll put out the fire.

177
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:16,271
Understood!

178
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,271
Understood!

179
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,950
Shaogong,

180
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,230
bring some men

181
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,871
and deepen the drain

182
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,590
between the village and
the mountain stream.

183
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,710
As long as there are no plants around,

184
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,830
the fire won't reach the mountains.

185
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,031
Shaogong, it all

186
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,230
depends on you now.

187
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,350
Understood!

188
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:34,110
Qiqi, Song, open a path for me.

189
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,631
Me, Cheng Yang, and her husband

190
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,151
will provide enough sand
to put out the fire.

191
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:38,871
Understood!

192
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,631
Understood!

193
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,590
-Understood!
-Understood!

194
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,070
General Cheng.

195
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,751
Where's Shaoshang?

196
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,871
We managed to save Guo Village.

197
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,031
We won.

198
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,551
We won.

199
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:17,990
Why are you crying?

200
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,710
It's not like your face was hurt.

201
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,111
It won't affect you from getting a wife.

202
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,190
Why are you crying?

203
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:23,950
That's not it.

204
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,790
I've let down Young Master

205
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:28,671
and Young Lady.

206
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,151
When we were in the Northwest,

207
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,270
I even intended for Young Master
to marry Luo Jitong.

208
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,270
Now,

209
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,871
Young Master and Young Lady

210
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:40,151
are finally getting married.

211
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:41,990
I can finally have some peace of mind.

212
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,591
You guys were deceived because

213
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,750
you didn't know women well.

214
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,950
In the future, I'll bring you two around
and expand your horizon.

215
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,510
We'll enjoy the company of

216
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,311
the dancers of Western Regions

217
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,470
and the songstresses of Nanyue.

218
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,431
Where are you heading
to expand your horizon, huh?

219
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,550
That's right.

220
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,030
I don't need to expand my horizon.

221
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,230
My wife

222
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,351
is my entire world.

223
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:16,071
You two, don't lead me astray.

224
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,831
Go there.

225
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,431
This is amazing.

226
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,151
I just made another divination.

227
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:41,510
According to it,

228
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,071
our family will have
another joyous occasion.

229
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,151
Let's guess who will be the next.

230
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,671
Say, you're not young anymore.

231
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:50,151
Even if you're not willing
to get married,

232
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:51,431
you should prepare for
the imperial exam.

233
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:53,311
Stop playing with things like these.

234
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:55,831
You guys don't understand.

235
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:59,750
Only laymen would prefer
getting married and having children.

236
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:02,950
I plan to travel around,

237
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,671
enjoy the great scenery out there,

238
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,710
and experience the world for myself.

239
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,190
By then,

240
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,230
I will surely find my own path.

241
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:11,790
You can just do another divination
for yourself

242
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,510
if you wish to find your path.

243
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,631
Your divination is not accurate at all.

244
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,351
Song,

245
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,190
according to my divination,

246
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,671
your blood will be shed tonight.

247
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:34,470
Qiqi,

248
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,151
I will tell you

249
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:38,351
all about Song's

250
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,510
eight female friends.

251
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,071
Cheng Song.

252
00:21:57,871 --> 00:21:59,591
You actually had

253
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:06,071
eight female friends, huh?

254
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,351
Aren't you afraid that
you'll die of exhaustion?

255
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,950
Look at

256
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,030
how capable you are.

257
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:23,750
Since that's the case,

258
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,071
why don't you let me
beat you to death first?

259
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:27,710
Stop hitting me!

260
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,111
I'll kill you!

261
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,550
How long do you plan on lying down?

262
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,591
Shaoshang has asked me this
several times.

263
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:45,151
Did I take your medicine

264
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:47,030
or consume your food?

265
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:48,911
What's with all the nagging?

266
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:52,230
Although you didn't sponge off us,

267
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,270
you're making my fiancee worried.

268
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,311
That means you're going against me.

269
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,030
Tell her

270
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:04,391
that I'm doing fine.

271
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,671
However, the Crown Prince

272
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:09,311
needs to return to the capital
to report his progress.

273
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:11,790
You should

274
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,710
leave now.

275
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,911
Since that's the case,

276
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:20,111
I shall take my leave.

277
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:21,990
Wait.

278
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:34,591
General Huo,

279
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,030
I'll tell you one last thing.

280
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:39,591
I always thought

281
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:41,790
that Shaoshang was just like me.

282
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,671
In reality, I was wrong.

283
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,671
Due to my parents,

284
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:50,431
I hated deep

285
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,230
and loyal feelings for one's beloved.

286
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,391
Since young, I thought

287
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,911
that deep feelings

288
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,871
were just like sharpened swords

289
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,710
and deadly poison.

290
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:05,391
I thought it would ruin my future

291
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,510
and tone down my ambitions.

292
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:12,431
To me, husband and wife

293
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:14,831
should treat each other like guests.

294
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:17,631
But Shaoshang said otherwise.

295
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,230
She often said

296
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:24,470
that she was cold-blooded and selfish.

297
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:28,911
Even so, she was envious of her parents
for their loving relationship.

298
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:36,550
Actually,

299
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,750
you two are the same instead.

300
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:54,151
Yuan Shanjian,

301
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:57,790
I used to hate you in the past.

302
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,391
However, for the past five years,

303
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,030
you were the person
I was most grateful to.

304
00:25:07,391 --> 00:25:09,470
When she was at her lowest moment,

305
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:13,550
you were there by her side.

306
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,710
But don't worry.

307
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:19,831
From now on,

308
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,990
I will never make her sad again.

309
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,631
You better don't.

310
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,470
If not...

311
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:28,950
That won't happen.

312
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,790
You knew that I would be in danger
when I was in Guo Village.

313
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,151
Even so, why did you
come late to my rescue?

314
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:43,631
You told me to trust you.

315
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,311
Don't you think you trust me too much?

316
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,831
Weren't you afraid that
something might happen to me?

317
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:57,750
Of course I was.

318
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:04,071
However, I've already made up my mind.

319
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,071
If something happens to you,

320
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,591
I will never live by myself.

321
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:21,391
Stop spouting nonsense.

322
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,351
I was just joking around.

323
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:42,750
I'm already content

324
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,831
that you trust me

325
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,111
and allow me

326
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,550
to share your burdens with you.

327
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:55,510
Even if something does happen

328
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,071
to me one day,

329
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:01,710
I want you to live on.

330
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,591
I want you to live
a better life than before.

331
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:17,940
(Yongle Palace)

332
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:34,030
Look.

333
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,111
It's a shooting star.

334
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:38,871
It's an auspicious sign.

335
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,591
If Shen'an was still alive,

336
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:50,990
I'm sure she would be happy

337
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:54,631
for Zisheng and Shaoshang.

338
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,591
Now,

339
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,151
they've finally reunited
with each other.

340
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,750
Maybe

341
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,230
Shen'an was silently

342
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:07,911
blessing them

343
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,071
from the heavens.

344
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:24,391
Do the deceased

345
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,151
truly turn into stars?

346
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:32,351
In the past,

347
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,550
I used to gaze at the stars

348
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:39,550
just like this.

349
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,990
I would wonder if my parents
and siblings

350
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,950
had turned into stars

351
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:48,911
and were watching me from above.

352
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,071
After that, I realized

353
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:56,911
that they would respond to me.

354
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,270
How do they respond to you?

355
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,351
You can try speaking to them.

356
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:07,550
The stars will glitter

357
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,030
if they hear you.

358
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,111
You can give it a try.

359
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,950
Your Majesty,

360
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:25,391
I'm Shaoshang.

361
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,311
Did you hear me?

362
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,671
That star did glow for a moment!

363
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,831
Your Majesty.

364
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,111
Father,

365
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,470
Mother,

366
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,111
I found the one for me.

367
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:15,750
Did you guys see it?

368
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,270
They did.

369
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,671
They did.

370
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,311
Her Majesty

371
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,391
always wanted us

372
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,270
to reconcile with each other.

373
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,510
Right now,

374
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:08,591
she must be happy for us.

375
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,351
You've worn it for many years.

376
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,311
Whenever I see it,

377
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:32,591
I always feel like

378
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:36,311
a part of my heart is warm.

379
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,190
There's something

380
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:43,710
I should've told you long ago.

381
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:46,990
Zisheng,

382
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:49,391
your character

383
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:51,151
and personality

384
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,950
are just like a newborn child's.

385
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,550
You're the best man

386
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,790
in the world.

387
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,270
I'm lucky

388
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,270
to be able to encounter you.

389
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,710
Shaoshang,

390
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:16,311
you're the purest,

391
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,710
kindest,

392
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:22,351
and most steadfast lady
I've ever encountered.

393
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,871
You're

394
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,710
the best lady

395
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,111
in the world.

396
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,071
I'm lucky

397
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,831
to be able

398
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:45,510
to encounter you.

399
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:40,790
General.

400
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,270
General Huo.

401
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:42,831
Huo Buyi,

402
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:46,831
I'll leave my daughter to you now.

403
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,790
If you dare to let her down,

404
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,030
the entire Cheng Family

405
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:51,550
will bring our weapons

406
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,751
and demand justice for Niaoniao

407
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:53,990
in your residence.

408
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,191
Sure.

409
00:36:57,871 --> 00:36:58,871
The Cheng Family has

410
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,110
kind and excellent people.

411
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,791
The heavens did bless us.

412
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:38,630
I knew

413
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:41,110
that I was a fortunate person.

414
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:43,070
Look.

415
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:45,711
My eldest son

416
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:48,110
got himself an excellent wife.

417
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,110
Yuanyi had rendered
merit once again.

418
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,990
That's not all.

419
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,630
I just read Third Young Master's letter.

420
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,791
Second Young Master and his wife
had rendered merit as well.

421
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:00,670
There's General Huo too.

422
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:03,950
I heard that Fourth Lady
and General Huo

423
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:05,911
will get married in Hua County soon!

424
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,070
They're getting married,

425
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,550
not engaged.

426
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,150
This time,

427
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:14,791
I'll get the dowries for sure!

428
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,391
For sure.

429
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:27,231
I want to see

430
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:28,231
if anyone

431
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:31,990
is daring enough to mess up
my granddaughter's wedding.

432
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,670
Who allowed them
to get married in Hua County?

433
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,751
Both of her parents are in Hua County.

434
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,030
Why can't they hold their wedding

435
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,311
for them in Hua County?

436
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,630
But...

437
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:43,670
Your Majesty,

438
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:45,791
you've fretted about Zisheng's wedding

439
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,271
for so many years.

440
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:48,871
Now, he has finally settled down.

441
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:49,990
You have to be happy for him.

442
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,391
It's Zisheng's wedding!

443
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:53,030
How could I not be around?

444
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,191
How could they get married
in Hua County?

445
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:55,431
This doesn't make sense!

446
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,590
This doesn't count!

447
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,990
I will never agree to this.

448
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,231
Hurry! Summon them immediately!

449
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:03,670
We will hold their wedding again
in the capital!

450
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:05,550
Your Majesty,
you're going overboard here.

451
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,550
Am I?

452
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,630
They're the ones going overboard here.

453
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,110
I've been waiting for this day

454
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:13,231
for so many years.

455
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:14,070
Now that the day has arrived,

456
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,550
I'm actually not there to attend it?

457
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:17,831
It doesn't count
as long as I'm not there!

458
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,110
Do you know who I am?

459
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,751
I'm the emperor!

460
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,150
I decide

461
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:24,950
what the world will do!

462
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,871
Moreover...

463
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,070
Shut the door.

464
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,310
(Yongle Palace)

465
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:33,150
(Yongle Palace)
It doesn't count even if you shut the door on me!

466
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:48,030
What were you guys smiling at?

467
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,431
When I was observing the night sky,

468
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,030
I performed divination for you.

469
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:54,990
It seems like you don't have...

470
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,070
Shut up.

471
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,351
The sky tonight

472
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:03,950
