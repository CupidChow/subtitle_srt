1
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like The Galaxy=

2
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,840
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:48,813
As ruler and subject,

4
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:50,893
gold is the element.

5
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:53,612
As father and child,

6
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,532
wood is the element.

7
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:57,333
As siblings,

8
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,652
fire is the element.

9
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,413
As husband and wife,

10
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,333
water is the element.

11
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,213
Seems like she's going to
have good luck in love.

12
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:14,853
Seems like Niaoniao

13
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,052
might find a better man

14
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,692
after losing out on Lou Yao.

15
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:21,773
Excuse me.

16
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,373
(Ban Jia)
Do you know the way back?

17
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,140
(Ban Jia)

18
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:27,853
Oh no.

19
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:31,012
She's going to suffer
bad luck in love instead.

20
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:33,773
This...

21
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:38,853
Qiqi,

22
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,413
didn't you say

23
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:42,373
that Young Marquis Ban held this hunt

24
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,532
in order to make acquaintances
with everyone?

25
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,972
Where is he then?

26
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:48,773
That's right.

27
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:50,492
Shaogong

28
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:51,692
isn't here as well.

29
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:54,373
He needs a quiet spot

30
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,293
to perform divination.

31
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:04,773
Li.

32
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,333
Someone is shameless indeed.

33
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:34,853
She loves to flock
to places filled with men.

34
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,092
What are you saying?

35
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,853
She's one to talk
when she's present herself.

36
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,572
How could you put us on
the same level as you?

37
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:43,092
Lady Wang's father is
the Cavalry General.

38
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:46,012
She has been practicing mounted archery
with her father all along.

39
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,413
She's here to have a competition,

40
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:51,733
unlike someone else.

41
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:53,933
Who do you mean?

42
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,172
She wasn't embarrassed even though
her marriage was canceled.

43
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,453
She actually has the guts to go outside.

44
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:00,773
Shaoshang only canceled the marriage
out of her respect

45
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,253
for the heroes of the He Family.

46
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:03,572
She fulfilled their dying wish.

47
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:06,413
Lady Wang, why did you make it

48
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,733
sound like something embarrassing?

49
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:09,092
Could it be

50
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:10,652
that you think slaying enemies

51
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:13,373
on the battlefield and sacrificing
one's life for the nation

52
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:15,453
are embarrassing deeds?

53
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,933
Qiqi, you may ignore her.

54
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:21,012
When have I said that sacrificing one's
life for the nation is embarrassing?

55
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:23,333
Since when did I say that?

56
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:24,773
Besides,

57
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,612
my father is the Cavalry General.

58
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,453
He taught me mounted archery before.

59
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:30,012
I'm not inferior to you.

60
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:34,373
Someone is trying to show off
even though

61
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,572
she's only a beginner.

62
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,532
We grew up

63
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,293
on the back of horses.

64
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:40,333
Even so, we never
bragged about our skills.

65
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:42,413
Shameless wretch.

66
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:43,612
Wan Qiqi,

67
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:44,813
don't be too full of yourself.

68
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,773
Have a competition with me if you dare.

69
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,253
Come on then.
Do you think I'm scared of you?

70
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:50,453
Come on!

71
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:51,213
Qiqi.

72
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:53,972
Qiqi!

73
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:55,253
I'll spar with her.

74
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:56,453
This is bad.

75
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,692
I never expected

76
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:24,092
the proud Lady Cheng

77
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:26,853
to be this subservient.

78
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,733
I've already told you the story
of Changmen Fu, haven't I?

79
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:31,572
Why do you still not understand?

80
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,373
A life without love

81
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,652
is truly free.

82
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,413
Seems like the talented gentleman
of Mount Bailu

83
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,092
has turned into a bigmouth.

84
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:43,492
Yuan Shanjian, listen up.

85
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:44,933
I don't wish to talk to you today.

86
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,213
You better shut up.

87
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:50,253
You can enjoy your free life

88
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:53,333
without any love.

89
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:00,413
Master,

90
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:03,052
regarding Changmen Fu...

91
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:04,532
All right. I understand.

92
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,492
It's Mr. Yuan Shanjian!

93
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,652
Mr. Yuan Shanjian!

94
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:21,333
Ladies,

95
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,012
please calm down.

96
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,373
I heard that there's a path ahead.

97
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:28,853
Calm down.

98
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,092
Slow down.

99
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:33,612
Please calm down.

100
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,813
You actually got lost
when we're this near to the campsite?

101
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,333
Even if you can't recognize the road,

102
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:41,532
you can actually tell

103
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:42,692
from the loud noise over there.

104
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,893
I really wonder how you managed
to survive until now.

105
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,092
My parents said

106
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:48,213
that I was difficult
to raise since young.

107
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,333
That's why they didn't allow me
to head outside.

108
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:51,453
You and I are fated to meet.
You're my first friend.

109
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,853
This is ill-fated.

110
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,092
I wouldn't have gotten the ill love lot

111
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:57,453
if you didn't kick my divination
by accident.

112
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:59,213
What is the ill love lot?

113
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,280
-Mr. Yuan.
-Mr. Yuan, wait.

114
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:07,853
Slow down.

115
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:08,692
Calm down.

116
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
-Mr. Yuan.
-Mr. Yuan, slow down.

117
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:15,652
Please stop chasing after me.

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,300
-Slow down.
-Slow down, Mr. Yuan.

119
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,092
This is

120
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:20,893
the power of the ill love lot.

121
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,200
Please stop following me.

122
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:23,733
It's scary when there are so many people.

123
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:25,733
It's even scarier
when all of them are girls.

124
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,240
-Mr. Yuan, wait.
-Mr. Yuan, slow down.

125
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:48,773
The peach tree beams so red,

126
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:50,453
how brilliant are its flowers.

127
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,172
The maiden’s getting wed,

128
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:54,092
good for the nuptial bowers.

129
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,612
Seems like I'm in luck today.

130
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:36,920
(Yanhui Tower)

131
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,773
(So, this is how they build towers.)

132
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:55,532
(It's actually structured
like an umbrella.)

133
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:57,853
(The sole pillar acts as the support.)

134
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:00,013
(The scattered bucket  structure)

135
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,133
(will shoulder the weight of the tower.)

136
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:03,812
(This is amazing indeed.)

137
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,280
(Yanhui Tower)

138
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:03,253
(I just lost a husband-to-be.)

139
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,652
(So what?)

140
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:08,093
(I am still me.)

141
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:25,133
Now that Lou Yao had married
the daughter of the He Family,

142
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:28,932
His Majesty felt sorry
for the Lou Family.

143
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,213
He's being more and more
lenient toward the Lou Family.

144
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,780
His Majesty even turned a blind eye

145
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,860
to Grand Tutor Lou's despicable deeds
of suppressing officials

146
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,620
of ordinary birth by taking advantage

147
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,420
of the Eastern Palace's influence.

148
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,660
If we want His Majesty to be entirely
disappointed with the Eastern Palace,

149
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,100
we need...

150
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,460
The Eastern Palace
houses a bunch of useless fools.

151
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,820
I'm sure His Majesty will strip
the crown prince of his position.

152
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:57,852
Who's there?

153
00:11:58,173 --> 00:11:59,173
Go and check it out.

154
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:08,973
Don't move!

155
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,013
Don't be scared.

156
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:46,812
Don't move! Hold tight!

157
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:52,173
Don't let go!

158
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,973
I heard a sound from
three floors below us.

159
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:03,053
How did the person disappear
all of a sudden?

160
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,013
Let's go and check it out.

161
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:10,213
Get up!

162
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:51,213
Come inside!

163
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:56,572
You can head back for now.

164
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,173
I'll send some men to search the area.

165
00:13:58,612 --> 00:13:59,373
Don't worry.

166
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:02,453
I'll find the culprit

167
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:04,652
even if it means I have
to flip the hill upside down.

168
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:19,453
General Ling, are you okay?

169
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:22,732
What about you?

170
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:25,013
Were you frightened?

171
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,612
General, did you sustain this injury
in Feng Yi County?

172
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:31,173
It's just an old injury of mine.

173
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:32,812
It doesn't matter.

174
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:35,892
Lady Cheng,

175
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:40,612
what did you hear just now?

176
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,173
I heard something about

177
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:46,173
stripping the crown prince's position...

178
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:47,373
You heard nothing.

179
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:52,013
You heard nothing.

180
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:54,892
Do you understand?

181
00:14:59,213 --> 00:14:59,892
That's right.

182
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,492
I heard nothing.

183
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:03,612
I was just passing by

184
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,652
while I was taking my walk.

185
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,053
You've never passed by this area before.

186
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:10,812
You must keep today's matter

187
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:12,612
a secret.

188
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,053
Do not let anyone know about this.

189
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:24,812
Let's go.

190
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,173
Let me send you back.

191
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,532
No need for that, General Ling.

192
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,532
General Ling, thank you for rescuing me.

193
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:32,213
My horse is nearby.

194
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:33,532
I will head back myself.

195
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,013
It's unsafe for you to do so.

196
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:37,652
Let me send you back.

197
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:40,453
Let's go.

198
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,612
Wang Ling,

199
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,532
it doesn't matter

200
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:16,812
if you fire the last arrow or not.

201
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:17,973
What about this?

202
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,133
I'll go easy on you.

203
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,892
You don't need to do mounted archery.

204
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,053
You can stand in front of the target.

205
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:25,692
It's your win if you hit it.
What do you think?

206
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,173
Good boy.

207
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:35,692
Fine!

208
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:35,812
Stop!

209
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:16,732
Wan Qiqi!

210
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,053
Be careful! Stop now!

211
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:20,013
The horse was startled! I can't tame it!

212
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:05,133
Song!

213
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:06,053
Song!

214
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:07,732
Song, were you hurt anywhere? Get up!

215
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:10,173
Don't move!

216
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:11,453
Don't look!

217
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:12,652
Why can't I look?

218
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:13,892
Cheng Song, listen up.

219
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:14,932
If you're crippled
because of this incident,

220
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:15,973
I'll support you forever.

221
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:19,053
You mustn't look!

222
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:21,732
I've seen plenty of situations
like these in the military camp.

223
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:23,093
Why can't I look?

224
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:30,333
I did tell you not to look, didn't I?

225
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:31,572
You just had to look, hadn't you?

226
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:32,732
Now,

227
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,532
you have to be responsible for me
for the rest of your life.

228
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:49,373
We're here.

229
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,013
General Ling, thank you
for saving me once again.

230
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,213
I don't know when
I'll be able to repay the favor.

231
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:56,333
Before this,

232
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,253
I even said I would play the flute for
you when you returned victoriously...

233
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,812
This is not the time for this.

234
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,133
Lady Cheng,

235
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:05,333
are you truly not
worried about your life?

236
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,133
Why do you say so?

237
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,492
General Ling,

238
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:22,852
that is my jade pendant.

239
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:24,572
My nickname is on it.

240
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,333
Ruoruo?

241
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,932
That's an interesting nickname.

242
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,173
What Ruoruo?

243
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,053
It's Niaoniao.

244
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:38,013
But half of the pendant is missing.

245
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,293
If those two got a hold

246
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:44,692
of your pendant,

247
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,173
they would know that
you eavesdropped on their conversation.

248
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,013
Say, do you think it's better

249
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:53,572
for them to keep it?

250
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,093
Or do you think
it's better for me to keep it?

251
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,333
Both choices

252
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:01,253
are terrible.

253
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,373
You should let me keep it.

254
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:04,812
However, even without the pendant,

255
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,892
they can find out who eavesdropped

256
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,572
on their conversation
by doing a headcount.

257
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:10,612
Why are we still here then?

258
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:12,772
We should hurry back before
they do a headcount.

259
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,612
General Ling, your injury...

260
00:21:30,492 --> 00:21:31,612
I'm lucky that I was injured before.

261
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:45,532
What a disgrace!

262
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,253
(Empress Xuan)
People are easily excited during spring and summer.

263
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,932
Young Marquis Ban prepared
so many exciting events for them.

264
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:58,612
Those lads and ladies
are young and vigorous.

265
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,213
I can understand

266
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:02,812
if they get carried away.

267
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:03,892
What do you mean?

268
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:05,532
The lady from the Wan Family and Ling

269
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:06,892
almost lost their lives

270
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:07,852
because of a trifle!

271
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,413
The brat from the Cheng Family

272
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,253
was even wounded because of it.

273
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:12,812
And those ladies,

274
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:16,133
they chase after Yuan Shanjian
whenever they see him.

275
00:22:16,373 --> 00:22:17,532
What a disgrace!

276
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:18,612
And,

277
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:19,652
I've already heard

278
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:23,532
that some young couples
have been caught.

279
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:25,812
They went overboard this time.

280
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:28,892
Why do you think I came to Mount Tugao?

281
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,932
I came here to pray for
my people's fortune.

282
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:33,293
Yet, they came here to commit
such audacious acts?

283
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:36,133
Ridiculous.

284
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:38,133
It's an utter disgrace!

285
00:22:38,812 --> 00:22:39,732
Your Majesty, it's my fault

286
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:41,932
for not disciplining Wang Ling well.

287
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:43,242
(Noble Consort Yue)
Your Majesty, why are you

288
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,772
(Noble Consort Yue)
taking the blame for everything?

289
00:22:45,492 --> 00:22:46,492
Your Majesty, in my opinion,

290
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,692
this isn't a huge deal at all.

291
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:51,572
Your Majesty, in the past,
you scaled the palace wall

292
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,213
to reach the backyard so that
you could meet me in secret.

293
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,013
You even fell into the drain before.

294
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:58,692
It's not strange for young people

295
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:01,293
to mingle around and have some fun.

296
00:23:01,492 --> 00:23:02,373
Heng,

297
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:06,173
why did you bring up the past?

298
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:08,852
So, Your Majesty,
how do you plan to deal with them?

299
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:11,013
Naturally, I'll punish them severely.

300
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:34,333
Say, do you think His Majesty
will blame us for this?

301
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:35,973
Why don't I tell His Majesty

302
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:37,013
that everything was my fault

303
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:37,973
and that it has nothing to do with you?

304
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:39,652
How could it have nothing to do with me?

305
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:42,253
His Majesty wouldn't have been furious

306
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,333
if I didn't bleed during
the prayer ceremony

307
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,253
and render the ceremony inauspicious.

308
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:46,812
Even so, you did so to save me.

309
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:48,812
In my opinion,

310
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:50,293
it's all Wang Ling's fault.

311
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,732
It's all because she bore
a grudge against Niaoniao.

312
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,133
That's why she hated it
when I stood up for Niaoniao.

313
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:57,973
Be careful.

314
00:23:58,093 --> 00:23:59,652
The wound is getting wider and wider.

315
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:00,812
I'll fix it for you when we get back.

316
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:03,093
His Majesty is here.

317
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:04,213
Both of you, shut up.

318
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:12,692
Dear, you do not need to worry.

319
00:24:13,013 --> 00:24:15,293
Song was wounded
because he tried to save someone.

320
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:17,572
His Majesty won't punish him severely.

321
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,013
I'm not worried about Song.

322
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,333
General, have you seen
Niaoniao around today?

323
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:28,093
What if His Majesty found out that
Niaoniao didn't return here?

324
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:30,053
What should we do by then?

325
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:31,532
You're right.

326
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:33,732
Where's Niaoniao?

327
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:41,333
Your Majesty!

328
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:43,013
Your Majesty!

329
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:45,652
Your Majesty, General Ling has returned.

330
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,692
He returned together with
Fourth Lady Cheng.

331
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:52,532
I heard that General Ling
risked his life to save

332
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,213
Fourth Lady Cheng when
she almost fell off a cliff.

333
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:55,692
Due to that, his old wound opened up.

334
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:58,932
Fourth Lady Cheng is crying profusely.

335
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:01,093
She said she would repay
General Ling with her life.

336
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:05,133
He went to save Fourth Lady Cheng again?

337
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:12,492
Good.

338
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:15,932
Zisheng

339
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:19,093
does resemble the past me now.

340
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,053
Your Majesty, you haven't told me

341
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,133
how you plan to punish them.

342
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,213
Our goal is to pray for our people

343
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:29,852
and have some fun while we're here.

344
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:32,973
It's common

345
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:36,293
for young people like them to be playful

346
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:38,572
and impulsive.

347
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:39,652
Besides,

348
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,253
didn't I behave just like them
when I was young?

349
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:46,772
Am I right?

350
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:52,013
All right. I shall not
pursue responsibilities

351
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:54,692
against those young people.

352
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,253
Cao Cheng,

353
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:59,253
let's go and check on Zisheng.

354
00:25:59,253 --> 00:25:59,973
Yes, Your Majesty.

355
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,333
Your Majesty, slow down!

356
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:05,612
My dear subjects.

357
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,053
Get up.

358
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:13,373
Thank you, Your Majesty.

359
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:14,852
I'm not talking to you.

360
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:15,973
Go.

361
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,253
Cheng Shi, please get up.

362
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:20,532
Your Majesty.

363
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:22,572
Let's go.

364
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:23,932
Follow me.

365
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,413
Be honest with me.

366
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:36,932
What exactly happened?

367
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:40,093
I almost fell off a cliff.

368
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:42,652
General Ling's old wound

369
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:45,133
reopened after he saved me.

370
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,932
I feel terrible.

371
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:50,612
All right.

372
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,253
That's good enough.

373
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:55,973
Just repeat the same thing

374
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:57,732
to His Majesty when we see His Majesty later.

375
00:26:58,612 --> 00:26:59,612
His Majesty?

376
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:01,772
All right.

377
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:04,532
General Ling,

378
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:07,692
please rest well. I shall take my leave.

379
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:11,692
I got injured because of you.

380
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,053
Is this how you treat me?

381
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:16,492
His Majesty has arrived.

382
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:26,053
Zisheng.

383
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:28,173
Did you get hurt again?

384
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,732
You were too careless.

385
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:34,053
Greetings, Your Majesty.

386
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:38,532
Shaoshang,

387
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:40,732
you better greet His Majesty properly.

388
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:51,732
Greetings, Your Majesty.

389
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:53,572
Greetings, Your Majesty.

390
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:56,973
Tell His Majesty your name
before you initiate your greeting.

391
00:27:59,013 --> 00:27:59,852
Your Majesty,

392
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,652
my daughter, Cheng Shaoshang,
is not familiar with imperial customs.

393
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,293
Please pardon her.

394
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:08,492
Let me ask you something.

395
00:28:09,093 --> 00:28:12,253
How exactly did Zisheng's
old wound open up?

396
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:26,253
Lady Cheng was riding a horse

397
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,572
when she almost
fell off a cliff by accident.

398
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:29,293
I was passing by.

399
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:30,652
Therefore, I saved her.

400
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:32,492
That's why the old wound
on my shoulder reopened.

401
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:37,453
So, it's because you saved her?

402
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:40,572
Lady Cheng,

403
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:41,973
have you met Zisheng

404
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,413
before this accident?

405
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,373
We've met several times before.

406
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:47,612
That's why I could not ignore her.

407
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:50,772
I'm asking Lady Cheng, not you.

408
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:54,453
Lady Cheng,

409
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:56,333
if so, where have you met

410
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:57,852
Zisheng before?

411
00:28:57,852 --> 00:28:58,892
Your Majesty,

412
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,612
you could've asked me the same thing.

413
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:01,612
Don't speak.

414
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:03,173
I only want her to answer me.

415
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:08,532
Lady Cheng,

416
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:10,213
Zisheng

417
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:12,373
is one of my most important subjects

418
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:13,652
and the pillar of the nation.

419
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:15,892
Now, he got injured because of you.

420
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:18,692
I've lost one of
my trusted aides as well.

421
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:21,532
Do you know your fault?

422
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:22,772
Your Majesty,

423
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,213
she didn't mean to fall off the cliff.

424
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,373
Please forgive her.

425
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:34,173
Your Majesty, I wouldn't have gone

426
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:35,333
to save her

427
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:37,093
if I knew you were
trying to frighten her.

428
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:46,772
Cheng Shi,

429
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:49,612
Zisheng is the pillar of the nation.

430
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:52,173
His old wound was reopened
due to your daughter.

431
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:55,492
He has saved your entire family.

432
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,053
You should remember his kindness

433
00:29:58,053 --> 00:30:00,293
until the end of time

434
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:01,532
and repay his kindness.

435
00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:02,732
Yes, Your Majesty.

436
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:04,572
I will definitely repay his kindness

437
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:07,612
in return.

438
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:09,852
Forget it.

439
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,772
Lady Cheng has suffered
a minor shock.

440
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:14,013
You two may leave

441
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,572
for now.

442
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:17,612
I will speak to Zisheng in private.

443
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,492
Yes, Your Majesty.

444
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:21,973
Shaoshang.

445
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:37,612
Be honest with me.

446
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,652
You and Lady Cheng...

447
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,213
I was just passing by,

448
00:30:43,732 --> 00:30:44,692
and I saved her
purely out of coincidence.

449
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:46,413
It's nothing to talk about.

450
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:50,053
Fine.

451
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,333
Whatever you say then.

452
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:54,492
Tomorrow, you should
follow me back to the palace

453
00:30:54,892 --> 00:30:56,013
and let Physician Sun

454
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:57,692
treat your wounds.

455
00:30:58,093 --> 00:30:59,293
Your Majesty,
thank you for your kindness.

456
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:00,732
However, physicians in my residence

457
00:31:00,732 --> 00:31:02,973
are experts in treating
traumatic injuries.

458
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:05,093
I can recuperate in my residence.

459
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:06,213
What?

460
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:09,973
Do you think your physicians
are better than Physician Sun?

461
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:11,652
I assume someone

462
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:12,812
wants to be in the residence

463
00:31:12,932 --> 00:31:15,333
just in case the lady he had rescued

464
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,213
wants to visit him, huh?

465
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:33,413
I'm afraid of His Majesty.
Who are you afraid of?

466
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:35,892
I almost lost my life there.

467
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:37,373
Do you think I'm not afraid?

468
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:40,213
Why did you return with
that Ling Buyi again?

469
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:41,732
Today, I...

470
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,093
I just...

471
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,293
Father,

472
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:48,093
I would've fallen off the cliff

473
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:49,812
if General Ling didn't save me.

474
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:52,093
You wouldn't be able
to see me again by then.

475
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:54,333
Don't tell me it was purely
a coincidence

476
00:31:55,173 --> 00:31:56,253
that he saved you in the nick of time

477
00:31:56,572 --> 00:31:57,812
right before you fell off the cliff?

478
00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:58,973
There are plenty of

479
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,772
coincidences in the world.

480
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,732
Just like how you married Mother.

481
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:04,013
That was also a coincidence.

482
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,732
If you had married Madam Ge,

483
00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:07,453
your daughter would be Yangyang

484
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:09,093
instead of me.

485
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:10,413
-Such nonsense!
-If your daughter would be Yangyang...

486
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:11,772
Your mother and I, we...

487
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:12,652
I'll make a move now.

488
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:19,852
Could it be that I was overthinking it?

489
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:22,333
I'm sure Zisheng

490
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:24,453
is recuperating at home on purpose

491
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,453
so that Lady Cheng can visit him.

492
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:28,973
In my opinion, not only is Lady Cheng

493
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:30,772
ordinary,

494
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:32,053
but she also lacks courtesy.

495
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:33,973
You should take a nap.

496
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:41,453
This...

497
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:43,892
Why is this fruit so bitter?

498
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:47,373
Your Majesty.

499
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:49,732
A few years ago, some of your subjects

500
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:52,133
had sent some
beautiful women to Zisheng.

501
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,692
Your Majesty was afraid that Zisheng
might marry them

502
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:57,293
instead of being as pure-hearted as Huo.

503
00:32:57,293 --> 00:32:58,932
You were so worried that
you couldn't even sleep at night.

504
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:00,333
Did that truly happen?

505
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:01,333
Yes, it did.

506
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:03,173
I was worried

507
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,732
that he might fall prey to temptation
and ruin his conduct.

508
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:06,732
Was I wrong for thinking that?

509
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:09,093
After that, Zisheng sent
all the women back.

510
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,453
He never touched a single woman.

511
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:12,932
He was always alone.

512
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,973
Your Majesty was worried that he might
rise from the common herd

513
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,453
and stay alone forever.

514
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:19,652
Did that truly happen?

515
00:33:19,652 --> 00:33:20,413
Yes, it did.

516
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,492
I was afraid that he might be
too pure-hearted.

517
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:24,973
It would harm his bodily functions.

518
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:26,093
Was I wrong for thinking that?

519
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,133
After that, I heard Zisheng
had someone he fancied.

520
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,772
Your Majesty was afraid that the lady
might be already betrothed.

521
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:33,093
Did that truly happen?

522
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:35,492
I was just afraid that
he might lose out on a potential mate.

523
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:36,852
Was I wrong for thinking that?

524
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:38,852
Now that this lady had
canceled her marriage,

525
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,492
Your Majesty looked down on her
for being too ordinary.

526
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,692
But Your Majesty frets about
Zisheng's relationship

527
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:44,732
every day.

528
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:45,572
That's why I thought

529
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:48,572
this unripe fruit was best for you,
Your Majesty.

530
00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:50,892
It's sour and bitter,

531
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,852
just like your heart.

532
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:56,772
How could anyone

533
00:33:57,253 --> 00:33:58,612
know how sour and bitter I feel inside?

534
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,652
Zisheng had a rough life since young.

535
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:02,732
Your Majesty, I'm getting tired.

536
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:05,173
His uncle and the Huo Clan

537
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,173
had sacrificed everything
for the nation's sake.

538
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,293
Your Majesty, I'm tired.

539
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:10,772
Now, every official in
the imperial court

540
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:12,053
is...

541
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:13,932
What are you doing?

542
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:16,213
Since you have a court
full of imperial officials,

543
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,932
why did you need a woman like me
to come up with ideas for you?

544
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:20,852
Your Majesty, since you're busy,

545
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,013
I shall not see you off.

546
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:25,013
Heng, listen to me.

547
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:27,093
I just wanted to have a chat with you.

548
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,612
I don't mean anything else.

549
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,293
Cao Cheng, tend to His Majesty's needs.

550
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,053
His Majesty has arrived.

551
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:45,973
Shen'an.

552
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:49,133
You may drop the formalities
when we're outside.

553
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:53,732
I feel troubled,

554
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,133
and I think you can

555
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:57,772
come up with solutions for me.

556
00:34:58,612 --> 00:34:59,852
I dare not interfere

557
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,413
with state affairs.

558
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:03,652
Your Majesty, you should return

559
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:05,532
and discuss them with
your loyal subjects.

560
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:07,652
It isn't about the state.

561
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:09,413
Sit down.

562
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,652
I was just fretting over

563
00:35:16,093 --> 00:35:18,812
Zisheng's wound.

564
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:20,532
That's why, my dear,

565
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,492
I hope you can think of an idea for me.

566
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:24,213
Your Majesty,

567
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,892
I do not dare to make the call here.

568
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,013
I think we should head back

569
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:29,013
and let Physician Sun
examine his wound for now.

570
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:31,732
Actually, it isn't about his wound.

571
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,373
You've heard it as well.

572
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:35,612
Zisheng was injured

573
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:37,492
all because

574
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:40,692
of that young lady of the Cheng Family.

575
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:45,333
Seems like Zisheng fancies her.

576
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:49,253
Zisheng is still young.

577
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,093
He knows nothing

578
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:53,812
about true love.

579
00:35:54,973 --> 00:35:56,772
Your Majesty, you're right.

580
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:59,732
Although Zisheng has seen countless
people, he has never fallen for anyone.

581
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:00,772
We can see

582
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:03,852
that he isn't infatuated with love.

583
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:07,253
Not necessarily.

584
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,932
As the saying goes,
gentlemen desire fair maidens.

585
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,772
If so, why can't Zisheng
desire a partner?

586
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:14,932
Your Majesty, you're right.

587
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,812
Heroes are always prisoners of love.

588
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:21,133
It's common for Zisheng
to fall for someone.

589
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:22,532
It's pretty uncommon too.

590
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:24,413
He just had to recuperate
in his residence.

591
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:25,652
If I knew this would happen,

592
00:36:25,772 --> 00:36:27,732
I wouldn't have granted him a residence.

593
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,053
Your Majesty, you have a point.

594
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:32,572
The physicians he has are definitely

595
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,453
inferior to the imperial physicians.

596
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:35,572
Why don't we

597
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:37,133
summon him into the palace?

598
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:38,492
Summon him into the palace?

599
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:42,213
He will be restricted

600
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,492
if he has to recuperate in the palace.

601
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,413
I don't think it'll do his recovery

602
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,253
any good.

603
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:53,053
Your Majesty is wise.

604
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:56,453
I shall obey you.

605
00:37:10,013 --> 00:37:11,973
Your Majesty, slow down.

606
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:21,532
Tell me then.

607
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:23,293
Do you think Lady Cheng

608
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,692
is good enough for our Zisheng?

609
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:26,812
Your Majesty,

610
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,532
God is the only one

611
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:31,732
who can decide
if she's good enough for him.

612
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:34,732
Your Majesty's worries are unfounded.

613
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:39,333
Great answer.

614
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,293
Cao Cheng,

615
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:45,013
you are

616
00:37:45,492 --> 00:37:46,692
better than the two of them.

617
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,293
I do not deserve such praises.

618
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:53,732
But what if

619
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,293
God is blind?

620
00:37:57,532 --> 00:37:58,492
Your Majesty!

621
00:37:58,973 --> 00:37:59,932
Your Majesty!

622
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:02,612
You are

623
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:05,133
nothing.

624
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:20,173
General,

625
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:22,492
can you stop pacing back and forth

626
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:23,652
in front of me?

627
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:25,053
You're making me dizzy here.

628
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:31,572
How many times has it been?

629
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:34,093
What do you mean?

630
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:37,612
How many times has Ling Buyi
saved Niaoniao?

631
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:39,013
That's right.

632
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,293
It's been several times.

633
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,173
This won't do. I have to ask Niaoniao
about the details.

634
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:47,333
Dear, you should stop.

635
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:51,612
Even if they do have feelings
for each other,

636
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,572
I guess Niaoniao will be too stubborn

637
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:55,453
to admit the truth in front of us.

638
00:38:57,692 --> 00:38:59,973
I'm just afraid that our worries

639
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:01,293
might come true.

640
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:02,692
Dear, you might not know,

641
00:39:02,772 --> 00:39:05,732
but His Majesty was clearly
on General Ling's side yesterday.

642
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:08,293
His Majesty even reminded me
to thank him

643
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:09,692
and repay his kindness.

644
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:13,013
If so,

645
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:18,373
why don't you and Niaoniao
visit General Ling together?

646
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:25,333
I'm not proper to go.

647
00:39:25,812 --> 00:39:27,173
Naturally, you should go.

648
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:31,612
This is the time

649
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:33,413
for you to shine.

650
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:37,772
It never rains, but it pours.

651
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,173
This is so worrying.

652
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:09,812
Time's up.

653
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:10,932
Song is still injured.

654
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:11,852
I'll deliver the medicine to him.

655
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,572
Song cannot turn his body around now.

656
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,373
I'll help him out.

657
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:18,932
Hurry up.

658
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:20,013
Stop right there.

659
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,612
I haven't permitted you guys to go yet.

660
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:25,572
Who permitted you guys to leave?

661
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:28,812
Cheng Song only suffered a scratch.

662
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:30,532
There's no need for three people
to tend to his needs.

663
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:32,133
You guys should've kept quiet

664
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:33,652
if that was the best excuse
you could come up with.

665
00:41:37,173 --> 00:41:38,652
Since you guys are so absent-minded,

666
00:41:39,173 --> 00:41:40,213
it'll make me look bad

667
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:41,932
for keeping you guys here.

668
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:43,892
Leave now.

669
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:47,173
Let's go!

670
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:48,093
Wait.

671
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:52,053
The others may leave.

672
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:53,852
But Shaoshang,

673
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:55,532
you will stay.

674
00:41:59,093 --> 00:41:59,932
Let's go.

675
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:23,453
Three mistakes in five words.

676
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:25,492
Fourth Lady Cheng, your writing ability

677
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:26,612
is truly

678
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:28,413
impressive.

679
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:32,253
I've been busy lately.

680
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:34,013
I didn't have time
to practice my writing.

681
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:35,973
Master, I'm sure you know that well.

682
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,932
Ling Zisheng got injured for saving you

683
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:40,373
right after

684
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:43,293
you canceled your marriage with Lou Yao.

685
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:47,572
I guess you were busy indeed.

686
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:53,772
Master, you don't need
to beat around the bush.

687
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:55,852
You may get straight

688
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,293
to the point.

689
00:42:57,532 --> 00:42:58,852
I just wish to advise you

690
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:01,013
to learn more about
how to be a decent human.

691
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:03,692
If you intend to use marriage

692
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:05,453
as an excuse to seek freedom,

693
00:43:05,892 --> 00:43:07,492
you'll regret it sooner or later.

694
00:43:07,772 --> 00:43:08,932
You're still green to the world.

695
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:11,532
Did you think you could escape
your family and lead a carefree life

696
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:13,333
after you got married?

697
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,013
Little did you know

698
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:16,692
that another person
would be tying you down.

699
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:18,973
Do you think getting married
into a noble family is a great thing?

700
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:20,253
Don't you understand the truth

701
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,932
after your dispute with the Lou Family?

702
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,093
There's no need for you to be in a rush

703
00:43:25,532 --> 00:43:26,492
and approach Ling Buyi.

704
00:43:30,253 --> 00:43:31,772
Who said I was using my marriage
as an excuse to seek freedom?

705
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:35,213
Who said I approached
Ling Buyi on purpose?

706
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:39,213
Yuan Shanjian,

707
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:40,532
you must be sick in the head.

708
00:43:41,253 --> 00:43:42,612
Did I offend you in any way?

709
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,612
Why must you think of people
in such a lowly manner?

710
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:50,173
That's far from being the case.

711
00:43:50,572 --> 00:43:52,053
I just can't bear to see you falling prey

712
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,652
to people's trickery

713
00:43:54,213 --> 00:43:55,692
due to your ignorance.

714
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:57,572
I'm just giving you a friendly reminder.

715
00:43:58,812 --> 00:44:00,213
You should stay away from Ling Buyi.

716
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:07,093
I told you already.

717
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:07,692
Yuan...

718
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:13,053
Shaoshang,

719
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:14,293
I met Father just now.

720
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:16,453
He told me to ask you
to head to General Ling's residence

721
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:17,812
to repay his kindness for saving you.

722
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:25,932
Master,

723
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:28,253
we study in order to reason.

724
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,732
However, listening to our parents

725
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:31,892
is a must.

726
00:44:32,013 --> 00:44:34,572
My father wants me to visit
my benefactor.

727
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:36,692
I assume you have no reason to stop me.

728
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:44,892
Lady Cheng, you forgot the pain

729
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:47,293
now that your wounds had healed.

730
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:49,572
I just hope

731
00:44:49,973 --> 00:44:51,453
that you won't regret it in the future.
