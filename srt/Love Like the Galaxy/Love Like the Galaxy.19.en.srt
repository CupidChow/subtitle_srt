=Episode 19=

3
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,060
Imperial edict for Cheng Shaoshang,
daughter of Marquis Quling.

4
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,300
Helping the weak.

5
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,940
Hardworking and virtuous.

6
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,260
Kind and gentle.

7
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,700
Knowledgeable.

8
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,220
A happy nature.

9
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,220
Helping the people of Hua County.

10
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Dealing with the trouble of bandits.

11
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,980
An example of
an honorable family indeed.

12
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,180
I heard the Cheng and the Lou families
will be bonded through marriage.

13
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,140
(Am I the person who is
being mentioned in the imperial edict?)

14
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,580
A pair of jade artifacts

15
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,740
and ten brocades will be granted.

16
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,340
Bow!

17
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,500
Thank you, His Majesty!

18
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,180
Thank you for His Majesty's grace.

19
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,980
Receive the edict.

20
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,540
(Your Majesty.)

21
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
(Since you are going to give a gift,)

22
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,540
(can you)

23
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,940
(grant Lady Cheng
another imperial favour?)

24
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,940
(Why not)

25
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,660
(praise her in front of the guests)

26
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,220
(during the banquet at Lou's residence?)

27
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,940
(You'll be blessing the Cheng Family)

28
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,900
(and making the Lou Family proud
at the same time.)

29
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,100
Everyone, you can rise.

30
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
I shall take my leave.

31
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,620
Is this really for me?

32
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,180
Do you know Ling Buyi was the one

33
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,100
who requested this imperial edict
for Lady Cheng?

34
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,180
Did he really?

35
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,820
I must go and thank Senior Zisheng.

36
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,820
I mean

37
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,140
Shaoshang and I should visit
and thank him together.

38
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,220
You don't need to.

39
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,820
Since General Ling never told anyone about this,

40
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,820
I think he didn't want anyone to find out.

41
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,300
Both of you and Shaoshang

42
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
should interact less
with him in the future.

43
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,540
You should go and entertain the guests.

44
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,660
All right, I'll go right away.

45
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,780
General Ling.

46
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,740
You'd address me as "Zisheng"

47
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,900
in your letters.

48
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,220
Now that we've met in person,

49
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,940
why are you being distant now,

50
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,260
Mr. Mou?

51
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,620
How did you know

52
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,700
I'm Mr. Mou?

53
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,060
Do you think I'd trust anyone?

54
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,900
I wouldn't dare to use
the information you gave

55
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,300
if I don't know
your complete background.

56
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,220
Indeed, nothing can get past you.

57
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,220
May I know if you're here to see me

58
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
or...

59
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,100
I know

60
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,300
you know the terrains in Feng Yi County
like the palm of your hand.

61
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,780
Now, His Majesty is

62
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,700
in urgent need of the map
to pacify the rebellions.

63
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,460
If you can lend us a hand,

64
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,260
your future

65
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,620
will be bright.

66
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,700
However,

67
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,820
I'm afraid there's no chance

68
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,420
for us to interact less

69
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,060
if we become comrades in hands
in the future.

70
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,460
Did you hear

71
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,700
what I said just now?

72
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,540
In that case,
I'll just be honest with you.

73
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,380
My father passed away early.

74
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,180
He only left my mother
and younger brother to me.

75
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,940
Yao has a pure heart.

76
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,660
I'd naturally have
to watch over him attentively.

77
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,260
So as to avoid him being subjected
to being bullied.

78
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,540
I may be ambitious

79
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,900
and want to show my talent
at the royal court.

80
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,740
But no matter how I value opportunities,

81
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,180
I would never harm people around me.

82
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
I'll set out to Feng Yi County tonight.

83
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,860
You don't have to be concerned
about your younger brother.

84
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,180
I only came to see you

85
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,140
for the map.

86
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,140
Since it's what you're asking for,

87
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,620
I shall have it delivered

88
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,540
to you tonight.

89
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,700
You have my thanks.

90
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,380
I shall excuse myself.

91
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,980
Uncle.

92
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,780
So you do remember that I'm your uncle.

93
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,700
Lady Cheng, you're incredible.

94
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,260
I was too scared to breathe just now.

95
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,740
Only Lady Cheng could behave composedly.

96
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,260
Lady Cheng, it's only reasonable
that you were commended

97
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,140
by His Majesty.

98
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,220
Not only you're knowledgeable,

99
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,340
but you also have a happy nature.

100
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Knowledgeable? I don't deserve it.

101
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,420
I don't deserve to be called that.

102
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,340
Lady Cheng, you're too modest.

103
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
Are you saying

104
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,020
His Majesty is wrong?

105
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,260
I never said His Majesty was wrong.

106
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,820
It was me.

107
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,020
I'm not as good or was raised

108
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,500
as His Majesty has said.

109
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,180
It's my fault.

110
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,060
My fault.

111
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,580
- Lady Cheng, you're too modest.
- How humble you are.

112
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,300
I was wrong.

113
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Let me drink as a sign of respect.

114
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,420
Let us all drink.

115
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,460
Cheers.

116
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,500
Thank you all.

117
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,260
How can His Majesty be so muddle-headed?

118
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,540
How could he praise an ignorant person

119
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,820
to be an example for young women?

120
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,860
If you keep speaking recklessly,

121
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,540
your mother will beat you.

122
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,500
Qiqi,

123
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,660
please help me entertain them.

124
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,380
Here.

125
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,460
Let's drink.

126
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,420
Cheers.

127
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,340
Young Lady.

128
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Young Lady.

129
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,820
Young Lady.

130
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,820
Young Lady.

131
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,620
Lady Cheng, please share your stories.

132
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,580
Please tell us.

133
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,620
Ladies,

134
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,260
I have to excuse myself for a while.

135
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,420
Why are you leaving?

136
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,860
How did you do it?

137
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,500
Lady Cheng, do tell us.

138
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,460
Lady Cheng.

139
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,700
Why do you want to see me so urgently?

140
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,300
Did you see that?

141
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,700
All of them want to drink with me.

142
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,660
Young Lady,

143
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
General Ling wants me
to convey three messages to you.

144
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,580
First,

145
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,700
he has something to tell you.

146
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,700
Second,

147
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,820
he said not to worry

148
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,340
because he won't harm you.

149
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,540
He asked that you trust him.

150
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,300
Lianfang,

151
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,500
tell him

152
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,460
that I won't see him.

153
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,540
It's not proper.

154
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,460
There's the third message.

155
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,540
General Ling also said

156
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,580
if you refused to go,

157
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,540
he'll come and see you in person.

158
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
When trouble happens,

159
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,100
you can wait to break off the betrothal
and marry him.

160
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,140
If you don't go,

161
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
he'll take this

162
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,980
as you agreeing to marry him.

163
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,660
That's outrageous.

164
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I, Cheng Shaoshang shall not

165
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,660
be threatened by him.

166
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,540
Where is he? Take me to him.

167
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,500
Go.

168
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,020
Did you come because I wanted to see you

169
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,180
or

170
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,940
was it because of the third message?

171
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,180
General Ling, I'm indebted to you
because you've saved my life

172
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,340
and come to my aid many times.

173
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,740
I should treat your earnestness

174
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,220
and kindness with sincerity.

175
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,820
I just wonder

176
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,660
why you wanted

177
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,060
to see me here.

178
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,620
I guessed you came
because of the third message.

179
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,460
That may not be a bad thing.

180
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,100
You've learned to be more cautious.

181
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,180
It's a good thing.

182
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,580
If you have nothing else to say,

183
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,260
I'll have to excuse myself.

184
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,660
Lady Cheng,

185
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,380
allow me to speak to you.

186
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,260
Is that all right?

187
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,100
Rest assured.

188
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,780
I've sent away

189
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,420
the Lou Family's servants
who were guarding here.

190
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,180
I don't want our meeting

191
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,300
to implicate you

192
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,660
or let anyone know about it.

193
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,460
General Ling,

194
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,260
I'm sure you know.

195
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm betrothed to Yao.

196
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,500
It's inappropriate for you

197
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,300
to ask me out like this.

198
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,900
What do you want to do in the future?

199
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,100
I mean

200
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,780
other than marrying.

201
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,340
There are many things I want to do.

202
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
I want to gather many physicians

203
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,060
to compile their medical skills
and knowledge

204
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,820
into a book

205
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,420
for the benefit of the people.

206
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,340
I also want

207
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,100
to transform heavy farming tools

208
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,100
to help ease people's burden

209
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,060
and increase food production.

210
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,660
Also,

211
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,340
I want to build a smelter,

212
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,740
draw more instruments

213
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,940
and see if I can build them.

214
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,820
I also want to...

215
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,540
General Ling, did you want to see me

216
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,980
because you wanted to ask me these?

217
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,580
Your heart is as big as the world.

218
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,100
You and I are not on the same road.

219
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,180
That's without a question.

220
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,460
You are you. I am me.

221
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,220
You're right.

222
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,460
You are you.

223
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,140
I am me.

224
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,740
Today

225
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,980
should be the last time we meet.

226
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,100
Why do you say that?

227
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,860
Is there a war ahead?

228
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,860
Where are you going?

229
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,260
How long will you be away?

230
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,700
I'll set out tonight.

231
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,660
I might die on the battlefield this time.

232
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,380
This is also the fate of soldiers.

233
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,100
Cheng Shaoshang,

234
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,260
I know you want to move away
with Lou Yao after he's appointed.

235
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,660
But don't be too hasty.

236
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,980
I'll request His Majesty

237
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,780
to send you to a safe place.

238
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,100
Don't just go to any barren lands

239
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,060
because you wanted to escape
from your family's leash.

240
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,300
You're frail.

241
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
You won't be able to withstand it.

242
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,380
I just remembered

243
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,140
that I never earnestly listened
to you playing the flute

244
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,980
since we know each other.

245
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,140
Your journey will be filled with danger.

246
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,900
I pray that you take care of yourself.

247
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,460
If you wish to listen to it,

248
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,060
I'll play it for you

249
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,420
when you return with triumph.

250
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,420
Better not.

251
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,300
You should play it for your husband.

252
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,460
Moreover, you'll be married.

253
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,140
If I'm able to return alive,

254
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,820
we shall be strangers

255
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,940
and never meet again.

256
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,420
Since I've said this,

257
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,380
you can return now.

258
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,540
What about you?

259
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,660
I want to stay for a while.

260
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,300
(Ling's Residence)

261
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,540
Young Master,

262
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,060
Mr. Lou Ben sent someone
to deliver the map just now.

263
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,260
He said, he has done
what's been entrusted to him.

264
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,020
He prefers living a carefree life.

265
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,820
So you don't have to recommend him
to join the court.

266
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,660
It looks like

267
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Grand Tutor Lou stopped him
from serving His Majesty.

268
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,700
The Lou's Second Chamber has
to live under people's whims.

269
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,500
I wonder how her life would turn out

270
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,140
after she married into that family.

271
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,740
I just remembered

272
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,620
I never earnestly listened
to you playing the flute

273
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,340
since we know each other.

274
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,700
Your journey will be filled with danger.

275
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,300
I pray that you take care of yourself.

276
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,820
If you wish to listen to it,

277
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,540
I'll play it for you

278
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,780
when you return with triumph.

279
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,980
Young Master,

280
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,700
the soldiers have assembled
outside the gate.

281
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,500
When do we set out?

282
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,740
Now.

283
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,060
Yes, Sir!

284
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,880
(Ling's Residence)

285
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,700
(One month later)

286
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,540
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

287
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,580
Your Majesty,

288
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,180
we have not failed our mission

289
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,220
and we have captured Lord Yong
and his son alive.

290
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,300
Well done.

291
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,540
Generals, please rise.

292
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,820
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

293
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,620
Did General He

294
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,780
and his sons survive?

295
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,860
Your Majesty,

296
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,500
I was too late.

297
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,540
(General Wu)
They have died for the country.

298
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,300
If it weren't for the sacrifice
of General He and his family,

299
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,380
it'd be impossible

300
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,900
for Zisheng and I

301
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,220
to capture Lord Yong back

302
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
to the capital so quickly.

303
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,700
Heaven truly

304
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,140
has taken a loyal general from me.

305
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,340
When General He bid farewell to me
for the wedding,

306
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,420
he looked happy in front of me.

307
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,140
Who would have expected

308
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,540
we'd be separated by death

309
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,100
when he returned this time.

310
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,500
Your Majesty,

311
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,180
General He had left a request
before he passed.

312
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,780
What is it?

313
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,660
By all means, tell me.

314
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,940
I

315
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,020
will grant all his requests.

316
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,780
General He is worried

317
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,060
about his surviving son and daughter.

318
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,580
His son is still young.

319
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,020
His daughter, Zhaojun

320
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,700
was first betrothed to the Lou clan

321
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,420
before she married Prince Xiao.

322
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,980
It's uncertain if the Xiao Family
will be executed or imprisoned.

323
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,500
The marriage between the Xiao Family
and the He Family has been severed.

324
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,180
He hoped that the Lou clan can continue
with the betrothal again.

325
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,980
Isn't he

326
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,900
already betrothed?

327
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,180
General He didn't know

328
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,260
that Grand Tutor Lou's nephew
is engaged to Lady Cheng.

329
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,340
That's why he had such a request.

330
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,020
The He Family's journey was tragic.

331
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,300
It may be against ethics.
But it's understandable.

332
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,740
I hope Your Majesty can decide
on this matter.

333
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,260
What's there to decide?

334
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,500
As an official,

335
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,980
it's our duty to be loyal
to the country.

336
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,820
It may sound unpleasant to hear.

337
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,100
But does it mean anyone

338
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,740
who rendered merits can ask
to be rewarded?

339
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,700
(Official Zuo)
You can't put it this way.

340
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,420
(Official Zuo)

341
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,340
(Official Zuo)
Most of the He Family had died.

342
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,500
Shouldn't we show some compassion?

343
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,340
So do you mean

344
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,220
His Majesty should fulfill his request?

345
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,580
Have you thought about this thoroughly?

346
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,020
If we allow this,

347
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,380
does that mean any family
that suffered tragic deaths after this

348
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,460
could use their credit

349
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,140
to request things from other families?

350
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,500
Well, the Lou Family and the Cheng Family

351
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,260
haven't completed the marriage yet.

352
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,060
Betrothal is a promise.

353
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,860
How can one easily break it?

354
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,340
But apart from the law,

355
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
there's still human compassion.

356
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,980
The He clan moved heaven
with their bravery.

357
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,460
We should observe

358
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,140
General He's last words.

359
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,820
Ji,

360
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,460
whose side are you on?

361
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,980
This concerns the country

362
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,900
and also Grand Tutor Lou's Family.

363
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,980
So

364
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,740
we should ask what he thinks
of this matter.

365
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
Grand Tutor Lou,

366
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
what do you think of this?

367
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,940
This is a matter between two families.

368
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,500
You can't ask the suitor's side first.

369
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,340
Aren't you just taking advantage
of Cheng Shi

370
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,100
when he's not in court?

371
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,060
This is indeed difficult to manage.

372
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,420
What?

373
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,300
Yao won't be coming for these few days?

374
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,700
It's Yuan Shanjian's fault

375
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,060
for stopping Yao and me
from meeting each other.

376
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,820
He insists on saying
it'll affect our studies

377
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,100
and told me to be careful
that happiness will bring sadness.

378
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,420
He truly has a vicious mouth

379
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,500
that's not inferior to a country woman.

380
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,220
Niaoniao,

381
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,980
you mustn't say that.

382
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,820
Mr. Yuan is stopping you from meeting

383
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,900
because he cares about Mr. Lou.

384
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,020
I think Mr. Yuan felt uncomfortable
and stopped you

385
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,620
because he can't stand

386
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,260
Yao and your disgusting behavior.

387
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,780
It's really fighting poison with poison.

388
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,780
Shaogong, who are you calling poison?

389
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,860
Are you looking down on Yao too?

390
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,460
We're not looking down on Mr. Lou.

391
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,140
We're just looking down on you.

392
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,460
When you see him,

393
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,740
you smile like Erwang from next door
when it had chicken thighs in its mouth.

394
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,020
You're the one
who looked like Erwang from next door!

395
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,740
Qiqi.

396
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,540
Just ignore these commoners.

397
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,860
Shaoshang, something bad had happened.

398
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
What is it

399
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,260
that made you come here in a rush?

400
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,260
My father just returned home
from the court

401
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,700
saying we have won

402
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
the battle in Feng Yi County.

403
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,180
Lord Yong and his son were captured

404
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,900
and escorted back to the capital.

405
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,060
The people of the capital were watching
the excitement at the gate.

406
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,860
Isn't this great news?

407
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,340
How is it bad?

408
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,500
It's not good news at all.

409
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,820
It's bad for you.

410
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,660
Do you know

411
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,860
General He

412
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,380
and his whole family died in battle?

413
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,620
His whole family died?

414
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,460
How sad.

415
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,380
Why is it bad for me?

416
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,180
They're just bullying the Cheng Family

417
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,260
for not holding any position in court.

418
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,020
Aren't there any other ways

419
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,860
to comfort the He clan?

420
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,860
Why do they have to do favors
at the cost of Niaoniao's marriage?

421
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,700
Yet, Grand Tutor Lou said
nothing at all.

422
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,220
That old man seemed
to have his tongue cut off.

423
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,620
Sister-in-law, calm down.

424
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,260
This matter has not been decided yet.

425
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,300
Why should I be anxious about it?

426
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,140
Since the Lou Family
dared not decide at the time,

427
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,140
we shall wait for them to talk to us

428
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,460
after they've made their decision.

429
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,340
You're right.

430
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,660
Worse comes to worst,
we'll just break off this betrothal.

431
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,340
Niaoniao has suitors.

432
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,780
They were the ones
who were eager for this betrothal.

433
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,100
Now, they're also the ones
who are behaving like cowards.

434
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,860
I don't need Yao as my son-in-law.

435
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,300
But Niaoniao must not suffer
such humiliation.

436
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,380
I've always had bad luck.

437
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,540
That's why I was also curious

438
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,460
why my betrothal goes this smoothly.

439
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,460
I didn't expect this would happen later.

440
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,340
Niaoniao, don't worry.

441
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,180
As long as the Lou Family
doesn't make their stand,

442
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,140
this betrothal is still binding.

443
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,140
They didn't make their stand

444
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,060
because they cared
about the Cheng Family.

445
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,860
But they're weighing this matter.

446
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,380
If they accept it,

447
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,380
would they receive more criticism

448
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,700
or obtain more benefits.

449
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,460
Niaoniao is right.

450
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,340
That Grand Tutor Lou is one old fox.

451
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,660
He wouldn't decide
if there's no benefit.

452
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,020
But Niaoniao,

453
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,740
this matter concerns you.

454
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,260
What do you think

455
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,380
putting the Lou Family aside?

456
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,380
It never matters what I think.

457
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,620
I just feel sorry for Yao.

458
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
It wasn't easy

459
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660
to leave

460
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,980
that oppressive family.

461
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,380
But now...

462
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,900
We're only one step away.

463
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,540
I'm not the one
who suffers the most in this matter.

464
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
It's Yao.

465
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,260
I only can't marry the one
I wanted to marry.

466
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,780
But he...

467
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,740
He has to marry someone
he didn't want to marry.

468
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,100
Lad!

469
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,060
Uncle.

470
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,180
Are you done behaving ridiculously?

471
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,700
Are you only going to give up

472
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,180
after you do something

473
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,660
to embarrass the Lou Family?

474
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,700
Come down this instant!

475
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,340
You can't even climb over the wall.

476
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,300
How are you going
to go against everyone?

477
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,340
Don't help him.

478
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,620
Inform the Second Chamber

479
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,580
and let them send someone
to carry him back.

480
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,900
Yes, Sir.

481
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,820
My leg.

482
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,540
Why are you so careless?

483
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,660
Even if His Majesty granted the title
Lady Ancheng

484
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,900
or Princess Ancheng to He Zhaojun,

485
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,220
I'd still refuse.

486
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,140
Even so, you can't behave rashly.

487
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,060
If anything happens to you,

488
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,060
how heartbroken Mother would be.

489
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,020
Master asked me to check on Yao.

490
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,540
I didn't expect you'd be this useless.

491
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,220
You broke your leg

492
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,460
over a love affair.

493
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
I'd like to ask you this.

494
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,300
The He Family died as martyrs.

495
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,660
They all died except He Zhaojun
and her younger brother.

496
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,980
Do you only care about love affairs?

497
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,900
I never liked He Zhaojun
since she was young.

498
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,580
She has bullied my poor Yao

499
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,860
for so many years.

500
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,140
I'll not agree

501
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
to this marriage.

502
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,820
I know you never liked Zhaojun.

503
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,940
How about this?

504
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,540
After she married into this family,

505
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,740
I'll guide her.

506
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,380
You only need to live in comfort.

507
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,620
After Yao is betrothed to Shaoshang,

508
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,140
he has been cheerful every day.

509
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,820
How can we force him

510
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,140
to marry someone he doesn't like?

511
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,700
You're in no position to speak.

512
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,700
You must think of the greater good.

513
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Speaking of the world,

514
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,460
General He has died for the country.

515
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,980
Speaking of us,

516
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,940
the Lou Family is indebted to her.

517
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,620
Be it for loyalty or righteousness,

518
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,500
Zhaojun must marry into this family.

519
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,300
Since the family is indebted to her,

520
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,740
why did you have your eldest betrothed

521
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,300
in a hurry back then?

522
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,300
If it's for the sake of His Majesty,

523
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,900
the He Family only said to marry
He Zhaojun into the Lou Family.

524
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,980
They never pointed out
that it must be Yao.

525
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,980
Why didn't you
let your second son marry He Zhaojun?

526
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
We may be widow and orphans

527
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,700
but don't treat us like fools.

528
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,300
Stop talking nonsense.

529
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,540
How dare you talk back at me!

530
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,020
Mother-in-law didn't say anything wrong.

531
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,620
You can't bear

532
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,660
to see He Zhaojun bully your second son.

533
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,980
Yet, you insist on making
Yao the victim.

534
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,380
I'm going to lodge a complaint
against you for being defiant.

535
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,620
You're not my mother-in-law.

536
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,820
How can you lodge a complaint
against me?

537
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
I'll not marry her.

538
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,380
If you and Uncle try to force me,

539
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,500
I'll tell everything to the guests

540
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,220
who come to my wedding with He Zhaojun.

541
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,740
I'll tell them

542
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,100
how the First Chamber
of the Lou Family rushed their son

543
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,820
to be betrothed

544
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,780
to avoid marrying He Zhaojun.

545
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,980
We'll let them judge

546
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,380
and see how Lou's First Chamber had

547
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,580
deliberately planned it.

548
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
It's not up to you

549
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,060
to decide whether you break off
the engagement.

550
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,540
I'll send someone to deliver
an invitation to the Cheng Family

551
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,460
to come here
to break off the engagement.

552
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,220
Since Yao is betrothed
to Fourth Lady Cheng,

553
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,180
he has indeed changed.

554
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,380
He now makes effort to fight
for reasons.

555
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,260
Shaoshang said

556
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,620
we must fight

557
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,260
for the life we want.

558
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,540
General Ling, how almighty you are.

559
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,540
You actually sent away
all the dungeons guards

560
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,060
of the Ministry of Justice.

561
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,580
Why?

562
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,580
Do you want

563
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,500
(Lord Yong)
to have a private talk with me?

564
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,660
Yes.

565
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,620
You've always stayed in Feng Yi County.

566
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,740
When His Majesty summoned you,

567
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,700
you would either be wounded or sick.

568
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,380
It was hard to meet you in person.

569
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,180
Shouldn't I take this chance
to talk to you?

570
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,180
What's there to say?

571
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,220
The end justifies the means.

572
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,140
I'll just accept my fate.

573
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,540
I'm responsible

574
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,260
for everything.

575
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,540
My son was only obeying my orders.

576
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,140
My death will not be regretted.

577
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,580
I only hope His Majesty would spare his life

578
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,740
for the sake of our friendship.

579
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,140
You're indeed a loving father.

580
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
I wonder

581
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,580
if this includes the case in Gu City

582
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,820
when you said you were responsible
for everything.

583
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,660
What are you saying?

584
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,100
I don't understand.

585
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,500
If you don't understand,

586
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
why did you start a rebellion

587
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,980
the moment you received
His Majesty's edict?

588
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,860
You knew it very well.

589
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
If it was just
Prince Xiao smuggling armaments,

590
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,580
His Majesty may not want
to take your life

591
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,180
because you intend to rebel.

592
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,460
But if you include

593
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,260
the time you smuggled armaments in Gu City,

594
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,540
which led to the fall of Gu City

595
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,380
and the tragic deaths of His Majesty's
sworn brother and his family,

596
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,220
His Majesty will not forgive you.

597
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,540
Indeed,

598
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,340
my son told me

599
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,940
that he obtained the armaments

600
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,700
through Xu Jinzhong.

601
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,220
And Xu Jinzhong fell

602
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,300
into your hands.

603
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,420
I knew I can no longer keep this
under wraps.

604
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,620
It was a waste

605
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,220
to grant him the name "Jinzhong."

606
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,660
Such a treacherous thing.

607
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,740
If I didn't elevate him,

608
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,020
he'd still be

609
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
a lowly blacksmith!

610
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,460
If he didn't betray me

611
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,660
and confess what happened at Gu City,

612
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,620
would I even take the risk
and start a rebellion

613
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,780
and ruin half of my life's achievements?

614
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,180
You truly like to judge others
based on your beliefs.

615
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,180
You put Gu City in danger

616
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,700
because of your own interest.

617
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,300
You have no morals.

618
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,820
You defied the imperial edict

619
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,980
and started a rebellion.

620
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,700
You have no loyalty.

621
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,340
You're also someone
who has no morals or loyalty.

622
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,340
How dare you expect others
to keep your secrets?

623
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,020
But you were wrong

624
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,620
about one thing.

625
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,020
That Xu Jinzhong never told me

626
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,780
about these.

627
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,420
He already died

628
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,860
before I could interrogate him.

629
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,180
His Majesty summoned you to the capital

630
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,860
only to hear your explanation
and to spare your life.

631
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,740
Yet you suspected

632
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,100
that Xu Jinzhong had betrayed you.

633
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,180
So you started a rebellion right away.

634
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,620
It was your foolishness

635
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,900
that sent you to your death.

636
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,180
Impossible!

637
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,340
I rebelled because His Majesty wanted
to take my life!

638
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,540
I never make the wrong choice!

639
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,660
This is your retribution!

640
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,000

641
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
(Eastern Castle)

642
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,900
Do you know

643
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,620
how many soldiers of Gu City
couldn't die in peace

644
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,540
and how many people lost their homes
because of you?

645
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,500
Let me ask you this.

646
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,900
Do you have

647
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,660
a good night's sleep

648
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,260
