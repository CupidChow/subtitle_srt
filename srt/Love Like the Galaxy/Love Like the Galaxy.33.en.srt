00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,840
=Episode 33=

3
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,334
Your Highness.

4
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:33,294
Your Highness,

5
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,494
what's the matter?

6
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:36,454
Why are you out here barefoot
without a robe?

7
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:37,973
You'll catch a cold like this.

8
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,093
Did you hear

9
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,093
anything strange just now?

10
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:45,734
It's already late at night.

11
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:48,174
Why would there be a strange sound
in the Eastern Palace?

12
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,934
Could it be the palace servant on duty?

13
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:53,214
This won't do.

14
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:55,133
I just feel something's not right.

15
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:56,774
I need to check

16
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:57,934
if the tiger seals are still here.

17
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:41,093
They're still here.

18
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:43,093
You can rest assured now.

19
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:44,533
It's a serious matter.

20
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,533
This item concerns
the reputation of the Eastern Palace

21
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,054
and Changqiu Palace.

22
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,693
I can't make any mistakes.

23
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:52,413
If anything truly happens,

24
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:54,813
putting aside I might lose
my title as the Crown Prince,

25
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,774
I'm afraid Mother might be implicated.

26
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,573
I don't eat or sleep well

27
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,054
for the past few days.

28
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:02,934
It's as if these tiger seals

29
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,734
are godly objects

30
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:06,894
straggling me

31
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:08,573
until I'm out of breath.

32
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,734
You worried too much.

33
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:13,454
These tiger seals were kept
in the palace for so many years.

34
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:15,093
It was never lost before.

35
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,534
Keeping these under Father's care

36
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,013
and my care,

37
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,213
how would it be the same?

38
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:20,854
I'm worried.

39
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,453
Information will leak when there are
too many people around in the palace.

40
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:24,893
I don't feel secure keeping these

41
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,734
in the Eastern Palace.

42
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:29,974
Why don't

43
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:32,213
we don't stay here for these few days

44
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,773
and bring these tiger seals
along to Zigui Courtyard?

45
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:39,253
The guard there is my cousin, Sun Sheng.

46
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,414
You can feel more assured.

47
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:44,813
We'll bring back the tiger seals
when it's time to mobilize the troops.

48
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:47,013
You're right.

49
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,654
Zigui Courtyard has fewer people
so it's safer.

50
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:50,854
Tomorrow,

51
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:53,573
I'll take these tiger seals
out of the palace.

52
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,013
Young Lady,

53
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:03,253
time to get up.

54
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,294
Why is the door opened?

55
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:08,893
Young Lady,

56
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,573
why are you sleeping here?

57
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:27,934
Young Lady,

58
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:29,734
you must not sleep here next time.

59
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,934
Old Madam said

60
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,054
it's cold sleeping like this.

61
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,174
You'll be forgetful
when you're old in the future.

62
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:37,854
That's how Old Madam is now.

63
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,133
She has poor memories now.

64
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:50,534
Grandmother's memories
never deteriorate.

65
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:52,573
She could still remember

66
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:55,133
Madam Zhang next door didn't return
the two eggs she borrowed

67
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:56,854
20 years ago.

68
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,253
You must not

69
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:02,013
let Old Madam hear this.

70
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,693
Or else she'll hold a grudge on you
for another ten years.

71
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,654
It's your rest day today.

72
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:10,734
Are you going out to have fun
with General Ling today?

73
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,294
I can wear

74
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:14,773
your hair nicely.

75
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:20,534
I don't want to go out.

76
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,974
This rest day is hard to come by.

77
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:24,934
I'll just stay home

78
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,013
and not go anywhere.

79
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,854
Did you fight with General Ling again?

80
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:32,133
What do you mean by "again?"

81
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,734
Do I always fight with him?

82
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:39,693
Who doesn't call General Ling

83
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:42,174
the cold-faced general

84
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:44,414
and who doesn't tremble in fear
when they see him?

85
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,174
Only you dare to be upset with him.

86
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:51,213
But with your wisdom,

87
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,734
you're capable of coaxing anyone.

88
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:56,094
Yet, you refused

89
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:58,373
to coax General Ling.

90
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:00,333
So

91
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:02,253
both of you treat

92
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:03,974
each other differently.

93
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:07,813
What do you mean by "differently?"

94
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,734
It's hard to deal with him.

95
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,854
So I'm too lazy to attend to him.

96
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,693
Young Lady.

97
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:20,974
Someone from the palace came

98
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,414
with Crown Princess's message.

99
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,414
The tiger seals are missing?

100
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:33,693
When and where did they go missing?

101
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:36,414
Why did you bring the seals out
from the Eastern Palace?

102
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,213
Didn't I tell you

103
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,174
to keep the seals in the Eastern Palace?

104
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:42,174
I was too worried about the tiger seals

105
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:43,654
that I couldn't sleep well every day.

106
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,494
I even hear strange noises.

107
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,253
Crown Princess said many people
in the palace could cause problems.

108
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,693
So she suggested handing

109
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:51,373
the tiger seals to her cousin,
Sun Sheng,

110
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:52,813
and bringing them to Zigui Courtyard.

111
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:53,934
I thought

112
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:55,373
since he's her relative

113
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,534
and the Head of Imperial Bodyguards
for many years,

114
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:58,854
he'd watch over

115
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:01,013
this important object more carefully.

116
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:02,693
But I didn't expect

117
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:04,813
him to lose them on his way.

118
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:06,373
Zisheng,

119
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:07,934
General Wan will lead the troops

120
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,414
to suppress bandits
and rescue General Wang in two days.

121
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,133
I have to send off the three armies

122
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:13,654
in front of all officials.

123
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,573
If I can't take out the tiger seals,

124
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,494
what would happen then?

125
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:19,013
I told you

126
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:22,013
that Sun Sheng is useless
and unreliable.

127
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,534
Why do you still keep him

128
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,133
as the Head of Imperial Bodyguards

129
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,213
and carry out such an important task?

130
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,133
He's after all
the Crown Princess's cousin.

131
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:30,934
The Crown Princess pleaded
with me to vouch for him.

132
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,414
I can't just turn her down.

133
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:36,973
You're always like this.

134
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,134
You appoint friends and relatives

135
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:41,093
without any regard
for their talents and virtues.

136
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,254
Zisheng,

137
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:43,894
I know I made a big mistake.

138
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,333
Can you help me

139
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,414
think of something

140
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:47,934
that I should do next?

141
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:52,493
It all started with Wang Chun.

142
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,093
Have you asked what he thinks?

143
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,733
The Cavalry General is

144
00:08:58,894 --> 00:08:59,853
sick.

145
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:01,254
Sick?

146
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:04,174
What about Grand Tutor Lou?

147
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,294
Don't tell me he's sick too.

148
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:07,414
Well, no.

149
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,853
He said this matter could be
a serious or a minor one.

150
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:10,853
Admitting my negligence,

151
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:12,294
failing Father's trust,

152
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,733
and being incapable of governing

153
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,054
will make it serious.

154
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,213
To make it a minor matter,

155
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,014
I could say

156
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,054
I simply lost it

157
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:22,693
because of my carelessness.

158
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:24,374
Anyone could think of this.

159
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:26,174
What about your countermeasures?

160
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,213
Grand Tutor Lou told me to beg Mother

161
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:30,973
so she'd ask forgiveness
from Father on my behalf.

162
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:32,813
To avoid Mother from losing face,

163
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:34,733
Father will definitely show some mercy.

164
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,654
Then do you think

165
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:39,054
this method will work?

166
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,493
As their child,

167
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,093
forget that I fail my duty as a son,

168
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,374
I can't always cause
my parents problems all the time.

169
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,693
Mother is a respectable
and noble person.

170
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,213
For more than 20 years,

171
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:51,654
she never asks favors from Father

172
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,093
over personal matters.

173
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,654
I don't want this matter

174
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:58,934
to humiliate Mother.

175
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:01,934
There may be

176
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,613
a way to solve this matter.

177
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,014
Zisheng, you're here.

178
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:13,213
Why are you here?

179
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,654
I'm worried about this matter.

180
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:25,613
Zisheng is your brother

181
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,213
and someone Father trusts.

182
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:29,573
His words carry more weight

183
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,654
compared to what others say.

184
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,213
There is nothing you
and I can do about this matter.

185
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:35,453
But it'll be easy

186
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:37,254
for Zisheng.

187
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,934
It's not hard to solve this problem.

188
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,134
But

189
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,693
you'll need to help Crown Prince.

190
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,093
As long as I can share
Crown Prince's burden,

191
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,654
I'm willing to risk my life to do it.

192
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,654
Crown Princess only needs
to admit your mistake to His Majesty.

193
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:02,973
Tell him it was your fault

194
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,093
and His Highness was implicated
because of you.

195
00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:06,254
Won't this

196
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:08,453
be deceiving His Majesty?

197
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:10,934
This is the only solution.

198
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:14,134
Unless

199
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:15,973
you're not willing.

200
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,174
It's not that I'm not willing to you.

201
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:19,453
But I just...

202
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:20,693
How can men push away

203
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,973
the responsibility

204
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,134
by saying it's a woman's fault?

205
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,774
Isn't this just making
the women take the blame?

206
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:33,213
I thought it was your rest day today.

207
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:34,693
Why are you here?

208
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,414
We're discussing something here.

209
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,054
It's not convenient for you to be here.

210
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:43,374
Leave now.

211
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,333
Crown Princess invited me here.

212
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,014
Why do you want me to leave?

213
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:52,493
It's my fault.

214
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,534
I thought

215
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,294
that Shaoshang won the trust of Mother

216
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,414
and even helped her solve many problems.

217
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,213
Seeing how intelligent
and sensible she is,

218
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,853
I'm sure she can help us.

219
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:02,613
That's why I invited her here.

220
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,254
Shaoshang,

221
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:18,414
don't quarrel with Zisheng
because of me.

222
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:20,453
Let's go out first.

223
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,493
That was outrageous.

224
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:38,254
He actually chased me out.

225
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:40,534
Zisheng was only worried

226
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,654
that you might be implicated
in this matter.

227
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,414
I wasn't being thoughtful enough.

228
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,174
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

229
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,213
I was just worried
about Crown Prince's current situation.

230
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:53,213
His Highness has made many mistakes

231
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,613
and Father has not been happy about it.

232
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:58,294
If he committed such
a serious crime this time,

233
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:00,894
I'm afraid it'll implicate Mother.

234
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,134
If everything fails,

235
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:10,374
I can just go and meet Father

236
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,613
and admit that I lost the tiger seals.

237
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:14,733
To protect Mother and His Highness,

238
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:15,894
I can sacrifice my life.

239
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,134
You can't do that.

240
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,613
If His Majesty wants to punish you,

241
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:21,093
you'll lose your position

242
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:22,573
as the Crown Princess.

243
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:28,453
His Highness already has

244
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,453
someone in his heart.

245
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,213
If I give up my position,

246
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,573
it might allow them to be together.

247
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,733
Crown Princess.

248
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:21,613
Young Madam,

249
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:22,493
it's getting dark.

250
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,613
Young Master instructed us
to send you home.

251
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:25,934
Where's General Ling?

252
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,813
General Wan requested
to meet Young Master

253
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:30,414
to discuss the reinforcement
for General Wang.

254
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:31,774
He'll return
after the discussion is over.

255
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:33,213
Young Madam, please board the carriage.

256
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:40,693
You said you'll prepare a footstool.

257
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,014
Why didn't you prepare one?

258
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:43,374
If we prepare one,

259
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:45,573
how will Young Master carry you
into the carriage?

260
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:50,414
There's no footstool.

261
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:53,453
You can step on our backs
to get into the carriage.

262
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:57,174
No need.

263
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:00,174
I sent you into the palace.

264
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:02,374
Don't be stubborn.

265
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:03,813
Let me send you back.

266
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:04,693
No need.

267
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:06,374
I can go back myself.

268
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:09,453
Hey!

269
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:11,054
Ling Buyi, put me down!

270
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:12,294
What are you doing?

271
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:15,693
Ling Buyi, put me down.

272
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:18,894
With this little strength,

273
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:20,693
how can you walk back home?

274
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,333
I won't go back, then.

275
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:24,493
I'll go to Changqiu Palace.

276
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,414
I'll just go and see Her Majesty.

277
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:40,093
Shaoshang,

278
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,813
I shouldn't have raised my voice at you.

279
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:44,414
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,693
The matter of the tiger seals is
very serious.

281
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:50,613
I really don't want you to get involved.

282
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,054
That's why I was harsh with my words.

283
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,333
How about this?

284
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,654
Go and rest in Changqiu Palace.

285
00:15:58,134 --> 00:15:59,294
As for the rest,

286
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:02,774
let me take care of it.

287
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:06,054
Is that all right?

288
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,853
Can you tell
if Young Madam is upset or not?

289
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,174
If she can let it go easily,

290
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:36,054
it won't be her.

291
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,613
Keep an eye on the Eastern Palace,

292
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:41,374
especially Crown Princess.

293
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:43,254
Anything unusual,

294
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,294
inform me immediately.

295
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:46,934
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

296
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:50,894
Your Majesty, look

297
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,813
what I've found today.

298
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:01,733
I can't believe you found it.

299
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,374
Isn't this the drawer

300
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,934
Crown Prince wore when he was born?

301
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:07,814
Your Majesty, you gave birth
to two princes and three princesses.

302
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,374
You only kept

303
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,453
the Crown Prince's drawer.

304
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,094
No matter what hardship
His Majesty had faced,

305
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,094
you never discard it.

306
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:18,334
How could I bear

307
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:20,174
to throw it away?

308
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:21,253
I still remember

309
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:23,854
I gave birth to Crown Prince
during the hardest time

310
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:26,293
because His Majesty hadn't achieved
his great cause yet.

311
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:28,293
So I was scared all the time.

312
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,414
Among the rest,

313
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:31,493
he's bigger than other babies.

314
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:35,334
I was in labor for 20 hours
before delivering him.

315
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:37,013
His Majesty was worried

316
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:38,934
that he had almost fainted.

317
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,574
As the saying goes,

318
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,453
the more the child tortures
the pregnant mother,

319
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:46,053
the more filial the child will be
after being born.

320
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:47,253
You're right about that.

321
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:48,973
Crown Prince is

322
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,213
the most obedient among my children.

323
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,053
It was as if he knew

324
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,293
how much I suffered because of him.

325
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,094
Luckily, His Majesty grants

326
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:00,814
him the tiger seals to command the army

327
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,773
and scare off those
who have bad intentions.

328
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:06,934
His position as the Crown Prince
is stable now.

329
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:09,493
I can feel more assured now.

330
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:13,733
Were you worried about him losing
his position as the Crown Prince?

331
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,614
I never thought

332
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:17,854
he was suitable to be the Crown Prince.

333
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:20,733
But do you know

334
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:24,894
what happens to the descendants
of a crown prince

335
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,293
who stepped down from his position?

336
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:28,693
They either take their lives

337
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:30,374
or are killed.

338
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:34,973
Even if this is my selfish reason
as a mother.

339
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,293
If the child I gave birth to
with so much hardship

340
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,614
dies unexpectedly,

341
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,574
it'll be the end

342
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,094
of my life.

343
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:00,973
Crown Princess,

344
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,614
have you seen
what the tiger seals look like?

345
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
(Chongde Hall)

346
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:32,854
I, Wan Songbai greet Your Majesty.

347
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:36,733
I wish General Wan victory

348
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,973
in suppressing the bandit this time.

349
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:41,213
Thank you, Your Majesty.

350
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,693
Grant the tiger seal!

351
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:47,894
Yes, Your Majesty.

352
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,293
Wait!

353
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:26,374
What seems to be the problem,

354
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,293
Marquis Yue?

355
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:42,854
Your Majesty,

356
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,934
it's said there are magnets
within the tiger seals,

357
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,334
which could stick them together.

358
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:50,614
These tiger seals can command
the three armies.

359
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,374
We must not be careless.

360
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,733
General Wan,

361
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,013
aren't you going to examine it?

362
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:10,854
If it's true or fake,

363
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:13,814
we'll know once we test it.

364
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:24,253
Zisheng.

365
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:35,773
General Wan.

366
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:37,134
General Ling.

367
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:02,654
Marquis Yue,

368
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:06,174
any more doubts?

369
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:11,213
Not anymore.

370
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:15,334
I wish General Wan

371
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,574
to return with victory.

372
00:23:17,693 --> 00:23:18,773
Thank you.

373
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:42,374
I wish General Wan

374
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:44,293
to return with victory!

375
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:48,374
Victory! Victory! Victory!

376
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:02,934
(The tiger seals I made only look)

377
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:04,213
(the same on the outside.)

378
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,453
(But I didn't know
there were magnets in these seals.)

379
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,213
(That's why I didn't add any magnets.)

380
00:24:10,693 --> 00:24:12,053
(Why did they stick together?)

381
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:21,574
(How about this?)

382
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,894
(Go and rest in Changqiu Palace.)

383
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:25,814
(As for the rest,)

384
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:28,773
(leave it to me.)

385
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,733
Young Master,

386
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,574
we received news

387
00:24:46,574 --> 00:24:47,574
that Young Madam...

388
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:51,453
I mean

389
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:54,134
Lady Cheng went to the Eastern Palace.

390
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:57,854
She's probably there
to give some suggestions.

391
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:01,293
This is what she's like.

392
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:05,334
She won't let those who harmed her go.

393
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:08,814
She even won't disappoint
those who treat her well.

394
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,733
To save Crown Prince and Her Majesty,

395
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:16,574
it's impossible for her
to just suggest ideas.

396
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,094
Qi,

397
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:23,293
get the Huo clan's tiger seals.

398
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:27,174
Marquis Yue bribed Sun Sheng
to steal the tiger seals.

399
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:29,374
He wanted the Crown Prince to be
in a situation he couldn't get out of.

400
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,973
It'll take time to trace
the whereabouts of tiger seals now.

401
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:34,414
Only the Huo clan's
tiger seals can help now.

402
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:49,614
Young Master,

403
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:51,134
His Majesty granted

404
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:53,414
these tiger seals
to General Huo in the past.

405
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:56,134
It's also General Huo's
only relic left in this world.

406
00:25:56,574 --> 00:25:59,134
Are you really going to use it
for Lady Cheng's favor?

407
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:00,814
The Huo clan's tiger seals

408
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,693
and the ones Crown Prince had been made

409
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,134
by the same master.

410
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:07,574
Except for some subtle patterns,

411
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:09,374
they look the same.

412
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,174
Only by doing this,

413
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:14,733
Shaoshang won't be exposed.

414
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:16,973
His Majesty dotes on you,

415
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:18,773
that's why he granted
General Huo's tiger seals

416
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,654
to you as your private seals.

417
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,134
If you give it out,

418
00:26:22,293 --> 00:26:23,733
you'll no longer own

419
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,493
any of the Huo clan's relics.

420
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:28,094
Are you sure you want
to hand it over to help Lady Cheng?

421
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:30,094
If they found out
the tiger seals are fake,

422
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:33,614
they'll know it was Shaoshang
who did it.

423
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:39,733
I've promised her

424
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:43,574
that no matter what she does,

425
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:47,574
I'll protect her.

426
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:51,574
This time is

427
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:57,174
no exclusion too.

428
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:21,174
Yangyang, why do you look troubled?

429
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,213
Everyone in the capital knows

430
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:24,213
that you're capable and virtuous.

431
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:25,174
I also heard

432
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:26,453
there are quite a few officials

433
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:27,773
who came to ask
for your hand in marriage.

434
00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:29,894
Even Young Marquis Ban
who always lost his way

435
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,814
comes here every day.

436
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:35,414
He can even remember the way
to our house now

437
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,134
and is no longer scared of getting lost.

438
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:40,094
Yangyang, the good news is approaching.

439
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:41,693
Why do you look troubled?

440
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,013
But

441
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,533
Aunt Yuanyi asked what I think

442
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:47,574
and told me to decide.

443
00:27:48,453 --> 00:27:49,574
Marriage is a serious matter.

444
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:51,213
How can I decide?

445
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:53,973
Niaoniao, you knew me well.

446
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:55,894
When have I ever had any opinions?

447
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:59,854
Isn't it good for you
to decide for yourself?

448
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,374
Look at me.

449
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:04,453
I can't even make my decision.

450
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:06,854
Stop taking your happiness for granted.

451
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:08,894
His Majesty granted
this marriage to you.

452
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:11,174
No one can break you off

453
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:12,293
unlike Song and me.

454
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:14,453
If the family doesn't agree,

455
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:15,453
we can only be

456
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,654
a pair of a miserable couple.

457
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:24,654
Say,

458
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:27,134
do you think

459
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:29,934
marrying is a good or a bad thing?

460
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:33,293
Why do I feel more troubled than before?

461
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:36,973
How would I know?

462
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,374
I'm not marrying someone.

463
00:28:38,814 --> 00:28:40,493
I'm going to take a husband.

464
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:44,013
Your Second Brother has agreed
to marry into the Wan Family.

465
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:49,814
What about you, Yangyang?

466
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:53,934
In any case,

467
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,334
the person I like

468
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:58,814
may not like me.

469
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:00,894
What?

470
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:03,533
Nothing.

471
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,374
I...

472
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:06,894
I'll just follow
Aunty Yuanyi's arrangement.

473
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:11,654
If she wants me to marry Ban Jia,

474
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:13,973
I'll agree to it.

475
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:16,094
No matter what,

476
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,174
Aunt Yuanyi will do what's best for me.

477
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:20,094
If she decides for me,

478
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:21,174
it can't be wrong.

479
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:22,414
How is that good?

480
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:24,094
After you get married,

481
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,973
your fate will be in someone's hands.

482
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:28,094
It's better to live alone.

483
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,814
After getting married,
the husband has to listen to his wife.

484
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,973
What's wrong with having your fate
in the hands of others?

485
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:35,414
It's exactly how
your Second Brother listens to me.

486
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,574
He'd never do the opposite
of what I said.

487
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:40,013
He looks like he was enjoying it too.

488
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:42,414
You got the sayings reversed.

489
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:43,973
How is this the same?

490
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,733
You won't understand even if I tell you.

491
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,253
What makes you think so?

492
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:53,374
Listen.

493
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,894
It's fairly simple

494
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,174
when it comes to relationships.

495
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,174
It's nothing more

496
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:58,934
than being together
if you like each other.

497
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:01,213
You can separate
if you don't like each other.

498
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,374
Why are you worried
about this all the time?

499
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:06,094
It's so unlike you.

500
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,814
Just tell me this.

501
00:30:09,094 --> 00:30:10,934
What do you feel

502
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:12,894
about Ling Buyi?

503
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:19,894
Do you like him?

504
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,854
I don't know.

505
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:35,574
Most of the time,

506
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:38,854
I'm happy when I'm with him.

507
00:30:39,614 --> 00:30:41,253
I also think

508
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:42,814
that I like him.

509
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:46,334
But whenever I feel

510
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,934
I can be happy with him,

511
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:50,814
he'll make me angry

512
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:52,614
that it suffocates me.

513
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:55,614
Your second brother and I used

514
00:30:55,614 --> 00:30:57,414
to quarrel every day in the past.

515
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,773
After that, we always make it up.

516
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:01,414
Just think about it.

517
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:03,374
When you're with him,

518
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:04,773
do you feel happy most of the time,

519
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:06,293
or unhappy most of the time?

520
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:10,773
Does he make you happy most of the time

521
00:31:10,773 --> 00:31:12,374
or upset you most of the time?

522
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,414
Won't you know after you compare it?

523
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,053
Compare?

524
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:22,374
When I was at Lord Ruyang's Mansion,

525
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,134
he helped me get out of the problem.

526
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:26,894
So it's a good thing.

527
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:29,213
But he threatened me with the bridge

528
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:31,414
at your home.

529
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:33,814
That was a bad thing.

530
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,973
One good and one bad.

531
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:37,773
They're even.

532
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:41,134
When I was in danger in Hua County,

533
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,614
he saved my life.

534
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,293
When I was in Mount Tugao,

535
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:46,374
he helped me again.

536
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:49,814
But he asked His Majesty

537
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:51,533
to grant this marriage against my will

538
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,174
and disregarded my family.

539
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,253
After that, he meddled in my affairs.

540
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,973
He didn't allow me
to eat and sleep a lot.

541
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:01,814
These are even now...

542
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,733
How can these be even?

543
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,414
Why not?

544
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:07,973
You merely resent him

545
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:09,053
because he made

546
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:10,973
you drink less

547
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:12,733
and sleep two hours less.

548
00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:15,013
But what about him?

549
00:32:15,574 --> 00:32:18,174
He put his life in danger to save you.

550
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:19,773
How is this even?

551
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:23,134
Putting these aside,

552
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:24,934
the wounds inflicted on his body were

553
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:27,253
because of you.

554
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:29,453
You must not be ungrateful.

555
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:33,293
Just saving your life

556
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,894
is enough to outweigh

557
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:36,693
all the resentments you have for him.

558
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:37,814
You

559
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,894
can't just take

560
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:40,894
what he did for you for granted

561
00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:43,213
just because he likes you

562
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,293
and you didn't have
to do anything for him, can you?

563
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:48,614
Qiqi, you have a point.

564
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:50,934
I may not know

565
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,614
the right way for married couples
to get along.

566
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,533
But I think

567
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,213
if there's someone

568
00:32:57,773 --> 00:32:59,293
who doesn't hesitate to risk his life

569
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:01,174
to save you when you're in danger

570
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,894
and protects you

571
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:05,414
when you're helpless,

572
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:08,453
then he's worth for you to like him.

573
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:10,773
Getting along with others is

574
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:13,253
nothing more than being sincere
with each other

575
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:16,253
and not letting
each other's feelings down.

576
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:36,654
Niaoniao!

577
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:38,094
Shaoshang, where are you going?

578
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:39,253
You haven't eaten yet!

579
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:41,174
Fu Deng, prepare the carriage!

580
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:41,973
No.

581
00:33:42,134 --> 00:33:43,574
Prepare the horse!

582
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,080
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

583
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:23,214
Did you stay out here all night?

584
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:25,334
Niaoniao,

585
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:27,613
I...

586
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:28,734
It's not only one night.

587
00:34:30,374 --> 00:34:32,294
As long as I'm not spending
the night at Changqiu Palace,

588
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,774
you'd send me home in secret

589
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:37,334
and guard the entrance.

590
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:39,734
I know you hate all these.

591
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:41,093
That's why I...

592
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:43,254
I planned to come and see you
at your residence.

593
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:48,254
I want to thank you

594
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,334
for the tiger seals.

595
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:52,854
I know the truth behind the incident.

596
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,093
You don't have to say more

597
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,334
about this to me.

598
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:00,334
I did everything willingly.

599
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:03,814
Is there anything else
that you don't know?

600
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:05,814
Of course, there are.

601
00:35:07,294 --> 00:35:08,453
Just like this moment,

602
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:10,814
I don't know if you want
to make up with me

603
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,374
because of what happened

604
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:16,653
or if you sincerely wanted to.

605
00:35:17,294 --> 00:35:18,854
But no matter what made you do this,

606
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:21,734
I don't want you
to feel reluctant to do it.

607
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:23,734
So

608
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,254
I can only come to see you.

609
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,653
You saved me many times.

610
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:35,133
I truly feel grateful.

611
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:40,053
But I can't follow my parents' example

612
00:35:40,653 --> 00:35:41,774
and obey my husband.

613
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:44,774
I can't leave my life to destiny

614
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:45,973
as Yangyang does.

615
00:35:47,374 --> 00:35:49,573
I don't know how
to become someone's wife.

616
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:52,854
When I was with you,

617
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:56,013
I felt I had to compromise
and lower myself.

618
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:57,934
But I just realized

619
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:01,334
that you've been compromising

620
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:03,453
and lowering yourself

621
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:06,453
all this while.

622
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:08,613
I have a fault at this too.

623
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:10,573
I was wrong

624
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:11,973
for trying to restrict

625
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:14,973
and restrain you

626
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:16,973
when I clearly love

627
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:19,533
how reckless

628
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:21,173
and brave you are.

629
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:23,053
Niaoniao,

630
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:25,694
you don't have to lower yourself

631
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:28,653
in my presence

632
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:30,414
like the rest.

633
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:33,173
I like

634
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:36,694
the way you are.

635
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:40,734
Actually,

636
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:42,894
I wanted to tell you two things.

637
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:44,653
The first one is,

638
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:46,814
from today on,

639
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:49,013
I'll do my best to treat you well

640
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:51,173
until you feel annoyed.

641
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:54,133
All right.

642
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:56,374
I'll remember this.

643
00:36:57,694 --> 00:36:59,013
What about the second one?

644
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:00,374
The second one is

645
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:04,374
when we grow old

646
00:37:05,414 --> 00:37:07,013
and our hair turns gray,

647
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:09,814
I'll never forget this day

648
00:37:11,294 --> 00:37:13,133
when I recall the days

649
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:16,934
you treat me well.

650
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:30,774
Shaoshang,

651
00:37:33,854 --> 00:37:35,334
let's marry sooner.

652
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:39,133
Shall we?

653
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:23,294
What is this place?

654
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:24,854
Why did you take me here?

655
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,133
This is where my mother lives.

656
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:31,414
I want you

657
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:33,254
to meet my mother.

658
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:36,973
But we haven't officially betrothed yet.

659
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,734
Don't you think it's too soon

660
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:41,573
to meet my future mother-in-law?

661
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:42,894
No, it's not too soon.

662
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:45,934
It's obviously too late.

663
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,133
How I wish

664
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:50,414
I could hold the betrothal
and invite everyone tomorrow.

665
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,214
Why are you so foolish?

666
00:38:55,214 --> 00:38:57,093
Can't you even pick apricot flowers?

667
00:38:57,694 --> 00:38:58,774
Calm down.

668
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:00,254
I'll pick another one for you.
Is that all right?

669
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,173
I want that one.

670
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,254
All right.

671
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:04,374
Hurry up!

672
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:05,374
Shaoshang.

673
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:07,734
After we go inside,

674
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,854
no matter what you see or hear,

675
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,173
just keep quiet first.

676
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:14,294
I'll explain everything to you after.

677
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,013
Is that all right?

678
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,013
Gosh!

679
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,934
Hurry up!

680
00:39:27,093 --> 00:39:28,093
All right.

681
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:39,173
Young Lady,

682
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:42,334
your nephew is here to see you.

683
00:39:48,414 --> 00:39:49,973
I, Cheng Shaoshang pay

684
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:52,294
my respect to the Young Lady.

685
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:57,694
So you're the one who came
for a free meal that day?

686
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:00,374
You even brought your wife with you

687
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:02,173
to ask for money this time.

688
00:40:03,013 --> 00:40:04,294
I'm warning you.

689
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,093
You must know when to stop
and not go too far.

690
00:40:07,214 --> 00:40:09,053
Chong may have a good temper.

691
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:10,934
But I won't let you eat and drink

692
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:12,294
for free all the time.

693
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:19,374
Junhua, don't be upset.

694
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:21,214
You're going to have wrinkles.

695
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:22,133
Nonsense.

696
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,053
I'm only 16. I don't have any wrinkles.

697
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:28,254
Were you bought off

698
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:30,374
by that shameless Yue Heng

699
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:31,573
and you're here to shame me?

700
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:32,894
Of course, not.

701
00:40:33,294 --> 00:40:36,053
Just you wait. I'll show you!

702
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:37,453
I'm going to make Yue Heng

703
00:40:37,694 --> 00:40:38,814
lose face

704
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,973
and have her reputation ruined!

705
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:42,653
In this world, His Majesty...

706
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,374
Brother Wen is not the only man.

707
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,613
Am I right?

708
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:48,973
You can still marry someone else.

709
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:50,254
Someone else?

710
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:54,934
That Ling is pleasing

711
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,854
to the eyes.

712
00:40:58,573 --> 00:40:59,653
But

713
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:02,173
he's a refugee from other places.

714
00:41:02,453 --> 00:41:03,734
So he's little poor.

715
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,533
His family doesn't have enough money
for food and medicine.

716
00:41:07,294 --> 00:41:08,173
But it's all right.

717
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:10,053
Brother has manpower and money.

718
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,533
He can help him.

719
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:12,453
The Ling clan

720
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:14,133
will gradually prosper.

721
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:14,774
That's right.

722
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:17,934
Brother...

723
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:22,254
I haven't seen my brother
for a long time.

724
00:41:25,093 --> 00:41:26,934
Where's he?

725
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:28,854
Where's my brother?

726
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:31,854
Where's my brother?

727
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:37,013
My brother...

728
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:40,053
He's already dead!

729
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:42,973
My brother is dead!

730
00:41:43,453 --> 00:41:45,533
His whole family and the whole clan

731
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:47,053
had died!

732
00:41:47,053 --> 00:41:49,133
My brother! My brother!

733
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:52,533
I want to see my brother!

734
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,214
My brother! My brother!

735
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:57,894
Ling Yi!

736
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:00,133
Why are you still here?

737
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:01,254
Why are you still alive?

738
00:42:01,254 --> 00:42:02,814
Why are you still alive
after betraying me?

739
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:04,734
I want you to die! Die!

740
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:06,493
Madam Huo,

741
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:07,613
he's your son, Ling Zisheng.

742
00:42:07,613 --> 00:42:08,814
Madam Huo.

743
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:18,854
Zisheng,

744
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:20,093
tend to your injuries now.

745
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:21,053
Leave her to me.

746
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:22,053
Die!

747
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:23,414
Go now.

748
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:26,053
- Die!
- Yes, he'll definitely die!

749
00:42:26,053 --> 00:42:27,093
Yes, he'll die.

750
00:42:27,093 --> 00:42:28,694
- He'll die.
- Die!

751
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:34,214
Zisheng, let me tend to your injury.
