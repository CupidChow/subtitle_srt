=Episode 36=

3
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,340
Your Majesty.

4
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,890
This is the food menu I drafted
for the birthday banquet.

5
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,660
Can you take a look

6
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,100
and see if anything should be added?

7
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,860
(Qianqiu Banquet Menu List)

8
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,170
I don't think this is right.

9
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,370
A ruler sets an example
for his followers.

10
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,060
An extravagant banquet like this

11
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,740
contradicts His Majesty's advocacy

12
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,970
of frugality.

13
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,730
No.

14
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,820
I shall talk to His Majesty and advise him.

15
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,010
Don't.

16
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,140
The ministers have worked very hard too.

17
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,540
They have to either
study thousands of scrolls

18
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,300
to earn His Majesty's favor

19
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,140
or they have to risk their life
on the battlefield

20
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,450
to earn a title.

21
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,730
Don't ruin someone else's future,
Your Majesty.

22
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,370
What did you just say?

23
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,690
What I mean

24
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,730
is that Your Majesty, you are
His Majesty's wife

25
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,610
before you are his subordinate.

26
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,010
If you want to advise His Majesty
for the better,

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,300
you

28
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,530
should say,

29
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,860
a married couple always

30
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,890
should be equals.

31
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,860
No wife should have a feast

32
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,370
while her husband

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,530
contents himself with simple dishes.

34
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,610
And then, tell His Majesty

35
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,090
to first hold a grand ceremony
for his birthday

36
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,940
before he extends the same favor

37
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,140
to his wife.

38
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,500
Remember.

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,170
When you speak,

40
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,090
make sure you sound vulnerable
and gentle.

41
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,650
Do not meet His Majesty's gaze.

42
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,890
Do not look like
you are there to criticize him.

43
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,010
You're young and yet,

44
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,810
you have your ways with words.

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,250
You tamed Zisheng

46
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,010
like that too, didn't you?

47
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,140
Look at the items here.

48
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,250
Are you trying to build your courtyard

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,090
the same as the one
in Marquis Quling's Residence here?

50
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,420
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,250
Just let me handle the organization
of this birthday banquet.

52
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,660
That way, I can return home sooner.

53
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,770
Zisheng has brought me items
from my room

54
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,660
and they have made me homesick.

55
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,540
I will not do you this favor.

56
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,490
You don't look homesick at all.

57
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,380
It's more like you don't like how
restrictive it is in here.

58
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,450
Your Majesty, just help me this once.

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,890
I won't help you.

60
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,930
Mother.

61
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,100
You were right that day.

62
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
My body and my titles I received

63
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,260
are all because Father and Mother grant.

64
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,660
Whatever expensive things I get,

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,540
I can get them because of
taking advantage of your and Father's power.

66
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,980
Therefore,

67
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,930
I asked choreographers
to teach me a dance.

68
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,010
I have been practicing
in the residence for long.

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,380
If my performance is short
of satisfactory during the banquet,

70
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,610
please ignore my shortcomings.

71
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,660
Just cheer for me.

72
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,730
I appreciate this filial piety of yours.

73
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,890
However, I heard

74
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,770
that you corralled ten thousand mus of land

75
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,450
in Hongnong County
as your private garden.

76
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,050
Is it true?

77
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,010
The land outside of the palace

78
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,730
is a dry and hard rocky beach.

79
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,330
No one wants it.

80
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,210
I corralled that place to develop it

81
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,300
so that homeless citizens can one day
work on it.

82
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,420
Not only will it produce food,
it will also provide their livelihood.

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,420
I just want you and Father

84
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,770
to acknowledge my capability.

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,930
The world belongs to us.

86
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,540
There are ministers in charge
of development.

87
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,170
You need not worry about it.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,930
Enough.

89
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,420
That's all for today.

90
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,330
I'm tired now.

91
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,890
You can all leave.

92
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,130
Mother, it's fine if you favor
Ling Buyi over me.

93
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,340
But now, why do you trust
the daughter of a general

94
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,860
more than you trust me?

95
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,490
I heard ever since Cheng Shaoshang

96
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,130
took over Changqiu Palace,

97
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,050
she cooked dessert one day

98
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,570
and grew vegetables another.

99
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,810
Not only did you not punish her,

100
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,540
you even supported her financially.

101
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
And when I want to do something,

102
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,250
you don't support me,
but rebuked me instead.

103
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,250
It's because Shaoshang

104
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,900
only consumed what is useful.

105
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,130
She did not waste resources
because she wanted to.

106
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,130
I'm tired.

107
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,930
Leave now.

108
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,930
Shaoshang.

109
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,810
The noble ladies brought in
by Fifth Princess

110
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,570
are too many for Changqiu Palace.

111
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,900
They are an eyesore.

112
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,980
I will write a letter.

113
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,540
Lady Luo and you will bring it
to Yongle Palace

114
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,690
so that Consort Yue can look after them.

115
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

116
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,610
Fifth Princess,

117
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,730
dear esteemed guests,

118
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,250
I have informed Consort Yue.

119
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,780
She has arranged so that

120
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,130
all of you will spend a night
in Longyuan Garden.

121
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,540
Cheng Shaoshang.

122
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,300
Do you know where you live now

123
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,810
used to be my residence?

124
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,050
Fifth Princess, if you wish to stay
in Changqiu Palace tonight,

125
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,610
I can make another arrangement.

126
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,570
No need.

127
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,340
I don't want Mother to say
I was being petty.

128
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,130
I have never stayed
in Yongle Palace before.

129
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,540
I can spend two nights here.

130
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,300
Shaoshang.

131
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,660
Shaoshang.

132
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,900
How clumsy of you, Lady Cheng.

133
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,930
Save her!

134
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,780
Hurry up!

135
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,300
Aren't you very capable?

136
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,490
Come back up.

137
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,980
Mother said you were gifted
and graceful.

138
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,780
As if you were one of the kind.

139
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,250
Pray tell. How did you fall
into the lake while you were guiding us?

140
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,900
Indeed.

141
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,100
Look how frantic she is.

142
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,420
Fifth Princess.

143
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,370
If this carries on, she might die.

144
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Someone is always dying every day.

145
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,810
It's just one life.

146
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,170
It's not a big deal.

147
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,170
Also, Lady Cheng fell
into the lake herself.

148
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,420
We can't swim

149
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,540
so we can't save her.

150
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,130
Why don't you

151
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,490
jump in to save her then?

152
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,130
(Lady Zuo)
She's coming back up.

153
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,040
(Lady Zuo)

154
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,130
Aren't there snakes in the water?

155
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,420
Come up now. Hurry!

156
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,540
There are snakes.

157
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,610
There are snakes.

158
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,980
Go away.

159
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,130
This is so scary.

160
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,660
Let's go.

161
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,020
Cheng Shaoshang.

162
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,570
Listen up now.

163
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,380
I didn't come here today

164
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,660
just for the banquet tomorrow.

165
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,540
I also came here for you.

166
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,330
This is your warning.

167
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,570
Behave yourself
when you see me next time.

168
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,970
Otherwise,

169
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,260
the non-venomous snakes here

170
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
might turn

171
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,450
into something else next time.

172
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,970
Your Highness,

173
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,300
will she file a complaint?

174
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,810
What are you afraid of?

175
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,050
No one saw us.

176
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,050
We just have to deny it.

177
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,540
Lady Luo.

178
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,690
What did you see?

179
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,810
I...

180
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,420
Think twice before you reply.

181
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,330
Aren't you getting married soon?

182
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,810
If you're found to have disrespected
the princess before your wedding,

183
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,620
I wonder how your in-laws
will treat you.

184
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,420
Your Highness,

185
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,210
we saw nothing.

186
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,570
Indeed.

187
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,330
We retired to our room early.

188
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,810
Lady Cheng

189
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,690
accidentally fell into the water
on her way back.

190
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,300
She was then bitten by a snake.

191
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,500
She only has herself to blame,
doesn't she?

192
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
What is that noise?

193
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,380
Who is there?

194
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,810
Everyone is here.

195
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,780
Fifth Brother,

196
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,850
who are you meeting this time

197
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,690
behind your wife's back?

198
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,050
Fifth Brother, don't let anyone know

199
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,540
you snuck out again.

200
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,020
Otherwise,

201
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,690
Father will be more disappointed in you.

202
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,500
Fifth Sister,

203
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,740
I passed by here.

204
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,900
I saw nothing.

205
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,930
I speak the truth.

206
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,140
When did you come here?

207
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,090
Will the Fifth Prince

208
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,690
tell anyone what happened today?

209
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,420
He's just the bad apple
from a palace maid.

210
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,930
I call him Fifth Brother out of respect.

211
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,420
Truth be told, he pairs very well

212
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,380
with Lady Cheng.

213
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,620
Shaoshang.

214
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,500
I brought you the clothes you want.

215
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,690
Your clothes are drenched.

216
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,090
Where were you?

217
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,810
I'll take your wet clothes away.

218
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,740
When you were in
Marquis Quling's Residence,

219
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,570
I longed to see you.

220
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,570
Now that you live here,

221
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,500
I thought we could see each other all the time.

222
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,850
However, you're busier than anticipated.

223
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,970
Even the meal

224
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,690
is delivered by eunuchs.

225
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,810
Seeing you

226
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,900
is harder than before.

227
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,380
Tonight,

228
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,500
I miss you more than ever

229
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,420
and so I came.

230
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,900
Do you know?

231
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,450
Everyone in the royal court
is envious of me.

232
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,850
They say I'm about to marry
a graceful woman.

233
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,140
Even His Majesty says

234
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,140
you're smart and capable,

235
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,170
that you did a good job
managing Changqiu Palace.

236
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,450
I feel much relieved knowing that
you're living well

237
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,570
in the palace.

238
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,450
Shaoshang,

239
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,090
His Majesty lets you handle
Her Majesty's

240
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,140
birthday banquet

241
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,050
not because you are my fiancee.

242
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,930
It's because only you

243
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,810
can hold a truly meaningful banquet
for Her Majesty.

244
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,090
People always say

245
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,210
you're stubborn and cold.

246
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,500
That's because
they don't know you at all.

247
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,330
When you decide

248
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,930
to treat someone well,

249
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,300
you mean it.

250
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,500
You'll do everything.

251
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,660
Even at your expense.

252
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,740
You...

253
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,540
Niaoniao.

254
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,620
Niaoniao.

255
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,260
What happened?

256
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,090
Niaoniao.

257
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,420
What's the matter?

258
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,810
It's okay.

259
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,210
All is well now.

260
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,900
Hug me tighter.

261
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,810
Tighter.

262
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,210
Even tighter.

263
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,690
Enough. I can't breathe now.

264
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,330
There, there.

265
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,140
Niaoniao.

266
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,170
What happened?

267
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,690
Niaoniao.

268
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,020
What went wrong?

269
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,570
I miss home.

270
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,610
I was busy practicing in the residence

271
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,330
and I have yet taught you many things.

272
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,180
Let me

273
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,890
tell you about pressure points today.

274
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,130
This

275
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,370
is Mingmen, the pressure point of life.

276
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,330
Other than Mingmen, there is also...

277
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,050
Other than Mingmen,

278
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,890
can you teach me something else?

279
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
At least if someone ever bullies me,

280
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,370
I can fight back.

281
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,410
I'm here.

282
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,020
No one will bully you.

283
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,410
What if you're not?

284
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,740
Okay.

285
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,090
What do you want to learn?

286
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,090
If you stand here,

287
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,460
and someone from behind...

288
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,090
Like this.

289
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,810
You stand here.

290
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,810
Someone ambushes you from behind

291
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,330
and shoves you.

292
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,850
Then I'll retaliate with this.

293
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,020
What do you think?

294
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,300
Use just one hand if you can.

295
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,460
Sure.

296
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,570
Don't use your hands if you can.

297
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
From now on,

298
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,610
my life

299
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,300
is yours.

300
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,980
Niaoniao.

301
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,700
Can you tell me

302
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,740
what exactly happened?

303
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,220
Can you

304
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,740
promise me something?

305
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,650
Yes.

306
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,300
As long as

307
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,330
it's about you.

308
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,780
What is the meaning of this decor?

309
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,090
Your Majesty.

310
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,700
This is called Tall Peaks
and Long Rivers.

311
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,980
Your Majesty, may you

312
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,300
rise as tall as a mountain

313
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,850
and you live as long as a river

314
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,410
to receive auspices.

315
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,850
That's considerate of you.

316
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,810
I now understand why she dotes on you.

317
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,500
It is an interesting decor.

318
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,540
Marvelous.

319
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,940
Long live Your Majesty.

320
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,810
At ease.

321
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,050
Have a seat.

322
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,980
Thanks, Your Majesty.

323
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,180
What is

324
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,890
going on?

325
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,980
Zisheng?

326
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,780
General Ling is the performer?

327
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,130
Zisheng plays so...

328
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,300
Only Lady Cheng can make Zisheng

329
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,410
play an instrument.

330
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,220
This is a birthday banquet

331
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,850
that surpasses expectations.

332
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,700
Lady Cheng's exceptional hosting skill

333
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,050
makes my gifts look so

334
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,090
banal.

335
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,090
Bravo.

336
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,410
Bravo.

337
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,020
I have always wanted to hear
your performance

338
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,570
but you always say you are too rusty.

339
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,220
Only Shaoshang can make you recall

340
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,700
how to play music again.

341
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,890
Your Majesty,

342
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,700
Third Prince has found new mines
within the fief.

343
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,460
The latest geographical map
is being delivered here

344
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,460
as we speak.

345
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,300
Wonderful news.

346
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,500
Father,

347
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,370
I have been looking for new mines for years

348
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,260
and I managed to find one
before Mother's birthday.

349
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
This is Mother's blessing.

350
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,180
I dare not claim it as mine.

351
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,300
You are my blessings.

352
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,410
Great.

353
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,700
Mother,

354
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,460
this is a pair of jade qilin

355
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,570
that we found in the Western Regions.

356
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,810
It means good things come in two.

357
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,300
Mother, I wish

358
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,020
you a long life.

359
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,330
We have spent a lot on it.

360
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,570
May Your Majesty spend your life
in eternal love.

361
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,330
Your Majesty,

362
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,570
this is not the only gift

363
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,020
the Crown Prince and his consort

364
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,540
brought with them.

365
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,410
Your Majesty,
do you taste any difference

366
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,610
in today's wine?

367
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,460
It's sweeter and rounder.

368
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,260
Where did you find this wine?

369
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,180
I did not find this wine.

370
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,890
His Majesty and you advocate
for frugality.

371
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,050
I dare not use rice to brew wine.

372
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,780
As I sought a substitute,

373
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,180
the seeds His Highness

374
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,220
brought from the Western Regions

375
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,460
bore fruits.

376
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,540
They are sweet but not sickening,
sour but not vinegary.

377
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,570
I had a taste

378
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,260
and thought it was perfect
for fruit wines.

379
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,220
Such an undertaking

380
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,700
is frugal in essence

381
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,850
without compromising
the gastronomical delights.

382
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,220
Well done.

383
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,180
My empress.

384
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,610
You should drink more today.

385
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:55,810
Of course.

386
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,850
My dear ministers.

387
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,890
Drink more.

388
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,570
It is amazing.

389
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,330
How can you drink wine
without side dishes?

390
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,570
Dear esteemed guests,

391
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,220
have a taste of the dishes
in front of you.

392
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,700
They are all made with

393
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,330
the walnut oil the Crown Prince brought
from the Western Regions.

394
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,410
Not only are the walnuts

395
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,370
sweet, they are also filling.

396
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,020
They are exotic and rare.

397
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,890
Thank you, Your Highness.

398
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,090
Wonderful.

399
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,540
The Crown Prince is concerned
about his subjects.

400
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,180
He has brought with him
many tummy-filling snacks.

401
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,330
Such generosity.

402
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,740
Good.

403
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,700
You will be rewarded.

404
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,700
Definitely.

405
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,570
-Thanks, Father.
-Thanks, Father.

406
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,570
Thanks, Your Majesty.

407
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,260
It's delicious.

408
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,060
(Madam Qu Ling, Liang Shang)

409
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,330
Good things come in two?

410
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,130
This is a menage à trois.

411
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,500
Father, Mother.

412
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,180
I have learned a dance

413
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,500
to perform before you.

414
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,180
May you live a long life.

415
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,220
That is sweet of you, Fifth Princess.

416
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,020
Since Fifth Sister will be dancing,

417
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,370
there has to be music.

418
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,570
I am willing to perform
with the Prince Consort

419
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,410
to add merry to your birthday, Mother.

420
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,050
Of course. The more the merrier.

421

431
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,050
Are you okay, Fifth Princess?

432
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:15,850
All right.

433
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
It's okay.

434
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,130
All of you will be rewarded.

435
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,090
Your Majesty.

436
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,090
Zisheng wishes to give Her Majesty a present.

437
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,570
Zisheng.

438
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,850
What rare gift have you brought
with you?

439
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,740
Your Majesty,

440
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,410
Shaoshang and I

441
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,330
found an old keepsake
of Grand Duke Xuan.

442
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,090
May Her Majesty be granted
Grand Duke Xuan's protection

443
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,500
and all her wishes will come true.

444
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,140
(Boat Trip. Cascading ivy,
lush green trees under the setting sun.)

445
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,610
Father was very fond

446
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,610
of poems.

447
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,740
He often gave the poems he wrote
to his friends

448
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,740
instead of keeping them to himself.

449
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,300
Therefore, not many of his works

450
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,610
remained after his passing.

451
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,220
I thought

452
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,570
I could never see Father's work again.

453
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,890
The value

454
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,940
of a gift doesn't matter much.

455
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,460
It is the thought that matters.

456
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,500
Zisheng.

457
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,540
Thank you, truly.

458
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,570
I know Zisheng

459
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,260
and Shaoshang

460
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,850
truly care about me.

461
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,700
Indeed.

462
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,500
Today is a special day.

463
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,370
This banquet

464
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,980
is masterfully organized.

465
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,890
For a jovial day like today,

466
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,500
I shall share it with my ministers.

467
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,740
A toast!

468
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,090
Come.

469
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,090
Let's drink

470
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,610
to our heart's content.

471
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,890
Let's drink to our heart's content.

472
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,010
Your wine is good.

473
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,700
Why don't you drink it?

474
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,220
Why did you

475
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,010
use my wine plate?

476
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,660
Drinking the wine I brew
from your wine plate

477
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,140
is more delicious.

478
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,530
Let's drink together then.

479
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,780
Is it sweet?

480
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,010
Very.

481
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,260
Because of the wine

482
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,450
or because of me?

483
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,010
Both.

484
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,660
What happened to your fingers?

485
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,700
From the zither practice last night?

486
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,220
Can you

487
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,580
promise me something?

488
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,970
Yes.

489
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,810
As long as

490
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,890
it's about you.

491
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,850
Yes, Your Highness?

492
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,330
I see a beauty.
She refuses to leave my mind.

493
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:52,010
One day without seeing her,
I go out of my mind.

494
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,370
Your Highness.

495
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,530
Open your eyes and look at me.

496
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,220
You're Ling Zisheng's fiancee.

497
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,180
Don't go away.

498
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,060
It's been a few days

499
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,490
and you look prettier than before.

500
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,180
Cheng Shaoshang!

501
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,450
Cheng Shaoshang!

502
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,180
Your Highness.

503
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,580
You have had too much to drink.

504
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,660
Time to sober up.

505
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,260
You wrench!

506
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,890
I can't swim.

507
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,810
This is murder!

508
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,890
Help!

509
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,260
Patient now, Your Highness.

510
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,740
I'll find a solution.

511
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,260
Help me.

512
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,300
Help.

513
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,740
I'm coming.

514
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,580
Your Highness.

515
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,060
Give it to me.

516
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,140
Grab onto this bamboo stick.

517
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,970
Grab onto it.

518
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,060
Over here.

519
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,060
Here.

520
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,890
Here.

521
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,220
Give it to me.

522
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,260
Grab it.

523
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,330
Here.

524
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,410
No, here.

525
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,700
No, here.

526
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,180
Hurry.

527
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,740
Grab onto it.

528
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,780
Hurry.

529
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,970
Grab it.

530
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,450
It's exhausting.

531
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,740
Your Highness.

532
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,010
This is exhausting. I can't save you.

533
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,180
You're a witch.

534
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,100
Your Highness.

535
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,140
Are you okay?

536
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,010
You're as evil

537
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,970
as that Ling Buyi.

538
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
Now that you know how scary
Ling Zisheng is,

539
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,300
you should stay away from me.

540
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,620
If he ever sees us together,

541
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,740
he might

542
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,740
do something even scarier.

543
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,780
You think I'm afraid of him?

544
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,740
He looks so dapper

545
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,930
but I know it's all an act.

546
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,620
He always bullies me.

547
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,930
I know him the best.

548
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,220
Cunning and petty.

549
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,410
Villainous and scheming.

550
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,180
Ling Buyi and you

551
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,620
are a match made in heaven.

552
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,490
Both are cold, inhuman.

553
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,010
I want to protect him.

554
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,010
You badmouthed him

555
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,370
and tried to court me.

556
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,370
If I bring this up to His Majesty,

557
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,740
you will not be spared.

558
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,260
Punishing you today

559
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,740
is not unreasonable.

560
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,530
Why? Why does everyone treat him better?

561
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,930
Even Father too.

562
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,740
You know the reason very well,
Your Highness.

563
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,580
Regardless of Ling Buyi,

564
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,620
His Majesty will still treat you like this.

565
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,780
He told you something, didn't he?

566
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,810
I know he is capable

567
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,810
so he publicizes my shortcomings
everywhere.

568
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,180
But I...

569
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,220
Not just your shortcomings.

570
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,140
Your Highness.

571
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,100
Although you're lazy

572
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,010
and can be quite stupid,

573
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,370
you often

574
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,930
offer a special perspective.

575
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,930
I heard

576
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,370
you are fond of tales from exotic lands.

577
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,700
How do you know?

578
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,970
However,

579
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,580
what I like

580
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,490
cannot be used for governance

581
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,060
nor can it be translated
into great literatures.

582
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,010
They are just trivia.

583
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,700
Father does not hold them
in high regard.

584
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,300
Your Highness.

585
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,180
You know what you like

586
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,370
has no used in the royal court

587
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,700
and is not favored by His Majesty.

588
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,180
Yet, you continue pursuing it.

589
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,410
You have a utter innocence.

590
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,300
That said,

591
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,490
why do you need

592
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,660
others' acknowledgment?

593
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,620
You like it. That's what matters,
isn't it?

594
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,490
In this regard,

595
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,970
we're quite similar.

596
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,450
For what you have said today,

597
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,180
I will look past this.

598
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,930
All right

599
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,260
From today onwards,

600
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,410
we'll be friends.

601
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,060
General Ling.

602
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,450
Yes?

603
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:11,780
I

604
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,620
will marry into the Northwest soon.

605
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,970
I don't know when I will see you again.

606
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,700
I want

607
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,810
to drink with you.

608
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,970
Oh, no.

609
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,450
The Fifth Prince and Lady Cheng...

610
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,740
They...

611
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,620
They what?

612
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,010
What happened to the Fifth Prince
and Lady Cheng?

613
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,100
They...

614
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,660
Speak now.

615
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,780
Stop stuttering.

616
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,970
They

617
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,300
met privately in Jingxin Lake.
