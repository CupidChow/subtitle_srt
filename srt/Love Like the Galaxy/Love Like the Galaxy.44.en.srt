3
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,180
(Tongniu County)

4
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,240
(Tongniu County)
Half a day after I persuaded Ma Rong to surrender,

5
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,080
he was stabbed to death
by Peng Kun's vice general.

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
What a coincidence.

7
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,239
That vice general knew
it was all over for Shouchun.

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Why did he still kill Ma Rong?

9
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,120
He was raised by Peng Kun.

10
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
He is loyal to Peng Kun.

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,519
Apparently, Peng Kun intended to take him
as his foster son.

12
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,639
Mr. Lou travels a lot

13
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,320
and is well-informed in many things.

14
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
Don't you know

15
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,440
that this person is close to Peng Kun?

16
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,359
I was careless

17
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,799
and didn't realise it.

18
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,560
I went to Lou's residence
before I went to battle

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
to see Grand Tutor Lou.

20
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,959
I wanted you to go to battle with me

21
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,280
but Grand Tutor Lou
was worried about your safety

22
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,759
and rejected me.

23
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,600
Who would've thought

24
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,479
you would take the risk again

25
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,079
and achieve something incredible

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,079
at Tongniu County?

27
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,079
It was just a coincidence.

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,919
I went to Shouchun last year

29
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,120
and got acquainted with Ma Rong

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,759
so we were on talking terms.

31
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,199
You are too humble.

32
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:09,479
Persuading a general to surrender

33
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,519
is not something
you could do with just a few words.

34
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,639
Oh.

35
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,199
Lou, do you also think

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Yan Zhong has defected?

37
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,359
Then, where is

38
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,399
General Cheng Shi

39
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,079
and the refined copper?

40
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,400
With the testimony of Li Feng,
the county assistant governor,

41
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,959
how can it be fake?

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,079
Besides,

43
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,679
Yan Zhong's letter of repentance

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,880
was even found in
the county office's study.

45
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,000
As for General Cheng,

46
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:36,359
I really don't know where he is.

47
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,880
(Greed has grown.
Heart filled with regret.)

48
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,600
Greed has grown.

49
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,160
Heart filled with regret.

50
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,799
It is Yan Zhong's handwriting.

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Feels like Official Yan made a mistake

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,519
to take care of his family.

53
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,160
It's forgivable.

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
Forgivable you say?

55
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,759
Is he the only one

56
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,479
with family members in this world?

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Thankfully, not everyone

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
is a coward like him.

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,519
Isn't the county assistant governor, Li Feng

60
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,120
locked up in the county office prison

61
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,120
because he would not surrender?

62
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,919
Has he been released?

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,559
We shouldn't let the good people down.

64
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,640
Many things happened
over the past two days.

65
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
Ma Rong wanted to release him

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,999
but something was wrong.

67
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,400
Don't worry, General Ling.

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,720
I will order someone
to release him right now.

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,760
Reporting!

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,400
Sir, it's bad.

71
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,960
The county office prison is on fire.

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,160
We extinguished the fire

73
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,999
but Official Li is...

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,439
It's Li Feng.

75
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,239
However,

76
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,520
he's already dead.

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,799
Shaoshang.

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,600
Shaoshang!

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,559
Shaoshang.

80
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,799
I'm here.

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
I think I'm going to die.

82
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,319
Aren't you in battle at Shouchun?

83
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,760
Why are you here?

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Qiqi is right.

85
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,400
The person you like

86
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,280
is the person you see
when you open your eyes.

87
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,319
I'm late.

88
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,160
Thankfully, you are fine.

89
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,040
You still know the feeling of pain?

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,919
Coming to a battlefield alone.

91
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,319
You are already fearless.

92
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,799
Are you still afraid

93
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,840
of pain right now?

94
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,359
Father has gone missing

95
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,960
and the whole family is in prison.

96
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,679
I'm the only one left
in the Cheng Family.

97
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,559
If I don't think of something
to save my family

98
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,239
and prove my parents' innocence,

99
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,200
do you think I can sit at home

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
and wait for you to marry me
without doing anything?

101
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,799
You don't know

102
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,280
how tough it was

103
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,840
to make my way here.

104
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,359
When I visited my family at the prison,

105
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,239
Yuan Shen caught me red-handed.

106
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,919
When I went home,

107
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,919
I found some money left by Grandmother
in the preserved vegetable jar.

108
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,520
When I left the city,

109
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,080
the guards searched me

110
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,679
and took half of the money away.

111
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
I finally arrived

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,200
at Tongniu County
while travelling under the sun and rain.

113
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,479
I could only sneak into the city
by hiding inside the poop bucket.

114
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,559
I'm having a headache now

115
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,640
when I recall the smell.

116
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,359
How did you

117
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,160
end up in the prison after that?

118
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,760
I thought about it

119
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,960
and realised Li Feng
was the key to the case.

120
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,239
But I didn't know

121
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,200
how to enter a secure prison

122
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:41,960
so I could only

123
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,999
steal some biscuits and get arrested.

124
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,960
Why are you smiling?

125
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,679
You don't know how much I've suffered.

126
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,960
I didn't eat and sleep well in prison.

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,879
I was afraid they would chop me up

128
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,879
if they find out who I am.

129
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,200
I was also afraid they would

130
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,319
send me back to the capital.

131
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:08,520
Then, I wouldn't be able

132
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,640
to rescue Father and meet you.

133
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,280
All right.

134
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,960
I am here now.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,040
You are not the only one left
in the Cheng Family.

136
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,879
Me too.

137
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,559
I am your fiance

138
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,319
so I am also a part of the Cheng Family.

139
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,040
You will never be fighting alone.

140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,799
I will always be behind you.

141
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,160
Your father

142
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,040
is my father.

143
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,199
Shaoshang.

144
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,760
We will investigate

145
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:44,000
the truth of the Tongniu case together

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,079
and rescue your family.

147
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,280
You are saying so many nice things

148
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,360
but you still weren't here

149
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
when something happened.

150
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,280
I was wrong.

151
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,640
In the future,

152
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,000
I will never leave you again.

153
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,120
Oh.

154
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,079
My stay in prison

155
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,520
wasn't totally in vain.

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,599
I met Li Feng.

157
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,839
He was a strange one.

158
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,919
He said something

159
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,839
about being rich in the future

160
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,040
and he could feast every day

161
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,079
when Lou Ben recovers Tongniu County.

162
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,040
Who is it?

163
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,959
I came here to send

164
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,360
the casualty list of the fire.

165
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,719
I was waiting outside

166
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,319
because I didn't want
to disturb you two.

167
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,360
You have already disturbed us.

168
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,079
Leave immediately.

169
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,559
Lady Cheng, are you angry at me
because of your misunderstanding

170
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,719
with the Lou Family?

171
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,040
If that's the case,

172
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
let me apologise to you

173
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,000
in Yao's place.

174
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,120
Lou...

175
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,079
Mr. Lou.

176
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,400
What are the casualties

177
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:22,959
of the fire?

178
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,120
The physicians
did their best to rescue them.

179
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,959
However, only

180
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,719
County Assistant Governor Yin
and three officers survived.

181
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,520
There are eight victims

182
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,120
including County Assistant Governor Li.

183
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
What about the cause of the fire?

184
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,839
I went to investigate
with General Liangqiu Qi and Liangqiu Fei.

185
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,000
It was caused by

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,880
a spy of Peng Kun
planted beside Ma Rong.

187
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,439
They wanted to die with Ma Rong

188
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:46,880
because they were dissatisfied
with his surrender.

189
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,559
When we arrested them,

190
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,559
they committed suicide.

191
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,280
Bury them.

192
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,360
When County Assistant Governor Yin recovers,

193
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,000
assign him as
the temporary county governor.

194
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,599
Sorry to trouble you recently, Mr. Lou.

195
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,439
When Mr. Lou returns to the capital,

196
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,719
His Majesty

197
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,160
will arrange for your reward.

198
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,520
General Ling, your praise is too much.

199
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
My contribution is nothing

200
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,319
compared to yours.

201
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,439
I'll be leaving.

202
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,040
What are you doing?

203
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,040
Don't stare at him.

204
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,040
Don't say nonsense.

205
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm not concerned about
my cancelled engagement with Yao.

206
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,599
I know.

207
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,120
You suspect him

208
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,880
of being involved with the Tongniu case.

209
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,240
How do you know?

210
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,880
If you keep showing it on your face,

211
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,959
even Lou Ben will be able to see that.

212
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,040
I do suspect Lou Ben.

213
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,280
I haven't finished talking.

214
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,839
When I was in prison,

215
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,240
Li Feng was not worried
about being captured.

216
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,040
He confidently said

217
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,520
Ma Rong would surrender

218
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,040
when the royal court's army arrived.

219
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,719
Are you saying

220
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,640
that Li Feng knew Lou Ben
would persuade Ma Rong to surrender

221
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,199
and was sure
that Ma Rong would surrender?

222
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,559
Not only that.

223
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,120
During the fire,

224
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,319
everyone was shouting.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,240
I was nearly unconscious

226
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,599
because the smoke choked me.

227
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,919
But I heard Li Feng scolding someone.

228
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,799
He said something about betrayal

229
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,839
and tying up loose ends.

230
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,480
If he didn't collude with someone else,

231
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
why would he mention loose ends?

232
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,120
I just don't know

233
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,799
where Father is right now

234
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,959
and whether he is related to this case.

235
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,000
Lou Ben is very smart.

236
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,439
I admired his talents in the past.

237
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,520
Right now,

238
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,959
I think I have underestimated
how ambitious he is.

239
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,760
It won't be easy

240
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,640
to find evidence from him.

241
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,799
Any person

242
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,079
will have an opening.

243
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,000
I have to find a way to obtain evidence

244
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,439
and find Father.

245
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,719
Master!

246
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,120
(Li Feng's Memorial Tablet)
It's too soon for you to die!

247
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
General.

248
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,559
County Assistant Governor Li
was such an unlucky man.

249
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,599
He was orphaned at a young age

250
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,719
and grew up as a beggar.

251
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,480
His wife is a steady person.

252
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,760
I thought his life would be better

253
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,079
with his wife taking care of him.

254
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,520
Who would imagine
that he didn't even leave a child behind

255
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,520
(County Assistant Governor Yin)
because of Yan Zhong's defect?

256
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,480
What is Yan Zhong like normally?

257
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,439
Yan Zhong

258
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,640
is just an arrogant

259
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,679
and unkind person.

260
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,880
He doesn't like
to get along with the noble families.

261
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,640
Usually,

262
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,199
when the county office
did something to help the people,

263
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,040
even if someone accepted
a chicken as thanks,

264
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,360
he would be fined their wages

265
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
if Yan Zhong found out.

266
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,360
It sounds like

267
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,599
he is not money-minded.

268
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,599
I thought so too.

269
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,160
His mother was seriously ill previously.

270
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,120
He pawned all his assets
to hire a famous physician

271
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,919
and exchanged his
horse cart for a bull cart

272
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,640
without feeling ashamed.

273
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,799
He looked at ease riding the bull cart.

274
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,880
If I didn't see Mr. Lou

275
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,480
finding the letter of repentance myself,

276
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,120
I will never believe

277
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,679
that Official Yan will defect
with the refined copper.

278
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,240
What a pity.

279
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,000
Li passed away before I get to meet him

280
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,719
in person.

281
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,480
Don't worry, Li.

282
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,679
I will help you

283
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,959
take good care of your family.

284
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:47,360
Madam Li.

285
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,760
Tongniu County is a sad place for you.

286
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,520
Why don't you bring some money
and return home?

287
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,799
What do you think?

288
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,630
(Madam Li)

289
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,240
(Madam Li)
I plan to do that too.

290
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,880
(Madam Li)

291
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
Recently,

292
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,719
I'm already selling the house.

293
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,199
Since I have nothing now,

294
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,120
I should just return home.

295
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,160
Thank you for your consideration, Sir.

296
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
I'm not an official.

297
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,079
Madam Li is smart.

298
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,319
I'm sure the decision you make
will be the right one.

299
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,160
Mr. Lou is really capable.

300
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,959
If he didn't
persuade Ma Rong to surrender,

301
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,679
I'm afraid Tongniu County
would have fallen.

302
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,919
Why did they bring the refined copper
out of the city?

303
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,799
Do you know the reason?

304
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,439
General Cheng and Yan Zhong

305
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,879
said Tongniu County
is just beside Shouchun

306
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,799
and used its safety as an excuse

307
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,440
to take it out of the city.

308
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,559
They said they would
take it back to the capital first.

309
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,000
However,

310
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,000
Yan Zhong brought
his family out of the city as well.

311
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
That was an obvious act
of defecting to the enemy.

312
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,799
Looks are deceiving indeed.

313
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,720
Who told you these things?

314
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,159
County Assistant Governor Li.

315
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
We've been following her
for a whole day.

316
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,559
She is either moving

317
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,879
or selling her asset.

318
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,920
There's nothing weird about her.

319
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Move.

320
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,159
Go away!

321
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:40,720
No.

322
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,760
Storekeeper!

323
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,680
Listen to me, Storekeeper!

324
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,000
It is really a treasure.

325
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,399
Enough. Go away!

326
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Go away!

327
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,839
Everyone, help me!

328
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,000
Help me!

329
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,040
(Pawnshop Yongchang)
My husband just died for Tongniu County

330
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,000
(Pawnshop Yongchang)
and he is already bullying me, a widow!

331
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,040
He even tried to get
this treasure off me for a cheap price.

332
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,399
What treasure?

333
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,960
I am already being nice to you
by giving you 300 qian.

334
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,280
This is

335
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,960
a treasure passed down

336
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,559
from my father-in-law
who was a post sheriff.

337
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,920
How can it be worthless?

338
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,240
My husband wanted me
to leave it for the family

339
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,119
in the prison.

340
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,839
If my hometown isn't 30 li from here

341
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,079
and I don't have money to return there,

342
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,079
why would I pawn this item?

343
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,440
Enough. Just leave!

344
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,639
I will definitely report you
to the authorities!

345
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,720
Look at him! He is bullying me!

346
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,159
Let's go.

347
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,840
(Tongniu County)

348
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,200
County Assistant Governor Li

349
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,760
was hardworking and loved the people.

350
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,119
What a pity.

351
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,359
Such a good official

352
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,040
had to die so early.

353
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,879
Why is this handwriting different?

354
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,000
(Get strong men to repair the embankment
according to the governor's order)

355
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,119
This is County Governor Yan's handwriting.

356
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,680
He is good at pretending

357
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,280
and putting up such a good act.

358
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,000
You may leave.

359
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
What do you think?

360
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,760
Look at the county plans.

361
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,920
Yan Zhong promoted farming

362
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,079
and education.

363
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,359
He wanted to

364
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,240
dig three trenches over here

365
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,040
and pave two roads.

366
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,559
He wrote everything in detail.

367
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,480
If he wanted to defect,

368
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,399
why did he make these plans?

369
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:08,478
Li Feng must have hidden

370
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,960
all of Yan Zhong's handwriting

371
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,119
because he was afraid that
someone might get suspicious.

372
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,520
Madam Li kept giving us ambiguous clues.

373
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm sure she is being threatened.

374
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,079
Looks like
there's someone she's afraid of

375
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,399
in the county office.

376
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:48,119
She said

377
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,240
she wouldn't pawn her jade pendant

378
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,799
if her hometown isn't 30 li from here.

379
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,920
A distance of 30 li.

380
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,159
It only takes two days.

381
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,480
Why does she need so much money?

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,879
If Li Feng was raised by his clan,

383
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,680
why would his father be a post sheriff?

384
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,119
Madam Li said

385
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,319
to leave the pendant for her family

386
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,040
but I remember
she doesn't have any children.

387
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,159
30 li.

388
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,640
Her father-in-law was a post sheriff.

389
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,280
Post sheriff.

390
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,119
Post...

391
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,879
I know.

392
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:26,280
Qi! Fei!

393
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,079
-Yes.
-Yes.

394
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,960
Search every post within a 30-li radius

395
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,000
around Tongniu County.

396
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,480
Yes.

397
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,440
We will stay here

398
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and not move forward anymore.

399
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,639
Have you investigated everything?

400
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,280
Who do the bodies belong to?

401
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,480
An old woman in her sixties.

402
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,119
A woman in her forties.

403
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,639
A child younger than ten

404
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:14,480
and an adult man in his forties.

405
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:15,720
Looking at their outfit,

406
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,399
they should be Yan Zhong
and his family members.

407
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
The other people should be
in their thirties or forties.

408
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,720
But we can't identify them

409
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,879
because they were buried
for a long time.

410
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:22,879
Looking at their outfit,

411
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,639
they were the guards

412
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,119
who went to Tongniu Count with
General Cheng.

413
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,200
Shaoshang.

414
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,000
Shaoshang.

415
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,240
Enough. Don't look.

416
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:51,480
Shaoshang.

417
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,559
Where is Father?

418
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,839
Where is Father?

419
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,240
Shaoshang.

420
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,639
Dig deeper.

421
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,040
There must be someone else down there.

422
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,879
Young Lady.

423
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,040
We've investigated this place.

424
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,879
Every dead body is here.

425
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:29,399
Shaoshang.

426
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,480
Shaoshang.

427
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,000
Think about it.

428
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,280
It's a good thing
that we can't find General Cheng.

429
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,280
Your father must still be alive.

430
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,159
He is good at fighting.

431
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,399
Perhaps he is

432
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
healing his injuries
somewhere right now.

433
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:47,240
Yes.

434
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,559
My father might be healing
his injuries somewhere.

435
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,799
He is still waiting for me to find him.

436
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,559
I'm going to find Father.

437
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,000
Write a letter

438
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,399
and report this
to His Majesty immediately.

439
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,399
Yes.

440
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:10,480
Shaoshang!

441
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,599
Shaoshang!

442
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,680
We still have a chance.

443
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,399
If we can investigate the truth
behind the Tongniu case,

444
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,040
we will definitely find clues
about your father.

445
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,440
There must be evidence
that I didn't find.

446
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,839
I must have missed out.

447
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,440
Let me go.

448
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,240
Shaoshang!

449
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,240
You won't find any evidence
in your current condition.

450
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,559
You will only hurt yourself.

451
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,319
Calm down.

452
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,480
How do I calm down?

453
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
How do I do that?

454
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
My father's fate is still unknown.

455
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,000
My mother, grandmother,
cousin and brothers

456
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,720
all got locked up in prison.

457
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,240
They might die anytime.

458
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,319
If I still can't find Father,

459
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,480
it will be too late.

460
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,960
It will really be too late.

461
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,079
Let me go!

462
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,720
I know

463
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,319
how you feel more than anyone else.

464
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,000
Don't worry.

465
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,319
I won't let you bear

466
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:38,879
the pain I suffered in the past.

467
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,559
Father!

468
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,240
Shaoshang.

469
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,000
Did you find my father?

470
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,240
Not yet.

471
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,359
We verified the bodies again.

472
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,920
None of them is Uncle Cheng.

473
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,960
We must have missed out on something.

474
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,639
I'm going to find my father.

475
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,760
Let me find my father.

476
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,839
Young Lady.

477
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,200
Do you know how many hours

478
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,879
Young Master carried you on his back?

479
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,159
He didn't even drink when he came back.

480
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,559
Shut up, Fei.

481
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,040
No.

482
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,319
When Young Master heard

483
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,440
Marquis Quling was in trouble,

484
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,799
he went inside Shouchun alone

485
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,359
to capture the city as soon as possible

486
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,760
and got surrounded by armies.

487
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,960
He almost lost his life

488
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,399
because Peng Kun stabbed him.

489
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,480
He finally escaped danger

490
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,359
and worried you would
come to Tongniu County

491
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,799
so he rushed here immediately.

492
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,440
He didn't get any sleep

493
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
just to investigate this.

494
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,599
Just pity him.

495
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,399
Qi.

496
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,000
Take him to receive punishment.

497
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,680
Yes.

498
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:46,440
Are you hurt?

499
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,119
Is it serious? Show me.

500
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm fine.

501
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,280
It's true.

502
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,559
I'm fine.

503
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,000
Peng Kun wanted to kill me

504
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,680
at Shouchun that day.

505
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,920
But his weapon

506
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,879
did not pierce through the armour you gave me.

507
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,040
So, you are still the one

508
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,000
who saved me.

509
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,599
You are my fiance.

510
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,520
You must remember in the future.

511
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,639
Don't risk your life

512
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,440
even if it's for my sake.

513
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,839
When I found out you were in trouble,

514
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
I only wanted to reach you
as soon as possible.

515
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,680
I had no time to care about my life.

516
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,399
Does it hurt?

517
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,480
No.

518
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,240
When you removed the arrow

519
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,159
at Hua County,

520
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,359
you asked the same question too.

521
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,480
Sometimes, I am thinking.

522
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,159
It is worth it

523
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,440
to get a few cuts on my body

524
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,280
if you treat me gently.

525
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,559
Stop saying nonsense.

526
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,079
Everything I said is the truth.

527
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,240
Do you know?

528
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,639
Since my uncle passed away,

529
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,879
my mother became crazy.

530
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,760
I no longer have any family member
in this world to care about

531
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,520
whether I feel pain or not.

532
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,720
You said

533
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,720
you had no choice that day.

534
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,200
The fate of the Cheng Family
lies in your hands.

535
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,639
I know how you feel.

536
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,879
Because I have always been

537
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,720
the last member of the Huo Family.

538
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,359
It won't happen anymore.

539
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,480
Just like what you said to me.

540
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,599
From now on,

541
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,200
You will never be fighting alone

542
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,839
and you are not without a choice.

543
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,639
I will always be behind you.

544
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,079
I can protect you too.

545
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,559
Shaoshang.

546
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Actually, I...

547
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,960
What?

548
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,079
I really need you.

549
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,079
Grand Tutor Lou.

550
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,720
Congratulations.

551
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,920
Lou Ben won the battle

552
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,680
without a fight

553
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,079
and achieved something incredible.

554
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,119
What an honour for the Lou Family.

555
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,799
As expected of the Crown Prince's tutor,
Grand Tutor Lou.

556
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,440
You are good at educating.

557
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:18,599
How can I compare myself
to Official Zuo?

558
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,441
Although your ancestors
were civil officials,

559
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,399
their descendants
felt like military officials.

560
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,599
Your daughter dared
to make a mess of Changqiu Palace

561
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,639
and you dared to fight Ling Buyi

562
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,359
at the Censorate.

563
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,200
How impressive.

564
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,680
General Wan.

565
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,559
Why are you laughing?

566
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,599
I am laughing because
someone forgot their own mistakes.

567
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,680
Trying to force His Majesty
to punish someone

568
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,480
because he heard
rumours from other people.

569
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,559
Now that Yan Zhong and his family
have been proven to be murdered,

570
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,399
it's obvious that
he was a loyal official

571
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,879
who was murdered because
he wouldn't defect to the enemy.

572
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,119
The only official
who left Tongniu County

573
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,720
with Yan Zhong that day

574
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,319
was Cheng Shi.

575
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,520
It is highly possible
that the missing Cheng Shi

576
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,760
is the person
who caused Yan Zhong's death

577
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,079
and Li Feng's murder.

578
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,159
Besides,

579
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,280
Yan Zhong's body
was discovered by Lady Cheng.

580
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Perhaps

581
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,879
she was only pretending.

582
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,079
Nonsense!

583
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,559
Cheng Shi's fate and whereabouts
are still unknown.

584
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,960
He might be harmed by those evil people.

585
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,040
Shaoshang finally found Yan Zhong's body

586
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,319
to clear her father's name

587
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,879
yet you are accusing her.

588
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,599
I pity Cheng Shi.

589
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,399
He is righteous and loyal to his empire

590
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,040
yet he is still betrayed

591
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,599
by a group of jerks.

592
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,520
General Wan, mind your words.

593
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,720
How can you be so vulgar?

594
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,639
I am vulgar. So what?

595
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,400
Let go!

596
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,880
Boors like us

597
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,639
use real weapons

598
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,520
to achieve something
with a body full of injuries.

599
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,000
Unlike someone

600
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:21,000
who only knows
how to talk and accuse good people

601
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,320
to blow his own horn.

602
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,759
You are framing me.

603
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,559
You are obviously
colluding with Cheng Shi

604
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,239
so you are siding with him.

605
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,840
I never frame anyone.

606
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,440
I will never run my mouth
when I can use my hands.

607
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,440
Your Majesty.

608
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,880
General Wan just broke

609
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,639
Official Zuo's arm.

610
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,119
His arm got broken?

611
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,480
Well done.

612
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,960
These officials

613
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,960
were always trying
to alienate each other.

614
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,400
They even want to

615
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,960
impeach me as well

616
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,880
so their name

617
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,119
can go down in history.

618
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,079
If I'm not the emperor,

619
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,360
I really want to go out and kick them.

620
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,559
Your Majesty.
Are you not going to meet them?

621
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,440
No.

622
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,639
I'm annoyed.

623
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
I'll go and see Heng.

624
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,639
Your Majesty.

625
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:35,119
Consort Yue also said

626
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,040
she won't see you
because she is annoyed.

627
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,000
What are you saying?

628
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,360
Seriously.

629
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,719
Lady Cheng forged
the Empress's document to leave the border

630
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,679
and won't come back
after going to Tongniu County.

631
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
Ask Zisheng

632
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
not to stay at Tongniu County anymore.

633
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,320
Bring Lady Cheng back immediately

634
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,679
and I won't punish her.

635
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,079
Look out there.

636
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,320
All those people

637
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:03,880
who are criticising him.

638
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,040
Suppressing them makes me angry.

639
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,599
It's frustrating.

640
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,440
It's frustrating

641
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,400
to become the emperor.

642
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,360
Your Majesty!

643
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,159
I want to report Wan Songbai!

644
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,559
He beat up his colleagues

645
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,079
and ignore the law!

646
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,239
Your Majesty, you can't ignore this!

647
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,480
Look...

648
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,719
Go. Ask them to get inside.

649
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,040
Your Majesty.

650
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,279
Your Majesty.

651
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,279
I was almost murdered
and couldn't see Your Majesty.

652
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,960
Wan Songbai...

653
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

654
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,159
Official Zuo.

655
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,960
You shouldn't scare His Majesty

656
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,920
and act rudely.

657
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,199
Yes.

658
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,400
Your Majesty, please investigate this.

659
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,559
Official Zuo slipped

660
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,880
and I wanted to hold him.

661
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,360
However, he was too weak

662
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,360
and got a dislocated shoulder
when I pulled him.

663
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,239
Nonsense...

664
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,840
All of you

665
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,279
witnessed it.

666
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,079
Was I saying nonsense?

667
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,639
From what I saw,

668
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,400
it was as Official Wan said.

669
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,480
He was telling the truth.

670
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,360
That's right.

671
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,159
It was as Official Wan said.

672
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,480
Your Majesty.

673
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,800
General Ling sent a letter at night.

674
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,800
Yan Zhong and his family
were annihilated.

675
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,800
Cheng Shi is really...

676
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,079
A lunatic.

677
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,520
Besides stealing the refined copper,

678
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,599
he also murdered
Yan Zhong's whole family.

679
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,599
I think

680
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,239
we should
execute Marquis Quling's family

681
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,400
and call Lady Cheng back
to receive her punishment.

682
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,480
Do you want me to tear another arm off?

683
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,400
Your Majesty!

684
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,079
Official Zuo is right.

685
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,360
However, the battle is just over

686
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:04,639
and every colleague is busy.

687
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,239
The Censorate
is the only free department.

688
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,599
Why don't

689
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,440
we ask Official Zuo

690
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,279
to go to Tongniu County

691
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,920
and call Lady Cheng back?

692
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,079
I...

693
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,119
I'm not a royal servant.

694
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,679
Why should I go to the front line?

695
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,520
I think what Official Yuan said

696
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,360
is reasonable.

697
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,440
Official Zuo.

698
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,400
Since you're concerned about Lady Cheng so much,

699
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
you will go and pick her up yourself.

700
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,360
You are fated with

701
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,559
Zisheng and Lady Cheng.

702
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,559
Fated?

703
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,880
Aren't you acquainted with them?

704
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,719
Acquainted...

705
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,401
It's decided then.

706
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,079
Your Majesty is wise.

707
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,279
Also,

708
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,239
ask Grand Tutor Lou's nephew

709
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,040
to come back as well.

710
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,880
He deserves all the credit.

711
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,279
I will reward him accordingly.

712
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,960
Thanks for Your Majesty's praise.

713
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,119
My nephew

714
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,719
likes to travel around.

715
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,520
He only has many friends.

716
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,000
It was all a coincidence.

717
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,480
He is not worthy

718
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,199
of Your Majesty's praise.

719
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,480
Tongniu County has copper refineries.

720
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,759
So, every county governor
from the past to present

721
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,520
have been building
tall and thick city walls.

722
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,440
There would be many casualties

723
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,599
if the castle was attacked forcefully.

724
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,520
But your nephew

725
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,759
is well-acquainted
with people from various factions.

726
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:36,679
He recovered Tongniu County

727
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,000
without losing a single soldier.

728
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,480
He deserves all the credit.

729
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,840
It is only right

730
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,119
to punish mistakes

731
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,800
and reward achievements.

732
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,159
I won't

733
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,920
forgive any people
with ulterior motives.

734
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,079
But I will never disappoint

735
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,040
my loyal retainers.

736
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,840
I have

737
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,520
made my decision.

738
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,119
That's all.

739
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,159
Yes.

740
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,079
Officials, you may leave.

741
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,119
Don't even think of slacking.

742
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,599
They shouldn't

743
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,040
come to me for every little issue.

744
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,320
Lou.

745
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,759
I fought Peng Kun

746
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,239
at Shouchun.

747
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,079
Peng Kun might be ambitious

748
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,279
but he is not a coward.

749
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,239
His vice general, Ma Rong,

750
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
who served him for more than a decade

751
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:52,079
was no ordinary person as well.

752
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,759
I wonder how you

753
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:55,239
persuaded Ma Rong

754
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,840
to surrender back then

755
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:58,840
without losing a single soldier.

756
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,000
I already

757
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,520
told General Ling about this.

758
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,040
I got acquainted with General Ma Rong

759
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,679
when I was travelling.

760
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,159
We were old friends

761
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,040
so we were on speaking terms.

762
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,840
It was His Majesty's benevolence

763
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,639
that convinced Ma Rong

764
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,040
to surrender.

765
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,719
I also heard

766
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,159
the county governor, Yan Zhong,

767
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,000
had an old friend as well.

768
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,840
He is even a noble.

769
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,960
However, Yan Zhong
didn't want others to say

770
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,440
he had submitted to the rich

771
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,440
so he hid their relationship.

772
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,599
Both of them always
avoided other people when they met.

773
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,239
Lou,

774
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,800
