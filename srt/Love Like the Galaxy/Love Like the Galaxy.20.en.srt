3
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,240
This is your retribution!

4
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,140
(Eastern Castle)

5
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,020
(Eastern Castle)

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,490
Do you know how many

7
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,200
warriors in Gu City
died because of you?

8
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,120
Do you know how many civilians
lost their homes because of you?

9
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,080
Let me ask you this.

10
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,490
All these years,

11
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,240
could you sleep in peace

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,850
when their ghosts
haunt you in your dreams?

13
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,560
I've never tried to harm them.

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
Ling Buyi, you're still too young.

15
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,850
You do not understand

16
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,490
the pain veterans like us had to endure
after conquering the battlefield

17
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,200
together with His Majesty.

18
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,680
Back then,

19
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,040
feudal lords were vying for the throne,
and the situation was unclear.

20
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,640
No one could know if His Majesty
could rule the world forever.

21
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,520
I just wanted to save up some money

22
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,520
so that I could have enough
to retire in peace.

23
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,490
I swapped the military armaments
for fake ones

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,040
and sold them to other people.

25
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,450
I never expected

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,200
everything to go downhill
because of this one act.

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,080
Ling Buyi,

28
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,200
General Ling,

29
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,370
it wasn't my wish

30
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,600
for Gu City to be taken over.

31
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,720
Lord Yong,

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,970
you can tell this
to General Huo and soldiers

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,330
in person when
you arrive at the underworld.

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,890
I thought

35
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,770
Huo Chong could hang on
until the reinforcements arrived,

36
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,160
but I didn't expect that

37
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,890
no one left for saving them.

38
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,680
It wasn't my own fault

39
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,770
that Gu City was taken over, right?

40
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,930
Don't tell me you want to take the blame

41
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,080
when the reinforcements had forsaken them?

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,080
Since His Majesty
wishes to pursue responsibility,

43
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,770
why didn't he pursue responsibility

44
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,410
against those who had forsaken them?

45
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,080
Ling Buyi,

46
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,410
judging from His Majesty's personality,

47
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,970
do you think he'll do as you wish

48
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,290
and investigate everything?

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,080
Ling Buyi, what do you think?

50
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,370
No matter if His Majesty
investigates the matter or not,

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,520
you have to die.

52
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,930
This blow

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,080
is for General He's and
Magistrate Cheng's family.

54
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,200
Ling Buyi, you're out of your mind!

55
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,330
This blow

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,720
is for the vengeful spirits of Gu City.

57
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,490
This blow

58
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,600
is for General Huo Chong!

59
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
How can you answer to His Majesty

60
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,600
after killing me?

61
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,080
I only

62
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,770
answer to myself.

63
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,290
Tell Official Ji of
the Ministry of Justice

64
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
that Lord Yong had betrayed the country.

65
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,290
He committed suicide

66
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,490
as he felt guilty for
betraying His Majesty.

67
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,290
This...

68
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,890
Official Ji will never believe you.

69
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,680
He will perform an autopsy.

70
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
Just do what I tell you.

71
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,290
Yes.

72
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,560
Lord Yong did remind me of something.

73
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,160
Back then, Gu City did send messengers
back requesting reinforcements.

74
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,010
However, due to inferior armaments,

75
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,290
the city was taken over
in just a few days.

76
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,720
Maybe they had survived the attack.

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,370
They might be still alive.

78
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,010
Two of you,

79
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,290
search for them immediately.

80
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,080
Yes.

81
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
Young Master, where are you going?

82
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,490
Don't follow me.

83
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,810
Mother,

84
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,240
I've discovered the mastermind

85
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
behind the embezzlement
of the military armaments,

86
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,040
and I've ended him myself.

87
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,720
Don't worry.

88
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,560
I will never forget about

89
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,410
what they did to the Huo Family.

90
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,600
One day,

91
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,120
I'll find out the truth
behind the massacre of Gu City.

92
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,970
I will slay all sinners

93
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,080
one by one.

94
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,600
None of them will escape my wrath.

95
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,520
Blood

96
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,690
will have blood.

97
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,610
You're injured.

98
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Let me treat your wounds.

99
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,690
No!

100
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,570
No, Li.

101
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,120
Li,

102
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,810
you were hemophobic since young.

103
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,810
Did you forget?

104
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,970
You fell unconscious for two hours

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,850
when you saw the scratch wound
on your arm in the past.

106
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,010
I can do it myself.

107
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,810
I've grown up.

108
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,650
Now, I'm daring enough
to slay enemies on the battlefield.

109
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
Why would I fear the sight of blood?

110
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,650
No!

111
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,770
You mustn't head to the battlefield!

112
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,570
All those weapons are faulty.

113
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,080
You cannot defeat enemies.

114
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,650
None of them came to rescue us.

115
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,400
None of them!

116
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,040
You mustn't head to the battlefield.

117
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,770
I can do it myself.

118
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,200
You're hemophobic.
I can treat my own wounds.

119
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,690
You mustn't head to the battlefield!

120
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,080
You mustn't head to the battlefield!

121
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,440
It's fine now.

122
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,690
Everything is fine now.

123
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
I've killed all of those

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,160
who were involved with
the military armament embezzlement.

125
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,850
As for those who didn't come to aid,

126
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,080
I will find them one by one.

127
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,200
I will avenge all of us.

128
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:56,420
(Memorial Tablet of
Eldest Brother, Huo Chong)

129
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,440
General Ling,

130
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,970
you should confess your fault
to His Majesty.

131
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,240
His Majesty is heartbroken

132
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,080
that you're kneeling like this.

133
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,010
General Ling,

134
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,530
please listen to me.

135
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,010
You see, His Majesty is...

136
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,010
How dare you!

137
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,400
Do you know your fault?

138
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,610
Your Majesty.

139
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,810
I was too lenient toward you!

140
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,010
You even dare to kill
a criminal whom we haven't put on trial!

141
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,610
You've deceived your emperor!

142
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,890
Tell me! How should I handle this?

143
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,280
Your Majesty, please be appeased.

144
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,570
General Ling has been
kneeling for six hours.

145
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,570
Moreover, he's still seriously wounded.

146
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,120
Why don't we...

147
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,970
What?

148
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,320
Come inside!

149
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,770
General Ling,

150
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,240
His Majesty wants you to head inside.

151
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
Get up now.

152
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,480
I'll help you out.

153
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,730
Don't help him!

154
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,280
You still want to act stubborn, huh?

155
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,280
Fine!

156
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,440
Stay stubborn then. You're done for.

157
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,040
-Show me how stubborn you are!
-Your Majesty.

158
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,440
Show me.

159
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,010
What do you mean by this?

160
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,770
What do you mean by this?

161
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
Are you waiting for me
to kick you a third time?

162
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,730
Your Majesty, everything you grant to me
is a reward.

163
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,850
I do not dare

164
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
to avoid your kick.

165
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,200
You interrogated Lord Yong, and
you even killed him without permission.

166
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,040
Do you still have respect for me
and the Ministry of Justice?

167
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,480
Such audacity!

168
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,650
Innocent warriors had died
because of Lord Yong and his son.

169
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,690
General He and his entire family died
because of him.

170
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,890
How am I guilty

171
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,400
for killing a sinner like him?

172
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,810
Even so, you do not need
to commit the act yourself.

173
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,120
An imperial edict

174
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
is all it takes.

175
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,570
Why must you stain your hands
with his blood?

176
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,610
I found out that Lord Yong and his son

177
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,930
were involved in other
heinous deeds as well.

178
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,080
They deserve to die.

179
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,890
Even so,

180
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,120
you don't need to kill him yourself!

181
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,570
I was upholding justice for the dead.

182
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,440
Upholding justice for the dead?

183
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,850
They're already dead.

184
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
Why must you dwell on the past?

185
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,610
Your Majesty.

186
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,400
Stop.

187
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Zisheng,

188
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,010
there's a bottom line to my patience.

189
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,480
The peace of my people

190
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,040
is my bottom line.

191
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,730
Remnants of Emperor Li's forces
had caused chaos for several decades.

192
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,850
The peaceful days

193
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,280
that the people had prayed for

194
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,610
only just started.

195
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,730
But now, you're stirring up a storm
within the imperial court.

196
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,970
Are you trying to plunge the world
into chaos again?

197
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I do not dare to do so.

198
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,280
Today,

199
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,610
due to your act of killing
a heinous criminal before trial,

200
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,770
I shall punish you

201
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
by deducting
half a year's worth of grain from you

202
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,850
and demoting you.

203
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,010
Go back and reflect upon your mistake.

204
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,890
Your Majesty.

206
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
That darned brat.

207
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,890
He has such a stubborn temper.

208
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,610
His body is too sturdy.

209
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,240
My legs hurt from kicking him.

210
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,040
And you, Cao Cheng!

211
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,570
Why didn't you stop me from kicking him?

212
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,850
Your Majesty, I deserve to die for that.

213
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,970
Your Majesty,

214
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,320
General Ling is still young.

215
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,650
He'll definitely understand

216
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,360
your painstaking effort one day.

217
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,080
I hope so.

218
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,640
(Grand Tutor Lou's Message)

219
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,620
(His Majesty's order is absolute.
Please come and have a chat.)

220
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,400
Have a chat in his residence?

221
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,690
Chat about what?

222
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,690
It's obvious that they're rushing us

223
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,930
to cancel the marriage.

224
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,890
The Lou Family is rushing us to do so

225
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,320
when His Majesty hasn't issued
an imperial edict yet.

226
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,650
It's obvious that this wasn't
Grand Tutor Fu's idea.

227
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
It's First Madam Lou's idea.

228
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,690
This cynical hag.

229
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,120
She is in such a hurry

230
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,570
after hearing some news
through the grapevine.

231
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,810
Doesn't she know

232
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,280
that the Cheng Family
isn't one to be trifled with

233
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,240
when we're on the battlefield?

234
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,480
What else did the messenger
from the Lou Family say?

235
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,890
He even said

236
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,010
that if Madam and Young Lady
didn't cancel the marriage,

237
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,280
they would request His Majesty to do so.

238
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,770
They hope that Master and Madam

239
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,240
won't make things difficult
for His Majesty.

240
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,770
Fine.

241
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,930
Fine then.

242
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,810
Let's head to the Lou residence

243
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,730
and find out exactly what they're up to.

244
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,530
Let's go.

245
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,200
Yuanyi,

246
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,770
I shall follow you.

247
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,650
General, you don't need to get yourself
involved with women's affairs.

248
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,360
You just need to stay here
and hold down the fort.

249
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,610
If both of us

250
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,650
did get into a fight with them,

251
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,040
you could come and stop us by then.

252
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,360
Let's go.

253
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,480
They will definitely get into
a fight with them.

254
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,240
First Madam Cheng, why are you
only here by now?

255
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,770
We will cancel the marriage

256
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,690
even if you are unhappy with it.

257
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,240
Who said we were unhappy with it?

258
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,530
We were just waiting for
His Majesty's edict

259
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,770
before canceling the marriage.

260
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,730
We have no choice too.

261
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,650
We cannot leave this

262
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,730
to Shaoshang and Yao.

263
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,160
First Madam Lou, do you intend to say

264
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,730
that I should be benevolent

265
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
and cancel the wedding

266
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,970
since General He has just passed away
and He Zhaojun is all alone?

267
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,040
Shaoshang,

268
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,690
mind your manners.

269
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,400
If you steal her words,

270
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,890
First Madam Lou will
have nothing to say.

271
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,120
The Cheng Family comes from
a line of generals too.

272
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,970
I'm sure you can understand
how difficult it is

273
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,610
for the He Family
to sacrifice for the country.

274
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,850
Speaking of which,

275
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,610
the He Family is
a glorious family indeed.

276
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,040
I think Yao's marriage with Zhaojun

277
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,080
is actually a match
beyond our social status.

278
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,320
If so, First Madam Lou,
why did you leave it

279
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,280
to the second chamber

280
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,970
of your family instead?

281
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,810
Precisely.

282
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,610
Back then, Yao's parents
weren't the only ones

283
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,570
who benefited from
General He's kindness.

284
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,480
What's wrong?

285
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,200
So, Grand Tutor Lou remembered that
he's the eldest son

286
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,690
when he received his hereditary rank.

287
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,040
But now, he forgets that
he's the eldest son

288
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,690
when the family needs
someone to bear responsibility?

289
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,610
How dare you humiliate my mother?

290
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,040
I'll rip your mouth to pieces.

291
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,930
First Madam Lou,

292
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,010
although

293
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,440
you were being unfair,

294
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,650
you were right about something.

295
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,120
The Cheng Family does come from

296
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,650
a line of generals.

297
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,690
I, Xiao Yuanyi, accompanied
my husband to conquer the battlefield.

298
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,010
I usually prefer resolving issues

299
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,200
with swords and spears

300
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,240
to reasoning things out.

301
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,530
First Madam Lou,

302
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,570
do you wish to spar with me?

303
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,080
Initially, I did this

304
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,440
as I was trying to take pity
on the He Family.

305
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,320
But you just had to come here
and show me your unruly behavior.

306
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,360
Someone!

307
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,440
Someone!

308
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,770
First Madam Lou,

309
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,530
since you said you were
taking pity on He Family,

310
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,890
you shouldn't just make empty talks.

311
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,320
Everyone can be a saint
if one can boast without actions.

312
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,810
Show us how benevolent you are.

313
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,280
If that's the case,

314
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,650
why don't you let your son
cancel his betrothal

315
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,570
and marry He Zhaojun instead?

316
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,360
By then,

317
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,970
you can console
the He Family all you want.

318
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,930
I ensure you that the entire city

319
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,930
will praise your
virtuous behavior by tomorrow.

320
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,770
What do you think?

321
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,770
You!

322
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,080
First Madam Cheng,

323
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,610
are you going to leave your daughter be

324
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,010
even after she insulted her elder?

325
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,120
I am but a lowly female warrior.

326
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,970
It's reasonable for me to leave her be

327
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,890
even after she insulted her elder.

328
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
However, Shaoshang,

329
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,850
you should spare a thought
for First Madam Lou as well.

330
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,650
I have never done so.

331
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,480
I always want to spare a thought
for my elders.

332
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,570
However, the Lou Family

333
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,970
is just asking for it.

334
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,570
My husband

335
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,200
is the grand tutor of the crown prince!

336
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,530
Where did you two get the guts

337
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,400
to display such audacity
in my residence?

338
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
His Majesty

339
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,570
conferred the title of Marquis Quling
onto my husband personally!

340
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,280
The Cheng Family is only able
to get to where we are today

341
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,010
because of our efforts

342
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,810
on the battlefield.

343
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,530
Although the Cheng Family
isn't a noble family,

344
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,080
we will not yield

345
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,400
to people who bully us!

346
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,240
Back then, you guys were the ones
who requested the marriage.

347
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,730
We agreed to it
on account of your pitiful effort.

348
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,120
Even if we were to cancel the marriage,

349
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,810
Grand Tutor Lou should be the one
apologizing to us in our residence.

350
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,200
You have no right
to bicker with me at all.

351
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,120
First Madam Lou, did you say
I was being audacious just now?

352
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,480
It seems to me

353
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,850
that you're the one
who's being audacious right now.

354
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,400
Mother,

355
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,810
instruct our servants to chase them out!

356
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,930
From now on, the Cheng Family

357
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,810
is not allowed to come here!

358
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,570
Why are you guys still standing there?

359
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,120
Chase them out immediately!

360
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,240
Mother!

361
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,690
You!

362
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,080
I've shown you

363
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,080
enough respect

364
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
on account of the marriage.

365
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,200
Since the marriage has been canceled,

366
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,010
this slap will serve to sever our ties.

367
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,360
From now on, the Cheng Family
will never step into this residence.

368
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,530
I will never sully my feet
in a dirty place like this.

369
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,650
How dare you slap my mother?

370
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,850
I'll fight you until the end!

371
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,320
Li!

372
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,890
My mother will deal with her.

373
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,690
I will

374
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,610
deal with you.

375
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,440
They're out of their minds.

376
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,930
They must be out of their minds.

377
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,400
How dare you two

378
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,890
slap both of us

379
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,080
in our territory?

380
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,400
I'll report you two
to the Changqiu Palace tomorrow.

381
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,010
I'll see how
the empress will punish you!

382
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,280
Fine with me. I'll tag along
no matter what palace you'll head to.

383
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,610
I'll keep you company until the end.

384
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,690
Let's go.

385
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,530
Calm down.

386
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,930
Yao, your leg...

387
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,610
Shaoshang.

388
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,480
Did they do this to you?

389
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,530
No.

390
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,930
Yao fell from the wall by accident

391
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,400
when he tried to scale it

392
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,280
to find you.

393
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,530
What are you doing here?

394
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,080
First Young Master Lou and I
are great friends.

395
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,200
I was here

396
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,690
to visit Lou Yao since I heard

397
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,650
that he was injured.

398
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,610
You're everywhere indeed.

399
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,080
Young Lady Cheng,
you were quite sharp with your words.

400
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,360
It seems

401
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,930
that you're quite angry.

402
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,280
Shaoshang,

403
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,040
I'm really sorry about this.

404
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,570
I still don't dare to go against
His Majesty's will

405
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,080
after giving it some thought.

406
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,320
What about...

407
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,080
What about this?

408
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,970
Both you and Zhaojun
can get married to Yao together.

409
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,730
That way, you two will have equal ranks.

410
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,280
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

411
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,440
Yao, what do you think?

412
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,400
Mother!

413
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,770
If not,

414
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,080
your first uncle will never let us off.

415
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,480
How can we resolve this issue

416
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,850
without your father around?

417
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,160
It's fine as long as

418
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,080
both you and Shaoshang

419
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,480
show respect for Zhaojun
after you marry her.

420
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,320
Out of the three sons
of the Cheng Family,

421
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,040
no one had taken a concubine before.

422
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,400
No, they will be of equal ranks.

423
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,850
She won't be a concubine.

424
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,440
They will be of equal ranks.

425
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,360
Shaoshang,

426
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,730
did you hear that?

427
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,730
What do you think?

428
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,080
Yao, what's your opinion?

429
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,610
I...

430
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,610
I...

431
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,080
To hell with that!

432
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,610
I will never marry He Zhaojun.

433
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,730
Never.

434
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,970
Yao, just tell me this.

435
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,650
Will you cancel our marriage or not?

436
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
I will never cancel our marriage.

437
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,970
It's a deal.

438
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,010
You can get on my carriage.

439
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,360
Let me send you back.

440
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,970
No thanks. My family has a carriage.

441
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,530
Look at how angry your mother was.

442
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,730
Do you think she'll wait for you?

443
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,650
Moreover,

444
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,200
aren't you curious

445
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,570
as to why the He Family

446
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,200
must make Lou Yao marry He Zhaojun?

447
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,850
Follow me.

448
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,890
Mr. Yuan, you were the one

449
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,930
who told me that men and women
shouldn't be seated together.

450
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,400
But now, you're asking me to
get on your carriage?

451
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,240
Mr. Yuan, did you forget
your own teachings?

452
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,570
I did forget something.

453
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,890
I forgot the fact that you were a woman.

454
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,200
Mr. Yuan, since you're trying
to be sarcastic here,

455
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,770
I shall get off the carriage now.

456
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,810
Stop.

457
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,890
Since you have such a fiery temper,

458
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,080
why didn't you cancel
the marriage outright

459
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,930
when the Lou Family mentioned
marrying both ladies?

460
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,810
If Yao knew that marrying both ladies

461
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,930
would be a humiliation to me,

462
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,160
I'd surely slap him to death

463
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,970
if he agreed to it.

464
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,040
However, he didn't agree to
his mother's proposal.

465
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,480
Why must I give up on him?

466
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,810
Lou Yao is ignorant and incompetent.

467
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,280
He's not intelligent too.

468
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,730
Are you not willing
to cancel the marriage

469
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,850
because you're not willing to dispose of
Lou Yao, who's easily manipulated?

470
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,360
Or are you not willing

471
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,280
to give up the chance for you
to leave your parents

472
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,440
and explore the vast world outside?

473
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,810
Yuan Shanjian,

474
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,770
stop being jealous of me.

475
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,040
Besides,

476
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,810
even if that was my intention,

477
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,930
it's none of your business.

478
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,930
Stop being so prickly.

479
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,440
Do you know

480
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,810
why General He insisted on marrying
his daughter into the Lou Family?

481
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,440
It's because

482
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,730
the descendants of the Lou Family

483
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,280
are scholars and civil officials.

484
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,770
Young Master He can only
protect his inheritance

485
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,650
if He Zhaojun gets married to Lou Yao.

486
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,280
Do you mean the troops that belong
to the He Family?

487
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,530
It's more than that.

488
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,440
Their manors, houses,

489
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,690
and tribesmen

490
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,650
are under the temporary command
of He Zhaojun.

491
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,650
She'll return everything to her brother

492
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,730
after he turns into an adult.

493
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,400
This thing may look simple
on the surface,

494
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,770
however, there will be too many changes

495
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,480
during the years when Young Master He

496
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,850
is growing up.

497
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,200
Lou Yao

498
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,690
is the best candidate for He Zhaojun.

499
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,770
However, Yao doesn't like He Zhaojun.

500
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,610
Besides,

501
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,200
I don't believe that there's no one else

502
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,850
who's not impressed with
the loyalty of the He Family

503
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,320
and is willing

504
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,970
to marry He Zhaojun.

505
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,610
Now, the He Family is praised
throughout the country.

506
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,690
He Zhaojun has plenty of dowries.

507
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,400
He Family cannot believe

508
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,850
those who are eyeing their assets.

509
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,010
However, people who don't have eyes
for their assets

510
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,570
are not willing to marry He Zhaojun.

511
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,160
If so,

512
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,930
Mr. Yuan,

513
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,010
why don't you marry He Zhaojun?

514
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,730
You're an open and upright person.

515
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm sure you won't take
the troops of He Family as your own.

516
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,480
Besides,

517
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,120
you're 100 times more capable,
knowledgeable,

518
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,480
and good-looking than Yao.

519
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,080
If you propose to her,

520
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm sure He Zhaojun won't...

521
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,320
She won't do what?

522
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,080
I must think twice

523
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,200
before marrying a lady like He Zhaojun.

524
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,650
In the future, I have to sacrifice
a lot of my wealth and manpower

525
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,320
to assist the He Family
in making a comeback.

526
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,850
You think too highly of me.

527
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,400
It's getting late.

528
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,010
Farewell for now.

529
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,120
Halt.

530
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,650
See yourself off.

531
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,650
Please see yourself off.

532
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,080
Young Lady, why are you getting off?

533
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,040
Let's go.

534
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,970
Young Lady, it's raining.

535
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,080
We don't have any carriages.

536
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Young Lady, be careful.

537
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,610
Why don't we

538
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,570
borrow a carriage from the Lou Family?

539
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,040
No way.

540
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,040
I'm too embarrassed to go back.

541
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,140
(Ruyang)

542
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,240
Will He Zhaojun be convinced

543
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,440
by our plan?

544
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,040
What if she refuses to do so?

545
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,690
She didn't fancy you in the past.

546
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,890
Why would she refuse us?

547
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,730
However,

548
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,930
her entire family just perished
in the battle.

549
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,810
We should

550
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,320
express a mild attitude

551
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,650
and be gentle with our words.

552
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,770
We shouldn't make her think

553
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,320
that we're here to bully her.

554
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,120
He Zhaojun is already pitiful enough.

555
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,530
Why don't we

556
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,040
find her some other time?

557
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,530
But...

558
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,080
But will your uncle wait for us?

559
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,010
Even if your uncle was willing to wait,

560
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,040
would His Majesty be willing to wait?

561
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:32,690
If so,

562
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
why don't you talk to her?

563
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,400
This marriage is between you two.

564
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,400
I have no right to interfere.

565
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,610
You do have a point.

566
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,840
(Ruyang)

567
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,810
So, it's you two.

568
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,010
Lady Ancheng,

569
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,690
we...

570
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,530
We're here

571
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,120
to receive you today.

572
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,120
Receive me?

573
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,810
For what purpose?

574
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,360
We have something to tell you.

575
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,400
I have an emergency to attend to.

576
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,610
Lady Cheng, since
you need to speak with me,

577
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,730
why don't you join me?

578
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,570
Shaoshang isn't close with you.

579
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,200
Come at me if you dare.

580
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,530
Yao, don't worry.

581
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,970
I won't harm Lady Cheng.

582
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,970
If you don't believe me,

583
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,610
I can swear a vow
on my late father's name.

584
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,730
Lady Cheng,

585
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,080
you have the guts to
steal my husband from me.

586
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,890
But now, you don't have the guts
to join me in my carriage?

587
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,530
There's no need to provoke me.

588
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,120
I came here to
talk it out with you anyway.

589
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,570
Yao,

590
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,160
your leg is still injured.

591
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,480
I'll join her.

592
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,930
You better come back

593
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,320
if anything seems suspicious.

594
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,770
Yao does worry about you a lot.

595
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,850
Your relationship of several months

596
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,200
is actually stronger than
our relationship of more than a decade.

597
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,850
However, I think it's better for Yao

598
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,010
to be together with you than me.

599
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,770
You've grown up.

600
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
It's almost time.

601
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,970
Let us depart.

602
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:58,020
(Ministry of Justice)

603
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,010
(Ministry of Justice)

604
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,890
Lady Ancheng,

605
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,530
everything is ready.

606
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,650
Lead the way.

607
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,890
Why did you bring me here?

608
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,690
Inside

609
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,770
is the emergency that I had mentioned.

610
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,240
What?

611
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,770
Are you too afraid to enter?

612
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,360
Oh dear,

613
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,810
are you here to see me
through my last journey?

614
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,160
Do not call me dear.

615
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm here to take your life

616
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,480
to avenge my father and brothers.

617
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,530
I've let you down.

618
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,320
On account of our tie
as husband and wife,

619
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,010
I hope you can treat the members
of the Xiao Family nicely.

620
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,040
Our tie?

621
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,810
What tie?

622
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,360
Do you mean the tie where you pierced

623
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,970
the heads of my eldest brother
and fourth brother with a spear?

624
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,240
Do you mean the tie where
you challenged my father to a fight?

625
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,930
Do you mean the tie where you shot my
fifth brother dead on the battlefield?

626
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,480
Or do you mean the tie where you stabbed

627
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,890
my pregnant sister-in-law to death?

628
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,970
Do you mean the tie where my nanny had her
eyes gouged and her feet chopped off?

629
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,530
His Majesty is benevolent.

630
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,730
On account of the contribution
your family had made to the nation,

631
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,890
His Majesty wanted to leave you
with a complete corpse.

632
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,730
I was the one who submitted a proposal

633
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,280
to request your decapitation.

634
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,690
From today onward,

635
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,770
the Xiao Family will be known as

636
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,040
traitors who will be cursed upon

637
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,480
by people of the world.

638
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,530
What did you say?

639
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,320
We contributed to the nation.

640
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,040
The Xiao Family was the one

641
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,810
who conquered this territory
for His Majesty!

642
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,320
Even the current emperor

643
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,970
remembers our noble acts!

644
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,570
How dare you attempt to decapitate me?

645
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,690
You have no right to say
that the Xiao Family are traitors!

646
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,010
You crazy woman!

647
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,010
Shut up!

648
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,530
I rushed back to the capital

649
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,690
just to witness your decapitation.

650
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,610
Time's up.

651
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,200
Time for you to die.

652
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,970
Fine!

653
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,240
Even if I die,

654
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,320
I'll haunt you as a ghost!

655
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,040
Great!

656
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,730
If you do become a ghost,

657
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,280
my father and brothers
will surely kill you again.

658
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,400
Let's see who will have it worse!

659
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,440
He Zhaojun,

660
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,010
it's time for his execution.

661
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,120
Let us leave.

662
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,890
His Majesty has permitted me
to execute him personally.

663
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,160
Let me

664
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,730
send you to hell myself!

665
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,970
Don't be afraid.

666
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,400
I'm here.

667
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:26,679
♪The beacon-fire has knocked
over the white snow♪

668
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,679
♪I caress the scars gently
from the past♪
