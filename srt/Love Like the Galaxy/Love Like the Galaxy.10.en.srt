(Steafast Allegiance)

4
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,980
General Ling,

5
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,860
what's with

6
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,420
the late visit?

7
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,860
I heard that there's intruders
in Prince Xiao's residence,

8
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,700
so I've brought
the black armored guards here

9
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,100
to help you catch them.

10
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,980
General Ling,

11
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,620
no crime has ever occurred

12
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,380
in my residence.

13
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,380
There's no need for you
to trouble yourself.

14
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,500
See our guests off.

15
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,140
General Wan's Residence
was robbed just a few days ago.

16
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,500
These crooks are reckless and defiant.

17
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,140
People in the capital can't live in peace

18
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,500
if they aren't captured.

19
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,460
Your Highness, please bear with us.

20
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,180
Search the area!

21
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,300
Yes!

22
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,980
You!

23
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,460
Ling Buyi!

24
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,620
I am the heir of Lord Yong.

25
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,900
This residence belongs to Lord Yong

26
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,020
since I'm staying here!

27
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,140
How dare you order
your black armored guards

28
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,500
to intrude the residence of a lord?

29
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,580
Your Highness,

30
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,260
even if this was
Lord Yong's Residence,

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,540
I could barge in

32
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,700
as long as I felt like it.

33
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,580
Ling Buyi, what did you say?

34
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,020
Young Master,

35
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,420
I've searched the area.

36
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,060
The crooks are nowhere to be found.

37
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,740
General Ling,

38
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,820
since you found nothing,

39
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,860
you should leave together with
your black armored guards.

40
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,020
Steafast Allegiance?

41
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,980
Was this written by His Majesty himself?

42
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,260
Naturally.

43
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,060
My father served His Majesty
all his life as a soldier.

44
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,500
He has helped His Majesty
conquered countless territories.

45
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,820
He became a lord and
was assigned to garrison the frontiers.

46
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,580
These two words

47
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,620
were praises

48
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,060
from His Majesty for the Xiao Family.

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,820
His Majesty appreciated

50
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,820
Lord Yong's loyalty and bravery.

51
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,220
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,380
Your Highness, I'm sure

53
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,940
you won't let His Majesty down,

54
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,060
am I right?

55
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Naturally.

56
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,580
Since there weren't any crooks,

57
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,860
I shall interrupt you no longer.

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,620
Let's go.

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,220
Is Ling Buyi

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,700
starting to

61
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,180
get suspicious of us?

62
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,780
If so, regarding General Fan...

63
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,780
This Ling Buyi

64
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,900
keeps haunting us.

65
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,020
We would encounter him

66
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,980
if we handed over the goods.

67
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,860
As for Fan Cang,

68
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,740
ask him to wait for now.

69
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,180
Father,

70
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,020
look who's here.

71
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,940
Uncle Wan.

72
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,180
Cheng Shi,

73
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,700
Yuanyi.

74
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,660
Congratulations, Wan.

75
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,860
I heard that His Majesty had granted
Old Madam Wan the title of Noble Lady.

76
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,620
Today's a joyous occasion indeed.

77
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,340
As children,

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,980
we strove to bring honor to our family.

79
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,060
His Majesty has conferred
a title to my mother,

80
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,660
and I felt more honored than
getting a promotion myself.

81
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,540
Wan, you're such a filial son. Impressive.

82
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,100
Please come inside.

83
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,740
Wan, this is...

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm fine.

85
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,260
It's just an old ailment of mine.

86
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,180
-Come on.
-Let's go.

87
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,500
What happened to Uncle Wan?

88
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,420
Do you still remember the shriek you heard

89
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,260
when you left my residence the other day?

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,180
Guess what happened?

91
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,580
My grandmother gave my father a beating.

92
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,260
She almost beat him to death.

93
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,580
But don't you think it's strange?

94
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,740
Where did she get the strength
to torture my father like that?

95
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,620
You better don't stir up trouble.

96
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,060
What's wrong?

97
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,540
My mother gave me a warning today.

98
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,460
She said she would wallop me

99
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,020
if I got into another fight.

100
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,620
If so, you must control your temper

101
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,540
when Wang Ling is here.

102
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,140
Don't worry.

103
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,380
I will never

104
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,340
get into a fight today.

105
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Shaoshang, what's wrong?

106
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,740
Qiqi,

107
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,660
I have a stomachache.

108
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,660
I need to return to my room.

109
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,460
Let me tag along then.

110
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,500
You shouldn't do so.

111
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,180
You're the host. You have
to take care of the guests.

112
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,740
I lived in your residence some days.

113
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
I'm sure I can find the way to my room.

114
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,580
Go ahead.

115
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,740
All right then. Take care.

116
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,780
I'll be fine.

117
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,060
Qiqi.

118
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,140
One after another.

119
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,220
Qiqi.

120
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,540
-Qiqi.
-Qiqi.

121
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,980
Sit down. Enjoy yourselves.

122
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,180
Wan Qiqi,

123
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,540
is this how you treat your guests?

124
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,380
How dare you leave us hanging
in this desolate place?

125
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
I have to entertain you as well?

126
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,380
Fine.

127
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,820
Why don't I feed you

128
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,380
and keep you company in the loo as well?

129
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,740
You!

130
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,620
Enough.

131
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,820
We only have a humble shack.

132
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,780
We don't deserve
your graceful presence anyway.

133
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,940
Initially,

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,020
I sent you guys invitations
purely out of courtesy.

135
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,380
No one knew you guys would show up.

136
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,700
You invited plenty
of young men here, right?

137
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,060
I'm not here because of you.

138
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,900
Don't tell me you came all the way here

139
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,420
just to check the boys out?

140
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,260
For goodness's sake,

141
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,140
my grandmother is celebrating
her birthday today.

142
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,140
Can you be more reserved?

143
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,940
I heard from General Wan

144
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,420
that he'd lead the boys

145
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,700
to the training ground today.

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,060
I just wanted to see what was going on.

147
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,020
We're asking you nicely

148
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,060
since it isn't nice for us
to wander in your residence.

149
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
I only moved to this residence

150
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,300
quite recently.

151
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,380
About the training ground...

152
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,220
I wonder where it is?

153
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,620
Where is it?

154
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,340
Oh, I wonder.

155
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,300
Qiqi.

156
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,340
Shaoshang is here.

157
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,060
Do you feel better now?

158
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,140
Let's go.

159
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,540
Cheng Shaoshang,

160
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,860
why the rush?

161
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,940
Don't tell me you're afraid
that you'll encounter Zisheng here?

162
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,940
I guess so.

163
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,060
It was embarrassing when your lie

164
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,380
was exposed in public that day.

165
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,780
Li!

166
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,860
I...

168
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,660
Have a seat.

169
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,860
Your mother told me

170
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,540
to look after you.

171
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,980
You should follow me.

172
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,540
Stop gossiping about others.

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,300
Lou Yao,

174
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,420
you actually want to look after Lou Li?

175
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,700
I heard

176
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,060
that Zhaojun wanted to cancel

177
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,700
her marriage with you.

178
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,420
How embarrassing

179
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,220
and incompetent must you be

180
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,460
for Zhaojun to call off

181
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,700
her marriage with you
without any second thoughts?

182
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,740
If I were in your shoes,

183
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,660
I would hide in a hole.

184
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,580
You!

185
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,780
Qiqi,

186
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,140
calling off a marriage

187
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,100
is nothing special.

188
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,980
How could Lady Wang humiliate
He Zhaojun like that?

189
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,260
She actually said it was shameful
for He Zhaojun's marriage to be called off.

190
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,700
It would turn into a huge deal

191
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,340
if He Zhaojun heard about this.

192
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,260
Precisely.

193
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,940
I wasn't referring to He Zhaojun.

194
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Lady Cheng, thank you
for standing up for me.

195
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,300
How dare you, Lou Yao?

196
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,700
How dare you two gang up on me?

197
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,820
It's no wonder Zhaojun wants
to call off her marriage with you.

198
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,060
Only a boorish and uneducated girl like her
can communicate with you!

199
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,460
Stop arguing.

200
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,220
Old Madam Wan is
celebrating her birthday today.

201
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,180
We mustn't spoil the joyous mood.

202
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,860
Lady Wang is a frank person.

203
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,860
Please don't take her words to heart.

204
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,980
Your Highness, you do
live up to your name indeed.

205
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,660
You're so thoughtful and considerate,

206
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,500
unlike some other people.

207
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,260
Lady Wang,

208
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,140
why don't you learn something from her?

209
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,700
Don't just spend time with her

210
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,980
and learn nothing good

211
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,740
except for

212
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,820
how to bicker with
boorish people like me.

213
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,340
Stop spouting crap!

214
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,540
Your Highness,

215
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,340
she said you were spouting crap.

216
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,780
I didn't!

217
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,500
You did.

218
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,060
I didn't!

219
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,700
You did.

220
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,260
I didn't!

221
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,060
You did!

222
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,100
I'll choke you!

223
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
-Show it to us again!
-Right.

224
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,740
Mr. Yuan, please do it again.

225
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,860
General Ling is here.

226
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,900
-General Ling.
-General Ling.

227
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,780
So, General Ling, you've arrived.

228
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,700
I've heard about your glorious days
in the battlefield.

229
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,860
Since

230
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,460
we're in a joyous mood today,

231
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,740
General Ling, why don't you
show us your skills?

232
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,780
When I draw my bow,

233
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,300
I will definitely kill.

234
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,860
These kinds of childish games

235
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,940
are nothing to me.

236
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,740
General Ling,

237
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,700
we're celebrating
Old Madam Wan's birthday today.

238
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,060
You shouldn't spoil the mood.

239
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,420
This game is meaningless.

240
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,460
The scenery over there is excellent.

241
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,620
Mr. Yuan, I wonder if you're willing

242
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,500
to join me in admiring the flowers?

243
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,420
Hello, everyone.

244
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,820
Officials,

245
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,740
please.

246
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,860
Greetings, Old Madam Wan.

247
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,900
Please enjoy yourselves.

248
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,820
Do not stand on ceremony.

249
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,580
Here.

250
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,860
Official Li.

251
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,260
Don't stand on ceremony.

252
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,380
Drink up.

253
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,020
Okay.

254
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,180
General,

255
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,780
-don't drink too much.
-Drink more.

256
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,020
Thank you.

257
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,980
Cheng Shi.

258
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,700
Wan.

259
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,700
We must have a toast.

260
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,340
-Here.
-Okay.

261
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,759
Try this.

262
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,479
This one is good.

263
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,420
General Ling, I assume you've been

264
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,060
in the battlefield for too long.

265
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,780
This courtyard

266
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,300
has no flowers for us to admire.

267
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,260
Li,

268
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,940
be a good girl and follow me back.

269
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,980
I won't.

270
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,340
First Aunt instructed me

271
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,740
to bring you back.

272
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,020
I said, I don't want to.

273
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,500
But why?

274
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,020
We just mentioned

275
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,340
Zisheng, didn't we?

276
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,100
Zisheng?

277
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,580
He's over there, isn't he?

278
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,140
It seems like there's
another person beside him.

279
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,940
It's Yuan...

280
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,300
It's actually Mr. Yuan Shanjian?

281
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,780
Yuan Shanjian?

282
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,340
Let me take a look.

283
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:50,479
Is that Mr. Yuan?

284
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,700
It's Zisheng and Mr. Yuan Shanjian.

285
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,500
Take a look.

286
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,720
It's Mr. Yuan.

287
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,520
Yes, it's him.

288
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,420
Mr. Yuan,

289
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,380
do you ever smile?

290
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,340
General Ling, what are you saying?

291
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,260
You should ask yourself
that question instead.

292
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,080
He's so handsome.

293
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,420
Excellent.

294
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,380
If so, Mr. Yuan,

295
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,780
may I request you to smile alongside me?

296
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
It's them!

297
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,980
They're looking in our direction.

298
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,340
Look!

299
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,180
Mr. Yuan, why don't you

300
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,300
smile toward the direction

301
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,940
of the flowers?

302
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,660
Zisheng must be smiling at you!

303
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,380
Is that so?

304
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,460
I can't see clearly.

305
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
You can't see clearly?

306
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,980
You can't see clearly?

307
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,100
There's a bridge over there.

308
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,340
Let's get on the bridge.

309
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,140
We can get a better view from there.

310
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,900
There's a bridge over there?

311
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
-Let us go as well.
-Let's go.

312
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,960
Hurry. Let's go!

313
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
-Wait for me.
-I'll go.

314
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,759
-Let's get on the bridge.
-Come on.

315
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,440
Are they serious?

316
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,599
Come on.

317
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,020
Get on the bridge.

318
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,220
Mr. Yuan!

319
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,800
-Zisheng!
-Mr. Yuan!

320
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,700
I want to check it out too.

321
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,140
Qiqi,

322
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,300
I just had a stomachache.

323
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,820
You should keep me company
while I'm resting here.

324
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,260
-Mr. Lou,
-Li.

325
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,980
they're girls while you're a guy.

326
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,900
You shouldn't join them.

327
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,460
Just stay here.

328
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,359
Mr. Yuan Shanjian.

329
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,200
-Mr. Yuan.
-Zisheng.

330
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,560
We're coming.

331
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,700
What are they trying to do?

332
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,300
Wan,

333
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,780
General Ling and Mr. Shanjian

334
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,180
showed up at the banquet today.

335
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,260
I thought something bad happened.

336
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,780
It turned out that all the ladies
wanted to check out the suave guys.

337
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,160
-Zisheng.
-We're coming.

338
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,780
Zisheng!

339
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Zisheng!

340
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,100
-Mr. Shanjian!
-Zisheng.

341
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,640
(Dangerous)
Mr. Yuan!

342
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,599
We're coming.

343
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,320
-Mr. Yuan.
-Mr. Yuan.

344
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,920
Zisheng.

345
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,990
Mr. Yuan!

346
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,080
Zisheng.

347
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,940
General Ling,

348
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,780
don't tell me you brought us here

349
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,380
in order to check the ladies out?

350
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,599
-Wait for me.
-Mr. Shanjian.

351
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,220
Guys, look closely.

352
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,540
Mr. Yuan.

353
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,380
This is a rare sight

354
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
to behold.

355
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,020
Your Highness, look.
Zisheng is looking at you.

356
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,260
Ladies!

357
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,420
Get out of the way. Stop blocking me.

358
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
This bridge is fragile!
Do not step on it!

359
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,280
(Dangerous)

360
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,860
Stop blocking us!

361
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,940
This is bad!

362
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,940
Three,

363
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,020
two,

364
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,580
one.

365
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,940
The bridge is...

366
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,220
Someone!

367
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,940
-Help them out!
-Help!

368
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,100
Someone!

369
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,940
General Ling.

370
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,140
Li!

371
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,660
How did that bridge collapse?

372
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,080
Don't be afraid.

373
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,340
Hold on!

374
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,580
Grab my hands!

375
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,900
Did you think Wang Ling fell too?

376
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,980
Today was a joyous occasion.

377
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,500
How did this happen?

378
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,820
Shaoshang,

379
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,580
I'll go and see

380
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,260
if they require any assistance.

381
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,940
Hurry!

382
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,660
Get up!

383
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,820
I've never been this embarrassed
in my life before!

384
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,300
Was Niaoniao behind this?

385
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,300
That's impossible.

386
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,980
Mother,

387
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,220
she was together with Qiqi

388
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,700
when the bridge collapsed.

389
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,580
How is that possible?

390
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,540
It's impossible if Niaoniao

391
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,740
has a brain like yours.

392
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,620
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

393
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,500
How could Niaoniao know that
the bridge would collapse?

394
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,540
The bridge was constructed by Lu Ban

395
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,220
to assist the King of Chu.

396
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,300
It's known as the stacking bridge.

397
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,380
Actually, you just need to
remove some of the steps.

398
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,180
The bridge will collapse instantly

399
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,220
once someone steps onto it after that.

400
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,380
Mother, are you saying

401
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,420
that Niaoniao took advantage
of the situation

402
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,500
and lured the ladies to the bridge
after she saw through the secret?

403
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,460
That way, her plan will work

404
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,500
no matter if she's there or not.

405
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,460
Lady Wang

406
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,500
has always been trying
to pick a fight with Niaoniao.

407
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,340
I can understand why Niaoniao
wants to seek revenge against her.

408
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,940
I would do something more drastic

409
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,660
when I was young.

410
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,460
That's right.

411
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,740
Mother, I'm glad that
you didn't blame Niaoniao

412
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,300
for setting this up in our residence.

413
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,060
Why should I blame her?

414
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,300
She just told Wan Fu

415
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,540
to set up warning signs
at both ends of the bridge.

416
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,900
So it would have nothing to do
with Wan Family.

417
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,980
Right.

418
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,220
However, I've already notified her parents

419
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,460
with a letter.

420
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,900
We have to let Yuanyi know

421
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,100
the kind of person her daughter is.

422
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,420
Mother,

423
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,980
if that's the case,

424
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,940
Niaoniao will definitely be punished.

425
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,340
If you're not daring enough

426
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,020
to own up to your mistakes,

427
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
it's better for you
to cease all activities

428
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
and just stay at home.

429
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,420
Mother, you're right.

430
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,780
We have to teach her

431
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,740
the meaning of "you reap what you sow".

432
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,780
Do you want another beating?

433
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,980
No!

434
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,460
Mother! I know my fault now!

435
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,660
I'm sorry!

436
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,100
(A message from Old Madam Wan)

437
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,620
(Please pardon us for
the collapsing of the bridge...)

438
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,860
Actually,

439
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,620
this isn't a malicious deed.

440
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,820
It's just that the ladies
kicked a big fuss about it.

441
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,060
However, I think

442
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,860
no other people took
the incident to heart.

443
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,540
It's all because Old Madam Wan

444
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,260
is knowledgeable and meticulous.

445
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,940
All those young ladies

446
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,540
didn't even understand why it happened.

447
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,740
Niaoniao's plan

448
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,980
was flawless.

449
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,260
You both do not worry.

450
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,780
You just need to apologize

451
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,180
to the Wan Family later.

452
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,020
We can't just

453
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,100
leave it be.

454
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,140
I have to punish her

455
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,260
severely.

456
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,860
We were lucky

457
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,900
that Old Madam Wan saw through her trick.

458
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,300
What if others saw through her trick?

459
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
Niaoniao

460
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,300
knew it was not a proper deed,

461
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,540
but she still insisted on doing it.

462
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,860
She thinks that
she can gloss things over

463
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,540
just because she's witty.

464
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,740
She will get into huge trouble
eventually if she keeps this up.

465
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,580
Today,

466
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,380
I will tame her unruly nature.

467
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,660
General.

468
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,540
What exactly do you plan to do?

469
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,340
I...

470
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,900
Yuanyi, since I've made a promise to you,

471
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
I shall keep my promise.

472
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,060
Qingcong,

473
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,980
bring me the punishment rod.

474
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,900
Someone.

475
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,740
Brother, are you going
to punish Niaoniao?

476
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,780
Niaoniao has a fragile body.

477
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,220
You can knock her unconscious

478
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,540
with just a slap.

479
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,340
Do you even

480
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,620
need to resort to the punishment rod?

481
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,820
You don't know her personality.

482
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,380
Niaoniao is bold but cautious.

483
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,420
She won't be frightened
by ordinary means.

484
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,940
Even so...

485
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,620
This time,

486
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,620
we must punish her severely

487
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,420
and shed some blood

488
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,620
so that she could learn her lesson.

489
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,020
General,

490
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,460
aren't you afraid

491
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,380
that Niaoniao will hate you for this?

492
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,700
Dear, you're right.

493
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,100
That's why

494
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,620
I shouldn't punish her.

495
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,980
You should punish her instead.

496
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,300
I'm doing this for your sake.

497
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,300
What kind of person are you?

498
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,500
To tame an unruly child like Niaoniao,

499
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,380
we need to apply
the carrot and stick approach.

500
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,860
After you finish punishing her,

501
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,420
someone needs to coax her.

502
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,860
Between the two of us,

503
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,500
one has to use the carrot
while the other has to use the stick.

504
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,700
General, you're thoughtful indeed.

505
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,900
Dear, thank you for praising me.

506
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,940
Qingcong,

507
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,900
bring Fourth Lady here right now.

508
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes.

509
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,220
Come.

510
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,300
Come.

511
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,620
Here's my plan.

512
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,100
Later,

513
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,660
I'll hide outside the courtyard

514
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,740
so that I won't feel sorry for her.

515
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,300
When Niaoniao is here,

516
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,900
you can throw a fit and suppress her.

517
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,300
At this time,

518
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,460
you can go crazy

519
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
and smash the cup into pieces.

520
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,020
Cheng Zhi and Shunhua

521
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,700
can pretend to rush here.

522
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,780
You two

523
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,900
must make a pitiful plea
on Niaoniao's behalf.

524
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,340
Yuanyi,

525
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,300
you need to act as if

526
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,180
you were unwilling to do so

527
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,380
and that you only spared her
because they plead for her.

528
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,540
Brother-in-law, you are a great actor indeed.

529
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,540
Precisely.

530
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,300
However,

531
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,780
why do we need
to participate in your act?

532
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,540
Do you truly don't understand why?

533
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,700
Today,

534
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,940
we must let Niaoniao know

535
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,900
that there will always
be someone better than her.

536
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,700
She shouldn't think that
she could do anything she wants

537
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,860
just because
she has someone backing her up.

538
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,340
It's decided then.

539
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,620
Yuanyi,

540
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,580
don't forget.

541
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,660
Smashing the cup will be our signal.

542
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,140
Young Lady, Madam is requesting
for your presence at Jiuzhui Hall.

543
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,540
Young Lady,

544
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,780
who do you need me to call this time?

545
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,860
This time,

546
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,900
no one can help me out.

547
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,820
Kneel!

548
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,540
Were you the one who made

549
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,820
the bridge collapse today?

550
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,700
Why haven't you learned your lesson yet?

551
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,140
There's no particular reason for it.

552
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,620
I just wanted to take out
my frustrations on her.

553
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,820
I gave you a warning
before you went out today.

554
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,060
I said I would never spare you
if you stirred up trouble again.

555
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,260
Why did you still do it?

556
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,180
What has been done

557
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,820
cannot be undone.

558
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,500
Mother, I never expected you
to let me off.

559
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
You want to punish me?

560
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,100
Suit yourself.

561
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,180
All right.

562
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,020
Since you're willing
to own up to your mistake,

563
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,740
I will show you no mercy.

564
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,940
Qingcong,

565
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,020
serve her military punishment!

566
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,980
Young Lady, hurry and
admit your mistake.

567
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,620
I didn't do anything wrong.

568
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,620
Young Lady!

569
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,700
I did nothing wrong.

570
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,700
Mother, go ahead

571
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,100
if you wish to punish me.

572
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,700
Why aren't there any movements at all?

573
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,740
Did she punish her or not?

574
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,020
Niaoniao has a stubborn temper.

575
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,860
She won't shout
even if she receives punishments.

576
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,740
That's a military rod.

577
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,660
Even soldiers can't endure the pain.

578
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,260
Brother,

579
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,820
I'm truly stunned

580
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,260
by the current situation.

581
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,980
What's the situation when Yuanyi
was exerting military punishments

582
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,580
in the camp.

583
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,900
It was

584
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,460
terrifying.

585
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,940
Under her order,

586
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,780
the servants

587
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,740
would leave the tent

588
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,180
and stood guard over the entrance.

589
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,740
No one dared to speak

590
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,420
inside the camp.

591
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,860
There were only cries

592
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,220
and screams in the camp.

593
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,900
Are you going to stay stubborn

594
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,820
even if it means

595
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,540
you will bleed for it?

596
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,020
Mother, just go ahead.

597
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
All right.

598
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,860
Go ahead, huh?

599
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,020
If I don't discipline you today,
I won't be able to keep the Cheng Family

600
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,220
in check.

601
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,420
Qingcong,

602
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,980
deliver the punishment!

603
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,060
Do not go easy on her.

604
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,540
Do it!

605
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,580
This is bad!

606
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,740
She's punishing her for real now!

607
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,980
Didn't we agree that she would
punish Niaoniao for a moment

608
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,180
and smash the cup as our signal
to enter the fray?

609
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,460
I'm afraid Niaoniao will die

610
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,780
before she smashes the cup.

611
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,180
Why are you still standing there?
Go and take a look!

612
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,100
General, please stop!

613
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,180
How dare you stop me!

614
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,140
Stop it immediately!

615
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,020
Stop hitting her!

616
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,460
Niaoniao.

617
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,100
Niaoniao?

618
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,500
Niaoniao!

619
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,100
Father,

620
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,060
you're finally here.

621
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,660
Yuanyi,

622
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,820
you shouldn't go this hard on her

623
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,660
even though she was wrong.

624
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,180
She's our dear daughter!

625
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,660
Yuanyi, why were you so hard on her?

626
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,580
Hurry and summon a physician.

627
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,740
We need to treat her immediately.

628
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,940
Yuanyi,

629
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,620
you've impressed me

630
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,420
this time.

631
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,540
You actually

632
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,260
punished your daughter like
how you punished a soldier.

633
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,540
Even if Shaoshang was wrong,

634
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,140
couldn't you teach her by example?

635
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,620
Why did you have to go so far?

636
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,500
You punish her physically while
being impatient with her.

637
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,740
How could you shape a stubborn child
like her into a role model?

638
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,500
Excellent!

639
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,380
The one who was punished
didn't complain.

640
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,260
The ones who came up with the plan
are questioning me instead!

641
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,420
Your entire family

642
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,260
are always right.

643
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,900
I'm always wrong in the end.

644
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,380
I'm the only crook in the family.

645
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,540
Cheng Zhi,

646
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,180
you will assume your post
in Hua County soon.

647
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,460
Take her with you to Hua County.

648
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,820
From now on,

649
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,860
I will never care for this child again.

650
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,820
Great.

651
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,620
Mother,

652
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,620
it's

653
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,260
a deal then.

654
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,940
Niaoniao, you can continue sleeping.

655
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
I'm just here to see how you're doing.

656
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,300
Father,

657
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,660
you still treat me the best

658
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,420
out of everyone in the family.

659
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,820
From now on,

660
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,100
I won't create any troubles for you.

661
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,700
I won't make you

662
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,660
clean up my mess again.

663
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,180
Good girl.

664
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,820
Niaoniao, you've always been my pride.

665
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,620
It won't hurt

666
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,100
once you fall asleep.

667
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,940
I went to check on Niaoniao just now.

668
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,940
She was complaining about the pain
even when she was sleeping.

669
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,340
Yuanyi, you didn't see it yourself.

670
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,740
Niaoniao was in so much pain
that she was shaking

671
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,940
when the physician applied the ointment.

672
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,740
Do you want this?

673
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,140
How about some water?

674
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,820
Shaoshang, that was satisfying indeed.

675
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,420
It's a shame that you didn't witness it.

676
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,980
Wang Ling was covered with mud that day.

677
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,140
She was in such a messy state.

678
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,620
And that Princess Yuchang,

679
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,660
she still pretended to be dignified

680
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,100
even though her hairpins
were flying all over the place.

681
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,980
It was hilarious.

682
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,660
Do you know something?

683
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,540
I didn't even know

684
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,700
who I should laugh at first

685
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,220
when I was there.

686
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,180
It must be hurt.

687
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,940
Let me see.

688
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,460
Qiqi,

689
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,220
can you be gentle?

690
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,740
It still hurts.

691
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,300
Sorry about that.

692
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,220
Let me see.

693
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,180
Your mother is pretty ruthless.

694
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,140
She was as ruthless as my grandmother

695
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,860
when she gave my father a beating.

696
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,460
Your father brought it upon himself.

697
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,580
What did you say?

698
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,540
I was saying...

699
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,580
I was saying

700
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,020
that it hurts no matter

701
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,180
if I stand, sit, or lie down.

702
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,460
I'm so pitiful.

703
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,700
However, this is strange.

704
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,220
How did your mother know that
you were behind the incident?

705
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,660
Even I didn't know about it

706
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,260
when we are this close.

707
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,380
I'm sure he reported it to my mother.

708
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,100
He actually betrayed me

709
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,540
after I've done him a favor.

710
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,580
He's not a man.

711
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,100
Who were you referring to?

712
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,220
It's the jinx.

713
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,540
The jinx?

714
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,900
General Ling sent you some medicine.

715
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
He said it was for soliders
after they receive their punishments.

716
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,580
He guarantees that your wound

717
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,020
will fully recover within three days.

718
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,980
How did he know what happened to me?

719
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,380
Could it be

720
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,580
that he planted a spy in my residence?

721
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,020
Young Master,

722
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Lady Cheng didn't know
what was good for her.

723
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,100
She actually rejected
the medicine you gave her.

724
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,300
Are you so free that you can

725
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,140
eavesdrop on a conversation among ladies

726
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,260
because you no longer
need to monitor Prince Xiao?

727
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,940
I was just curious.

728
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,780
That's why I lingered for a little while.

729
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,940
Young Master,

730
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,260
Prince Xiao was terrified of us.

731
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,260
He doesn't even dare
to leave the residence nowadays,

732
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,340
let alone enjoying himself outside.

733
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,220
As long as he makes no moves,

734
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,060
the mastermind won't be able
to procure the armaments.

735
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,940
His Majesty's visit to the west
was already announced to the public.

736
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,860
I don't believe that the mastermind

737
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,220
can stay still even after hearing this news.

738
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,220
This trip will be a risky one.

739
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,260
Assign more men to the task.

740
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,500
We must get the goods on them

741
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,100
while sustaining the least injuries.

742
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,060
Yes.

743
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,060
So, about the medicine...

744
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,380
You can keep it for yourself.

745
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,260
My son,

746
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,980
you must eat more food
during the journey.

747
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,020
Don't starve yourself.

748
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,700
And you,

749
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,500
take good care of my son.

750
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,700
Yes, Old Madam.

751
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,580
Niaoniao,

752
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,060
you must eat more food
during the journey.

753
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,860
Don't starve yourself.

754
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,020
And you,

755
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,060
take good care of my Niaoniao.

756
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,620
Brother, don't worry.

757
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,820
What are you laughing at?

758
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,300
Niaoniao, don't worry.

759
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,500
I had your fortune read.

760
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,420
You will surely turn
calamities into blessings.

761
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,620
You don't need to worry about anything.

762
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,020
No matter how perilous
the journey might be,

763
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,460
I'm willing

764
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,500
as long as I'm able to explore

765
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,660
the vast world outside.

766
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,540
Song, Shaogong,

767
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,100
you guys don't need to worry about me.

768
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,780
I will surely write to you guys

769
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,060
and invite you over

770
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,340
if the world outside is great.

771
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,420
By then, the three of us can gather

772
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,020
and forget about the ancient teachings.

773
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,620
That would be great.

774
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,580
We're looking forward to it.

775
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,020
Niaoniao,

776
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,220
you must take care of yourself
during the journey.

777
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,500
You mustn't hold a grudge
against your mother.

778
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,220
I...

779
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,500
Father, you don't need to worry.

780
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,620
The three of us

781
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,620
will surely take good care

782
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,580
of ourselves.

783
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,820
Cheng Yang,

784
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,420
take good care of my mother.

785
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,860
All right.

786
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,620
Get on the carriage then.

787
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,980
Get on.

788
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,740
Get on the carriage.

789
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,660
You'll make a move now.

790
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
Take care.

791
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,940
Mother, please take care.

792
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,820
My son!

793
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,900
Cheng Zhi! Cheng Zhi!

794
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,740
My son!

795
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,220
My son!

796
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,980
My son!

797
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,940
My son!

798
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,300
Madam, since you're worried about her,

799
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,460
why didn't you see her off?

800
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,100
Who said I was here to see her off?

801
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,580
I was just passing by

802
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,820
on my way to the old residence

803
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,580
to search for some forgotten items.

804
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,700
Yes.

805
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,940
Madam, what a coincidence indeed.

806
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,540
You even assigned all of your military servants

807
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,140
to serve the Third Madam

808
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,300
in order to protect Fourth Lady...

809
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,620
No,

810
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,140
I mean to protect Fourth Lady and the rest.

811
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,540
This child

812
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,500
is truly stubborn indeed.

813
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,060
Actually, Fourth Lady

814
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,940
is just like you, Madam.

815
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,180
She may look stubborn,

816
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,100
but she has the kindest heart.
