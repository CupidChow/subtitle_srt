00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like The Galaxy=

2
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,560
=Episode 53=

3
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,790
Miss Shaoshang.

4
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,110
That day I spoke rudely

5
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,390
and bluffed about
General Huo's love for me.

6
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,270
Please forgive me.

7
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,040
Ever since my husband passed away,

8
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,390
Luo's family has been forcing me

9
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,560
to get married soon

10
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,440
and to play up to people of power again.

11
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,030
Or else,

12
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,350
they're going to make me
marry in the Northwest.

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,480
A woman of no good like me

14
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,590
could find a good match
for the first marriage.

15
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,200
But for the second marriage,

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,200
there're not many choices left.

17
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,310
Therefore,

18
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,910
I was getting anxious.

19
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,840
Therefore,

20
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,200
you didn't want to let go of Huo Buyi.

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,480
I have admired General Huo since I was young.

22
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,800
I always long

23
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,680
to be with him.

24
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,200
Sadly, he doesn't think the same.

25
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,630
The worst thing I did

26
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,400
was to overestimate myself

27
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,760
and underestimate General Huo's love

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
for you.

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,040
I deserve to be insulted

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,560
in public.

31
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,630
General Huo

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,630
gave my father the mirror

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
in front of so many people,

34
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,760
saying it's for my wedding gift.

35
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,560
I can't imagine

36
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,510
how embarrassed my father was.

37
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,840
Don't stare at me.

38
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,750
I don't want to deal with him.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,400
I won't plead for his mercy for you.

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I also won't persuade him to marry you.

41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,430
This is your own business.

42
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,470
No.

43
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,750
The one-sided infatuation

44
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,840
that lasted for five years.

45
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,310
That was enough.

46
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
How many five years

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
does a woman have?

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,430
I came today

49
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,430
to tell you

50
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,190
that I've decided

51
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,520
to spend the rest of my life
in the Northwest.

52
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,710
Farewell

53
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,030
forever.

54
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
I've found a carriage.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,710
I'll depart tonight.

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,120
I wish you and General Huo

57
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,310
will stay together forever.

58
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Or else I'll be upset in the Northwest.

59
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,590
I've let go of

60
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,150
my obsession with Huo Buyi.

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,680
But I have to do one thing

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,710
for Empress Xuan.

63
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
Since Empress Xuan fell sick,

64
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,270
she has been missing you.

65
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,030
Now

66
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,120
you're finally back, General Huo.

67
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,840
How's Empress Xuan's condition?

68
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,590
Physician Sun said

69
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
that she has been too depressed

70
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,710
and it's hard to be cured.

71
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,640
Her condition worsened this morning.

72
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,560
Her Majesty couldn't even get up.

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,270
I get it.

74
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,190
Your Majesty.

75
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,720
Is that Zisheng?

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
It's me.

77
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,280
You lost weight.

78
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,160
I think about the capital

79
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,920
and dare not slack off.

80
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Are you thinking about the capital

81
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,310
or

82
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,920
Shaoshang?

83
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,800
There's something

84
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,680
I want to tell you.

85
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,720
Yuan Shanjian and Shaoshang

86
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,630
aren't engaged.

87
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
I know.

88
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
Shaoshang

89
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,680
still cares about you.

90
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
I know that too.

91
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,630
It's my fault.

92
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,480
I've decided

93
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,190
to use my whole life to atone.

94
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,950
When she was young

95
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,800
and needed to be loved most,

96
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,720
she wasn't loved by her family.

97
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,870
If you want to love her,

98
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,920
you have to make up

99
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,160
for her grief.

100
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,310
Don't always make her

101
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,680
understand your choice.

102
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,070
Only by discussing

103
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,560
can you keep walking side-by-side.

104
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,920
Yes.

105
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,950
From now on,

106
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,240
I'll be honest to Shaoshang

107
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,600
and tell her everything.

108
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,510
I'll not hide anything from her.

109
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
Sadly,

110
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,680
time is short.

111
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,120
I'm afraid

112
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,680
I won't be able to see you marry.

113
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,040
It's my fault.

114
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,040
I've made you worried.

115
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,630
I only hope that

116
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,070
in my next life

117
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,720
the two of you
can be my biological children,

118
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,310
and I can live a few more years

119
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,040
to be with you

120
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,360
and smile at my death bed.

121
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,950
Such a life

122
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,280
would be perfect.

123
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,590
Lady Luo.

124
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,230
Haven't we arrived at

125
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,640
the miracle-working physician
you mentioned?

126
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,280
When I was
looking for medicine for Qilang,

127
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,400
I asked my friends and family

128
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
to inquire about many medical experts.

129
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,920
At last, I chose this one.

130
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,520
This physician is

131
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,430
the best in treating depression.

132
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,590
If you don't believe me,

133
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,640
you may go back to Changqiu Palace.

134
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm afraid Empress Xuan

135
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,190
can't hold on any longer.

136
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,560
Stop the carriage first.

137
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,310
Please tell me

138
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,350
the exact location.

139
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,400
So I can go back to inform His Majesty

140
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,160
and come back
to visit with precious gifts.

141
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,310
Miss Shaoshang.

142
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,110
Don't you trust me?

143
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,830
Look.

144
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,710
My entire asset is in this carriage.

145
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,830
I came to the capital with these

146
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,640
and I'm leaving
the capital with these as well.

147
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,950
I've decided to
go back to the Northwest.

148
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,680
Would I harm you

149
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,710
before I leave?

150
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,760
General Liangqiu sent a letter

151
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,040
to request General Huo's
presence for an urgent matter.

152
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,400
Go ahead.

153
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,880
When you see Shaoshang,

154
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,640
talk nicely to her.

155
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,640
She'll understand.

156
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,190
Okay.

157
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,470
General Huo.

158
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,310
General Liangqiu said

159
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,920
that Lady Cheng
was invited into Lady Luo's carriage

160
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,040
and they headed to the suburbs.

161
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
When did that happen?

162
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,470
An hour ago.

163
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,920
When you go back to the Northwest,

164
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,470
you can choose another husband.

165
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,040
If you can't find a good match,

166
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,680
don't force yourself to take anyone.

167
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,280
Who says a woman can't live a life

168
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,590
without a husband?

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,350
You don't understand.

170
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,590
Other than General Huo,

171
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,950
I'll not marry anyone else.

172
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,160
He's not the only man

173
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,830
in this world.

174
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,560
Why must you be stuck with him?

175
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
You don't understand.

176
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,350
I have admired General Huo since I was young.

177
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,680
But I was in a lowly state.

178
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,470
I didn't dare to confess my love.

179
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,190
And we're engaged
to someone else respectively.

180
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,830
I thought there was
no hope in this life.

181
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,350
But heavens had pity on me.

182
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,950
General Huo and I
met again in the Northwest.

183
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,110
You can never imagine

184
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,190
how happy I was.

185
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,230
It's as if when a drowning person

186
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,800
finds a floating wood.

187
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,640
Therefore,

188
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,520
even when your husband was alive,

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,640
you were already
thinking about General Huo.

190
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,430
Do you know how it feels

191
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,070
when you love someone deeply,

192
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,950
yet you have to serve
another person with your body and mind?

193
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,640
When I was on the bed,

194
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,470
I couldn't stop thinking about him.

195
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,950
I had to use Jia Qilang

196
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,310
as Zisheng's replacement to endure it.

197
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,880
I don't know.

198
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,310
You don't have to
tell me such silly things.

199
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,110
That's because you're heartless.

200
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,640
Do you know how his life was

201
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,070
when he was in the Northwest?

202
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
He was fighting the enemy

203
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,070
on the frontline with his life.

204
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,000
In wars, others fought for survival
yet he fought for death.

205
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,710
You're so ruthless.

206
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,830
Why are you so cruel to him?

207
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Fortunately,

208
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,710
Zisheng has me.

209
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,560
I love him,

210
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
and respect him.

211
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,830
No matter what he does to me,

212
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,190
I'll never blame him.

213
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,880
I can accept his good

214
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,760
and his bad.

215
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,280
I'm different from you,

216
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,590
a woman
who cancels her engagement at will.

217
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,920
I lived a chaste life

218
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,830
and loved only one person.

219
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,000
Lady Luo.

220
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,470
If it weren't for Empress Xuan,

221
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,560
I wouldn't come here with you.

222
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,560
Stop the carriage.

223
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,590
Cheng Shaoshang.

224
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,280
Because of you,
Huo Buyi cut off all ties with me.

225
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,230
I have nowhere to go now.

226
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,680
Every woman in town is making fun of me.

227
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,190
How could I let you off the carriage?

228
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,400
Let me go.

229
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,710
Do you know?

230
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,000
The military physician said

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,830
Zisheng refused to

232
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,400
have the tooth mark on his arm treated.

233
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,640
He even used medicine
to worsen the tooth mark

234
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,950
because of you.

235
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,230
I've been fooled by the two of you.

236
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,830
You're fooling yourself.

237
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,830
Let go.

238
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,470
He doesn't care about any other ladies.

239
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,430
Why are you so special?

240
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,400
I came to the palace before you.

241
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,280
I'm smarter and more virtuous than you.

242
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,310
Why

243
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,830
does Huo Buyi only have eyes for you?

244
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,040
You deserve to die.

245
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,310
Luo Jitong.

246
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,800
Even if you kill me,

247
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,280
you can't have him.

248
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,430
So what?

249
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,350
For him

250
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,950
I dare to do anything.

251
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,190
I even could kill my husband.

252
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,640
But he still doesn't love me.

253
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
As long as I've killed you,

254
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,920
he'll remember me forever,

255
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,760
even if it's out of hatred.

256
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,760
Stop the carriage.

257
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,520
Shaoshang.

258
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,350
Stop the carriage.

259
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,230
Zisheng.

260
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,680
If you dare stop the carriage,

261
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,040
I'll kill her right now.

262
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,640
Luo Jitong.

263
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let her go.

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,190
We can discuss this.

265
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,400
Discuss?

266
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,760
I begged you so hard yesterday,

267
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,310
yet you weren't moved at all.

268
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,800
Now you're afraid.

269
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,520
What if I let her go,

270
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,950
but you'll have to marry me.
Is that a deal?

271
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,680
Let her go first.

272
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll do anything.

273
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,470
Stop lying to me.

274
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,640
Do you think I don't know?

275
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,760
Other than Cheng Shaoshang,

276
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,560
you won't marry anyone else.

277
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,680
If that's the case,

278
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,560
why should I live?

279
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,190
I want to die with her.

280
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,310
Hold on, Shaoshang.

281
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,870
Let go.

282
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,630
You're capable to get up.

283
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,830
If you don't let go,

284
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,390
we'll both die here.

285
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,390
Let go.

286
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
I'll only let go

287
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,350
when I die.

288
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Huo Buyi.

289
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
Even if you die for me,

290
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,870
I won't forgive you.

291
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,960
Let go now.

292
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,000
I won't live without you.

293
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,910
I know

294
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,590
that I did many wrong things.

295
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

296
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
But since you bit my arm as a bond,

297
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,390
I've regarded you as my wife.

298
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,830
Therefore,

299
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,870
you live,

300
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,070
I live,

301
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,630
you die,

302
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
I die.

303
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,590
Young Master, we're here.

304
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,520
Hang in there.

305
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
Shaoshang, catch the rope.

306
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,670
Your injury...

307
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,910
It's okay.

308
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,240
I'll just have the physician bandage it.

309
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,910
Lady Cheng.

310
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,000
Let me send you back to your palace.

311
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
No need.

312
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,390
I can go back myself.

313
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,240
Let Qi send you back then.

314
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,040
Take my carriage.

315
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,240
I shall leave first.

316
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,070
Report.

317
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,910
General Huo, Lady Cheng.

318
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,350
His Majesty calls you
to return to the palace now.

319
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,350
Empress Xuan...

320
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,910
Empress Xuan is dying.

321
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,870
Shen'an.

322
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,910
Is there anything else

323
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,830
on your mind?

324
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,280
Tell me.

325
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,110
I...

326
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,670
I'll have them done for you.

327
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,440
I've lived my entire life

328
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,760
for people around me.

329
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,670
It would be pointless
to still be talking

330
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,870
for others right now.

331
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,560
I've been by Your Majesty's side

332
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,960
for decades.

333
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,520
I know that in Your Majesty's heart,

334
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,110
Your Majesty is
still an upright young man

335
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,040
who loves to read.

336
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,670
If it weren't for the chaotic world

337
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,390
and ruthless Emperor Li,

338
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,280
Your Majesty would rather stay
in the quiet countryside forever,

339
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,390
marry Yueheng,

340
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,390
and have a few children.

341
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,310
Your Majesty would work as the sun rises,
and rest as the sun sets.

342
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,800
Living a simple life.

343
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,800
Shen'an.

344
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,670
It's me.

345
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
I've held up

346
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,910
your entire life.

347
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,870
Your Majesty

348
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,910
has never owed me anything.

349
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,070
I didn't dare to reject
the marriage arranged by Uncle.

350
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,560
To be able to meet you

351
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,040
is

352
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,110
my biggest fortune.

353
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,960
Your Majesty

354
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,760
has sacrificed so much for world peace.

355
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,760
Heng is also the same.

356
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,350
Just because she's rude, straightforward

357
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,520
and casual,

358
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,280
Your Majesty thinks

359
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,440
that she doesn't
take things to her heart

360
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,560
and doesn't feel sorrow.

361
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,870
I know

362
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,630
that she has wept

363
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,310
more than I did.

364
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,590
From now on,

365
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,040
Your Majesty and Heng

366
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,280
should stay well together.

367
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,870
Just like

368
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,350
how close you were
when you were in the countryside.

369
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,040
As if I

370
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,000
had never been here.

371
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,870
Shen'an.

372
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,280
Your Majesty.

373
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,390
Please allow me to speak

374
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,520
to Heng.

375
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,960
Okay.

376
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,670
Shen'an,

377
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,520
as long as I'm around,

378
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,720
I'll make sure that
Xuan Family will be well.

379
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,670
I'm not counting on you.

380
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,630
The Crown Prince is here.

381
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,720
He's steady and capable.

382
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,910
I'm not worried.

383
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,390
Right now,

384
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,150
I want to talk about us.

385
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,070
I didn't suspect that you were the one

386
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,390
who assassinated my son
when he was nineteen.

387
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,590
I know.

388
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,830
That year

389
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,830
when my boy died at four months of age,

390
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
I didn't suspect you either.

391
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,240
I know.

392
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,110
You never suspected me,

393
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,870
that's why you ignored the rumors

394
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,070
and dared to accept these children.

395
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,000
Her Majesty.

396
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,520
In my heart,

397
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,480
we're just like

398
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,830
biological sisters.

399
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,000
If we were

400
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,310
siblings of a normal family,

401
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,280
that would be great.

402
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,910
Let the children in.

403
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,040
Come in.

404
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,070
Slow down.

405
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,390
Your Majesty.

406
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,910
My body

407
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,110
must be buried
in the Imperial Mausoleum.

408
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,870
May I give

409
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,040
a bunch of my hair

410
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,350
to Shaoshang so she can burn it to ash

411
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,830
and bring it back to the mountain

412
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,910
where my father and I
used to live in seclusion?

413
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,520
As you wish.

414
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,240
We will do as you wish.

415
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,110
Son.

416
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,910
You've always been indecisive.

417
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,040
So what if you have glory?

418
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,560
You have to be more broad-minded

419
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,000
to live a longer life.

420
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,760
Madam Zhai

421
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,110
shall count on your care now.

422
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
I will

423
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
take good care of Madam Zhai.

424
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,870
Hang in there, Mother.

425
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I want to take care of you
in your old age.

426
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,670
I can no longer live any older.

427
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,390
Mother.

428
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,240
I'm wrong.

429
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,910
I'm wrong.

430
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,390
I'm willing to use my life
to exchange yours.

431
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,240
If you're really filial,

432
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,240
don't use your life to exchange mine,

433
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,910
but live well

434
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,560
and cherish your life.

435
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,870
Don't disparage yourself.

436
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Zisheng.

437
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,520
Your Majesty.

438
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,870
I've never blamed you.

440
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,560
I know that all these while

441
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,350
you've been living in hardship.

442
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,480
You don't owe us anything.

443
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,480
I know

444
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,240
that you've been feeling guilty.

445
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,240
When I'm gone,

446
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,350
let the past

447
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,110
be gone with the wind.

448
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,070
You

449
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,870
should forgive yourself too.

450
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,520
Shaoshang.

451
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,110
Come here.

452
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,310
Shaoshang.

453
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,830
I've encumbered you

454
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,200
for five years.

455
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,800
What encumber?

456
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,310
I'm willing to follow Your Majesty

457
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,870
for five years

458
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,110
or even ten.

459
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,560
Silly girl.

460
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,870
One doesn't have so much time in life.

461
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,350
You've missed a lot because of me.

462
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,560
I hope that

463
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,440
in the future

464
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,280
you can live well for yourself.

465
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,070
I don't wish that

466
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,000
you'll waste your life as I did.

467
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,720
As a mother,

468
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,630
I hope you two

469
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,830
can pick up from where you left off.

470
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:29,040
But as a sensible elder,

471
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,960
I know that

472
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,760
a marriage can't be forced.

473
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
I can only advise you

474
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,150
to follow your heart.

475
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,480
Cherish the present. Don't regret it.

476
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,350
I hope that

477
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,720
the world will
have peace in my next life,

478
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,830
so I can be free from suffering.

479
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,240
I hope that

480
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,350
my parents will
live long and healthy in my next life,

481
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,670
so I can be free from sorrow.

482
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,590
I hope that in my next life

483
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,720
I can have the gift of youth

484
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,760
and sing in the mountains.

485
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,830
Dear,

486
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,390
I'm fortunate in this life

487
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,960
to be able to marry you.

488
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,710
I hope in my next life,

489
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,920
you and I

490
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,790
will

491
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,480
never

492
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,960
meet again.

493
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
General Huo.

494
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,840
Let's talk.

495
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,560
Okay.

496
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,750
What happened?

497
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,840
Empress Xuan passed away.

498
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,560
Don't worry.

499
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,920
I'm just here to send Shaoshang back.

500
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,960
I'll leave soon.

501
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,560
I won't disturb you.

502
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,440
Huo Buyi, stand right there.

503
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,230
General Huo.

504
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,440
What kind of place do you think
Marquis Quling's Residence is?

505
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,750
And who do you think Niaoniao is?

506
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,190
You come and go at will.

507
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,920
Just like that year,

508
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,480
you were about to marry her,

509
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,790
yet you abandoned her.

510
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,400
Five years ago,

511
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,320
you abandoned Niaoniao.

512
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,520
She was sick and dying.

513
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,190
Have a look at the backyard.

514
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,070
The half-done coffin

515
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,360
we made for her is still there.

516
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,360
I know I've done Shaoshang wrong.

517
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,880
I also know that

518
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,590
you care about Shaoshang.

519
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,190
Therefore,

520
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,270
I've decided never to disturb you again.

521
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,040
Do you know

522
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,400
how Niaoniao has lived
for the past five years?

523
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,750
She was a person
who loved crowds and fun.

524
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,630
Yet she locked herself up
in Changqiu Palace for five years.

525
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,670
When I was horribly sick,

526
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,520
when her brother got married,

527
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,840
when her cousin got married,

528
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,270
we hoped to see her.

529
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,230
But she's not

530
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,710
left Changqiu Palace.

531
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,880
You lost her for five years.

532
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,040
Our family also lost
our daughter for five years.

533
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,070
Do you know

534
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,840
who she did that for?

535
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,000
For you.

536
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,750
Huo Buyi.

537
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,440
It's my fault.

538
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,320
I've failed

539
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,920
Shaoshang's love for me.

540
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,750
I've failed Cheng Family's trust in me.

541
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,070
I've wronged Shaoshang.

542
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,670
I've also wronged Cheng Family.

543
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,840
What I owe you

544
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,960
can't be repaid
even with my entire life.

545
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,320
Let alone Shaoshang's forgiveness,

546
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,150
even I

547
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
can't forgive myself.

548
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,040
When I was in the Northwest,

549
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,150
I fought day and night

550
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,710
in hope that my chest
would be pierced by a sword

551
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,320
so I could die on the battlefield.

552
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,040
But I dared not to die.

553
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,670
I haven't been able
to make her let go of her resentment.

554
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,190
How could I just die?

555
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,840
General Huo.

556
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,880
We're not asking you to plead guilty.

557
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,790
What we said just now

558
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,320
wasn't so that you feel guilty.

559
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,070
We're Niaoniao's parents,

560
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,880
yet we didn't give her enough love
when she was young.

561
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,000
We also regret it now.

562
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,320
No matter what Niaoniao chooses,

563
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,440
who she wants to marry,

564
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,040
right now

565
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,710
we let her make her own choice.

566
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,920
The two of you

567
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,070
love each other.

568
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,230
However, fate has other plans.

569
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,070
Whether you two can be together again,

570
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,230
we shall

571
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,880
let the future decide.

572
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,040
(Special reminder: The cliff-falling
animal action scenes)

573

and props horses.)
