=Episode 3=

3
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:50,725
Young Master.

4
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:56,764
Young Master.

5
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:58,365
Head Armorer Dong was really
afraid of being interrogated.

6
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,405
He admitted to everything.

7
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:01,964
The man who bribed Head Armorer Dong
was Xu Jinzhong.

8
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:04,444
He stays in Feng Yi County and
he came from a blacksmith family.

9
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,725
For some reason, he joined the military.

10
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,844
Right now, he is the Imperial Armourer
in charge of all weapons.

11
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,005
Xu Jinzhong would give
Head Armorer Dong some money

12
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,325
so he would turn a blind eye.

13
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:17,124
As for where the armament was sent to

14
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:18,124
and sold to whom,

15
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:19,365
he knew nothing about it.

16
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:22,325
Xu Jinzhong.

17
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:24,084
What an interesting name.

18
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:26,124
I wonder

19
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,005
who he is loyal to.

20
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,124
How long has this been going on?

21
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:33,725
About half a year.

22
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:36,445
For the last six months,

23
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,764
there are no more wars

24
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:41,085
besides our last battle.

25
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:43,644
Xu Jinzhong took a lot of armament.

26
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:46,484
Seems like his buyer is very ambitious.

27
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:50,124
Where is this person now?

28
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,605
Since Head Armorer Dong was arrested,

29
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,885
he no longer appeared in public.

30
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,045
Keep investigating.

31
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:55,045
Yes.

32
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,885
What are you planning to do
with Head Armorer Dong?

33
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:01,445
He knew nothing about
the Imperial Armourer's plans.

34
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:03,885
He can be spared
from the death punishment

35
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,484
but he still needs to be punished.

36
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:06,805
According to his crime,

37
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,405
he will be banished to the borders.

38
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:14,564
Inform the Ministry of Justice

39
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:15,924
to let him return

40
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,965
to Cheng's residence
before banishing him.

41
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,405
We get all the leads

42
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:24,885
to arrest Head Armorer Dong

43
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,605
thanks to Fourth Lady Cheng.

44
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:29,644
We need to thank her

45
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:31,085
and return her favour.

46
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:32,364
Let Head Armorer Dong

47
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,165
see his family before he is banished.

48
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:38,564
When did Young Master learn
how to return a favour?

49
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,670
Didn't he say he wouldn't care
about Fourth Lady Cheng's fate?

50
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:42,004
Stop asking.

51
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,884
Do you want your legs to be chopped off
or do you want to eat molten lead?

52
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,604
Young Master won't be so cruel to us.

53
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,925
That depends on my mood.

54
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:50,444
I'll let Head Armorer Dong
return tomorrow

55
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,685
to repay Fourth Lady Cheng.

56
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:06,444
There are so many good things.

57
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,444
I've never seen them before.

58
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,284
This hairpin looks so pretty.

59
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:16,525
That's not all.

60
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,685
Your always in your mother's thoughts.

61
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,805
Whenever she sees these things,

62
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:23,444
she always keeps it for you.

63
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,525
Do you have something else?

64
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:30,324
Of course.

65
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:40,124
These are the scrolls I picked.

66
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:47,405
Scrolls?

67
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,205
I thought it was something good.

68
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:54,645
There's no end to learning.

69
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:57,124
The most precious thing is books.

70
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,085
Pick a scroll and read it for me.

71
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,645
Show me what you've learnt in the past.

72
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,685
After that,
I'll pick something suitable for you.

73
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:36,205
Read it.

74
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:40,805
Why aren't you reading?

75
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:45,525
My throat hurts.

76
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:46,804
Be honest.

77
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:51,604
Do you have some characters
that you don't recognise?

78
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:52,604
I don't recognise all of them.

79
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:53,765
All of them?

80
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:54,724
Not really.

81
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:59,525
Some of them look familiar.

82
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:00,604
This.

83
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:02,405
Cang.

84
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,484
Cang, right?

85
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:07,604
Something...

86
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,005
Something something...

87
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:10,364
To...

88
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:12,604
To...

89
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:14,765
To teach...

90
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:16,525
Something something...

91
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:17,684
Children.

92
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,684
There are
a few more familiar characters.

93
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:23,244
It's "Cangjie creates characters
to teach his descendants."

94
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,445
Exactly.

95
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,804
"Children learn from it to be cautious."

96
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:29,405
You only recognised four

97
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,205
out of all these characters.

98
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,164
Our Niaoniao

99
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,804
is really smart.

100
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:37,244
I should've repudiated the evil woman.

101
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,684
We left my child to her

102
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,044
and this is how she taught my child.

103
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,765
First Madam is so despicable.

104
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:43,405
Madam is knowledgeable

105
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,044
but she actually made Young Lady...

106
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,044
Illiterate.

107
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,205
Right?

108
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,325
It's fine.

109
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,684
I used to be illiterate too.

110
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:57,724
But I have your mother.

111
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,205
Your mother's knowledge

112
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:00,244
is famous

113
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:01,445
in the whole county

114
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,724
let alone the village.

115
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,525
Right?

116
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:09,085
Second Aunt shouldn't be blamed.

117
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:10,965
I don't like to study indeed.

118
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,604
Perhaps I'm similar to you, Father.

119
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:22,325
Just study slowly.

120
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:25,164
Your father was busy farming
when he was young

121
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:27,125
and went to battles after that.

122
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:29,965
He started studying at the age of 30.

123
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,405
Now, he can read all the reports

124
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,965
without any difficulties.

125
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,405
There's a lot more time
for you to study.

126
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,484
People from the Dong Family are coming.

127
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,645
Yuanyi, follow me.

128
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:46,525
Niaoniao, get changed.

129
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:51,284
Leave these scrolls here.

130
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,244
Something serious happened

131
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,085
yet you can still dress up

132
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:34,005
and make your elders wait for you?

133
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,965
How did I teach you usually?

134
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,684
You used to say

135
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:39,924
relatives from the Dong Family

136
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,284
have nothing to do with me
and there's no need to see them.

137
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:44,604
So, Niaoniao doesn't know

138
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,205
if I should come or not.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
Why do they have nothing to do with you?

140
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,364
You are a daughter of my family.

141
00:08:54,364 --> 00:08:56,724
Why can't you meet your mother's family?

142
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:59,005
Keep quiet.

143
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:00,724
Besides Shaoshang,

144
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:01,724
all of them are older than you.

145
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,244
We didn't even

146
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:04,565
scold Shaoshang for being late.

147
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:06,244
What does it have to do with you?

148
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:09,244
Third Lady is here.

149
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,885
Yangyang is here to greet grandmother.

150
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:24,604
Uncle. Aunt.

151
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,804
(Cheng Yang)

152
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:25,810
Mother.
(Cheng Yang)

153
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,645
Mother.

154
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:35,044
Why are you so late?

155
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,325
Teacher has scheduled a lot of homework

156
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:40,164
so I came late.

157
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:43,684
I'm not praising myself.

158
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:46,164
Although Yangyang
didn't grow up by my side,

159
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:48,164
she knew how to read and write

160
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,085
at her uncle's house.

161
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:52,405
Unlike a certain girl

162
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,244
who only knows how to play

163
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:56,125
without studying.

164
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:59,085
Scolding and beating her
didn't have any effect as well.

165
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:01,284
This is so worrying for us elders.

166
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:05,765
Father. Mother.

167
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:07,845
Niaoniao doesn't like to study.

168
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:11,005
Thanks to Second Aunt
for not forcing me.

169
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:12,885
She also said

170
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,044
a woman

171
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,245
only needs to remember
her husband's name.

172
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,084
There's no use in studying.

173
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,924
There's no need to be good

174
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,284
at studies and martial arts
like my mother.

175
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,084
Stop talking nonsense, Idiot!

176
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,525
If she doesn't study well,

177
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:28,725
do you want

178
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:31,284
to become like my useless brother
who got banished

179
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:32,245
to the borders

180
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:35,485
to become a slave
by His Majesty in the future?

181
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:39,845
My sister doesn't want me anymore!

182
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:42,564
Hurry up. Take me there.

183
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:43,564
Quick.

184
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,005
Cheng Yang.

185
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,125
Why are you hiding?
Let's go and take a look.

186
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:07,245
Let's go.

187
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,964
Brother.

188
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,444
Take care of yourself

189
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:23,564
when you are at the border.

190
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,084
Never ever

191
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,964
commit a crime again.

192
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,645
Brother.

193
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:42,405
Also,

194
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:43,924
all of you

195
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:45,924
shouldn't come here in the future.

196
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,324
Shi needs to get a promotion.

197
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,405
Rules are needed in the house.

198
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,044
We can't allow animals

199
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,964
to roam free in the house
as we do back in the village.

200
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:02,245
My sister doesn't want me anymore!

201
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:05,964
I wonder who did Grandmother learn from

202
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:07,405
since she always rolls on the ground

203
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:08,125
in disagreement.

204
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,725
When did I abandon you?

205
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:11,525
Look.

206
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:13,485
It's in the family.

207
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:16,645
Don't badmouth your elders.

208
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,044
Aunt Yuanyi will punish you again
if she hears you.

209
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,684
You have servants everywhere you go.

210
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,725
When your father was alive,

211
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:26,525
life wasn't as good as this.

212
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:30,444
Why did I let your father down?

213
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,645
But you live a better life than me!

214
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,485
I should live a better life than you!

215
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:46,845
The good life of the Cheng Family

216
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:50,204
was fought for by Cheng Shi.

217
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:52,765
You are a son of the Dong Family.

218
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:55,164
I am a woman of the Cheng Family.

219
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:56,804
Although we are relatives,

220
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,485
we are no longer
worshipping the same ancestors.

221
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:01,645
Do you get it?

222
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:05,444
It is already a huge gesture

223
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:08,125
to have the whole Cheng Family
sending you off today.

224
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:10,125
The whole family?

225
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:17,684
It's you!

226
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:23,324
This is the Cheng's Residence.

227
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,645
You should behave yourself here.

228
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:27,005
Cheng Shi.

229
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,645
I wonder
who this ungrateful person is like.

230
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:32,964
Betraying her relative
at such a young age.

231
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,645
Her ungrateful behaviour
is just like yours.

232
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:39,525
Cheng Shaoshang.

233
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:42,365
No wonder she treats you like that.

234
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,684
Quiet.

235
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:44,845
Fine!

236
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:47,204
Granduncle Dong, what did you say?

237
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,245
How did Grandmother treat me?

238
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,885
My sister told me that day.

239
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:56,725
Yuanyi left this girl.

240
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:58,084
In the future,

241
00:13:58,444 --> 00:14:01,725
she might be hated just like her mother.

242
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:04,164
It's better to abandon her earlier

243
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,164
so we don't waste our rice feeding her.

244
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,044
You...

245
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:10,964
Did you say it before?

246
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:14,044
When did I say such a thing?

247
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,645
Don't accuse me.

248
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:18,204
Is Uncle Dong crazy?

249
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,084
Why is he talking nonsense here?

250
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:23,084
Officer, take him away. Hurry!

251
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:25,684
Oh.

252
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:26,845
And you.

253
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:28,964
You said

254
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:30,405
to raise this girl for a decade

255
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:32,444
and make her useless

256
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,885
so it'll be too late
to change her behaviour in the future.

257
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,284
No. That's not it.

258
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:37,405
Cheng Shaoshang.

259
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:38,804
Now you know

260
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,485
why she didn't teach you
how to read and write, right?

261
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:47,924
The money my nephew sent you
all these years

262
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,164
all went to you!

263
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:50,765
Nonsense!

264
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,405
Stop pretending!

265
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,765
Take him away!

266
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:56,885
Hurry!

267
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,204
The Cheng Family

268
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,044
is heartless!

269
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,324
You abandoned me.

270
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,044
I won't allow you

271
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:07,725
to live your life comfortably here!

272
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,324
Who are you?

273
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,924
Just leave.

274
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:11,845
If you don't leave,

275
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,005
we won't live our life comfortably.

276
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,365
Sister.

277
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,880
What did you swear

278
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:20,485
to our father back then?

279
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:24,725
How can you face Father's soul
after doing that?

280
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:32,204
Have you found any news
about Xu Jinzhong?

281
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:33,245
Young Master.

282
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:33,924
Our men

283
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:36,005
have been keeping watch
outside his house for a few days.

284
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,204
He didn't go home.

285
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:38,444
His whereabouts are still unknown
at the moment.

286
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,405
Does he have any family?

287
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:42,964
He has no wife and children.

288
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:44,125
Let me ask you.

289
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,765
If you want to hide,

290
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,245
where will you choose?

291
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,164
A place you are familiar with
yet is difficult

292
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:53,765
for other people to find, of course.

293
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:54,605
That's right.

294
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,204
When a person is in a crisis,

295
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:59,765
they will usually go to a place
where they are familiar with.

296
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:01,164
That was why Head Armorer Dong

297
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:03,245
went to hide at the house in the village

298
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,684
when he used to

299
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:06,725
live with Old Madam Cheng.

300
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:08,924
Xu Jinzhong has no wife and children.

301
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,765
His hometown is in Feng Yi County.

302
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,164
So, the place he is most familiar with

303
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,885
in this capital

304
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:17,324
besides his home

305
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:21,444
must be a forge.

306
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,365
I'll investigate all the forges
in the capital immediately.

307
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,284
Permitted.

308
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,765
This calamity

309
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:46,845
is finally gone.

310
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:50,324
I almost die from anger.

311
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:01,365
You are stupid as well.

312
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:04,684
How could you use Shi's reward

313
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:06,125
to invest in Ge's fabric store?

314
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:07,525
You lost all your money, right?

315
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:10,605
Thankfully, Shi and Zhi are good.

316
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,645
If I depend on you

317
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,324
I'll have nothing left.

318
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:17,804
Mother.

319
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:19,765
Cheng Zhi sent a letter

320
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,564
and said he will return
to the capital in a few days.

321
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:23,645
He can celebrate New Year at home.

322
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,405
Since we grew up a decade ago,

323
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:27,885
the three of us

324
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,765
can finally reunite with Mother.

325
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:32,804
Finally, we can celebrate it.

326
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:36,405
For all these years,

327
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,924
you siblings have been
going to separate places.

328
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:40,564
My heart

329
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,525
has never been completed.

330
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:44,964
Old Madam.

331
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:47,204
Cheng Zhi and his wife will meet up

332
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,804
with Song and Shaogong at Qing District

333
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:49,845
before coming home together.

334
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:52,365
Besides Yong and his wife at the border

335
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,365
who can't come back,

336
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,485
our family

337
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:57,125
has finally been reunited.

338
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,405
That's right.

339
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,725
You. Tidy up the house.

340
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:03,605
The Cheng Family

341
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:06,365
has never been so lively
for a long time.

342
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,204
Old Madam.

343
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:09,164
Well...

344
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:10,084
How can we

345
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,204
spare so many rooms in an instant?

346
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:13,405
Oh,

347
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:14,684
isn't there

348
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:16,564
a study prepared for Fourth Lady?

349
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,525
I don't think she will use it.

350
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:19,485
Why don't we

351
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:22,485
give two of the rooms to our nephew?

352
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:23,405
I don't think

353
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:25,645
you will mind giving

354
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,084
your room to your brothers, right?

355
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:28,804
But Mother said

356
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:30,765
she wanted me to study every day.

357
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:32,204
What should I do?

358
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:34,684
If you have the intention to study,
you can do it everywhere.

359
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,285
This is just an emergency solution.

360
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,684
You are right.

361
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:40,565
If she really wants to study,

362
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:43,125
she can even do it in the stable.

363
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:44,605
Niaoniao.

364
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,204
Didn't I ask you to study every day?

365
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:48,645
Why aren't you going?

366
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,045
Qingcong.

367
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,325
Supervise Niaoniao.

368
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:53,924
Don't let her eat or sleep
before she finishes studying.

369
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,405
Since you don't oppose the idea,

370
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:59,365
I'll ask someone
to tidy up the study tomorrow.

371
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,924
They are both my beloved grandsons.

372
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:04,565
How can they sleep in a study?

373
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:05,964
You have no son anyway.

374
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:08,524
There aren't many people
in the your family.

375
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:11,045
Why don't you empty the main house

376
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:12,285
and swap with Yuanyi?

377
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,045
No.

378
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:16,924
Old Madam, you know nothing.

379
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:17,924
This...

380
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,164
The main house looks nice

381
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:23,405
but it hasn't been repaired
for a long time and it's humid.

382
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:24,805
It's uninhabitable.

383
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,405
Go and repair it then.

384
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:30,085
You might make it for New Year

385
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:32,724
to welcome my grandsons.

386
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:44,605
If I had to blame something,

387
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,805
it's marrying a useless fool like you.

388
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,524
(Cheng Cheng)

389
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:47,530
You only know
(Cheng Cheng)

390
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,764
You only know

391
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:50,805
how to read books

392
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:53,444
and let a woman like me fight out there.

393
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:56,004
In the Cheng Family,

394
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:59,444
your elder brother
is a general who fights in wars.

395
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,204
Your younger brother
is a knowledgeable official.

396
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,444
You are the only one left
who is useless.

397
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,845
You can't even keep the main house.

398
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,365
Your stupid scrolls!

399
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:12,964
If it can't be used
to exchange for the main house,

400
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:16,645
it's better to burn them.

401
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:17,724
My scrolls.

402
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:19,845
Father!

403
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:21,805
Father.

404
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:22,164
My scrolls.

405
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:24,444
Father, be careful. Calm down.
Let me do it.

406
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:25,325
Let me do it.

407
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,045
Careful.

408
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,204
Careful.

409
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:29,164
Careful.

410
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:31,125
Are you all right?

411
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,285
I'm fine.

412
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,605
The main house
should belong to the eldest son.

413
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,325
It's just that Cheng Shi
has always been fighting out there

414
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:46,244
so we occupied the main house.

415
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:47,885
It is only right

416
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:49,724
for us to return it.

417
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:51,045
Nonsense!

418
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,164
It has been two hours.

419
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:10,325
Have you memorised
the first ten lines of the Jijiupian?

420
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:17,444
Mother.

421
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,085
I'm hungry.

422
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:22,524
I don't have the energy
to study anymore.

423
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,924
I think your mind works better

424
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,164
when you starve.

425
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,885
There's no rush in studying.

426
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:33,204
Come, Niaoniao. Eat something.

427
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:34,524
Eat it.

428
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,405
Memorise five more lines
for every piece you eat.

429
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:42,045
Yuanyi.

430
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:44,565
Niaoniao has suffered for so long.

431
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:47,684
Are you being too strict on Niaoniao?

432
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:50,285
If you think

433
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,045
I'm being too strict on her,

434
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:53,885
I won't become a bad person.

435
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:55,964
Next time, you can teach her yourself.

436
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:00,125
Your mother is right.

437
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:01,724
They say

438
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:03,325
a kind mother spoils a child.

439
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:04,805
Strict teachers produce great students.

440
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,724
Learn from your mother.

441
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,285
You will definitely be successful
in the future.

442
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,444
I won't disturb you anymore.

443
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,565
Take away the snacks.

444
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:28,764
Since Cheng Shi left you here
to take care of your mother,

445
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,004
he should give us something at least.

446
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:33,365
If it wasn't for your health,

447
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:35,924
Yangyang won't be a daughter.

448
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,244
For more than 20 years,

449
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:40,244
I can't stand proud

450
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:42,845
in front of your mother

451
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:44,565
because I have no son!

452
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:47,125
I wanted to be Yao's stepmother

453
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:49,365
but Fourth Lady spoiled my plan.

454
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:50,924
Just great.

455
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:53,325
I don't have a son

456
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,924
and I even lost the house.

457
00:22:56,085 --> 00:23:00,045
How can you still say
his wife is not bullying me?

458
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:00,885
Actually,

459
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:03,405
the side house is not bad.

460
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:04,964
Father can study quietly

461
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:06,531
in the side house.

462
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,724
Shut up.

463
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:11,004
Do you think I don't know?

464
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:13,484
Whenever I didn't feed Shaoshang,

465
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:16,204
you were the one who feed her.

466
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:18,365
That was why I couldn't control her.

467
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:21,365
You are really an incompetent

468
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:23,645
betrayer!

469
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:28,724
Look at the both of you.

470
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:32,885
A coward and a weakling.

471
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:37,045
Why do I meet
a pair of father and daughter like you?

472
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:40,244
I'd rather give birth to

473
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:43,605
the black-hearted Shaoshang.

474
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:52,004
When I didn't listen to Second Aunt,

475
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,565
she won't give me any food.

476
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,004
When I was starving,

477
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:58,805
I'd listen to her no matter what.

478
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:01,845
I didn't expect

479
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:04,365
to still starve

480
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:06,444
when I return to Mother's side.

481
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:10,805
If you don't like studying,

482
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:12,805
what do you want to do?

483
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:14,845
I want to know

484
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,484
how they build the buildings so tall,

485
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:19,885
how a cart can move at a long distance

486
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:21,524
and why crops can be planted
on a plot of land.

487
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:22,684
I also want to see

488
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:24,285
the true nature of the world.

489
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:25,924
It's not too late

490
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:27,805
to study these theories and principles

491
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:29,524
when I've seen the world.

492
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,285
Stop using beautiful words

493
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:32,524
to cover your obvious playful nature.

494
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,405
You don't want
to study theories and principles

495
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:36,085
because you are immoral.

496
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:37,924
You don't want to listen to anyone

497
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,285
because of your personality
to take revenge on a trivial matter.

498
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:43,365
Do you think
I don't know what you are scheming?

499
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,845
Besides accusing your Granduncle Dong,

500
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:47,365
you also threatened your grandmother

501
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:49,805
and accused Second Aunt behind her back.

502
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:53,125
I don't agree with what they have
been doing for the last few years.

503
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:54,885
I did a good thing

504
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:57,244
for the Cheng Family by accusing them.

505
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,325
How am I wrong?

506
00:24:58,325 --> 00:24:59,885
You are wrong because you are young

507
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,085
and doesn't know the consequences
of your actions.

508
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,885
You actually think that a matter
of the imperial court is trivial?

509
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:07,444
You almost harmed the Cheng Family

510
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:08,845
and thought you were smart.

511
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:10,724
If I don't educate you well,

512
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:11,885
you will soon

513
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,565
cause huge trouble
that affects the whole family one day.

514
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,365
Just study.

515
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,885
You won't retort even if
you're bullied to this extent?

516
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:37,764
If I didn't retort,

517
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,565
I'd be badly bullied.

518
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,244
Do you want me to learn from you?

519
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,125
Enduring for

520
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:50,285
more than a decade for your pride.

521
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,484
Now, even the main house
has been snatched by Second Aunt.

522
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,325
Stop pretending to be virtuous.

523
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:04,845
No.

524
00:26:06,484 --> 00:26:07,845
With Mother's temper,

525
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:11,645
how could she allow Second Aunt
to bully her?

526
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,244
Second Aunt.

527
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:21,805
Are you asleep?

528
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:48,125
Why are you here?

529
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:52,405
I'm here to take a look at
the house I'll be staying at.

530
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:54,484
Shaoshang.

531
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:56,764
Don't think you have support

532
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:58,004
now that your parents are back.

533
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:00,565
How dare you come here
to laugh at your elders.

534
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:02,204
Have you checked

535
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:04,724
whether your mother
is standing on the same side as you

536
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:06,004
and will fight for you?

537
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:09,924
Second Aunt.

538
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,484
Seems like you know many trivial things

539
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:14,244
about me and Mother.

540
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,085
That's right.

541
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,565
I did send people to investigate you.

542
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:19,964
I just want to see

543
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:22,045
how deep your relationship is

544
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,645
after you reunite with your mother.

545
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,405
Looking at the situation now,

546
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:28,405
your relationship with your mother

547
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:30,924
isn't as deep as I thought.

548
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:34,365
Since Second Aunt already knows that,

549
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:37,085
there's no need for me to hide anymore.

550
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,204
Do you want to continue
staying in the main house?

551
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:44,244
What are you scheming now?

552
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:45,524
Where did that come from?

553
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:49,004
My mother came back
from the battlefield.

554
00:27:49,645 --> 00:27:51,004
If you fight fire with fire,

555
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:52,885
I'm sure you will lose.

556
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:55,924
Second Aunt,

557
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:56,764
but if you

558
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:59,645
use an offspring
to persuade Grandmother,

559
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:01,764
no one can guarantee

560
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,805
that you won't have

561
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:04,325
Grandmother's grandson in the future,
Second Aunt.

562
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:12,805
Shaoshang.

563
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,085
Do I need you to remind me?

564
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,524
Why are you being nice

565
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,605
and side with me to oppose your mother?

566
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,645
Are you here to set me up?

567
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:27,004
Why should I set you up?

568
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,244
I'm sure you know.

569
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:29,724
As long as my mother isn't happy,

570
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:30,964
I'll be happy.

571
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,004
Second Aunt,

572
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:37,085
it's getting late.

573
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:38,405
I'll be going back.

574
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:40,204
You should rest early, Second Aunt.

575
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:48,285
Only both of us

576
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:50,045
know about this.

577
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,724
This little jerk.

578
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:21,405
At least my effort raising her
didn't go to waste.

579
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:23,605
I finally nurtured a good child

580
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,444
for Yuanyi.

581
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:34,684
How are you, Old Madam?

582
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,085
Has the house been tidied up?

583
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,365
Old Madam.

584
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:50,805
Yuanyi said
she didn't want to trouble us

585
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:53,365
so they could just live in the backyard.

586
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:56,924
I was forced to stay in the main house.

587
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:58,524
Now, they say

588
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:00,964
the nephews are coming back.

589
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:02,924
With so little time,

590
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:05,645
how can I empty the house?

591
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:08,645
Did you believe her words easily?

592
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:12,204
Shi is the master of the Cheng Family.

593
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:14,004
If you won't move out of the main house,

594
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,444
won't other people tease us
for not following customs?

595
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:20,164
It's not that
I'm not willing to move out.

596
00:30:20,524 --> 00:30:22,125
I've asked the Old Fairy.

597
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:23,805
The Old Fairy said

598
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,244
this main house

599
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:26,885
is good for childbirth.

600
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,045
When Yuanyi stayed there,

601
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:31,805
she had so many children.

602
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:34,204
She gave birth to three sons.

603
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:37,645
You've been staying there for years
but you still don't have a son.

604
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:45,645
Yes.

605
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:49,684
I'm not as good at giving birth
compared to Yuanyi.

606
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:51,524
I hope Old Madam

607
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,805
can pity Cheng Cheng

608
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:55,524
at least.

609
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:59,085
He still has no son after the age of 30.

610
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:02,405
Naturally, Cheng Shi

611
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,605
doesn't believe in superstitions

612
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,924
because he has many sons.

613
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:11,125
For unfortunate people like us,

614
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:12,645
it is better

615
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,244
to believe in superstition

616
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:17,365
than nothing at all, Old Madam.

617
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,484
What's wrong with having many sons?

618
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:21,605
Shi only has three sons.

619
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:22,805
I don't mind having more.

620
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:27,004
The Old Fairy's message
might not be right.

621
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,724
If I didn't believe him,

622
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:31,805
I wouldn't have left Niaoniao here

623
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:34,724
with no one to educate her.

624
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:36,885
How is he not accurate in his foresight?

625
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,085
My body recovered

626
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:41,045
all thanks to the Old Fairy.

627
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:41,885
Yes.

628
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:44,724
I think what the Old Fairy said
made sense.

629
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,004
Since

630
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,004
the main house is good for childbirth,

631
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:49,845
You may

632
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:52,565
stay in the main house.

633
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,444
Yes.

634
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:55,565
Old Madam.

635
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:57,125
Does it mean Sister-in-law

636
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:59,524
can stay there forever

637
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:02,085
as long as she doesn't
give birth to a son?

638
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:03,125
Of course.

639
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:04,885
The son is the most important thing.

640
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:07,045
Old Madam.

641
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:09,484
I'll swear an oath today.

642
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,885
If I don't give birth to a son
for the Cheng Family,

643
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:13,764
I won't move out of this place.

644
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:39,125
Yuanyi.

645
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:43,724
No one can argue with
Old Madam's decision.

646
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:46,645
Having a son is
the most important thing in the world.

647
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:49,365
I have no choice
but to trouble your family again

648
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,164
to stay in the backyard.

649
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:52,605
I hope you don't

650
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,444
regret it in the future.

651
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,524
I knew you were competitive.

652
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:00,645
Today, I've finally witnessed it.

653
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:02,444
Women like us

654
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:04,605
should know when to back down.

655
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:07,164
If it wasn't you
who forced Niaoniao too much,

656
00:33:07,244 --> 00:33:10,365
she wouldn't have given me the idea

657
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:11,805
to fight with you for the main house.

658
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:16,805
What does this have to do with Niaoniao?

659
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,924
Niaoniao is average.

660
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:21,085
Even if you rush her education,

661
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:22,325
she still won't be successful.

662
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:24,045
You might as well let her be.

663
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:25,444
In my opinion,

664
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:27,964
raising a daughter
is different from raising an army.

665
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,484
You can't be rash.

666
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:31,164
You need to teach
according to the material.

667
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:33,045
Yangyang is good at studying.

668
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:35,244
She can learn theories and principles.

669
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:36,805
Niaoniao is good at making arguments.

670
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,004
She needs to be taught
some underhanded tricks.

671
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:40,805
Of course,

672
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,605
Niaoniao is not my daughter.

673
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:45,885
Why do I care?

674
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:47,244
Even if I care,

675
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:48,964
do you think I can replace you

676
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:51,524
and be better than you,
the biological mother?

677
00:34:17,204 --> 00:34:18,484
Young Lady, what are you doing?

678
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:23,125
Mother punished me to make book copies.

679
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:24,365
I'm modifying the brush.

680
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:26,164
When it is done,

681
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:27,605
I can write three characters at once.

682
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:28,764
Isn't it amazing?

683
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:34,325
See?

684
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:36,405
Try it.

685
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:39,524
I have another one.

686
00:34:42,004 --> 00:34:44,164
It can really write
three characters at once.

687
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:45,724
Young Lady is so smart.

688
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:47,885
I'm afraid she made a mistake
by being too smart.

689
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:54,565
Why are you in a panic?

690
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,004
Leave. I have something to say
to Niaoniao.

691
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,645
Aren't you leaving?

692
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,524
Yes.

693
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:09,125
Yesterday night,
did you find Second Aunt

694
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,285
to teach her
how to stay in the main house?

695
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:19,484
Since we will be moving
to the new residence,

696
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,125
we should just leave
the old main house to her.

697
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:25,204
How do you know

698
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,125
we'll be moving to the new residence?

699
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,004
When Second Aunt forcibly occupied
the main house,

700
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:35,924
Mother did not oppose it.

701
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:38,045
With Mother's personality,

702
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,004
you wouldn't have compromised easily.

703
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:41,524
I'm guessing

704
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,524
that Mother knew you have
no use for the main house

705
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,765
so you abandoned it.

706
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:47,205
Besides,

707
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,805
Father came back
with Mr. Wan with a victory.

708
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:51,845
The imperial court's reward
has yet to arrive.

709
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:53,484
According to the number of days passed,

710
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:55,924
I think it's almost time.

711
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:02,165
Your Second Aunt and I

712
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,805
has a grudge between elders

713
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:05,885
for a long time.

714
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:07,044
There's no need for you to get involved.

715
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:10,484
Mother isn't the only one
who has a grudge against her.

716
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:13,604
They bullied me and humiliated me

717
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,124
but Mother turned a blind eye.

718
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,285
I just let them have a taste

719
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:19,524
of their own medicine.

720
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:20,964
Why can't you accept this, Mother?

721
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,765
When your father and I weren't home,

722
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:24,124
we didn't teach you

723
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,044
and let Ge nurture you

724
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:27,444
into a reckless child.

725
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:29,765
We didn't do our responsibility
as your parents.

726
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,685
I can forgive you

727
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:33,285
for pretending to be sick

728
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:35,004
or accusing your elders.

729
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:36,685
This is the last time I'll forgive you.

730
00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:39,124
I won't forgive you easily
if you do something like that again.

731
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,004
Take care of your behaviour.

732
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:44,124
Bring it here.

733
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:49,484
Bring it here.

734
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:57,845
Where's the other one?

735
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:04,165
Study well.

736
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:10,845
Take care of my behaviour.

737
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:16,245
Take care of my behaviour.

738
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:27,004
Cheng Shi. Xiao Yuanyi.
Heed the royal decree.

739
00:37:34,845 --> 00:37:34,860
His Majesty's order
for Colonel Cheng Shi.

740
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,285
(Cheng's Residence)
His Majesty's order for Colonel Cheng Shi.

741
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:37,300
(Cheng's Residence)

742
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:41,564
I heard you have contributed
to the empire and should be rewarded.

743
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:46,044
Cheng Shi is filial and
has achieved brilliant victories in war.

744
00:37:46,325 --> 00:37:50,285
You will be granted the title
of Marquis in charge of Quling.

745
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:54,285
You'll be awarded tax from 500 families
to commend your achievements.

746
00:37:54,685 --> 00:37:57,044
I accept His Majesty's grace.

747
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,245
(Cheng's Residence)

748
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:04,260
Marquis Quling, please stand.
(Cheng's Residence)

749
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,564
Marquis Quling, please stand.

750
00:38:09,444 --> 00:38:10,444
Marquis Quling.

751
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:12,405
Congratulations.

752
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:15,644
Thank you, Attendant.

753
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,920
Hubby.

754
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,760
(Late Father of the Cheng Family,
Cheng Yi's Memorial Tablet)

755
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:30,604
Hubby, you've blessed us.

756
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,044
Shi has finally achieved something.

757
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:38,205
He became a general
and got the title of Marquis.

758
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:42,644
What an auspicious event!

759
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:43,604
Old Madam.

760
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:45,524
That's not all.

761
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,124
Apparently,

762
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:50,165
His Majesty also rewarded Cheng Shi
with many plots of land.

763
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:53,325
Cheng Shi, you made our family proud.

764
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,725
We are very happy for you as well.

765
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:57,845
Why aren't you going back to the room

766
00:38:57,845 --> 00:38:58,964
after hearing the royal decree?

767
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:00,604
Once you catch a cold,

768
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:02,604
Old Madam will have to
worry about you again.

769
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:05,964
Your wife is right.

770
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:09,845
Cheng.

771
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,760
If you are half as successful
as Shi and Zhi,

772
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:16,124
I can die and go
and meet your father with relief.

773
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,604
Mother,

774
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:18,765
among the three of us,

775
00:39:18,885 --> 00:39:20,524
the person who did the most

776
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:22,845
in caring for the family is Cheng.

777
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:24,484
How could you say
that he hasn't achieved anything?

778
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:26,484
Cheng.

779
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:28,285
You like to read books.

780
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,604
His Majesty has awarded me many books.

781
00:39:30,924 --> 00:39:31,805
Go and have a look.

782
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:33,124
See if there are any books you like.

783
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:35,524
Thank you, Cheng Shi.

784
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,084
Shi.

785
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,725
You gave your second brother books

786
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,165
because he was filial in your place.

787
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:44,165
My son,

788
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:47,444
I raised you up
since you were an infant.

789
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:48,765
Shouldn't you

790
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,084
(Late Father of the Cheng Family,
Cheng Yi's Memorial Tablet)

791
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,564
leave some reward for me?

792
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:54,805
Of course, I won't forget you, Mother.

793
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,924
All the jewellery belongs to you.

794
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:04,644
My son!

795
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,725
Tell me.

796
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:08,964
What did His Majesty award you?

797
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:10,885
There are many.

798
00:40:11,084 --> 00:40:12,365
Those treasures.

799
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:14,405
I've never even heard of some of them

800
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:17,205
let alone seen them.

801
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:20,245
Cartloads of them went past me.

802
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:23,044
I couldn't even see what they are.

803
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:24,084
Stop talking.

804
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:26,124
Stop talking.

805
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,685
Show me.

806
00:40:28,685 --> 00:40:29,444
Sure.

807
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:31,205
This is nothing.

808
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:34,124
I also heard His Majesty

809
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:37,325
gave a big house
to General Wan as a reward.

810
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:39,205
Is that...

811
00:40:41,245 --> 00:40:41,845
Exactly.

812
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:43,044
Wan told me

813
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:46,004
he will give his current house to us.

814
00:40:46,765 --> 00:40:47,524
Mother.

815
00:40:47,524 --> 00:40:49,564
You will be staying

816
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:50,805
where Madam Wan is staying now.

817
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:53,964
Yuanyi and I will stay
in General Wan's current house.

818
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:55,765
Great!

819
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,564
(Late Father of the Cheng Family,
Cheng Yi's Memorial Tablet)

820
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,325
I already fell in love

821
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,685
with Wan's residence when I visited.

822
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:03,484
I didn't expect

823
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:05,885
we get to stay there one day.

824
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:07,725
Ge, you don't have to go there.

825
00:41:08,964 --> 00:41:10,004
Didn't you say

826
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:11,644
you will stay in the main house

827
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,885
until the day you give birth to a son?

828
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,644
Since the main house is good for you,

829
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:17,885
you have to stay there
until the day you die.

830
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:19,285
Don't worry.

831
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,325
No one will disturb you.

832
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:24,405
Even Cheng will be staying
at the new residence with us.

833
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,004
He will not disturb you at all.

834
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:29,845
Old Madam.

835
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:32,725
Old Madam,
you need to make a decision for me.

836
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:34,444
What decision?

837
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:38,644
Isn't this what you wanted,
Sister-in-law?

838
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:40,245
The decision

839
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:42,604
was made by the Old Fairy.

840
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:43,725
Don't forget.

841
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:46,165
You swore an oath
in front of the Old Fairy.

842
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:48,044
Right, Old Madam?

843
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:49,964
Yes.

844
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:51,004
What?

845
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:52,245
We need to take a look at the treasures.

846
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:53,044
Yes.

847
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:56,405
We need to see
what treasures His Majesty rewarded us.

848
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:59,044
Come, Cheng. Let me show you.

849
00:42:00,004 --> 00:42:00,845
Cheng Shi.

850
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:02,285
Thank you, Cheng Shi.

851
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:03,165
Come.

852
00:42:03,165 --> 00:42:04,725
See if there's anything you like.

853
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:06,165
Tell me.

854
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:08,564
What scrolls did His Majesty reward us?

855
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:10,165
Come. Let's go together.

856
00:42:11,124 --> 00:42:11,685
Let's go.

857
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:21,644
