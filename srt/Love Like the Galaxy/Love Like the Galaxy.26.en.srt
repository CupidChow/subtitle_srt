3
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,207
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:01:58,687 --> 00:01:59,607
I'm sure

5
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,968
you've heard of my betrothal

6
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,448
with Lady Cheng.

7
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:06,127
On the day of my wedding,

8
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:08,368
I hope all of you

9
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,687
can attend.

10
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,248
-Congratulations, General Ling.
-Congratulations, General Ling.

11
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:28,687
Ladies,

12
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,007
you all can ask all of your questions

13
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:34,207
at once

14
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,087
if you have any about our wedding.

15
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,527
-No.
-No.

16
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,808
Please don't put my wife on the spot.

17
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,207
General Ling and Lady Cheng,

18
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,047
they're...

19
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,167
They're a match made in heaven.

20
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,487
They're a perfect couple.

21
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:55,928
That's right.

22
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,047
Why are you keeping quiet?

23
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:13,968
There's nothing for me to say.

24
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,448
We will still be bullied

25
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,968
no matter what we say, right?

26
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,567
But it's obvious that he was
speaking up for you.

27
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:24,728
Are you upset about it?

28
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,248
I don't know why,

29
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,888
but I can't bring myself to be happy.

30
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,007
Why are you keeping quiet?

31
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,408
Does it even matter?

32
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:02,567
No matter how much I say,

33
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,328
it'll never be impactful as your words.

34
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,047
If that's the case,

35
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:09,567
there's no need for me to speak.

36
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:10,968
You...

37
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:15,808
What are you trying to say here?

38
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:19,328
Today,

39
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,848
I've finally seen how it's like
to deal with powerful figures.

40
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:29,288
Qiqi had a rough time defending us.

41
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,047
I'm sure Mother

42
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:36,328
had also tried her best
to tolerate them.

43
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,328
Even so, those noble ladies

44
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:39,808
were still unwilling

45
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,607
to let us off.

46
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:44,768
But when you're here,

47
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,728
you made them shut up
with just a few words.

48
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:52,328
You don't even need to speak much.

49
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:54,928
You just need to give them hints

50
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:58,448
and they'll obey your command.

51
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:04,567
Don't you like power?

52
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,768
That's your power,

53
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:07,848
not mine.

54
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,047
Do you know why I can use your power?

55
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,487
It's because
I'll be married to you soon.

56
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,928
I'll give birth to your children

57
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,808
and provide you with a comfortable life.

58
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,007
That's how I'm able to use your power,

59
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,047
am I right?

60
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,567
Husband and wife are a single entity.

61
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:29,808
What's mine will be yours

62
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,248
after we get married.

63
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:33,607
Is there

64
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:36,527
any problem with that?

65
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,127
No.

66
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,728
I just love to overthink it.

67
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:46,928
You see,

68
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,328
I'm someone who likes

69
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:52,047
to follow my own will.

70
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,288
However, if I do get married to you,

71
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,768
I'll have to live
by your rules in the future.

72
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:01,207
By then,

73
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,288
I will cease to be Cheng Shaoshang like before.

74
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:19,487
It's too late.

75
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,527
You'll suffer from indigestion

76
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:24,248
if you eat too much before sleeping.

77
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:26,687
I never had food after noon

78
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,687
when I was on the battlefield.

79
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:30,567
We stay alert when we're hungry.

80
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,207
If we eat too much,

81
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:34,848
we'll lose the will to fight.

82
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,087
General Ling,

83
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,087
I know you don't like to discuss
your orders with other people

84
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:41,487
when you're in the military camp.

85
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,448
However, I'm used to living
an unrestrained life.

86
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:45,968
I hate it when people try to control me,

87
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,768
even if it's for my sake.

88
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:50,448
If you wish to marry me,

89
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:52,408
you have to bear with my temperament.

90
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,047
I'm already trying to initiate
a discussion with you.

91
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,007
Shaoshang,

92
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,207
I've already told you

93
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:06,647
my reason.

94
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,288
You can just give me a reason

95
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:11,448
you have to consume this flatbread

96
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:14,087
even though it's bad for your health.

97
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:14,968
General Ling,

98
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:16,567
not everything in this world

99
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:18,687
can be measured with reason,

100
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:20,728
just like how you proposed to me

101
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,728
without any reason.

102
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:25,448
There's no reason behind it.

103
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,928
Young Master, Western Village
has an emergency to report.

104
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,047
Send Lady Cheng back
to her residence for now.

105
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:43,728
Yes, Young Master.

106
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:49,448
Depart.

107
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:03,888
Han Wu said

108
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:05,047
he would definitely
return in three days.

109
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,888
However, he hasn't returned yet

110
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:07,928
even after we waited for him
until midnight yesterday.

111
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:09,848
I was worried about his safety,

112
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,248
therefore, I sent my men
to investigate the situation.

113
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,328
And, we discovered many
suspicious individuals.

114
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:14,808
I suspect

115
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,968
that Han Wu was killed.

116
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,688
The messenger of Huo Army
would definitely

117
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,728
leave a note behind
if they were in danger.

118
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,447
We need to make a trip
to Western Village.

119
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:28,728
But Young Master,

120
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:30,728
we need to deliver the dowries
to the Cheng Family tomorrow.

121
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:32,327
I will act accordingly.

122
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:44,087
All right.

123
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,367
Move all these things

124
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:47,768
to the backyard.

125
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,447
Free up the front yard for me.

126
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:51,287
I need to use it.

127
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:52,568
Yes, Old Madam.

128
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,888
Be careful. Don't damage them.

129
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:00,087
Slowly.

130
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,688
That's my dowry.

131
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:05,247
Yes, slowly.

132
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:06,207
Old Madam,

133
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,768
what are you doing?

134
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:10,528
Yuanyi,

135
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,327
you and Shi conquered Gu City

136
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,007
just when Niaoniao was born.

137
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:20,968
Niaoniao was born with good luck.

138
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:23,287
She was a fortunate child.

139
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,928
Now, no ladies in the capital

140
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:27,808
can compete with Niaoniao.

141
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,367
The Ling Family is sending
a marriage proposal to her

142
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:36,488
right after the Lou Family rejected her.

143
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:40,568
I've inquired about it.

144
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,928
Ling Buyi was raised by His Majesty.

145
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,808
His Majesty treats him like his own son.

146
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:48,728
If Niaoniao gets married to him,

147
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,688
she'll become a noble consort.

148
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:54,888
Old Madam.

149
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,007
Old Madam!

150
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:57,728
You must mind your words.

151
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,688
You'll get the Cheng Family
in trouble if you say that.

152
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:03,568
I know that.

153
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,648
The Ling Family is renowned.

154
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:11,047
I'm sure the dowries they send will
be more valuable than the Lou Family's.

155
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:12,528
Back then,

156
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,127
the dowries that the Lou Family had sent

157
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,407
filled up half of our front yard.

158
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,728
If so, I'm sure the dowries
that the Ling Family is sending

159
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:22,007
will fill up the entire courtyard.

160
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,167
That's why I have to make
early preparations

161
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:27,207
and free up some space in the front yard

162
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,367
so that we won't need
to store the dowries

163
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,367
in your storeroom.

164
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:31,728
Old Madam,

165
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:33,488
this marriage isn't confirmed yet.

166
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,407
The Ling Family hasn't sent someone

167
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,087
to exchange their engagement cards yet.

168
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:40,207
If they're not coming,
you should go there personally.

169
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,247
If you think
it's too embarrassing for you,

170
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:43,327
you can tell me.

171
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,087
I'll pay them a visit personally.

172
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,768
You're so pedantic.
No need to care about these trivial things.

173
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,808
Haven't you learned your lesson
from the Lou Family yet?

174
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:53,768
The earlier they send the dowries,
the better it is.

175
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:54,528
You...

176
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,287
What I meant was,

177
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:02,407
the earlier you confirm the marriage,
the better it is.

178
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:05,808
Old Madam, Madam,

179
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,568
the housekeeper of the Ling Family said

180
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,167
their madam was feeling unwell.

181
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:10,728
That's why they couldn't
send the dowries on time.

182
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:11,768
Please forgive them.

183
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:13,768
She's feeling unwell?

184
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:15,327
What does she mean by that?

185
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,888
How could she fall sick all of a sudden?

186
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:19,808
What should I do about this then?

187
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,768
I've already freed up space
in my front yard.

188
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:23,087
Look at them.

189
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:24,608
Yuanyi,

190
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:26,247
since our in-law is sick,

191
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,247
we should pay her a visit
with some medicine.

192
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,127
The housekeeper also

193
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,407
told us to stay away as they do not

194
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,287
want to spread the disease
to their in-laws.

195
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:39,528
Marquis Chengyang and his family

196
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,007
are too much.

197
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,247
This is bad.

198
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:50,768
This is very bad.

199
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:54,167
Seems like

200
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:59,327
Niaoniao's wedding will go south again.

201
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:08,447
My dowries!

202
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:27,087
It's all because I fell sick
at the wrong timing.

203
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,928
We can only discuss the marriage
with Marquis Quling

204
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:30,688
after I recover.

205
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:33,768
If not, I'll be a heinous sinner

206
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:36,688
if all of them fall sick because of me.

207
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,528
Lady Cheng is a jinx indeed.

208
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,207
She made her future mother-in-law sick

209
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:42,768
right before she got
married into the family.

210
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:44,407
No one dares

211
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,447
to ask for her hand in the future.

212
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:47,367
That's right.

213
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,367
Your Highness, not everyone

214
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,447
has a noble life like yours.

215
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,528
This marriage was
arranged by His Majesty.

216
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:57,407
Madam, I know
you have no way to reject it.

217
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,648
You and I suffer the same fate.

218
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:02,928
Don't worry.

219
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,928
The wedding doesn't count as long as
they haven't sent the dowries

220
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:08,207
and exchanged their engagement cards.

221
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:09,888
Tomorrow, I shall head to the palace

222
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,407
and reason with His Majesty.

223
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,688
Since Lady Cheng could
cancel her first wedding,

224
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:17,888
naturally, she could do it again.

225
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,367
Your Highness, Lady Ruyang,

226
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,447
I heard that General Ling
sent his men to the palace

227
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:29,968
and said that he was fatherless
and his mother was sick.

228
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,167
He requested His Majesty

229
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,968
to hold the marriage for him
and Lady Cheng.

230
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:34,888
His Majesty had already agreed to it.

231
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,207
He said

232
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:37,848
His Majesty would send
Old Master as their protocol officer

233
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:38,968
and deliver the dowries
to Cheng's Residence.

234
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:39,688
What?

235
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,407
Zisheng is actually ignoring the customs
because of Lady Cheng?

236
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:44,848
What do you mean by Old Master?

237
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,608
How many Old Masters are there?

238
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,568
It's Grandfather!

239
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:53,928
Why are you crying?

240
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,888
We should cry
if the protocol officer is anyone else.

241
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:59,688
Your grandfather is still on our side.

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,800
(Lord Ruyang)

243
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,087
(Lord Ruyang)
You shrew!

244
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:20,047
How dare you disrespect the deities?

245
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:21,327
Listen up.

246
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,047
You better don't be
too full of yourself.

247
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:24,648
Tomorrow, I shall report you
to His Majesty

248
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:26,688
and divorce you!

249
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:28,127
You!

250
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,287
You actually called me a shrew?

251
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:33,407
You were the one being too full
of yourself after becoming a lord!

252
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:34,648
Back then, I followed you

253
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,367
to the mountains and into the fields.

254
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:37,528
We barely had enough to fill our stomach

255
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,808
and suffered for so long.

256
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,287
How could I provide enough

257
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,928
for you and His Majesty
without being a shrew?

258
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,928
I've seen all the embarrassing sides

259
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:46,287
of the officials in the court.

260
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:47,848
I was the one

261
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,928
who raised His Majesty

262
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:51,367
by being thrifty!

263
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,127
My contributions should be appreciated.

264
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:57,528
So, you plan to burn your bridges

265
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,087
and try to bully me, huh?

266
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:00,728
You!

267
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,768
You're utterly conscienceless!

268
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:06,207
Do you want us to die here?

269
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:07,528
You better mind your words.

270
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,568
You should've reprimanded me alone.

271
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,608
How could you reprimand
His Majesty as well?

272
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,247
Grandmother,

273
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:16,447
why are you putting
Grandfather on the spot?

274
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:19,488
His Majesty had ordered him to deliver
the dowries on Zisheng's behalf.

275
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,808
How could Grandfather
defy His Majesty's order?

276
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:25,247
It's all because I was born unlucky!

277
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,608
I'm not fated to be together
with Zisheng!

278
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,047
Why don't you

279
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,207
just let me stay in Sancai Temple

280
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,247
and serve the deities?

281
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,047
Wen Daniu,

282
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:38,207
our children are already dead!

283
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:40,968
And now, our granddaughter
has finally grown up.

284
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,488
If she

285
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,007
becomes a nun today,

286
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,488
I'll...

287
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:48,407
I'll die with you in Sancai Temple!

288
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,047
Enough.

289
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:52,808
You shouldn't kill yourself.
And you should stop crying.

290
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,728
I'll look for Cheng Shaoshang tomorrow

291
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,888
and interrupt Ling Buyi's wedding.
What do you think?

292
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:01,928
If so, Grandfather,

293
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,688
we're counting on you tomorrow.

294
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:10,928
I was tricked.

295
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:15,888
Ling Buyi isn't here?

296
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:19,568
Young Lady,

297
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,007
don't be sad.

298
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,808
Although General Ling isn't here,

299
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,848
he had sent the renowned Lord Ruyang

300
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:26,007
to deliver the dowries to you.

301
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:27,568
It's something for you to be proud of.

302
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:28,888
Now,

303
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,688
everyone in the capital is envious

304
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:32,648
that you have received
plenty of dowries.

305
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:33,648
Envious of what?

306
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,127
Are they envious that
I cannot do anything about my wedding?

307
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,488
Go and help them out.

308
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:45,367
Just forget about me.

309
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,808
Yes, Young Lady.

310
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:10,688
Young girl,

311
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:12,488
be gentle.

312
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:14,447
My ears are going deaf.

313
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,047
Did the table offend you?

314
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,087
I'm just like this table.

315
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:27,968
Anyone can step all over my head.

316
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:30,688
I have no power

317
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:32,447
to resist at all.

318
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,608
You're still so young.

319
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,808
Why are you complaining like a hag?

320
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:41,728
Young girl, let me ask you something.

321
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,287
Where is Cheng Shaoshang?

322
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,007
My granddaughter cried last night

323
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,968
because that girl
stole her husband-to-be.

324
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:52,367
I just want to ask her

325
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:54,848
why she wants to climb up
the ranks by using General Ling.

326
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,207
Both General Ling and
Cheng Shaoshang are humans.

327
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,167
What do you mean by
climbing up the ranks?

328
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:16,367
Everyone in the capital is saying

329
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,848
that I'm climbing up the ranks

330
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:20,528
by getting married to Ling Buyi.

331
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:22,848
But no one knew

332
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:25,287
that I, Cheng Shaoshang,

333
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,207
don't care about
the inequality in status at all.

334
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,167
Lord Ruyang,

335
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:37,728
could it be that you're here

336
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:40,087
to ruin my marriage?

337
00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:44,568
I'm the Emperor's uncle.

338
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:46,848
How could I commit
such a despicable deed?

339
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:51,087
So, you're Lady Cheng?

340
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:56,808
I thought the savior

341
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:00,247
who was only second to the Emperor
has finally come to rescue me.

342
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,728
So, you knew about my identity long ago?

343
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,648
Only Lord Ruyang, who's here
to deliver the dowries,

344
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:14,327
can enter and exit Marquis
Quling's Residence at will.

345
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,167
You're pretty bold, aren't you?

346
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:20,247
Even so, you still talked back to me?

347
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,247
That is how I am.

348
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:24,688
I have no courtesy at all.

349
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,608
Lord Ruyang, if you dislike me,

350
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:31,407
why don't you cancel this marriage
on Ling Zisheng's behalf?

351
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:36,207
Do you know how many girls
fancy Ling Zisheng?

352
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,848
But now, why do I feel like

353
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,207
you're asking me

354
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,247
to ruin the marriage for you?

355
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:45,047
He and I had different ranks
from the start.

356
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:46,728
In my heart,

357
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:49,327
if we could not respect
each other as equals,

358
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:51,407
I would rather stay single.

359
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:56,247
Do you know that people are classified
into different ranks and status?

360
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:00,047
Even if you're someone else's wife,

361
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,728
it doesn't necessarily mean
your husband will treat you as an equal.

362
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,848
I've been married

363
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:07,447
with that old woman for 50 years.

364
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:09,568
Even so, we do not speak much.

365
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,848
We don't show
any respect for each other.

366
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:15,648
However,

367
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,528
I've been cultivating my personality
for many years

368
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:20,808
in search of attainment.

369
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,247
The only choice I had
was to bear with her.

370
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:28,768
Lord Ruyang,

371
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,968
you're actually on
the path to attainment?

372
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,247
I couldn't tell just now.

373
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:39,247
Lord Ruyang, you only wanted things
to take its own course.

374
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:41,367
However, you forgot that
people who sought attainment

375
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,287
should follow their hearts

376
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:44,928
and keep quiet.

377
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:46,768
Lord Ruyang,

378
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:48,488
it seems like you did none of the things
you mentioned.

379
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:51,728
This world

380
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,407
is filled with unhappy couples.

381
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,488
Some couldn't bear to part with each
other for the sake of their children.

382
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:58,367
Some didn't dare to part with each other

383
00:20:58,808 --> 00:20:59,888
due to their parents.

384
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,047
However, no one dared to admit

385
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:05,568
that they didn't part with each other

386
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,007
because they were afraid of
the consequences.

387
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,007
Lord Ruyang,

388
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:12,287
since you don't dare
to reject the marriage,

389
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,528
you shouldn't use
the path of attainment as your excuse.

390
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:15,688
I think

391
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,648
you're just afraid of offending

392
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,287
His Majesty.

393
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:24,327
How dare you lecture me?

394
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:30,407
Why didn't you reject the marriage
when you knew

395
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:32,447
that you two had unequal status?

396
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:39,287
I'm afraid of the power too.

397
00:21:53,568 --> 00:21:54,488
Lord Ruyang.

398
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,568
Lord Ruyang, since you're under
the order of Lady Ruyang

399
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,688
to stand up for Princess Yuchang,

400
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:00,768
why don't you

401
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,888
move all these dowries
back to your residence

402
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:05,888
and ruin the marriage?

403
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:07,127
This way,

404
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:08,728
it's good

405
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:10,488
for both of us.

406
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:13,047
Under whose order?

407
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:16,327
Do you think that shrew
can order me around?

408
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:20,087
I understand now.

409
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,728
You're trying to trick me here.

410
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,928
You hoped that
this marriage would be ruined.

411
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:29,528
I won't fall for your trick.

412
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:32,928
I watched over Zisheng as he grew up.

413
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:35,608
Now, I hope that this marriage
will be successful.

414
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,367
-Don't.
-You want me to reject the marriage for you?

415
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:40,207
Do you think I'm a fool?

416
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,007
Anyway, the dowries are already here.

417
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:48,167
It's time for me to make a report.

418
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:51,808
You wanted to use me
to ruin your marriage, huh?

419
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:54,007
I will

420
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:55,608
never fall for your trick.

421
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:05,528
I thought he was senile,
but I was wrong.

422
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,047
I told you to ruin the marriage!

423
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:16,287
Who told you to let it proceed?

424
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,848
Shrew, you're being unreasonable here.

425
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:21,568
I cannot ruin the marriage.

426
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:23,728
His Majesty arranged
the marriage himself.

427
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:25,167
What can we do about it?

428
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,047
Grandfather, you're His Majesty's uncle.

429
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:29,207
Even His Majesty has to
show you some respect.

430
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,007
Grandfather,

431
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:33,007
why don't you seek an audience
with His Majesty

432
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,688
and see if you can order Ling Buyi
to marry both me and Lady Cheng?

433
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,407
I'm willing to serve
Zisheng together with her.

434
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:39,488
Such nonsense!

435
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:41,327
Yuchang,

436
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,167
look at how disgraceful you look

437
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,648
when you're being so desperate.

438
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:47,688
You're such a disgrace!

439
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:49,608
Grandmother,

440
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:51,247
Grandfather has changed!

441
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,488
He doesn't love me anymore!

442
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:57,608
Now, everyone in the capital
treats me as a laughing stock!

443
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,888
I'm too embarrassed to live!

444
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:02,928
Just let me die!

445
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:03,928
Stop crying.

446
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:05,447
Stop your nonsense!

447
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:10,808
Yuchang,

448
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:13,127
listen to my heartfelt words.

449
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:16,928
You shouldn't be too casual
with your marriage.

450
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,047
If you're not particular about it,
it'll end up terribly.

451
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:21,007
Just look at your grandparents.

452
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:22,808
We fight

453
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:24,047
and complain every day.

454
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,848
We're a great example
for you to learn from.

455
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:27,447
Why are you trying to
repeat history here?

456
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:30,407
What nonsense are you talking about
in front of your granddaughter?

457
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,808
Do you really dare
to get a divorce with me?

458
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,728
Do you want to embarrass His Majesty?

459
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,808
When you instigated me

460
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:38,688
to cause trouble for Lady Cheng

461
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:41,087
and pressure her with my power,

462
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:43,848
have you ever thought about
how embarrassing it was for me?

463
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:49,087
I finally understand something
after 50 years.

464
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:51,247
I have to live for my own sake
at least once.

465
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,047
I'm divorcing you

466
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,207
for my own sake.

467
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:58,207
You can do whatever you like.

468
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,207
Grandmother,

469
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,247
I'll hang myself

470
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,047
in front of His Majesty right now!

471
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,207
I'll see if His Majesty
will grant the marriage to her

472
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,407
if it means his niece will die from it!

473
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:14,968
Your parents died when you were young.

474
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,688
I pampered you all the time

475
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,127
because I felt sorry for you.

476
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:20,648
That's why you always
try to kill yourself

477
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:23,127
whenever you don't get your way.

478
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,207
Have you ever thought about

479
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:28,327
who would respect you
if you try to threaten people

480
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,247
in the same way whenever
you don't get your way?

481
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:33,007
You're not respecting
yourself as a lady.

482
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:34,528
If so, why should your future husband

483
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:35,968
respect you?

484
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:40,568
Yuchang,

485
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,247
I've let you down.

486
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,127
You've missed out on the best times
of your life due to Ling Buyi.

487
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:47,367
I think

488
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,968
you should hurry and find yourself
another husband.

489
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:51,928
As for Ling Buyi,

490
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:53,327
you should give up on him.

491
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:56,087
There's no way for you to compete with
Cheng Shaoshang.

492
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,407
You're no match for her.

493
00:25:58,608 --> 00:25:59,608
Grandmother.

494
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:02,728
You heartless scum!

495
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,327
How dare you hurt
my granddaughter's heart?

496
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,407
I'll fight you until the end!

497
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,087
I'll enter the palace

498
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,728
and ask His Majesty
if his promise still counts!

499
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:13,407
Enough! I had enough of you!

500
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,207
All these years, you've been
blackmailing His Majesty

501
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:19,327
just because you fed His Majesty
some food when he was starving.

502
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,688
Both you and I knew

503
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:24,007
that it was a bowl of spoiled rice.

504
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:25,848
It was a bowl of spoiled rice
that you planned to throw away.

505
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,007
You've led a luxurious life
for over 10 years

506
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:30,207
because of that.

507
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:31,488
That's more than enough.

508
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:32,968
It's time to stop.

509
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:39,047
Yuchang,

510
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:40,888
I give you my promise.

511
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:41,928
It's either

512
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:44,488
you get married to another man

513
00:26:44,888 --> 00:26:46,167
or you stay in Sancai Temple

514
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:47,808
and be a nun.

515
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,808
You can decide

516
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,888
if you want to be a wife

517
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:55,888
or a nun yourself.

518
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:03,728
Grandmother.

519
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:21,207
Young Master,

520
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:22,968
we've searched the entire area
within a 10-mile radius.

521
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:24,648
We didn't discover any leads.

522
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:26,608
The soil here is damp.

523
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:29,287
People will leave their tracks behind
if they traverse here.

524
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:32,047
However, the surrounding area
is neat and clean.

525
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:34,407
Forget about Han Wu's tracks,

526
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:37,688
we couldn't find
any horse tracks either.

527
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:39,648
To clean the area

528
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:41,167
in such a short time,

529
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,688
only someone from the military
is capable of this feat.

530
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,167
They're actually from the military?

531
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:45,968
If so, Han Wu...

532
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,848
Han Wu might have left some other clues behind.

533
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:49,407
Let's do another search.

534
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,247
But we've searched the surrounding area.

535
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:14,728
Dig it.

536
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,127
(If it's one short and three long lots,)

537
00:28:38,688 --> 00:28:40,047
(that means I'm already dead.)

538
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:41,808
If it's two short and two long lots,

539
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:44,528
that means I'm safe.

540
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:47,367
Han Wu buried a clue here

541
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:48,808
after he realized that he was pursued.

542
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,007
It's two short and two long lots,

543
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:51,367
that means he's still alive.

544
00:28:51,808 --> 00:28:53,167
He will come and look for us.

545
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:55,768
We should pay attention

546
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:58,047
and see if there are any other clues
Han Wu had left behind.

547
00:28:58,047 --> 00:28:58,648
Yes, Young Master.

548
00:28:58,848 --> 00:28:59,888
Depart immediately.

549
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:01,528
We will rush back to the capital
by tonight.

550
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:02,207
Yes, Young Master.

551
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:04,928
Must we rush back?

552
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,367
I have to rush to
Marquis Quling's Residence.

553
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:08,207
I didn't make it when they delivered
the dowries to them.

554
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:10,007
I should apologize to them in person.

555
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:11,608
Young Master.

556
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:13,928
What's the matter?

557
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,007
You don't look like you're going
to apologize to them

558
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:17,648
with that angry face of yours.

559
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:20,608
It's more like you're heading there
to interrogate them.

560
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:29,688
Are you guys saying

561
00:29:31,327 --> 00:29:32,367
that I look fierce?

562
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:34,808
Not at all.

563
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:38,047
But Young Master, you should
try to smile more often.

564
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:39,167
Just like this.

565
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:05,928
Do you know

566
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:08,688
how to tell jokes?

567
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:26,287
Niaoniao, I'm so envious of you.

568
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,207
You're getting married soon.

569
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:29,608
You won't need to be restrained
by our parents again.

570
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,407
That's not it.

571
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:33,928
Before this, Mother didn't want me
to be married to Ling Buyi.

572
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:36,768
But now, she's happier about it
than anyone else.

573
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,728
She never mentions anything about
canceling the marriage at all.

574
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,808
From that,

575
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,728
you can see that
she doesn't care about me at all.

576
00:30:44,247 --> 00:30:45,087
Niaoniao,

577
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:47,407
I don't think it's right
for you to say that.

578
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:48,848
Back then, Mother was the one
who mentioned the cancellation

579
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,167
at risk of death.

580
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,047
But you just had to
be married to Ling Buyi.

581
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:53,648
What do you mean by that?

582
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,888
I had no choice,
given the circumstances.

583
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:57,888
Forget it.

584
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,848
Why am I telling you guys about this?

585
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:01,167
You guys won't understand anyway.

586
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,488
You guys don't understand
the power of influence

587
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:03,648
and profits.

588
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:04,768
You guys don't understand anything.

589
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:08,888
Niaoniao, you should stop

590
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:10,968
making First Aunt angry.

591
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:12,608
First Aunt hasn't been eating

592
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,047
or sleeping well lately.

593
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:14,928
Yangyang,

594
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:16,608
time to eat.

595
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:29,968
Why did Niaoniao keep
making Mother angry today?

596
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:32,888
I'm sure it's because
she's angry at Ling Buyi

597
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:33,888
for not delivering
the dowries personally.

598
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,768
But Mother was acting strange today.

599
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,327
She would've smacked the table
in the past.

600
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,207
But today, she said nothing.

601
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:43,247
It's hard to figure out

602
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:45,167
what ladies are thinking indeed.

603
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,688
This Ling Buyi is too much.

604
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:54,127
This Ling Buyi is already
taking Niaoniao lightly

605
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,287
regarding the dowries
even before marrying her.

606
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:57,928
As her brothers,

607
00:31:57,928 --> 00:31:59,287
we must never pardon him.

608
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:01,047
That's right.

609
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:02,047
When he comes,

610
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,447
we'll show him.

611
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,528
Shaoshang,

612
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:05,047
General Cheng, Madam Cheng,

613
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:07,488
I had emergency military affairs
to attend to on that day.

614
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:09,127
That's why I couldn't deliver
the dowries on time.

615
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:11,688
I'm sorry about that.

616
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:27,447
General Ling, you always
make your decision alone

617
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,047
without discussing it with other people.

618
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:30,888
You don't need to apologize for that.

619
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:35,007
The military affairs are more important.

620
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,367
General Ling, since you're here,
you should join us.

621
00:33:38,728 --> 00:33:39,528
Qingcong,

622
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:41,047
clean up Jiuzhui Hall

623
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,007
and invite General Ling
to have a meal over there.

624
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:44,888
You may drop the formalities.

625
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:48,848
We'll be a family soon.

626
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,608
Let's eat together.

627
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:07,047
Everyone, please don't be restrained.

628
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:08,207
I am

629
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:09,768
easy to get along with.

630
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:33,888
Everyone,

631
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,608
why are all of you so quiet?

632
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:37,528
You see,

633
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,928
we have to keep quiet
during meals and bedtime.

634
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:42,648
Although the Cheng Family is small,

635
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,488
we do follow the rules and customs.

636
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:48,808
Keep quiet during meals and bedtime?

637
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:50,728
Excellent.

638
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:52,447
Excellent.

639
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:23,488
Why don't I

640
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,808
tell you guys something interesting?

641
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:35,528
During ancient times,

642
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,207
there was a scholar

643
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:38,968
who was selfish and cold.

644
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:40,808
He never made any friends.

645
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:42,047
He thought he wouldn't lose anything

646
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,648
if he didn't make any friends.

647
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:48,007
He was living on a mid-lake island.

648
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:49,407
He needed to take the boat

649
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:51,407
whenever he wanted to leave the island.

650
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:53,648
One day, when he was crossing the lake,

651
00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:55,247
he realized that there was a hole

652
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,007
in the boat he was riding on.

653
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:58,928
He could've taken off his clothes
to cover the hole.

654
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:00,568
However, he wasn't willing
to dirty his clothes

655
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:02,648
or talk to anyone.

656
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:04,648
He allowed water

657
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:05,928
to flow through the hole
without stopping it.

658
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:08,968
The others only realized

659
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,287
that there was a hole on the boat

660
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,167
when it was in
the middle of the lake.

661
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:13,568
Someone shouted,

662
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:15,968
"The boat is sinking!"

663
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:18,648
Everyone,

664
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:21,808
please try to guess
what the scholar said in return.

665
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:32,007
He said,

666
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:34,207
"This boat isn't mine."

667
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,207
"It's none of my business."

668
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:39,367
What happened in the end?

669
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:41,488
What happened to him?

670
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:43,488
Naturally, he drowned.

671
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:57,167
That sounded interesting.

672
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:17,768
I think he's here to threaten us.

673
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:19,247
It does sound like it.

674
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:30,287
Here, Third Brother.

675
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:32,888
Thank you, General Ling.

676
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:38,688
Third Brother,

677
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:40,728
why are you sweating profusely?

678
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:46,768
It's due to the hot weather.

679
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,047
Here, Third Brother.

680
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,167
Let me offer you a toast.

681
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:03,728
Third Brother,
why did you finish it one go?

682
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:07,808
I was just trying to quench my thirst.

683
00:38:12,648 --> 00:38:13,848
Thank you, General Ling.

684
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:19,528
Third Brother, let me offer you
another toast.

685
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:38,407
Second Brother...

686
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:39,488
I'll drink up.

687
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:44,327
Bottoms up.

688
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:45,608
Nice.

689
00:38:54,688 --> 00:38:55,447
I...

690
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:57,247
I can't hold my liquor well.

691
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,888
I'll have some dishes.

692
00:39:01,528 --> 00:39:02,367
Okay.

693
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,728
I heard that Ling Buyi is here!

694
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:10,888
Mind your manners!

695
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:20,007
What a lively scene!

696
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,688
I wasn't late, was I?

697
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,808
You must be our son-in-law.

698
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:32,087
Yes, Old Madam.

699
00:39:32,528 --> 00:39:33,488
Look at him!

700
00:39:33,728 --> 00:39:35,207
His eyebrows, eyes,

701
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,848
nose, and lips
are in the right positions!

702
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:39,928
You're distinctive indeed!

703
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:42,808
You're just as handsome as my husband.

704
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:47,327
Listen up.

705
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,007
I've never been wrong
about a person in my entire life.

706
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,047
You and Niaoniao

707
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,648
have the same faces,

708
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:55,728
as if you two were carved
from the same mold.

709
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:56,648
I know you two

710
00:39:56,848 --> 00:39:59,047
can grow old together at first glance.

711
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:02,768
I once said the same thing.

712
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:04,087
Old Madam Cheng,

713
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,688
you're wise indeed.

714
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:06,447
That's right!

715
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:07,648
I'm wise!

716
00:40:09,968 --> 00:40:10,968
I'm wise...

717
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:14,207
What does that mean?

718
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:27,127
I've never seen
all those delicacies before.

719
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:27,848
Is that so?

720
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:30,447
I'll ask the kitchen to make them
for you after we're done here.

721
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:32,407
Father,

722
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:33,888
I've told the shops to pack them for us.

723
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:36,247
By then, we just need to deliver
the gifts to all the families.

724
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:38,207
You're thoughtful indeed.

725
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:40,007
You've saved us from a lot of trouble.

726
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:41,808
Stop right there.

727
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:43,207
We have to inspect your belongings.

728
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:45,167
What?

729
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:46,728
A harmonious home

730
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:48,447
brings prosperity.

731
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:50,488
Since Shaoshang and I are engaged,

732
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:51,968
the Cheng Family

733
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:54,047
is a part of my family now.

734
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:56,047
That's why I brought my bodyguards here

735
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:57,968
to set up a barrier at the entrance

736
00:40:58,127 --> 00:40:59,528
in order to ensure your safety.
