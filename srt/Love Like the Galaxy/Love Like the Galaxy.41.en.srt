=Episode 41=

3
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,956
It's said an exemplary person sets
an example

4
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,956
to teach people

5
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,276
to be upright.

6
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,677
The Crown Princess of the Sun Clan

7
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:01,036
had a malicious heart
and dishonest behavior.

8
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:02,916
She caused a disturbance in the country
because of her jealousy.

9
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:04,957
She has sown discord through slanders

10
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:07,677
which caused disorder in the palace

11
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:09,677
and hostility among the subjects.

12
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:12,957
Therefore, she'll be demoted
to a commoner

13
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,517
and banished to the Northern Palace.

14
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:33,797
Crown Prince,

15
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:35,357
please accept the royal edict.

16
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,396
I shall take my leave now.

17
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,517
Are you here to laugh at me?

18
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:24,236
When I just entered the palace,

19
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:26,276
I was alone and had no one to rely on.

20
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,197
You and I have a similar background,

21
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:30,996
and we used to take care of each other.

22
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:33,276
Yet, I didn't expect

23
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:35,197
all your painstaking effort
would be in vain.

24
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,276
You ended up harming yourself more
than others.

25
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:41,517
I especially came here to see you today

26
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:43,956
because I want to show you my gratitude

27
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:45,996
because you were kind to me before.

28
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,517
You don't have to lecture me.

29
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:06,236
Even if everyone looks down on me,

30
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:09,917
I'll never regret what I did.

31
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,116
You don't know how hard

32
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:14,597
it was to keep a husband

33
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:18,597
who didn't love you

34
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,996
for so many years.

35
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:24,197
You have no right

36
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:25,757
to tell me to be generous.

37
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:27,477
I'm not asking you to be generous.

38
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:28,917
I just don't want you

39
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:30,236
to trap yourself

40
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:31,396
in the grief of self-pity

41
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,396
because of your jealousy.

42
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:36,037
When the Crown Prince kept his promise
and married you,

43
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:39,197
you should've gotten along with him

44
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,357
and cherished this marriage.

45
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:45,317
Instead of tormenting another woman

46
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:47,037
because of your inferiority
and suspicions.

47
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,037
All this while,

48
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:52,757
the Crown Prince wasn't the one

49
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:53,917
who couldn't forget Qu Lingjun,

50
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,077
but you

51
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,077
kept reminding him of her.

52
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,517
You always blame others

53
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:03,836
for the misfortune of your marriage

54
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,197
and never reflect on yourself.

55
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:08,716
That's why things ended up
like this today.

56
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:12,517
I'm not wrong.

57
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:16,197
There's nothing I should reflect on.

58
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:22,356
I rather die in the Northern Palace

59
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,757
than face this person again.

60
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:28,677
This...

61
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,916
This is the best place
for me to return to.

62
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:36,036
I rather die

63
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,877
than leave the imperial palace.

64
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,156
It was never

65
00:06:57,677 --> 00:06:59,237
the imperial palace that trapped you

66
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:05,796
but your heart.

67
00:07:58,836 --> 00:07:59,916
I thought

68
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,877
the Crown Prince would continue
his relationship with Qu Lingjun

69
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:03,956
after ending his marriage
with the Crown Princess.

70
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:05,916
I didn't expect

71
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:07,836
that she would marry Official Liang.

72
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:10,997
It's a good thing

73
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,836
that Qu Lingjun marries Official Liang.

74
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,557
Official Liang is an upright man,

75
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,877
and he looks after his kin.

76
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:19,596
I'm sure after they get married,

77
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,637
Official Liang will treat
Qu Lingjun's children

78
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:23,916
as his own.

79
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:26,117
You're right.

80
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,317
Official Liang has defended
Qu Lingjun many times

81
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:31,796
and stepped forward bravely
at a critical time.

82
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:33,197
I'm sure

83
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,237
he'll be a good husband in the future.

84
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,036
You're praising another man

85
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:40,877
in front of your fiance.

86
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,077
Aren't you afraid I might be upset?

87
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:46,716
I didn't know the great General Ling

88
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:47,997
would get jealous.

89
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,796
I always thought
I was unlucky in the past.

90
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,077
When I think back,

91
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,317
I think

92
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,997
I guess I saved all my luck

93
00:08:57,396 --> 00:08:58,557
so I could meet you.

94
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,796
The Crown Princess married someone
who didn't love her.

95
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:05,356
She lived her life questioning herself

96
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:06,596
and in self-pity.

97
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:09,637
Qu Lingjun did her duty as a wife.

98
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,117
Yet, she had to suffer a lot
because she married the wrong man.

99
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:14,517
When I compared their lives

100
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:16,757
with mine,

101
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:19,237
I suddenly

102
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:22,077
felt I was lucky

103
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,517
and had good judgment.

104
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:25,956
I'm the one

105
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:28,916
with the good judgment, all right?

106
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:33,836
Look.

107
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:36,156
That shop's preserved fruits
are really tasty.

108
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,796
I'll buy you some preserved fruits

109
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,836
so your lips become sweet
after you eat them.

110
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,196
Give me two bags

111
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,156
of preserved fruits
that make the lips sweet.

112
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:34,637
No, General Ling.

113
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:36,517
It doesn't cost that much.

114
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:38,436
I'm paying

115
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:40,237
for everyone here.

116
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:42,877
He is good at everything.

117
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,276
But he is a bit conspicuous.

118
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,316
Don't be scared.

119
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:48,076
It's all right, General Ling.

120
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:49,676
Please come often.

121
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,076
Try some.

122
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:06,597
Let's go.

123
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:25,156
Urgent military report!
Shouchun has defected!

124
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:29,717
Urgent military report!
Shouchun has defected!

125
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:35,637
Today's pancake

126
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,196
is pretty good.

127
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,196
Your Majesty, you've always liked
the chewy part.

128
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:41,156
After so many years,

129
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:42,997
you still like it.

130
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,517
The palace's imperial kitchen

131
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,997
can never have
the same taste as before.

132
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:49,156
Don't you think so?

133
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,076
That's because you missed
the hardships in the past.

134
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:53,396
At that time,

135
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,156
a bite of solid food

136
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,517
is already tasty enough.

137
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,117
Zisheng,

138
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,396
what are you thinking about?

139
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,156
I think

140
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:08,556
it's not suitable to gather troops
in Shouchun.

141
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:09,916
First,

142
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:12,717
there aren't
many fertile lands in the city.

143
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:14,757
If they're besieged,
it'll be difficult

144
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:15,796
for them to sustain their food supply.

145
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:17,556
Second,

146
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,076
they have no workshop
to produce weapons.

147
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:20,477
If it's a long-term battle,

148
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:21,957
it would be difficult to supply weapons.

149
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:25,556
So what do we do?

150
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,957
So I think

151
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,556
we should divide the troops

152
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:29,877
to besiege

153
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,597
Shouchun.

154
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:33,997
At the same time,

155
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:35,477
we'll set up an ambush

156
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,276
on both sides of the mountain.

157
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,076
But

158
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:40,877
we must clear the bandits away.

159
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,916
Say,

160
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,117
has Peng Kun gone out of his mind?

161
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,436
Why is he revolting all of a sudden?

162
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:49,717
Your Majesty,

163
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,957
I'll lead the troops

164
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,837
and level Shouchun for you.

165
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,957
Don't take it too easy.

166
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,477
The noble families

167
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:58,676
and officials petitioned

168
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,276
to send their sons
and nephews into the army,

169
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:04,076
so they can gain experience
in the Shouchun's war.

170
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:05,997
These noble kids

171
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,237
are fragile and tender.

172
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:08,997
It's hard to lead them.

173
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,396
Your Majesty,

174
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:15,156
these lads think it's easy
to win Shouchun's war

175
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:17,477
so they wanted to join my troops
to get some merits.

176
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,316
Vigorous men wanting
to fight on the battlefield

177
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:21,837
had always been a good chance
to gain merits.

178
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:24,717
The noble families want
to send their kin

179
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:26,117
to gain experience.

180
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,676
So it's understandable.

181
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:29,957
Since they want to go,

182
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,156
I can only support them.

183
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:33,637
But it's not going to be easy

184
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,357
to lead this group of people.

185
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,357
I can lead them.

186
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,196
Out of the question.

187
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,196
Your Majesty,

188
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:40,276
I'm willing to lead the troops
to recapture Shouchun.

189
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:41,717
Who says you're going?

190
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,757
Your Majesty, calm down.

191
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:44,637
- Calm down.
- There, there.

192
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,276
A vigorous man wanting
to fight on the battlefield, right?

193
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,357
Zisheng is only eager
to serve his country.

194
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:48,877
That's right, Your Majesty.

195
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:49,757
This is...

196
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:51,396
This is a great opportunity
to make contributions.

197
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,556
If Zisheng wants to go

198
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,076
to gain more experience,
it's understandable too.

199
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:55,156
Gain experience?

200
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,717
Does he need any more experience?

201
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:00,396
He already went to more
than 100 battles in a year.

202
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:01,916
You're right, Your Majesty.

203
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,357
Let's keep eating.

204
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:05,156
Stop eating!

205
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:06,597
Everyone, leave!

206
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:13,676
You, come back here!

207
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:33,676
Your Majesty, try this.

208
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:49,717
It's delightful.

209
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,637
But why did you make so much?

210
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,877
I heard Zisheng
was discussing military strategy

211
00:14:58,276 --> 00:15:00,316
in the assembly hall
with several generals.

212
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:01,957
I'm sure he didn't eat well.

213
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,957
So I especially prepared more.

214
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,477
I didn't expect

215
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:07,517
His Majesty was angry again.

216
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,597
I dare not deliver this inside the hall.

217
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,276
Why did His Majesty get angry again?

218
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:14,676
Is the war too difficult?

219
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,637
Attendant Cao said

220
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:20,597
it was Zisheng who asked to lead the troops.

221
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,916
His Majesty was so angry
that he threw away the pancakes.

222
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:24,757
But he's too biased.

223
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:30,796
Are you worried about Zisheng?

224
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:35,916
I'll teach you one method.

225
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:44,316
Come here.

226
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:48,436
Stand right here.

227
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:49,796
Stand still.

228
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,036
You brat.

229
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:55,997
You always pull this strategy.

230
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:58,357
Every time we talk about marriage,

231
00:15:58,517 --> 00:15:59,396
you always want to go to war.

232
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,877
It's just Shouchun.

233
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,396
I have other generals
to lead the troops!

234
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,117
I don't need you to worry about it.

235
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:07,156
Peng Kun murdered Lord Qian'an
and delayed the reinforcement,

236
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:08,276
which led to the fall of Gu City.

237
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:09,436
I suspect that he had colluded

238
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,916
with Emperor Li at that time.

239
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,357
So I must go to Shouchun

240
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:13,916
and capture Peng Kun back here alive
for investigation.

241
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:15,396
So I can rest my uncle

242
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:17,597
and the spirits of the dead
in Gu City in peace.

243
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:19,796
About Huo,

244
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,396
I'll definitely get someone
to investigate this matter.

245
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:23,997
I've decided

246
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:25,877
to let Cui You lead the troops

247
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,637
to capture Peng Kun back
to the capital for trial.

248
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,757
While you

249
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,357
should stay here quietly

250
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,717
and wait for your wedding.

251
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:33,717
You brat.

252
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:35,396
Even if you don't care about yourself,

253
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:37,117
you should think about your fiancee.

254
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,717
It's chaotic on the battlefield.

255
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:41,117
What if something bad happens to you?

256
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:42,796
How are you going
to get married in the future?

257
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,676
Lady Cheng has arrived!

258
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:46,796
Did you hear that? Your fiancee is here.

259
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:49,436
I'm sure she's going
to give you an earful.

260
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,396
We're here. Come inside.

261
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:57,276
Your Majesty.

262
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:58,837
Her Majesty heard

263
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:00,477
that you were too busy
to have your meal.

264
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,556
So she sent me to deliver sweet wine.

265
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,357
Shen'an is so thoughtful.

266
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:05,796
Unlike someone

267
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:07,117
who always makes me worry.

268
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:10,717
Try it.

269
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:14,997
I made it myself.

270
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:16,396
Is it good?

271
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,517
Yes.

272
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,796
Didn't you say

273
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:22,316
it's for me?

274
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,036
See how your fiancee dotes
on you so much?

275
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:27,477
You brat.

276
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:33,316
Here's yours, Your Majesty.

277
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,676
This one.

278
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,076
Your Majesty,

279
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:43,477
here's your sweet liquor.

280
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:55,036
I did not come here to anger you.

281
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:56,837
But Her Majesty wants me

282
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:58,477
to deliver a message to you.

283
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:04,477
At the beginning of a new empire,

284
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,877
a general should be on the battlefield.

285
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,357
If the general loafs on his duty.

286
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,837
it's inevitable for others
to criticize Zisheng

287
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:14,117
for being unworthy of his position.

288
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,997
Did Shen'an really say that?

289
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,837
Her Majesty said it.

290
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:24,637
Because of the Crown Prince's case,

291
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:26,436
Shen'an's health

292
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:27,957
has become worse than before.

293
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:29,637
But now,

294
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:31,597
she has the energy to persuade me.

295
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,156
How can I refuse her?

296
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:35,396
I

297
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,357
was only worried about him.

298
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:41,957
I want him to stay to get married.

299
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,477
Is that wrong?

300
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:46,957
I heard many officials are

301
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:49,437
also sending their male members
to gain experience in Shouchun.

302
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,876
They're also worried
about their children.

303
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:57,717
If we want to treat others nicely,

304
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,076
we shouldn't restrain them.

305
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,437
We should support them from behind.

306
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,556
It's the same with parents
toward their children.

307
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,397
That is how a woman
should treat her husband too.

308
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,556
Her Majesty cares about you dearly.

309
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:11,237
But she didn't stop you

310
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,237
from reviewing the memorials
into the late night

311
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:15,397
and dealing with state affairs
day and night.

312
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:17,116
You, young lady

313
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,636
sure speak in an ingratiating manner.

314
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:19,717
Zisheng.

315
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:20,876
Next time,

316
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:22,836
you must teach her properly.

317
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,197
What about Shouchun?

318
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:38,556
Listen.

319
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,836
After you capture Peng Kun,

320
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:44,116
you must return
to the capital right away.

321
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:48,276
You better get married after that.

322
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,477
If you delay this again,

323
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:52,076
I'm going to marry

324
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:52,917
your fiancee to someone else!

325
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,556
I don't want to marry someone else.

326
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:55,876
I'll wait for you to come back.

327
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:56,836
All right.

328
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:58,836
I'll come back soon.

329
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:07,157
Oh, my heart is throbbing.

330
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:08,677
Stop laughing.

331
00:20:09,356 --> 00:20:10,397
Leave the soup.

332
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:11,917
You two can leave.

333
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:13,917
So you can show affection to each other.

334
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:37,036
If you want to kiss me,

335
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:39,356
we should go somewhere else.

336
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:41,437
We're at the palace, after all.

337
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:45,556
I wasn't trying to kiss you.

338
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:48,717
I just want to take a good look at you

339
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,116
to remember your face.

340
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:55,076
After my father came back
from his war expedition,

341
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:58,036
he looked very tanned

342
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,717
other than his eyes and teeth.

343
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:01,677
You must not put yourself in a situation

344
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,076
where you'll jeopardize your complexion.

345
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:04,477
I don't want to hold hands
with an ink stick

346
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:05,636
when I get married.

347
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:08,836
Since you're so worried about me,

348
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:10,477
why did

349
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:12,757
you persuade His Majesty to let me go?

350
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,036
I know your uncle's death

351
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:21,917
and those who died in Gu City

352
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:24,517
had always been a pain in your heart.

353
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,477
You've never really let it go either.

354
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,356
Her Majesty is not well.

355
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:33,517
I need to take care of her
in Changqiu Palace.

356
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,116
If I didn't have to stay,

357
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:37,356
I'd definitely go to battle
and fight the enemies with you.

358
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:42,596
Zisheng,

359
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,997
I want to see you capture Peng Kun.

360
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:48,717
I want to share the joy

361
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,517
of having the great revenge
avenged with you.

362
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:53,157
All right.

363
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,717
With these words,

364
00:21:58,316 --> 00:21:59,356
I feel assured.

365
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,036
Go and come back soon.

366
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:05,636
I'll wait for you in the capital.

367
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,116
I'll wait for you to marry me.

368
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:12,036
I promise you.

369
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:14,717
After I take care of Peng Kun,

370
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:18,596
I'll definitely hold
a grand wedding for you.

371
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:24,796
Wait for me.

372
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:31,556
Incense.

373
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:32,876
Yes, Young Lady.

374
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:11,917
What's wrong?

375
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,157
Is it bleeding?

376
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,437
Why don't you let me...

377
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:21,556
They said

378
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:24,076
when we sew armor
for those who go out to fight,

379
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:25,717
we must do it ourselves.

380
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,477
Or else it wouldn't be sincere

381
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:29,596
and wouldn't be able to protect him.

382
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:40,556
Again.

383
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:46,197
What's wrong again?

384
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:49,276
Women's chores are too hard.

385
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,517
I think I pricked at the same place.

386
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,596
It was your daughter's
finger's got pricked.

387
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,197
Why are you the one in pain?

388
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:18,197
If the servants find out

389
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,836
you're out here peeking

390
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:21,477
instead of sleeping,

391
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:22,437
won't you be a joke?

392
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:24,636
I'm sure Niaoniao knows

393
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:26,437
that His Majesty dispatched
me to Tongniu County

394
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:28,397
to supervise the transportation
of copper.

395
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:31,596
That's why she stays up all night
preparing this armor for me.

396
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:33,276
Judging by the size,

397
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:35,517
I don't think she's making it for you.

398
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:37,796
If not for me,

399
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:40,036
who else is she making it for?

400
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:46,076
Since when did you have the habit

401
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,276
of eavesdropping?

402
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:02,876
On this march,

403
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:04,717
we can bypass Tongniu County.

404
00:26:05,157 --> 00:26:06,757
Not only can we save time
traveling on foot,

405
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:09,076
but we can also reach Shouchun
within five days.

406
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:10,197
Report!

407
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,540
(Ling)

408
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:14,677
Young Master,

409
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:16,076
the scout reported

410
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:18,116
that someone was approaching
our encampment.

411
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:20,116
It looks like this person
is trying to sneak in.

412
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:21,596
It's been years

413
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:23,076
since I've seen anyone tired of living.

414
00:26:23,076 --> 00:26:25,116
Someone actually had the nerve
to sneak into Panqing Military Camp.

415
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,517
No need to report such trivial matters.

416
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:27,556
After you capture that person,

417
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:29,596
you can kill that person on the spot.

418
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:30,596
- You can't!
- You can't!

419
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:40,437
Why not?

420
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,540
(Panqing Military Camp)

421
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:55,836
That's odd.

422
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:57,397
This is a huge military camp.

423
00:26:57,397 --> 00:26:59,477
But why is there no guard at all?

424
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:25,997
Where could he be?

425
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:30,917
General Ling sure works hard.

426
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,356
His camp is in the southeast.

427
00:27:32,356 --> 00:27:33,076
But he would come

428
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:34,997
to the southwest to train us every day.

429
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:36,517
You're right.

430
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:38,437
He has to pass by three barracks

431
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:39,717
and one weaponry storage.

432
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:41,757
He had to travel so far.

433
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:43,836
(The southeast?)

434
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:00,677
I was loud enough.

435
00:28:00,876 --> 00:28:02,717
Do you think she can hear me?

436
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,116
It's all right.

437
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,596
If Madam still gets lost,

438
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,276
our brothers will take care of it.

439
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:22,796
Such a huge tent.

440
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,757
But there's no guard at all.

441
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,076
It's so dangerous.

442
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:31,636
All trespassers

443
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:33,997
will be killed.

444
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:38,556
That'll depend if you can bear
to kill me.

445
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:44,556
Of course, I can't.

446
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:46,876
If you want to see me,

447
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,876
you can send a message.

448
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:50,997
Why do you want to dress up

449
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,836
and risk sneaking
into the military camp?

450
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,116
Aren't you afraid

451
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:55,636
of being taken as a spy

452
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:56,876
and killed?

453
00:28:57,316 --> 00:28:58,477
I took the risk to sneak in here

454
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:01,036
because I have my reasons.

455
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:03,876
General Ling,

456
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:05,596
you don't even have

457
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:07,796
a sentry post or guard
in such a large military camp.

458
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:08,677
If I'm really an enemy's spy

459
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:10,316
with excellent martial arts,

460
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:11,717
you would have fallen

461
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,197
into my hands now.

462
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,356
Do you really think

463
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:19,757
there's such a coincidence?

464
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:22,917
The patrol happened to not notice you,

465
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:24,636
and they happened to be in front of you

466
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:26,717
exposing the location of the main camp.

467
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:30,157
Come with me.

468
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,237
So you've been making

469
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:00,636
a fool out of me.

470
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:03,636
If you're truly an enemy's spy,

471
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:06,036
you would have died several times

472
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:08,316
no matter how excellent
your martial arts are.

473
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:12,796
You...

474
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:15,237
But I'm happy

475
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:17,757
that you risked your life to see me.

476
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,157
Before I set out,

477
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:22,997
I have a gift for you.

478
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:30,276
Do you see that?

479
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:33,796
That piece of land.

480
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:38,477
His Majesty asked

481
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:40,997
what do I want for a reward
after I returned with a victory.

482
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,957
I asked for the open space
beside the military camp.

483
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:45,917
There's an underground hot spring here.

484
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,076
It's suitable
for planting flowers and plants.

485
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:51,276
Don't you always want

486
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:53,836
to construct your own house?

487
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:56,517
In the future,

488
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:58,677
our residence will be here.

489
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,237
You can do whatever you want.

490
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:06,356
Be it cultivating the land

491
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:08,636
or building a canal.

492
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:10,796
It's up to you.

493
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:13,517
In the future,

494
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:17,237
this will be our home.

495
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,477
You always want a place

496
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:29,677
that truly belongs to you.

497
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:32,477
In this place,

498
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,276
you no longer have to worry
about being blamed.

499
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:39,757
No longer have to worry

500
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:42,276
about being abandoned.

501
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:46,437
We'll stay here,

502
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,356
have children here,

503
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:51,997
grow old here

504
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:55,116
until the end of time.

505
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:02,997
What's wrong?

506
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:06,316
You don't like it?

507
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:10,917
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

508
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:13,477
I shouldn't make the decision myself.

509
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:35,237
I like it.

510
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:37,556
I truly like it.

511
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:42,157
I'm glad you like it.

512
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:45,397
Then we can plant

513
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:46,876
a bed of flowers in the courtyard.

514
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:49,796
You'll play the zither
while I play the flute.

515
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:53,876
Just like what Third Aunt
and Third Uncle do.

516
00:32:54,997 --> 00:32:56,036
We can

517
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:57,316
marvel at the flowers,

518
00:32:57,997 --> 00:32:58,796
admire the moon,

519
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:00,596
and gaze at the stars in the sky.

520
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:05,157
From now on,

521
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:08,397
we'll grow old

522
00:33:10,677 --> 00:33:11,876
and die together.

523
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:32,677
Zisheng,

524
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:36,397
don't worry.

525
00:33:38,677 --> 00:33:39,796
We'll never be an unhappy couple

526
00:33:39,796 --> 00:33:41,596
like your parents.

527
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:44,957
Actually, they're not an unhappy couple.

528
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:47,556
What?

529
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:49,316
Nothing.

530
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,276
It's getting late.

531
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:56,517
I'll send you back.

532
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:01,997
Promise me.

533
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:04,636
After you return with a victory,

534
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:07,157
we'll build our new home.

535
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:08,717
Is that all right?

536
00:34:10,356 --> 00:34:11,197
All right.

537
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,076
I promise you.

538
00:34:15,316 --> 00:34:16,157
Aren't you curious

539
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:18,036
about why I took the risk to come here?

540
00:34:19,477 --> 00:34:21,757
Actually, I brought a gift for you.

541
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:37,796
Why did you prick your fingers
to such an extent?

542
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,636
Don't make armor for me again.

543
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:43,076
Don't you like the mandarin duck wings?

544
00:35:46,237 --> 00:35:47,316
These are mandarin duck wings?

545
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,837
I like it as long as you made it.

546
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:57,797
But

547
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:02,397
I thought these were chicken wings.

548
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:05,517
Chicken wings?

549
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:07,837
These are mandarin duck wings.

550
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:09,517
I made this

551
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,036
to remind you constantly.

552
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:14,036
At all times,

553
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:16,196
you must remember

554
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:19,477
that you have a fiancee.

555
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,437
While you're risking your life,

556
00:36:21,756 --> 00:36:23,277
you'll remember

557
00:36:23,437 --> 00:36:24,517
that I'm waiting for your return

558
00:36:25,236 --> 00:36:26,636
when you look
at these mandarin duck wings.

559
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,156
All right.

560
00:36:29,116 --> 00:36:30,236
If you say these are
mandarin duck wings,

561
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:32,076
then so it is.

562
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:34,116
Young Master's armor

563
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:35,636
has two mandarin duck wings

564
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,556
attached to it.

565
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:41,116
That's so embarrassing.

566
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:44,437
I don't even want to go to war now.

567
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:46,636
The enemy would laugh at us.

568
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:53,196
In the future,

569
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:55,477
you can leave needlework to me.

570
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:57,277
You don't have to do it anymore.

571
00:36:57,997 --> 00:36:59,277
You know needlework?

572
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:00,837
I personally do

573
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:02,756
most of the military affairs.

574
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:04,556
When it comes to needlework,

575
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:06,477
you can say I'm pretty good at it.

576
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:08,277
After I return,

577
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:10,437
you can leave

578
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:12,036
all the needlework to me.

579
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:14,277
All right.

580
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:16,036
That's settled then.

581
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:20,517
If you think my needlework is bad,

582
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:23,277
you can take these wings off.

583
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,716
But you must never take off

584
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:28,437
the soft armor I gave you.

585
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:31,317
This soft armor is made
of copper wire mixed with hemp.

586
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,477
It is not only soft
but pretty resistant to blade attack.

587
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,877
It can protect your life
at a critical time.

588
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:38,716
I also embroidered a rabbit.

589
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:41,317
That was a rabbit?

590
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:45,357
I thought

591
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:47,716
it was a rat.

592
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,636
That's a rabbit.

593
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:55,676
I was born in the year of a rabbit.

594
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,437
Yes,

595
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:00,957
it's a rabbit.

596
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:02,317
If you say it's a rabbit,

597
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:03,636
then a rabbit it is.

598
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:05,076
That's a rabbit, to begin with.

599
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:09,437
Yes, a rabbit.

600
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:24,716
Why are they behaving like that
in public?

601
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,196
Why is it so hard for them to part?

602
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:32,556
I wonder who was the one
who was impatient with the horse

603
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:34,477
for being slow after he won a war.

604
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:36,477
He had to jump off the horse

605
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:38,236
and rush to see me.

606
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:41,917
Heng,

607
00:38:42,116 --> 00:38:44,797
you still remember the past so clearly.

608
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:46,477
I don't want to remember

609
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:48,756
all those ridiculous things.

610
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:50,156
It's so tiring.

611
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:51,877
I can't forget them either.

612
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:01,477
Look how heartless she is.

613
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:03,716
She only cares about her fiance.

614
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:05,397
She embroidered all night.

615
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,397
But she didn't even give me
a pair of socks.

616
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,596
Are you jealous of your son-in-law now?

617
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,716
If she really did make one for you,

618
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,397
would you be
as thick-skinned as Ling Buyi

619
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:15,837
to put it on?

620
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,437
You're right about that.

621
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,196
Luckily, I didn't have

622
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,517
to wear those chicken wings.

623
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:22,076
Or else I don't know how
to face anyone.

624
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:25,437
Zisheng,

625
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:27,917
you're a good person.

626
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:29,636
You must live longer.

627
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,196
Or else I'll have to marry someone else.

628
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:39,357
You won't have the chance.

629
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:41,437
I'll definitely come back alive.

630
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:45,716
You must

631
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:48,196
come back alive.

632
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,477
I've never seen

633
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:54,236
Zisheng so happy.

634
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:56,877
I'm so happy.

635
00:39:57,236 --> 00:39:58,636
I only hope

636
00:39:58,877 --> 00:40:00,116
he no longer has to go
to war after this.

637
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,676
So the family

638
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:04,317
and husband and wife

639
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:06,036
no longer have to be apart anymore.

640
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:07,196
Don't worry.

641
00:40:08,477 --> 00:40:09,477
I'll definitely

642
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:11,716
unify the land.

643
00:40:12,196 --> 00:40:13,277
So there will be

644
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:15,156
no more war in the world.

645
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:55,277
Lady Cheng!

646
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:48,236
What's that?

647
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:50,517
That's Zisheng's mansion's private seal.

648
00:41:50,997 --> 00:41:51,917
It looks like

649
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,957
Zisheng is going to entrust
his family to Shaoshang.

650
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:58,116
It's the most beautiful thing
in the world

651
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:00,756
to see lovers get married.

652
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:01,877
Good.

653
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:04,477
This is good.

654
00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:10,756
(It's too bad)

655
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,036
(I've never experienced this)

656
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,636
(in my life.)

657
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:19,957
Soldiers!

658
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,997
I wish

659
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:25,477
all of you

660
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,756
victory in your first battle

661
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:30,277
and return with triumph!

662
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:32,837
I

663
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:34,596
and your family

664
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:36,877
shall await your return!

665
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:40,317
We shall do our best

666
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:41,957
and not disappoint Your Majesty!

667
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:45,596
We shall do our best

668
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,477
and not disappoint Your Majesty!

669
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:52,596
Set out!
