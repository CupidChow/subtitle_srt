3
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,840
(Previously on)

4
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,180
His Majesty has arrived!

5
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:07,981
Zisheng, what are you doing?

6
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,580
Your Majesty,
please represent my parents

7
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,660
and ask Fourth Lady Cheng

8
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,501
for her hands.

9
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,021
(My daughter)

10
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:23,740
(lacks discipline since young.)

11
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,021
(She's a stubborn lady.)

12
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:28,341
This marriage is excellent.

13
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,781
It's just that Shaoshang

14
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,100
isn't good enough.

15
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,580
(Shaoshang may not)

16
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,421
(be the ideal lady in everyone's heart,)

17
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,781
(but to me,)

18
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,501
(she's pure, decisive,)

19
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,620
(and honest about her feelings.)

20
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,260
(She's someone who can stand by my side.)

21
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,341
(She will be the only one I marry)

22
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,901
in this lifetime.

23
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,501
All of us are honest, subservient,

24
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,740
and decent ladies.

25
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:07,220
Unlike someone

26
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,501
who tries to seduce everyone
like the temptress she is.

27
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,100
Today,

28
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,700
I've finally seen the power
of influence in action.

29
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,180
(Shaoshang,)

30
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,660
(don't you like power?)

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,861
(That's your power.)

32
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,021
(I've been stubborn since young.)

33
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,381
(I do not yield to rules,)

34
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,660
(let alone listening to you.)

35
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,981
(Do you still wish)

36
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,781
(to marry a lady like me?)

37
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:34,660
Of course,

38
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,341
Cheng Shaoshang, you're the best lady

39
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,941
in the entire capital.

40
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,381
You're the best lady

41
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,941
in

42
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,540
the entire world.

43
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:06,901
Father, Mother,

44
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,140
I've decided.

45
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:12,700
I will marry him.

46
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,461
Young Master.

47
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,941
Young Master, leave him alive!

48
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,580
What's going on?

49
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,381
Young Master,

50
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,981
I've already located the physician
we were looking for.

51
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,341
He once examined

52
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,740
the mounts of the soldiers

53
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,260
who were sent to examine the miasma.

54
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,421
If someone was killed by the miasma,

55
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,180
his horse would suffer the same fate.

56
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,620
Out of his suspicion,

57
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
he made a secret investigation,

58
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,941
and he discovered

59
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,540
that all of the soldiers
actually died from sword wounds.

60
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:49,981
He retired from his duties

61
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,620
and hid his name out of fear.

62
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
Young Master, I wanted to
bring him to you initially.

63
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:56,660
However,

64
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,861
they still discovered him.

65
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,501
Speak.

66
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:05,700
Who sent you here?

67
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,220
Who exactly are you guys?

68
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:14,620
Han Wu, watch out!

69
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,941
Han Wu!

70
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:28,060
Han Wu!

71
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,180
Young Master,

72
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,501
I've dealt with the assassins' bodies.

73
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:07,260
However, we found no clues even after

74
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:08,341
examining their backgrounds.

75
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,421
Those assassins killed Han Wu
by using the military's way

76
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,501
to rout an enemy.

77
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,660
And these poison needles

78
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,821
are hollow and filled with poison.

79
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:23,100
No ordinary blacksmiths can forge them.

80
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,740
They should belong to the military.

81
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,461
It was actually the military?

82
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,341
But there are many troops
who are stationed here.

83
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:33,861
There are plenty of generals too.

84
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,540
Where should we start our investigation?

85
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:37,700
Han Wu had already found out the truth.

86
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,941
Back then, none of the soldiers

87
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,620
who were sent to investigate
the miasma survived.

88
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,501
However, their mounts

89
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,901
returned to the military camp safely.

90
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,220
If that's the case,

91
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,740
why didn't Marquis Yue
report the abnormality?

92
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,740
Not only did he not investigate
the true cause of their deaths,

93
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,580
but he also relayed the news
to Lord Qian'an immediately,

94
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:01,060
suggesting him to
slow down his reinforcements.

95
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,381
And,

96
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:07,700
it has been confirmed

97
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,981
that the soldiers

98
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,381
didn't die from the miasma.

99
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,500
Young Master, do you think Marquis Yue

100
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,100
killed them on purpose?

101
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,260
But all of them were his men.

102
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,621
In order to prove the existence of miasma,

103
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,661
he deceived others

104
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,220
and killed his men.

105
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,981
He was the one who stalled
the reinforcements,

106
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,021
causing Gu City to fall.

107
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:41,861
Han Wu's death

108
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,621
proves that he knows
someone is investigating the matter.

109
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:47,741
Next,

110
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,701
we cannot launch an open investigation.

111
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:53,060
We can only do it in secret.

112
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:57,180
We must be extra cautious.

113
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,941
Young Master,

114
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,220
His Majesty has sent Physician Sun here
to examine your wound.

115
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,340
Shall we let him in?

116
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,021
No.

117
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,180
His Majesty said he would behead

118
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,701
Physician Sun if
he didn't treat your wound.

119
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,340
His Majesty has said the same thing
for many years.

120
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,541
Has he ever beheaded someone before?

121
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:16,581
I won't see him

122
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
no matter what.

123
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,541
Why are you awake already?

124
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,260
Your Majesty, if you don't want to sleep,

125
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:43,701
I won't interrupt you.

126
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,500
I shall sleep in the side chamber.

127
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,380
Come.

128
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,541
Sit down.

129
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:54,821
I was

130
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,741
just worried about Zisheng.

131
00:09:57,821 --> 00:09:58,661
You see,

132
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,541
he didn't even tell me
when his leg was injured.

133
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,100
I cannot sleep or eat well

134
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,380
whenever I think about it.

135
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:10,180
Zisheng never told anyone
about his wounds before.

136
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:12,741
Your Majesty, if you have trouble
sleeping because of that,

137
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,741
I don't think you should sleep then.

138
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,901
You should be immortalized instead.

139
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,821
This time, it's different.

140
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,460
Not only did he keep it a secret,

141
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,380
but he also deceived me.

142
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,180
So, was the silly boy
finally enlightened?

143
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Tell me about it.

144
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,220
Your Majesty, how did he deceive you?

145
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:33,661
He said he was injured

146
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,621
due to horse riding.

147
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:38,060
Only a fool will believe him!

148
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,180
Zisheng has never fallen off a horse

149
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,621
since he was six.

150
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,500
How could he be injured
from horse riding?

151
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:48,701
I heard

152
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,220
that he went to see Lady Cheng

153
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,100
before he got injured.

154
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,100
Maybe

155
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,781
he deceived me because he was afraid

156
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,380
that I would punish Lady Cheng.

157
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,941
He did the same thing on Mount Tugao.

158
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,861
When I was questioning Lady Cheng,

159
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,380
he defended her

160
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:10,981
all the way.

161
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,060
Now

162
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:16,741
that he has fallen for Lady Cheng,

163
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,500
he has forgotten about me.

164
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:21,901
Your Majesty,

165
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,260
everyone was a youngster once.

166
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,021
Back then,

167
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,500
didn't you treat me

168
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,861
in the same manner?

169
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,500
That's a different story.

170
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:34,821
We were

171
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:36,781
in love.

172
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,260
But do you know something?

173
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,060
That Lady Cheng

174
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,180
is such a fool.

175
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,420
Think about it.

176
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:45,500
Zisheng got his leg injured.

177
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,741
Don't you think

178
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,260
she should pay him

179
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,340
a visit?

180
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,260
But she didn't do so.

181
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:51,821
But of course,

182
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:53,581
I assume

183
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:54,901
that Zisheng

184
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,220
is hiding it from her too.

185
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,861
I still remember

186
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,661
that Your Majesty tried everything
you could to get my attention

187
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,260
even when

188
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,220
you were bitten by a mosquito.

189
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,821
If Lady Cheng doesn't know

190
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,741
about Zisheng's leg injury,

191
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,621
doesn't that mean Zisheng
got injured for nothing?

192
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,460
You're right.

193
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:23,941
You're right.

194
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,741
Since she doesn't know it,

195
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,901
I will let her know.

196
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:35,180
Tomorrow, I shall summon
Lady Cheng into the palace.

197
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,821
I will summon Zisheng as well.

198
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,180
I will make her

199
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,380
feel sorry for Zisheng

200
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:42,260
just like how I feel for him.

201
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:43,781
Your Majesty,

202
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,380
if so,

203
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:48,140
can you feel for me right now?

204
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,781
Sure.

205
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,420
Greetings, Third Princess.

206
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,220
Lady Cheng, we meet again.

207
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,861
I heard that Zisheng had delivered
the dowries to your residence.

208
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,060
You must've used this face

209
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,541
to seduce him, huh?

210
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,180
Third Princess,

211
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:26,781
what do you mean by seducing him?

212
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:29,220
When I say you seduced him,
that will be the truth.

213
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,621
How dare you talk back to me?

214
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:32,901
Someone, slap her.

215
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,260
Stop!

216
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,500
Lady Luo, excuse me.

217
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,380
I need to speak with
Third Princess in private.

218
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,661
Please take your leave.

219
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,021
What did she say to you?

220
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,901
I heard that she was devious
and cunning.

221
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,941
You even got your leg injured
yesterday because of her.

222
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,380
She's not good enough for you.

223
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,100
Zisheng,

224
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,220
actually, I've regretted it all this while.

225
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,180
You were nice to me in the past.

226
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,420
However, I didn't know
the meaning of a good husband

227
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,140
when I was young.

228
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,500
Do you still remember the times

229
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,021
when I suffered from palpitations
in the middle of the night?

230
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,981
You were the one who knocked
on the palace door

231
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,380
and asked His Majesty to summon
the physician for me.

232
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,180
Yes, I did.

233
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,741
So, are you insulting my wife-to-be

234
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,701
in order to repay me?

235
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,941
Third Princess, I hope you will stop

236
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,901
insulting other people's families
and ancestral lineage.

237
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,981
His Majesty raised me himself.

238
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,340
He was busy with state affairs
day and night.

239
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,541
However, his daughter

240
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,500
is accumulating wealth by unfair means.

241
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:15,500
She has no regards
for her father at all.

242
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,180
You should stop

243
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,621
mentioning the past.

244
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,180
Now,

245
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:24,140
I hate you to the core.

246
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,260
Stop right now.

247
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,941
I'm not that shameless.

248
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,981
I just hope that
you won't regret it in the future.

249
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,500
I'm 21 years old this year.

250
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,220
Since young,

251
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,741
His Majesty had rushed me

252
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:37,781
to get married many times.

253
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:40,220
However, I only thought about

254
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,380
getting married

255
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,821
after meeting Shaoshang some time ago.

256
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:49,941
In this life,

257
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,021
she will be

258
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:55,460
the only one for me.

259
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,100
General Ling,

260
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,500
your leg is still injured.

261
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,140
You'll exert your leg
if you walk this fast.

262
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,260
You were cold to me yesterday.

263
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:01,741
Why are you

264
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,581
suddenly concerned about me today?

265
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:04,741
Who said I was concerned?

266
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,100
We're engaged.

267
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:09,140
I'm just afraid that His Majesty
might be angry at me

268
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,781
for not taking care of you.

269
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,060
Listen.

270
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,781
I know you hate me for restraining you

271
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,701
and giving you pressure.

272
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,340
But even so,

273
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,581
it's impossible for me to let you go.

274
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,701
You're just like a deity
that people pray to in a temple.

275
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,220
You're feared and respected by everyone.

276
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,541
Now, the deity is going to marry me.

277
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,621
And, I have to live together with him.

278
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,180
Can't you just give me some time

279
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,901
to think about it?

280
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:39,981
This is what you're like.

281
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,060
You're witty enough to
reject other people's advice

282
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,661
and eloquent enough to make people
gloss over your mistake.

283
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,380
I understand what you mean.

284
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,901
Mother praised me in the same way too.

285
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:49,901
Seems like

286
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:52,220
both of you are the same.

287
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,901
You can take a dig at me all you want.

288
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,541
But I won't take it to heart

289
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,661
no matter what you do.

290
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,260
Shaoshang,

291
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:03,100
I've decided that you're the one.

292
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,541
You will be the only one for me
in the future.

293
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,340
If you wish to cancel the marriage,

294
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,380
you can request His Majesty to do so.

295
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
I, Ling Buyi,

296
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,661
will never cancel the marriage.

297
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,420
Even if His Majesty were
to punish me for it,

298
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,100
I will never do it.

299
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,260
Who said I was going to do it?

300
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,021
I won't cancel the marriage.

301
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,260
I've straightened out my thoughts.

302
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,621
I didn't know how to love someone

303
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:36,420
because I wasn't loved when I was young.

304
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,180
That's why I doubted your intention.

305
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:46,861
But when I thought about the past,

306
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,981
I thought you were truly nice to me.

307
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,340
If I reject you again,

308
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:55,220
I might be a little heartless.

309
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,941
How's your injury?

310
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,941
Why were you so careless?

311
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,380
You actually asked me

312
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,220
if it hurt or not when I got injured

313
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:13,661
in the hunting hut.

314
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:17,260
Are you afraid of
His Majesty's questions

315
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,500
more than me?

316
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,140
You're not as scary as His Majesty.

317
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,220
Cheng Shaoshang,

318
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,420
I know.

319
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:35,661
You always doubted that our relationship
would be unequal.

320
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,420
You were always worried
that I would oppress you.

321
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,941
Today, I will tell you this.

322
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,821
I, Ling Buyi, treat you as my wife.

323
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,460
Everything I have

324
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,340
shall belong to you.

325
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:58,500
In the future,

326
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,021
I will do everything
I can to protect you.

327
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,220
I will never

328
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,420
oppress you.

329
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,140
I will make you believe me.

330
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,941
It depends on

331
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,861
your performance in the future.

332
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:32,621
In the future,

333
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,340
you can eat

334
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:35,781
whenever you feel like it.

335
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,500
Your formalities today

336
00:20:57,981 --> 00:20:59,380
are still acceptable.

337
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:00,901
Tell me now.

338
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,060
How do you plan

339
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,380
to become Zisheng's wife in the future?

340
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,420
We have to get married first.

341
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:19,661
Is that all?

342
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,220
Your Majesty,

343
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,581
I was a fool for not understanding
what you meant.

344
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:35,260
Please pardon me for my ignorance.

345
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,500
Let me ask you something.

346
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,741
You lack in formalities,

347
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,220
and you're not well-versed
in your studies.

348
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,541
However, Zisheng

349
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:45,260
is the pillar of the nation.

350
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,460
I treat him like my own son.

351
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,260
Do you think you're good enough for him?

352
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,060
What are you doing here?

353
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,021
Physician Sun said

354
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,781
your leg injury was getting worse.

355
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:09,100
What are you doing here

356
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
instead of recuperating at home?

357
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,861
Get up.

358
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:11,781
Your Majesty,

359
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,941
I'm here to see what kind of questions

360
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,661
you will ask my future wife.

361
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:20,581
All right. You shouldn't kneel
when you're injured.

362
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:21,380
You should sit.

363
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,981
You may sit too.

364
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,500
Both of you can sit down, okay?

365
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,621
Be careful.

366
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,260
Sit down.

367
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:47,701
Speak.

368
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
Your Majesty is wise.

369
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:50,941
My parents

370
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:52,460
left the capital to join the war

371
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:54,420
when I was still an infant.

372
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,140
Only my aging grandmother

373
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,220
and unscrupulous second aunt
were at home.

374
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:00,661
All these years,

375
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,741
I barely knew

376
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,661
100 words.

377
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,420
As for the books I've read,

378
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,420
I've never read any books.

379
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,100
Even when Father and Mother are back,

380
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,981
they think that I'm vulgar
beyond expectations.

381
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,861
That's why they taught me how to read.

382
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,861
General Ling is a general.

383
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,180
I assume

384
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:26,260
General Ling doesn't like

385
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,741
ladies who are highly educated.

386
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,180
I'm the only uneducated lady
in the entire capital.

387
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,180
That's why I'm a perfect match for him.

388
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,140
Nonsense!

389
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,941
Zisheng is highly intelligent.

390
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,981
How is he not good enough

391
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,460
for the educated ladies?

392
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,380
Yes, Your Majesty is right.

393
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,781
I thought of the same thing.

394
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
If I knew that General Ling

395
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:52,420
would fall for me in the past,

396
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,861
I would've studied hard.

397
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,781
But now, it's too late.

398
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:01,340
Your Majesty,

399
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,460
although Shaoshang is still young,

400
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,581
she has humility and self-awareness.

401
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:06,781
She's neither humble nor arrogant.

402
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,140
That's what

403
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,581
I like about her.

404
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,621
According to Confucius,

405
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:20,060
it is wise to hold what you know
and admit

406
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,220
what you don't.

407
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,981
It's rare for someone as young as you

408
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:24,180
to understand the meaning of that.

409
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,100
Do not speak.

410
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,180
Lady Cheng,

411
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:29,701
since the marriage

412
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,621
has already been arranged for,

413
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,981
you should

414
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,460
try to compensate

415
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,581
for your lacking in the future

416
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:39,861
instead of belittling yourself here.

417
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,060
If you were

418
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
as worthless as what you had said,

419
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,861
what would happen to Zisheng?

420
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,340
Now, Zisheng is establishing
his own family.

421
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:51,380
People are paying attention
to everything he does.

422
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,260
As his future wife,

423
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,981
you have

424
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,541
to be extra cautious

425
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:57,781
when you take care of the family.

426
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,541
If something goes wrong,

427
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:02,260
Zisheng will be mocked.

428
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,260
So,

429
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:07,821
you should attend a training
in the empress's palace.

430
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:11,741
You have to work harder.

431
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,220
Don't try to reject it
by trying to be humble here.

432
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,621
As for the details,

433
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,861
you just need to follow
the empress's instructions.

434
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:26,180
All right, it's decided then.

435
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:28,701
You guys have
nothing else to say, right?

436
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,821
You may speak what's on your mind.

437
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,021
His Majesty is usually busy.

438
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:38,781
It's rare that he has time for us today.

439
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,100
Your Majesty,

440
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,701
I wish to complain about someone.

441
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,260
I wonder if I can do so?

442
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,460
You're really bold indeed.

443
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,340
You're actually submitting a complaint

444
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,741
when this is your third time seeing me?

445
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,260
Do you know

446
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:08,140
submitting a complaint to me
is a huge matter?

447
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,260
You'll be punished severely
if you say the wrong thing.

448
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,901
Your Majesty, I know nothing
about state affairs.

449
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:15,941
However, I'm going to complain
about something trivial today.

450
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,180
Although it's something trivial,

451
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,981
all huge matters

452
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,140
were caused by trivial reasons.

453
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,180
General Ling always said that
Your Majesty is magnanimous

454
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:27,100
and that he treats
Your Majesty as his father.

455
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:29,420
That's why I'm daring enough

456
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:31,420
to treat Your Majesty
as one of my elders too.

457
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:33,781
I don't know

458
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,460
if it's appropriate to do so.

459
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,661
If not, I shall keep quiet.

460
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:38,741
Of course.

461
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,340
Of course.

462
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:44,781
Of course.

463
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:48,661
Speak up.

464
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,901
Today, I'm going to complain about

465
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,340
Wang Ling, the daughter
of Wang Chun, the Cavalry General.

466
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:04,621
I want to complain about her

467
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:06,060
for being rude

468
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,621
and slandering me during
the Lou Family's wedding banquet.

469
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,500
Regarding the mintage,

470
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,060
I'll mention it when
there's an opportunity.

471
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:24,581
If so,

472
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,821
has Official Peng completed

473
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,661
(Madam Wen Xiu)
the things he had promised me?

474
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,541
(Envoy of Shouchun)
Madam Wen Xiu, do not worry.

475
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,220
Young Master's estate is within
the borders of Shouchun.

476
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:39,100
My master will definitely
take good care of him.

477
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,581
However, acquiring the mintage
is a huge deal.

478
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:46,941
Madam Wen Xiu, you must
choose your words carefully.

479
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,781
If something goes wrong,

480
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,100
we may be beheaded.

481
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:55,541
It's just a mintage.

482
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,981
Although the family of Lord Qian'an isn't
as glorious as before,

483
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:01,821
Her Majesty is still indebted to us.

484
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:06,460
Xuan was wandering around
when we took her in.

485
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,021
If my father

486
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,500
didn't send her to the current emperor,

487
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,901
she would have no chance
to become the empress.

488
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
Moreover, my father

489
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:17,661
died on the battlefield
for the sake of the Wen Family.

490
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,661
I still retain

491
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:22,981
some influences over the city.

492
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,140
That's great.

493
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,220
This is a home letter

494
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:33,701
Young Master told me to deliver to you.

495
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:42,260
Young Master knew

496
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,861
that this would be a difficult task
for you, Madam Wen Xiu.

497
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,260
However, Young Master led a rough life.

498
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:49,741
It's been many years since
he had gotten new apparel,

499
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,340
and he was out at the elbows.

500
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,541
He had no choice but to
stop eating after noon

501
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:56,420
and shut himself in the house to get by.

502
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:58,701
Young Master has no choice

503
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:01,260
but to bring up this ridiculous request.

504
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:03,821
Now, the imperial court
belongs to the Wen Family.

505
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,741
People with the surname Wen
are fortunate.

506
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,340
Young Master didn't need to live on
in degradation in Shouchun

507
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,541
if Old Master Qian'an
didn't pass away this soon.

508
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,420
The world

509
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:21,541
should've belonged to Qian'an
and the Wen Family.

510
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
However,

511
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:27,821
my brother and I
have to suffer all our lives.

512
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:34,140
Mother, Father told me to find you.

513
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,100
Mother?

514
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,260
Mother, is there a guest in your room?

515
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,140
Have you forgotten about my teachings?

516
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,861
You should've knocked before coming in.

517
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,180
Leave right now!

518
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:48,901
Wait!

519
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,100
This must be the young lady
of the house.

520
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:29,380
You're a beautiful lady indeed.

521
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,861
This is a meeting gift for you.

522
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,021
Young Lady,

523
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,541
please accept it.

524
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
Young Lady, you've reached the age
to pin your hair, right?

525
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,021
Speaking of which,

526
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,701
it's been one year
since our madam passed away.

527
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,380
Ling is still young.

528
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,460
My husband and I

529
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,861
plan to keep her in the family
for a little longer.

530
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:12,420
Besides,

531
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:16,340
Official Peng is as old as my husband.

532
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:18,581
Their age gap is too wide.

533
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,100
Age doesn't matter

534
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,220
as long as he's considerate

535
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,821
and knows how to dote on her.

536
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,180
Official Peng hasn't recovered
from his asthma yet, right?

537
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,661
He shouldn't be trying
to get a new bride

538
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,581
when he hasn't recovered
from his sickness.

539
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:40,500
Madam Wen Xiu, don't forget

540
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,741
why my master
was injured in the first place.

541
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,140
He wouldn't have been crippled

542
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,941
if he didn't carry
Lord Qian'an on his back

543
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,821
and traversed through the miasma!

544
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,821
He couldn't produce any offspring

545
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:58,021
because of that.

546
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,581
People

547
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:04,260
may forget about his kindness,

548
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:10,021
but Madam Wen Xiu,

549
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:13,100
you should not.

550
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:17,781
Naturally, I won't.

551
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:19,941
I will help Official Peng

552
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,340
to find a new bride in the capital.

553
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:24,941
But he shall not marry Ling.

554
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:28,260
Young Master is stuck in Shouchun.

555
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:33,060
He misses his family a lot.

556
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,701
He might be relieved

557
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:39,901
if he can see his niece for once.

558
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:44,701
Although my master and Young Master

559
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,140
are brothers of different surnames,

560
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:48,821
there's still a gap

561
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:51,060
between them.

562
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:54,821
If they can have a marriage alliance,

563
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,701
they will become blood relatives.

564
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,781
That way, Young Master won't be
able to command him around.

565
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:16,901
What happened between you and Lady Wang

566
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:18,541
was just a trifle.

567
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,741
Why are you bringing it up
in front of His and Her Majesty?

568
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,621
You're ruining their peace here.

569
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:33,541
Since His and Her Majesty
treat Zisheng as their son,

570
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:35,500
they're my elders.

571
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,340
Naturally, I have to tell the elders

572
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:40,220
about what happened in the family.

573
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,460
Speak up.

574
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:53,621
That day,

575
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,701
Lady Wang and the others

576
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,460
insulted me in public

577
00:33:57,741 --> 00:33:58,781
and said that I was pretentious

578
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,500
and hypocritical.

579
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,500
I thought it was something serious.

580
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:06,140
So, they were just jealous of you.

581
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,100
Your Highness,
please let me ask you this.

582
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,380
If I'm truly devious and pretentious,

583
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,340
does that mean General Ling

584
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:13,741
was bewitched by a foxy lady?

585
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:16,380
Does that mean His Majesty
was wrong about our marriage then?

586
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:18,260
If I don't tell His Majesty about this,

587
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,500
doesn't that mean people will think

588
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:22,941
that General Ling was bewitched
by a foxy lady?

589
00:34:24,781 --> 00:34:25,581
Your Majesty,

590
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:28,180
I know it was a trifle between
me and Lady Wang.

591
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,581
However, Your Majesty also knows

592
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,541
that a silver tongue
is enough to ruin a nation.

593
00:34:32,981 --> 00:34:35,021
Your Majesty, your family affair
is the affair of the state.

594
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,581
If your family is not harmonious,
I'm sure the nation will be the same.

595
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,420
For the sake of my family and nation,

596
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:41,140
I have to complain about her.

597
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,581
Actually, I don't want

598
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,661
to pick on Lady Wang for her mistake.

599
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:46,861
However, Lady Wang

600
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:50,021
is very stubborn about Zisheng.

601
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:52,541
If I tolerate her this time,

602
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,380
she will pester me again.

603
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,180
If she commits a bigger mistake,

604
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,701
it'll worsen the situation.

605
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,340
I've improved the situation

606
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,581
by complaining about her.

607
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:03,140
Shaoshang is right.

608
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:06,220
Ever since Zisheng and Shaoshang
were engaged,

609
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:08,581
Ling had been displaying

610
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:09,901
her rage in public.

611
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
She kept saying

612
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,180
that Shaoshang wasn't
good enough for Zisheng.

613
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,380
I've heard about them.

614
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:17,941
Am I right?

615
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:21,661
I did hear about them as well.

616
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,901
Among the ladies who were
obsessed with Zisheng,

617
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,380
Wang Ling

618
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:28,340
was one of the most prominent ones.

619
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:33,861
You guys are right.

620
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,581
So, whose fault is this?

621
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,100
However,

622
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,100
we do need

623
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,821
to teach Wang Ling a lesson

624
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,420
so that

625
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,340
she won't stir up trouble in the future.

626
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
I will send Cao Cheng

627
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:54,701
to the Cavalry General's Residence.

628
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:57,861
Shaoshang,

629
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,100
I've discussed this with His Majesty.

630
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,021
Since you're getting married to Zisheng,

631
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,140
you have to understand
the palace rules well.

632
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,621
You should stay in Changqiu Palace

633
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:10,541
for a certain period.

634
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:12,821
I will take my time

635
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,861
to teach you about the palace rules.

636
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:17,420
But...

637
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:18,821
But what?

638
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,260
The empress is teaching you personally.

639
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,821
Are you unhappy about that?

640
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,220
Your Majesty,

641
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:29,380
Empress Xuan,

642
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:30,661
Marquis Quling and his wife

643
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,741
never returned home for over a decade
due to the war.

644
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,781
Shaoshang never got to spend
much time with them since young.

645
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,741
After she gets married to me,

646
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,380
she will have to move out
of the residence.

647
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:41,541
Shaoshang cannot bear
to part with her family,

648
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:44,701
and I cannot bear for her to suffer.

649
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,541
I think

650
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:49,100
we should let Shaoshang stay at home.

651
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,180
I shall send her

652
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,941
to Changqiu Palace every day

653
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:53,380
for her studies.

654
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,821
You'll send her here personally?

655
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:02,485
If Zisheng doesn't mind it,

656
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:03,821
I think

657
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,420
it's viable.

658
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,180
If so, we'll follow His Majesty's will.

659
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,861
Zisheng, you are to send Shaoshang

660
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:13,861
to Changqiu Palace early in the morning

661
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,060
and bring her home in the evening.

662
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,981
Rest one day every ten days.

663
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,140
What do you think?

664
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

665
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:33,500
I won't get married to him!

666
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:37,781
Shouchun is too far away
from the capital!

667
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,661
And it's a barren land filled with
vulgar people!

668
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,180
It's unfit for human habitation!

669
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:46,420
Your uncle has been living there
for so long.

670
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:48,220
Why can't you do the same?

671
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,340
(Wang Chun)

672
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
(Wang Chun)
Cheng Shaoshang is getting married to Ling Buyi

673
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:53,741
while I have to be married
into that barren land?

674
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:54,981
Why should I?

675
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,060
She always despised me.

676
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,821
If this does happen,

677
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,741
I'm sure she'll mock me to no end!

678
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:07,460
She's just the daughter of a general.

679
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:09,661
Why do you have to mind her opinion?

680
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,981
If you get married to Official Peng Kun,

681
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,140
no one will dare to laugh at you.

682
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,100
Official Peng

683
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,541
is the benefactor
of the Qian'an Royalty.

684
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,140
You have to get married to him
one way or another!

685
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,500
I won't!

686
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,420
Father!

687
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:29,180
If I do marry myself into Shouchun,

688
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,941
you won't be able to see me again!

689
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,380
Father, can you bear to let this happen?

690
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,100
My dear,

691
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,021
she's our only daughter.

692
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,460
How could you bear

693
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,100
to let her be married to Peng Kun?

694
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,060
The ancestral heritage

695
00:38:49,581 --> 00:38:52,100
of my tribe is in Shouchun.

696
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,140
With my younger brother's capability,

697
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,621
it's just a matter of time
before he can stage a comeback.

698
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,180
By then,

699
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:00,100
every lady in the world

700
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,861
will be envious of our daughter

701
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:03,100
for marrying herself into Shouchun.

702
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,140
The capital is nothing!

703
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:07,541
Uncle wouldn't have stayed in Shouchun

704
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:09,260
and be suppressed by Peng Kun

705
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,661
for so many years
if he was truly capable!

706
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:11,581
Such audacity!

707
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,500
The Qian'an Royalty

708
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,701
is just down-and-out at the moment.

709
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:20,420
Back then,

710
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,180
without our tribe,

711
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,661
the current emperor

712
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:25,741
wouldn't have received
a million soldiers

713
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,621
and eradicated
the remnants of Emperor Li.

714
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:29,781
Even the empress

715
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,060
was only able to survive until now

716
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,981
because we took her in.

717
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,701
Our tribe had sacrificed everything
for the world.

718
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,380
Your uncle is the only descendant left.

719
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,060
The world is in the Wen Family's debt!

720
00:39:43,741 --> 00:39:44,901
The Wang Family

721
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,621
has no right to reject this!

722
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,100
Mother.

723
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,661
However,

724
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:10,861
we're your family here.

725
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,180
If my tribe

726
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,541
didn't become despondent

727
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:23,340
after my father's passing,

728
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,100
there was no way for me

729
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,460
to become a family with you.

730
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,701
Attendant Cao has arrived
with His Majesty's oral edict.

731
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,060
Madam Wang,

732
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,621
please kneel and receive
His Majesty's oral edict.

733
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,140
As a descendant of
the Qian'an Royalty,

734
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,781
how could I kneel in front
of a castrated man?

735
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:09,901
Madam Wang,

736
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:10,981
you...

737
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,741
You're disrespecting His Majesty.

738
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,180
Let go of me!

739
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,420
His Majesty has spoken.

740
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,541
Wang Ling, the daughter of
the Wang Family,

741
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:40,021
acted arrogantly due to
her noble background.

742
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:44,701
She insulted the marriage of the Lou Family
and slandered Lady Cheng.

743
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:47,460
Wang Chun, the Cavalry General,

744
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,981
has been negligent in disciplining her,

745
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,420
causing her to be disrespectful and rude.

746
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,460
On account of their relationship
to His Majesty,

747
00:41:56,821 --> 00:41:59,021
both father and daughter are
to reflect upon their own actions

748
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,821
to serve as a warning to the public.

749
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,180
Madam Wang,

750
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,380
you should thank His Majesty's grace.

751
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,340
My dear, what are you doing?

752
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:41,380
You could've disciplined her
in private if she was in the wrong.

753
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,460
Why did you hit her in public?

754
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,460
What did I

755
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:46,941
teach you usually?

756
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,621
You have the blood of
the Qian'an Royalty!

757
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:52,140
If anyone dares to bully you,

758
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,581
you should've retaliated!

759
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,981
You can be arrogant

760
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:57,340
and domineering on your usual days.

761
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:58,861
You can do whatever you like!

762
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,781
But you mustn't disgrace me
like what you've done today!

763
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,180
His Majesty

764
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:09,821
actually put me on the spot

765
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:11,021
because of a general's daughter?

766
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,021
Xuan actually didn't
stop him from doing so?

767
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:16,821
Back then,

768
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,100
I would've become the empress

769
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:22,260
if I didn't hail from the same lineage
as His Majesty.

770
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,941
There was no way Xuan Shen'an
could become the empress!

771
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:26,621
Let's go.

772
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:28,541
I'll bring you to the palace
and reason with her.

773
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:29,340
Bring me to the palace?

774
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:32,260
But His Majesty had ordered me
to reflect upon my actions at home!

775
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,541
You're defying the imperial edict!

776
00:43:33,941 --> 00:43:35,340
I'm not scared of the emperor!

777
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,500
I'm scared!

778
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:38,781
The Wang Family is scared.

779
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:48,021
All of you are scared of him, huh?

780
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:50,861
I will never yield to him!
