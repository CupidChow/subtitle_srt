00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like The Galaxy=

2
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,800
=Episode 29=

3
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,929
What is this smell?

4
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,010
It's a newly mixed fragrance
for sleeping.

5
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,370
You can tell me
the type of fragrance you like.

6
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,729
When you start studying at the palace,

7
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,770
you can rest here.

8
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,129
Did you clear out this place

9
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,530
just so I can rest, Your Majesty?

10
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,370
Don't you think this is too wasteful?

11
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,210
A young lady should be pampered.

12
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,009
You left home to enter the palace

13
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,409
to study under me.

14
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,169
It's already hard, to begin with.

15
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,650
If I can't let you feel at ease,

16
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,370
won't I be sorry to your parents

17
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,530
who think of you day and night?

18
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,650
Take a look around.

19
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,250
You can tell me
if you still need anything else.

20
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:02,409
By the way,

21
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,849
Zisheng said

22
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,530
you like drawing craftsmen's designs.

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,250
So I ordered Madam Zhai

24
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,650
to place a long table,

25
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,490
especially for you to draw your designs.

26
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,370
Your Majesty,

27
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,090
my mother never prepared

28
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,849
such things for me at home.

29
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,210
So you don't have to go
through the trouble to do these.

30
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,210
Your mother is a female general
who fought in battles.

31
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,530
She's decisive and firm.

32
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,330
So she can be very strict

33
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,009
when it comes to raising her children.

34
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,849
I just complained about your niece

35
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,129
in front of His Majesty.

36
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,930
Aren't you mad at me?

37
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,689
Not at all.

38
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,970
Is it because I'm General Ling's
future bride?

39
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,490
That's why you treat me nicely?

40
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,370
Not exactly.

41
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,810
I'm naturally curious and fond

42
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,729
of the woman whom Zisheng adores.

43
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:05,129
I also heard you had a rough childhood.

44
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,449
When I see how clever
and sensible you are,

45
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,009
it made me all the more want

46
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,129
to treat you better
from the bottom of my heart.

47
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,289
But I was never a sensible child.

48
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:25,130
I just complained about Wang Ling.

49
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:26,970
I'm sure I've given you

50
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,489
a lot of trouble.

51
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:32,210
Ling has her mother's family,
Lord Qian'an's Mansion support.

52
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,690
She has never suffered many grievances
since she was young.

53
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,249
But you're different.

54
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,530
You grew up without your parents
since young

55
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:44,289
and suffered mistreatment
by your grandmother and aunt.

56
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:48,210
I was in a similar situation too.

57
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,809
So I know how hard it was to survive.

58
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,049
Thus, it's hard not to take pity on you

59
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,090
and be partial to you.

60
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,690
Even if you don't behave well,

61
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,729
I don't feel offended at all.

62
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,010
So do you know how much I favor you?

63
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:18,929
Thank you, Your Majesty.

64
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,409
I understand that now.

65
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:41,210
I'm sure you didn't complain
about Wang Ling

66
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,090
just to stop her
from pestering you, right?

67
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,090
You were clearly

68
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:49,690
testing His and Her Majesty

69
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,690
to feel them out

70
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,530
and see how they treat you, that's all.

71
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,690
I'll be spending time
with Her Majesty after this.

72
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,450
If I don't know them,

73
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,210
how can I protect myself?

74
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,929
So have you seen

75
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,249
Her Majesty's temperament?

76
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,450
Her Majesty is truly a wonderful person.

77
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,210
Even if she told me

78
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,210
she was partial to me

79
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,489
because she sympathized
with my childhood,

80
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,650
I don't feel embarrassed at all.

81
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,169
Do you know

82
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,849
the feelings of being favored?

83
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,929
Her Majesty treats me well

84
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,409
even when she doesn't know me very well.

85
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,010
Her Majesty has a really soft heart.

86
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,409
Sometimes it may not be a good thing

87
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,849
to have a soft heart.

88
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,210
Why do you say so?

89
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,609
You can ask me

90
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,770
about His and Her Majesty's temperament

91
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,770
if you're curious next time.

92
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,330
Don't put yourself in danger again.

93
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,130
But I also want them
to use the chance to know

94
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,369
what kind of person I am.

95
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,929
I don't like to be

96
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,210
in a helpless situation

97
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,729
and just follow the crowd.

98
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,489
Even if dying during a struggle,

99
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,530
I don't want to sit still
and be at a loss what to do.

100
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:10,249
Then have you heard

101
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,369
of my story?

102
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,010
I grew up in Changqiu Palace.

103
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,169
So?

104
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,530
So do you really want to know

105
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,169
what kind of person I am?

106
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,570
What kind of person are you?

107
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,330
Come with me.

108
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,130
Slow down, your leg.

109
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:05,289
Ling Buyi,

110
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,849
I can't run anymore.

111
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,330
When I was a child, I always came here

112
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:22,770
to watch the myriads of twinkling lights

113
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,530
dazzling brightly like the stars.

114
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,570
At that time,

115
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,169
I was shorter than this wall here.

116
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:29,849
So if I want to look at the lights,

117
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,450
I had to climb up the wall.

118
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:34,009
At that time, I started longing.

119
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,450
Among these bright lights,

120
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,609
it would be nice

121
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,529
if I could have a bright light

122
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,970
that's truly mine.

123
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,090
That's easy.

124
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,369
No, it's not.

125
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,690
It's not easy at all.

126
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,970
Niaoniao,

127
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:02,649
do you know

128
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,450
why I joined the military?

129
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,849
I heard

130
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:09,769
it was because you worship your uncle,
General Huo since young.

131
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:12,090
I joined the military

132
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:15,249
to repay His Majesty for raising me

133
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,970
and

134
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,729
hope I can protect the people

135
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,129
among the galaxy on earth

136
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,609
on the battlefield.

137
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,849
What's the matter?

138
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,290
I want to stand closer
so I can see better.

139
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,050
See what?

140
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,369
See the starlight in your eyes.

141
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:57,849
Then you should stand closer.

142
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,769
So you can see better.

143
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,410
To see what better?

144
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:08,970
Look at the brightest star

145
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:11,810
in my eyes.

146
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,050
That's you.

147
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,369
Who's there!

148
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:30,810
Someone's coming. Make a run for it.

149
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,729
Why should we?

150
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,529
General Ling.

151
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,609
Did you see

152
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,210
anything just now?

153
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,330
I didn't see anything.

154
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,609
Nothing?

155
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,090
Then take a good look.

156
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,210
Let's go.

157
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,930
Come on. Let's go.

158
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:13,369
Why are you behaving in such a manner?

159
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,889
Don't tell me

160
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,009
His Majesty wants
to raid Cheng's residence

161
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,330
because you caused
Ling Buyi to fall off a horse.

162
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,050
Should we start packing

163
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,129
and escape overnight?

164
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:28,410
His Majesty didn't blame me.

165
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,649
Then why do you look frightened

166
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,609
with your face red and neck swelling?

167
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,090
I can let it go
if you said my face is red.

168
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,090
Why did you have to mention my neck?

169
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,690
Is that a nice thing to say
about a young lady?

170
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:46,450
I just feel nervous when I think

171
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,609
about learning rules
at the palace tomorrow.

172
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,410
You're going to learn some rules
at the palace tomorrow?

173
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,129
That's great!

174
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:56,729
I mean

175
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,570
that's so unfortunate.

176
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,970
It must be bad not being able to go home

177
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,290
after all that lecture.

178
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,210
So take care. I'm going to bed now.

179
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,769
What is it?

180
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,849
Song,

181
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,849
have

182
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,769
someone ever kissed you before?

183
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,889
Someone! Someone! Someone...

184
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,649
Why do you ask?

185
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:25,489
Do you know...

186
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,330
You must not tell anyone, understand?

187
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,570
Of course, I won't tell anyone.

188
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:36,170
But I'm sure you know...

189
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,090
It's hard to hide it from our parents.

190
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,210
You know Mother's eyes blazing
with anger when she's mad.

191
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,009
If she finds out...

192
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,570
You must not say anything
if you want to live.

193
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,330
You're right.

194
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,849
Without a doubt,
I'd be dead meat if I tell her.

195
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,570
If neither of us says anything...

196
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,330
- Loyal sister.
- Good brother.

197
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:00,649
- You're righteous, indeed.
- You're righteous, indeed.

198
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,170
Song,

199
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,290
have

200
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,849
someone kissed you before?

201
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,729
(Why did he cover his mouth?)

202
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,090
(To see what better?)

203
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:24,970
Look at the brightest star

204
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,050
in my eyes.

205
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:30,849
(That's you.)

206
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:58,529
Young Lady.

207
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,290
Young Lady.

208
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,769
It's already morning.
Why are you still sleeping?

209
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,569
Young Lady, get up.

210
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,170
Young Lady, wake up now.

211
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,850
General Ling's carriage
is waiting outside.

212
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,450
You're entering the palace

213
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,650
to learn rules from Her Majesty.

214
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:24,930
You must not be late.

215
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:29,370
Young Lady, wake up now.

216
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,690
When it comes to studying,

217
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,210
she always doesn't sleep well at night.

218
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,650
Luckily, I've prepared in advance.

219
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,009
Lianfang,

220
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,089
you're more and more meticulous now.

221
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,930
I'm sure you're worried
I don't have time for breakfast

222
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,769
that I go study with an empty stomach.

223
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,249
That's why you've prepared
all these, right?

224
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:07,289
No.

225
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,769
These are for nourishing your brain.

226
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:12,049
Or else

227
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,890
you won't be able to come home
when it's already dark.

228
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,009
Qi,

229
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,529
why do we have to wake up so early?

230
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,410
Young Master walked under the moonlight
until the wee hours last night.

231
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,089
I didn't sleep a wink
because I was accompanying him.

232
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,890
I'm so sleepy now.

233
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,370
Isn't this Young Master's

234
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,769
first time kissing a lady?

235
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:51,769
He was swept away by it.

236
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:53,170
It'll happen to you too.

237
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,690
To sleep more,

238
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,890
I don't need to kiss
any lady my whole life.

239
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,289
Then you should stop dreaming

240
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:02,210
because we'll be waking up
this early from today.

241
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:04,210
Why?

242
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:05,610
Because someone is worried

243
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:07,970
about his future bride.

244
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,850
Spare me.

245
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,289
When will this be over?

246
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,569
Courtesy and way of walking.

247
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,890
So everything is a blessing from heaven.

248
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,890
With respect and integrity,

249
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,450
so everyone has their own narration.

250
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,130
Therefore,
there are worship and tolerance.

251
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:54,650
Greetings as a courtesy.

252
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,489
Courtesy must be detailed.

253
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,170
General Ling's carriage
is waiting outside.

254
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,569
Young Lady, time to wake up.

255
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,370
Please follow what I do.

256
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,489
Bow with your palm open.

257
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,210
Bow at each other.

258
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,569
It's a bow with your palm opened.

259
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:35,890
Bow at each other.

260
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,089
It's a bow with your palm opened.

261
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:39,489
Bow with your palm open.

262
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,289
Young Lady, get up now.

263
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:11,289
Follow the monarch after evaluation.

264
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,450
Abide the law
because of the consequences.

265
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,970
Suffering from the law
because of adhering to it.

266
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:20,769
Objects made from bamboo are used
for ceremonial rites.

267
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,690
To fill dates and chestnuts.

268
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,729
These are the words you've copied wrong.

269
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,489
I've circled them for you.

270
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,289
There are so many mistakes.

271
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,370
You've never learned
how to write since young.

272
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,529
So when you start learning
at this age,

273
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,210
it's only natural
that you have to work harder.

274
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,370
You write again if it's wrong.

275
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:04,049
I can't help but doze off

276
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,890
(when I read
these classic texts every day.)

277
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:16,249
There are some teachings
in the classic texts

278
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,370
that people of your age
can't comprehend.

279
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,930
If you don't know,

280
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,690
learning these
would naturally be boring.

281
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,089
Some books

282
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,850
are read for others.

283
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,850
But is it really useful to us?

284
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:30,850
Not really.

285
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,009
So does that mean

286
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,850
when those ladies mock me
based on these texts

287
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,009
saying I'm incompetent

288
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,690
is actually not my bad?

289
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:39,769
Am I right?

290
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,210
I still can't solve

291
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:50,289
this puzzle ring until today.

292
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,370
I know how to do it.

293
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,370
I solved it.

294
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:22,410
Your Majesty,
this is the mechanism I've invented.

295
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,729
I'm proficient at poetry and classics

296
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,930
while you're proficient
in building mechanisms.

297
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,170
Everyone has something
they're good at.

298
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,089
I made this little crossbow.

299
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,529
(You know what others don't.)

300
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:39,729
(What others know,)

301
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:41,410
(I'll teach you slowly.)

302
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,009
(You'll know after some time.)

303
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,410
This gourd is for washing.

304
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,410
This gourd is for washing.

305
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,009
(You don't need to feel inferior.)

306
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,610
(You can hold your head high.)

307
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,130
(You're no less than them.)

308
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:02,450
I not only know how to build mechanisms.

309
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,289
I know how to make something else too.

310
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,210
Do you want to know what it is?

311
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,289
Lady Cheng!

312
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,529
Lady Cheng,

313
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,130
that's preposterous.

314
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,529
How dare you put your feet
on Her Majesty's back?

315
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,089
I was helping Her Majesty
to relieve her back.

316
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,690
Her Majesty says she has back problems.

317
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,450
This method can loosen the muscles

318
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,089
so they won't be too strained.

319
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,970
You can ask Her Majesty
if she feels better.

320
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,690
I do feel relieved.

321
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:39,850
I had no idea Lady Shaoshang
has such a skill.

322
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,529
Relax.

323
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:42,410
Lady Shaoshang,
please teach me some other day.

324
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,410
I want to learn how to do it too.

325
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,370
Lady Luo, are you learning it

326
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,970
so you can use it
on your future husband in the Northwest?

327
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,450
Madam Zhai, please don't tease me.

328
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,890
If I could,

329
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:53,650
I want to attend to Her Majesty

330
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,650
like Lady Cheng.

331
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:58,690
It's better than marrying
so far away from my family.

332
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,650
Speaking of which,

333
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,049
I'm envious of Lady Cheng

334
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:04,289
to have such fortune.

335
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:07,370
Lady Luo is the first person

336
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,610
who said I'm a fortunate person.

337
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,690
Lady Cheng,

338
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,089
you have no idea
how many girls are envious of you

339
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,049
that you can marry
a hero like General Ling.

340
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,690
Lady Luo, you don't have
to feel sorry for yourself.

341
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,289
The Jia Family is also a rich
and influential family in the Northwest.

342
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,529
You'll be the lady of the family
when you marry into that family.

343
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,170
I'm sure you won't suffer.

344
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,009
Don't stop me!

345
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:32,610
Who's clamoring outside the palace?

346
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,289
That's obviously Madam Wen Xiu.

347
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:35,890
I wonder what brings her here today.

348
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:37,690
Which Madam Wenxiu?

349
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,890
Her Majesty's cousin, Madam Wenxiu.

350
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,769
Wang Ling's mother,
whom you've complained to His Majesty.

351
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:47,450
Is she here to punish me?

352
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,850
If you're a court official,

353
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,529
I'm sure you're an official
who likes to flatter.

354
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,529
I was only telling the truth.

355
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:59,370
Palaces are forbidden areas
and she comes without being summoned.

356
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:01,450
How can she come as she wishes?

357
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,210
Isn't this double the guilty?

358
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,890
That's a proud thing to say.

359
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,130
So you're Lady Cheng.

360
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,930
You sure have good looks.

361
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:23,690
So did you use your look

362
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,089
to seduce Zisheng?

363
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,210
A young lady like you

364
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,210
only entered Changqiu Palace
for several days.

365
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,489
Yet, you've already learned

366
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,370
Her Majesty's means

367
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,769
to shut people out.

368
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,249
Shaoshang.

369
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,049
The furnishings here

370
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,769
are really crude and simple.

371
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,610
It looks like Aunt treats you

372
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,850
nothing more than this.

373
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,089
When I stayed in the palace as a child,

374
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,130
I used

375
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:40,450
a set of gold lacquerware,

376
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,450
raw silk brocade,

377
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,690
and Fengxigu fragrance.

378
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:45,970
I'd drink...

379
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:57,729
Zisheng especially
had someone deliver this cup.

380
00:27:58,329 --> 00:27:59,410
It doesn't burn your fingers, right?

381
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,610
Made of fine pottery.

382
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,249
Better than lacquerware, of course,

383
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,610
because it won't burn the fingers.

384
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,970
And this cushion.

385
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,009
Zisheng sent it here too.

386
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,970
He's worried I might hurt my knees

387
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,249
from kneeling all day.

388
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:20,089
So he especially sent a soft one for me.

389
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,410
It's the same one I have at home.

390
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,850
I'm just used to it.

391
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:25,410
Cheng Shaoshang,

392
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:27,329
stop bringing up his name all the time.

393
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,370
You only found a good husband.

394
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,850
You don't have to be so proud.

395
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,170
I have to.

396
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,610
If I don't,

397
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,009
you and your mother

398
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,890
won't feel upset.

399
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:37,930
You...

400
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,089
Shameless.

401
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,289
Lady Wang,

402
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,370
you won't believe me if I say this.

403
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,289
But I like you.

404
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,049
It's too late for you
to get on my good side.

405
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,089
It's because you're stupid.

406
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:55,049
I like you

407
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:58,610
because you're stupid enough.

408
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:01,130
I can easily hold something against you
whenever you say something.

409
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,130
From the first time
I met you at my house,

410
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,970
I think you should learn one thing,

411
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,970
that is keep to your mouth shut.

412
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,529
His Majesty has always been frugal.

413
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,729
I've seen Her Majesty's chamber too.

414
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:12,930
I don't see

415
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,249
any gold lacquerwares
or raw silk brocade.

416
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:17,049
How could you lie
without blinking your eyes?

417
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:18,610
Aren't you afraid
that His Majesty punishes you

418
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,930
for living extravagantly?

419
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,489
Those were the original furnishings
at the old palace.

420
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:23,769
Those were not purchased
with state funds.

421
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,170
So they're not yours then.

422
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:27,130
I don't want to talk to you.
You can leave now.

423
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,930
Who says those aren't mine?

424
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:30,089
Do you know

425
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:32,049
the expenditures
of the Qian'an royal family

426
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:34,529
are higher than this palace?

427
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,009
My maternal grandfather

428
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,890
was an important official
in the previous dynasty.

429
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,249
Since the time of my ancestor,

430
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:42,249
he was the richest man
with more than 10000 soldiers.

431
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,489
His Majesty and Consort Yue
are childhood sweethearts.

432
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,690
To form an ally with my grandfather,

433
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,170
His Majesty married Her Majesty
whom my grandfather has fostered.

434
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,930
It's too bad

435
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,529
since my grandfather died

436
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,930
during the battle in Gu City.

437
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,690
That's how

438
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:00,890
my family had fallen

439
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:04,690
into this state.

440
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:08,890
A royal family that is passed its prime.

441
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,249
You're sure protective of Lady Cheng.

442
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,170
The moment I arrived,

443
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,890
you sent her away.

444
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,489
Why?

445
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,410
Are you afraid I'm here
to teach her a lesson for Ling?

446
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:21,650
I wonder

447
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,769
what you see in Lady Cheng.

448
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,170
Ignorant, incompetent,

449
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,529
rude, and vulgar.

450
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:30,370
Some women

451
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,769
are really sad.

452
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,009
No husband to love them.

453
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:36,170
No capable sons.

454
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,089
A wicked daughter-in-law.

455
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,249
Even the daughter lacks virtue.

456
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:44,650
She could only shower her love

457
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,569
on an outsider.

458
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,289
Do you have resentment in your heart?

459
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:52,850
Is that

460
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,329
why you come here to humiliate me?

461
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,289
I have no resentment.

462
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,850
I'm not here to speak up
for the Wang Family.

463
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:04,049
I come here

464
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:07,170
because of my younger brother,
Young Lord Qian'an.

465
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,489
He sent me a letter

466
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,009
saying he's having a hard life
in Shouchun.

467
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,930
He wants the right to mint coins.

468
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:18,529
My younger brother is

469
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,529
the only male descendant alive

470
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,970
after Lord Qian'an died
for His Majesty's cause.

471
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,610
It's a small matter.

472
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,210
I'm sure you won't reject, right?

473
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,049
I've never meddled

474
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,049
in state affairs.

475
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,489
I'm not the one you should talk to.

476
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:38,729
What do you mean you never meddle?

477
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:41,690
Do you still remember

478
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,489
the kindness
of Lord Qian'an royal family

479
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:44,729
has shown you?

480
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:46,210
When your father died,

481
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,450
my family took you in!

482
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,529
You should be discreet with your words.

483
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:50,450
Why should I? I should say that to you.

484
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,009
I never bother to cause you trouble.

485
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:52,970
Do you really think

486
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,970
you're all that because you're
the country's empress?

487
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,890
Xuan Shen'an,

488
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,210
do you think you can treat me
with disdain

489
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:01,210
because you're the empress?

490
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:02,089
Madam Zhai,

491
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,370
what's going on?

492
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,009
Her Majesty and Madam Wenxiu are
in a middle of a dispute.

493
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,650
Her Majesty told us to close the door.

494
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,210
No one is allowed to enter.

495
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,329
Everyone praised you for being gentle,
courteous, and frugal.

496
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:13,329
Rubbish!

497
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:14,850
They should all see

498
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,049
how ungrateful you are!

499
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:20,489
When your mother and your siblings

500
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,249
stayed in my home,

501
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,130
I never mistreated you.

502
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,089
I shared everything

503
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:27,650
with you.

504
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:29,289
My father

505
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:31,489
treated you like his daughter.

506
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:34,210
He even picked
the best  husband for you,

507
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:35,729
that is His Majesty.

508
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,210
Have you forgotten all these?

509
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:40,089
I'll never forget

510
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,210
Uncle's kindness.

511
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:44,410
But my father is dead.

512
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,489
He's dead!

513
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,370
The family's soldiers are

514
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,569
either dead or scattered around.

515
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,569
His lifetime power collapsed.

516
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,769
I only have this younger brother.

517
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:58,650
His Majesty made him a living signboard.

518
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,210
He may be alive.

519
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,289
But he's just a step to death,
that's all!

520
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,610
It's all to prevent people

521
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,970
from saying His Majesty is an ingrate!

522
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,370
And you!

523
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,450
You're also an ingrate!

524
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,489
Your Majesty!

525
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:16,049
Mother!

526
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:17,249
Mother!

527
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:19,210
Shaoshang, your hand is injured.

528
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,089
Get Physician Sun here now!

529
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:22,249
Stop pretending already!

530
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:24,009
You want to send
for the physician, right?

531
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:24,850
Fine!

532
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,289
You can open the doors while at it.

533
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,249
So I can tell everyone

534
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:32,049
and let everyone in the palace see

535
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:33,170
how many skeletons

536
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:34,930
the palace owner has in her closet!

537
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,890
Do you really not know

538
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,249
why Her Majesty closed the doors

539
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,249
and not let anyone in?

540
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:38,890
Shaoshang.

541
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,329
Do you think Her Majesty fears you?

542
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,930
She's protecting you.

543
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,410
Let half of the nonsense

544
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,690
you just said leak out.

545
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:48,170
Do you think your descendant
will die a natural death?

546
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,210
It's only death.

547
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,130
Do you think

548
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,690
I, Madam Wenxiu am afraid of it?

549
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,569
If you don't fear death,
why are you here in Changqiu Palace?

550
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,009
You should see His Majesty directly

551
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,329
and reason with him.

552
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,289
Why are you here making things
difficult for Her Majesty?

553
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:09,330
What an eloquent young lady.

554
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,089
You're indeed the type
of lady that lad likes.

555
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,770
You're sure united.

556
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,649
I don't fear death.

557
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,049
His Majesty won't let me die either.

558
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,730
I just want to see

559
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:28,609
if our noble empress

560
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,730
has forgotten my father's kindness!

561
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,330
Showing kindness
without asking for a reward.

562
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,689
Even a vulgar person like me knows this.

563
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,609
I'm surprised that you didn't know that.

564
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,770
I wonder

565
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,169
if the late Lord Qian'an expected
his younger sister and her children

566
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,930
to repay his kindness
when he helped them?

567
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,489
I can't believe the late Lord Qian'an.

568
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:46,970
Why didn't he let his daughter marry

569
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,970
His Majesty?

570
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:49,930
Ah, that's right.

571
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,770
No one could predict
who'll lead the nation back then.

572
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,330
Of course, he couldn't allow
his daughter to marry His Majesty.

573
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,730
How dare you mock me!

574
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,089
Shaoshang, you must not be rude.

575
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:00,089
No, it's not like that.

576
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:01,609
My maternal grandfather and His Majesty
have the same paternal lineage.

577
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:02,850
No wonder.

578
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:04,649
So you and His Majesty are first cousins

579
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,689
from the same paternal grandfather.

580
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,209
Naturally, you can't marry His Majesty.

581
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,009
The late Lord Qian'an
wasn't partial to Her Majesty.

582
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,569
He married Her Majesty off
to His Majesty

583
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,089
because you can't marry His Majesty.

584
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,169
In this matter,

585
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:19,129
Her Majesty doesn't owe
you anything at all.

586
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,290
Xuan Shen'an,

587
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,890
are you going to watch her

588
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,970
ridicule me like this?

589
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,450
Stop making things difficult
for Her Majesty.

590
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:26,169
I said it.

591
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:28,689
If you think what I said offended you

592
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,250
and it was a mistake,

593
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:32,689
everyone in the capital knows

594
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,730
I'm a vulgar person.

595
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,569
I hope you can show me some generosity

596
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,970
and not stoop your level to
a lowly person like me.

597
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,169
Cheng Shaoshang,

598
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,370
who do you think you are?

599
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:43,970
Even your future husband

600
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,529
was born

601
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:47,209
of an abandoned madwoman.

602
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,089
He may have been raised in the palace.

603
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,049
Did he really think he's a prince?

604
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,169
Zisheng's accomplishments and glory come

605
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:57,689
from fighting with real weapons

606
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,730
on the battlefields himself.

607
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,970
It was not
because His Majesty favors him.

608
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,330
At least he's better than someone

609
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:07,049
who keeps holding on
to the late Lord Qian'an's achievements

610
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:08,370
and behaves wantonly at Changqiu Palace.

611
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,250
How dare you!

612
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,290
You're just a girl who has only been

613
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,930
in the palace for training
for a few days.

614
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:15,930
You only have half-knowledge
of the palace rules.

615
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:18,930
You have the audacity to teach me?

616
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,250
Today,

617
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,089
I shall teach you

618
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:24,169
the first rule of the palace.

619
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,209
What is the nobility of the royal family

620
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:27,649
and what are common people!

621
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,330
Stop it!

622
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:31,049
Xuan Shen'an,

623
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:33,330
you refuse to give my younger brother
the coinage rights.

624
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,609
You even tried to stop me
from teaching this foolish servant.

625
00:36:36,649 --> 00:36:37,569
I knew

626
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:39,290
you're an ingrate

627
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:41,770
who'd leave me to my doom!

628
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:43,529
You...

629
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:44,330
That's enough!

630
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,730
Your Majesty,

631
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,209
please forgive me for not receiving you.

632
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:54,529
Shen'an, you can drop the formalities.

633
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,049
Are you all right?

634
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,169
I just heard

635
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:03,049
that you repeatedly reminded the empress

636
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:05,970
not to forget the kindness
of the late Lord Qian'an.

637
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:08,370
Did you say that?

638
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,689
Why?

639
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,730
Uncle Xuan died early.

640
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:16,410
My father took my bereaved aunt in

641
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:17,890
and raised her children.

642
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,770
Can't I even speak

643
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,689
of these kindnesses?

644
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:22,730
Kindness

645
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:24,730
between families can never be settled.

646
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:26,609
Early in the beginning,

647
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,609
your grandfather met with danger.

648
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,129
At that time,

649
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,049
he overcame the obstacle

650
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,450
with the help of the entire Xuan clan.

651
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,569
After that,

652
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,009
the late Lord Qian'an protected
and aided the Xuan clan during the war.

653
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:38,370
This is also repaying gratitude.

654
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:39,649
This comes and goes.

655
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:41,569
Are you going
to bring it up all the time?

656
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,770
Your Majesty,

657
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,770
my father died to protect Gu City.

658
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,689
I have dozens of siblings

659
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,850
who are scattered all over the country.

660
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,649
I only have my younger brother now.

661
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:52,290
Today,

662
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,569
I came to ask Her Majesty
to show me some grace.

663
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:56,009
Is that also wrong?

664
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:57,450
If you have a memorial to present to me,

665
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:00,009
why didn't you ask Cavalry General Wang

666
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:02,450
to present it to me
during the court assembly?

667
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,850
You chose to come here
and put the empress in a tight spot.

668
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,209
It's because you knew

669
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:12,089
she always tolerates and forgives you.

670
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:14,250
You were disrespectful to her today.

671
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,049
Your words and actions
had crossed the limit.

672
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:17,370
You lack proper conduct.

673
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:18,730
Do you know your crime?

674
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,169
Your Majesty,

675
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:21,930
I don't feel well.

676
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:23,370
We should

677
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,330
just stop here.

678
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,089
No!

679
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,569
I won't let it end here.

680
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,049
I want her to speak!

681
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:31,169
I can see

682
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,609
she hasn't finished
what she wanted to say.

683
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,529
Madam Wenxiu, you can choose

684
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,049
to stay here
and let His Majesty punish you

685
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,529
or follow my orders

686
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,890
and leave the palace.

687
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:00,089
His Majesty and Her Majesty
didn't raise you in vain.

688
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:04,009
I've never seen such
a tactful lapdog like you.

689
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,489
Your future wife sure is something.

690
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,370
She kept protecting Her Majesty

691
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,569
to the point
she doesn't even cherish her life.

692
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,129
My future bride and I
are naturally different from you.

693
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:17,649
Our lives

694
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,169
to you

695
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:21,569
are not as important
as Young Lord Qian'an's safety.

696
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,970
The late Lord Qian'an
didn't raise you in vain.

697
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,770
Someone like you
who knows nothing of parents' kindness

698
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,129
has always been cold-hearted

699
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:35,250
Of course, you don't understand action.

700
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,770
If His Majesty didn't order
my father to rescue Gu City.

701
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,850
He wouldn't have died without victory.

702
00:39:43,169 --> 00:39:44,450
Do you know

703
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,290
why the late Lord Qian'an died

704
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:48,049
before achieving any victory?

705
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,730
Of course, I do.

706
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,529
That year, Marquis Yue was
one step ahead of my father

707
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,489
in sending the men
to investigate the miasma.

708
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,370
After the men
who investigated the miasma died,

709
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,489
Marquis Yue informed my father about it.

710
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,850
It's a pity.

711
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,649
My father still wanted to save Gu City.

712
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:10,489
So he took the risk and led
his men into the miasma.

713
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,649
He lost his life in the end.

714
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,450
It was all to rescue your uncle

715
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,049
that my father died alone

716
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:21,770
in the wilderness.

717
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,330
If my father is alive,

718
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,930
we won't know

719
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,890
who'll gain supremacy

720
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:30,730
in this world.

721
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:32,730
Madam Wenxiu.

722
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:34,730
I'm afraid there's something fishy
behind this incident.

723
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,009
I suggest you pull back
before it's too late.

724
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:39,250
Don't fall into anyone's tricks.

725
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,970
What do you mean by this?

726
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,330
Marquis Yue never got along
with the Xuan clan.

727
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,089
He may not be telling the truth.

728
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,370
Why did you believe
without even questioning?

729
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,529
Also,

730
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,290
His Majesty

731
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,410
has done his best to fulfill his duty
towards Young Lord Qian'an.

732
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,290
He owns a copper mine.

733
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,730
He's definitely living in comfort.

734
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,930
I suggest you

735
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,730
do what you think is best.

736
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:07,129
Don't listen

737
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,970
to a one-sided story.

738
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,930
That year, Marquis Yue see

739
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,529
the late Lord Qian'an
as a thorn in the flesh

740
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:31,089
when His Majesty married Her Majesty.

741
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,290
He'd never be that nice
to scout the route for him.

742
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:35,689
How he wished
that the entire Xuan clan died

743
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,009
so Consort Yue can be the empress.

744
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,330
Keep a close watch on Marquis Yue

745
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:45,250
and continue with the investigation.

746
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:47,410
Yes, Young Master.

747
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,810
I was wondering who was chased out
from the Changqiu Palace.

748
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:01,250
So it's you.

749
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,169
Her Majesty is
the most generous and kind.

750
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,850
Why is she not putting up
with you today

751
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:13,649
that you have
to leave feeling humiliated?

752
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,250
This is between the Wen Family
and Xuan Family.

753
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,569
You don't have to worry about it.

754
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:20,489
I heard you came here

755
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:23,129
to beg Her Majesty
regarding the coinage rights.

756
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,450
Why? Is Young Lord Qian'an
too poor to provide for himself?

757
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:29,209
Doesn't he know that he's incompetent?

758
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:31,250
I can't believe he's delusional enough
to covet the coinage right.

759
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,450
The poverty must have driven him insane.

760
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,770
I just said

761
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,410
you don't have to worry about it.

762
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,770
Third Princess,

763
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:38,609
