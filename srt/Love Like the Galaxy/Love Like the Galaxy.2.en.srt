3
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,319
Young Master,

4
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,920
His Majesty won't reprimand you

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,719
for investigating the case without
notifying him, right?

6
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,319
Why would His Majesty do so?

7
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,799
Young Master is
His Majesty's foster son.

8
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,039
How could His Majesty
bear to reprimand him?

9
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
Young Master,

10
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,439
didn't His Majesty grant you a pass

11
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
so that we could search
the house of any person

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,479
and do whatever we want?

13
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,840
Silence.

14
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,360
Did His Majesty grant you
the pass or not?

15
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,960
You think we're still
on the battlefield?

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,319
Violence is the only thing you know.

17
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,479
Now that we've returned victorious,

18
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,120
His Majesty said our merit was enough
to cover up for our crime.

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,759
However, regarding the armament case,

20
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,879
His Majesty wants us
to stop the investigation for now.

21
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,599
So, are we going to
stop investigating then?

22
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,560
When have I said so?

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,560
The armament theft has been
troubling me for many years.

24
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,680
We cannot stop our investigation.

25
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,039
But, didn't His Majesty tell us to stop?

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,439
You're such an idiot.

27
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,759
Young Master,

28
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,280
we've arrived at
Marquis Chengyang's Residence.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,199
We haven't visited Marquis Chengyang

30
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,960
ever since we arrived at the capital.

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,400
I had already heard about the gossip
within the imperial court

32
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,520
while we were still on the battlefield.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,919
(Marquis Chengyang's Residence)
They were just gossiping about how unfilial I was.

34
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,879
They gossiped plenty of things about me.

35
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,599
This isn't a big deal.

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,879
Old Madam, you must
take care of your health.

37
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,960
You mustn't let yourself fall sick.

38
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,599
It was my fault in the first place.

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,240
I didn't hide Uncle away well enough.

40
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,879
Initially,

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,159
I thought of hiding Uncle away
in the village.

42
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,800
I was sure that no one would find out.

43
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,919
I never expected Fourth Lady
to be that ruthless.

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,680
She held a grudge against me and Old Madam
for punishing her in the past.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,759
She actually took revenge against us.

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,319
It's all because of
your inferior arrangements.

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
You unreliable fool.

48
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,280
How dare you try to hide a criminal?

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,439
Do you know that everyone around you
will be punished for your sin?

50
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,520
You'll be truly unfilial

51
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,159
Old Madam was implicated
because of this.

52
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,439
So, according to you,

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,719
Uncle was arrested
because of Fourth Lady.

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
Not only did she not commit any crime,

55
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,879
but she also rendered huge merit?

56
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
Uncle embezzled the military armaments.

57
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,519
What's wrong with reporting him
to the authorities?

58
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,240
If you're unsatisfied,

59
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,839
you can argue with them
in the government office.

60
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,959
Don't think that you can
scare me with the government office

61
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,680
just because I'm a housewife.

62
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,680
I may not understand the situation
within the imperial court,

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
however, I know

64
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,600
that blood runs thicker than water.

65
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
How could we sell each other out?

66
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,519
You should come up with a way

67
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,160
and try to save him.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,279
Can you bear to watch Old Madam
suffer the pain

69
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,560
of losing one's family member
at such an age?

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,839
Those who embezzled military armaments
will face military punishments.

71
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,439
I'm not capable enough
to save him from that.

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,759
I don't care!

73
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Shi,

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,439
you have to save your uncle somehow.

75
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,560
Shi!

76
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,959
Shi!

77
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,079
Now, you're only

78
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,199
concerned about your wife's family.

79
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,199
You don't care about your uncle

80
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,720
and your mother at all!

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,399
Mother.

82
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
Last time, I told you
to give me 2,000 liang

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,279
so that your aunt can get herself
a new daughter-in-law.

84
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,600
You weren't willing
to fork out the money!

85
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,639
However, when the brother
of your wife wanted to pursue his study,

86
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,920
you provided him

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,839
with all the money he needed!

88
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,480
You're so biased!

89
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,720
You have no regards
for my brothers at all!

90
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,759
Other people use the dowries

91
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,240
they receive from the bride's family
to pay for their expenses.

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
Only my sister-in-law

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,720
uses the money from her husband's family

94
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,040
to pay for her family's expenses.

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
You don't call that
getting a daughter-in-law.

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,759
You call that getting a concubine.

97
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,000
He's still young.

98
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,560
Studying and getting himself a bride
is the way to go.

99
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,959
Besides,

100
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,879
Yuanyi and I

101
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,480
earned a living

102
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
by risking our lives on the battlefield.

103
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,560
Why can't she use our money?

104
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,279
We're a family.

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,279
Why is there a need to
separate the two families?

106
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,399
I know I'm not comparable to you.

107
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,279
You're being so calculative.

108
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,920
Could it be that
you despise Old Madam

109
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,319
for spending money on her family?

110
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,680
Old Madam,

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,920
that's definitely not the case.

112
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,439
All of you are bad eggs!

113
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Scram! All of you!

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,000
Brother-in-law,

115
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,240
sister-in-law,

116
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,000
this is quite the sudden visit.

117
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,000
We haven't got time to clean
and organize the main house yet.

118
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,120
I've cleared out some rooms
in the backyard.

119
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
Your entire family can stay there.

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,439
It's more convenient for you too.

121
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,079
You're asking my entire family
to stay in the side house?

122
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,720
How is that convenient?

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,160
Brother, it's been over 10 years

124
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,879
since you've met Fourth Lady, right?

125
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,199
If so, my arrangement

126
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,600
serves to form
a closer bond between you two.

127
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,399
We will gladly oblige, sister-in-law.

128
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
So pretentious.

129
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,439
I won't move out of the main house.

130
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,519
I'll see what you can do about it.

131
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,800
We've let down Niaoniao.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,160
Look at how pale she looks.

133
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,000
She doesn't look healthy at all.

134
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,720
I wonder how much
she has suffered at home?

135
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,920
Madam, Lianfang is here.

136
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,279
Understood.

137
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,080
Has Madam Ge ever hired
a physician for Niaoniao?

138
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,279
Second Madam said

139
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,879
children will get better by themselves
when they fall sick.

140
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,200
She has been ignoring the child.

141
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,080
We were sent to the village

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,000
from time to time
for the past few years.

143
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,759
Although her parents have been
fighting at the frontlines,

144
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,600
Young Lady never got
to spend a single cent of their money.

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
Not only were we lacking in
food and apparel,

146
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,559
but we were also not taken care of
when we were sick.

147
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,840
They just left us to sink or swim.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Why did they send Niaoniao

149
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,559
to the village and leave her to die

150
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,639
without any reason?

151
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,480
Second Madam couldn't bear a son even
after being married for over 10 years.

152
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,519
That's why they were planning to adopt
her 10-year-old nephew, Yao.

153
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,320
They brought Yao to the residence
just a few days ago.

154
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,279
Niaoniao gave Yao a gourd of honey

155
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,559
out of kind intention.

156
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,600
But no one expected

157
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,759
the bees to come when he opened the lid.

158
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,240
Yao was stung all over his head.

159
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
Second Madam wanted Young Lady
to reflect upon her own actions.

160
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,840
She sent her to the village

161
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,320
during the coldest season of the year.

162
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,799
Madam Ge is truly vile and vicious.

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
I should've asked second brother
to divorce her.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,480
Did Yao open the gourd of honey

165
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
himself?

166
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,279
Or did Niaoniao open it?

167
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,080
Young Lady opened it.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,279
He couldn't even open the lid

169
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,279
when he was 10 years old?

170
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
He actually asked Niaoniao
to open it for him?

171
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,000
He could've had the honey
inside his room.

172
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,200
Why must he have it in the yard
where there are flowers and bees around?

173
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,039
It's either you don't do it,

174
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
or you do it properly.

175
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,320
If not, you'll turn into
a laughing stock.

176
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,399
General,

177
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,960
I've inquired about it from a physician.

178
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,879
Niaoniao

179
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,759
didn't faint because of the cold.

180
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,440
It was because her stomach
and spleen were damaged.

181
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,320
She stuffed herself with too much food.

182
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,279
It's because Young Lady was starving.

183
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,559
They don't feed her well
during usual days.

184
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,600
They only sent her some food

185
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,879
as you guys brought her here in a hurry.

186
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,480
Our lady had starved for several days.

187
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,600
That's why she devoured all the food.

188
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,799
She was afraid that she might not
be able to have decent food again.

189
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,159
If not, there's no reason
for her to do so.

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,279
We initially thought that Niaoniao

191
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,440
had her needs taken care of
when we were fighting in the war.

192
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,399
No one expected her

193
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,480
to live such a pathetic life.

194
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,559
All right, I understand.

195
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,919
You may leave now.

196
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,519
Yes, sir.

197
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,039
Although Madam has already
left someone kind and trustworthy

198
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,840
to take care of Niaoniao,

199
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,879
Madam Ge still managed to get her way.

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,799
Now that I've returned,

201
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,279
I will never allow this

202
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,320
to happen again.

203
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,399
It's getting late.

204
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,600
General, you still need to
visit your second brother, right?

205
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'll go and check on him.

206
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,919
Sickness comes quickly but goes slowly.

207
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,919
Young Lady's health
is seriously affected.

208
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,159
I don't know how long it'll take

209
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,240
before she can fully recover.

210
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,679
She fainted at just the right time.

211
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,279
She gave us a reason

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,639
to criticize Old Madam's
way of treating her.

213
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,960
(My mother does have sharp eyes.)

214
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,279
(I'm afraid she has already
seen through my act.)

215
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,600
(If so, why did she turn a blind eye
to the person who mistreated me?)

216
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,279
Madam, you're thoughtful indeed.

217
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,960
You told them you guys would return
half a month later.

218
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,399
That's why they couldn't cover up

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,799
their evil deeds and
gave themselves away.

220
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,240
Madam, these people

221
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,000
bore grudges against you.

222
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,639
That's why they directed
their hatred to Young Lady

223
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,240
and mistreated her.

224
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,720
(So, it's not that they didn't know
I was suffering here.)

225
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,639
(They just leave me be.)

226
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,759
Master is so worried about Young Lady.

227
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,080
I guess he won't obey

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,919
all of the Old Madam's wills now, right?

229
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,799
Don't worry.

230
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,559
General would've died
in the battlefield long ago

231
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,919
if he exhibited such petty kindness.

232
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
General

233
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,519
knows how to identify right from wrong.

234
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
There are no wives

235
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,879
who cannot win against
their mothers-in-law.

236
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,679
It just depends whether

237
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,879
their husbands are willing to help them.

238
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,840
(She let her daughter
suffered on purpose)

239
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,240
(so that Father can fall out with
Grandmother.)

240
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,159
(Mother is truly ruthless.)

241
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,159
I'm not worried about my husband.

242
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm worried that it'll be difficult
to shape the next generation

243
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,080
if I leave them be
for the next 10 years.

244
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,240
That's why I can only
be strict with them

245
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,399
and try my best to
rectify their mistakes.

246
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,919
(Instead of dealing with the people
who bullied me,)

247
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,000
(she tried to discipline me instead.)

248
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,039
(I would rather
depend on myself than her.)

249
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,320
(Seems like I need to do this myself.)

250
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,440
(Prison of Judicial Review)

251
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,559
I ordered you
to monitor the Cheng Family.

252
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,679
Have you done so?

253
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,639
The Cheng Family
is in turmoil every day.

254
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,200
It's all because of the womenfolk.

255
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,559
I heard that Old Madam Cheng was angry

256
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,440
that Fourth Lady Cheng
betrayed her brother

257
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,679
and that she intended to punish her.

258
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,240
I've investigated them.

259
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,519
There's nothing wrong with
Cheng's Residence for the past few days,

260
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,039
except for Madam Ge,
the Second Madam of the family.

261
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,600
I've verified it.

262
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,960
The person who obstructed us
from investigating the residence

263
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,960
was Housemaid Li , the maid of the Second Madam.

264
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,600
Young Master,

265
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,519
the servant of the Cheng Family
sent this bundle to us.

266
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,799
He said this was prepared for
Young Master by Fourth Lady Cheng.

267
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,399
Could it be that she was trying
to bribe Young Master with money?

268
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,879
It's a bunch of junk?

269
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,279
The members of the Cheng Family

270
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,120
are filial indeed.

271
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:41,080
(Ge's Fabric Store)

272
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,720
Young Master,

273
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,679
just as you expected,

274
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,960
there's something wrong with
the accounts of the fabric store.

275
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,759
Head Armorer Dong invested 8000 liang
into this fabric store.

276
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
He only has a low salary.

277
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,159
That's why he must've embezzled
the government's money.

278
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,799
Young Master, you haven't thrown away

279
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,000
the junk that Fourth Lady
had teased us with?

280
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,399
Did Fourth Lady Cheng send them here

281
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,360
to tell us something
about the fabric store?

282
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,799
Dried straw.

283
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,919
It means that Head Armorer Dong was hiding
within the haystack back then.

284
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,840
And, the torn fabric
refers to the fabric store.

285
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,159
This is interesting.

286
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,799
Fourth Lady Cheng

287
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,759
took such a huge detour
to tell us about the truth.

288
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,200
Is she trying to get on our good side?

289
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,759
I think she wants us

290
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,759
to assist her in her escape.

291
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,080
Why should we do so?

292
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,279
I'm afraid she has already
found her own means

293
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,440
to escape.

294
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,840
I won't take this. Take it away.

295
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
This is medicine the imperial physician
had prescribed.

296
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,879
It's very effective.

297
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,639
Young Lady, please take some.

298
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,600
I've already recovered.

299
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,679
Why should I take this?

300
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,080
Not only will it heal you, but it will
also strengthen your body.

301
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,000
Young Lady, please take your medicine.

302
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,399
After that, you can have your snacks.

303
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,360
You can take it for me.

304
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:19,919
I!

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,799
Someone's here.

306
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,960
Quiet.

307
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,679
Why isn't my daughter doing any better?

308
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,919
Greetings, Father, Mother.

309
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,919
You may drop the formalities.

310
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,039
Why are you still so weak?

311
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,960
It's all because of Madam Ge.

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,000
My daughter's health
was seriously affected because of her.

313
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,519
She won't be able to
return to normal now.

314
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,640
Here.

315
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,480
Lie down.

316
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,680
The medicine is getting cold.

317
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,440
Hurry and feed the young lady.

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, Madam.

319
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,160
Here.

320
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,799
Just finish it. Here.

321
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,759
My daughter, why are you crying?

322
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,559
Father,

323
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,519
the medicine is too bitter.

324
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,759
Why don't we put some malt sugar

325
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,279
into the medicine?

326
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,039
How could you add random things

327
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,759
into the medicine prescribed by
the imperial physician?

328
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,799
As the saying goes,
good medicine tastes bitter.

329
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,680
You have to take this

330
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,319
until you recover from your sickness.

331
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,240
Your mother is right.

332
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,799
You should listen to your mother.

333
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,200
It's good for you. Drink up.

334
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,799
Niaoniao, be a good girl.

335
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,960
Once you get better,

336
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
I'll bring you to go horse riding.

337
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,559
We can enjoy the lantern party that will
be held after New Year together.

338
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,799
Our Niaoniao is a gorgeous girl.

339
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,319
Even if you put all those girls

340
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,440
from Wan's house together

341
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,920
into a bouquet,

342
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,559
Niaoniao is still
better-looking than them.

343
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,359
General.

344
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,039
It's vain to praise a girl

345
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,960
for her looks.

346
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,920
It's more important for her
to learn courtesy and virtues.

347
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,359
Niaoniao, finish it.

348
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,440
Drink up.

349
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,880
My goodness!

350
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,680
Old Madam is having a fit again.

351
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,359
We should check it out.

352
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,480
My goodness!

353
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
Stop drinking.

354
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,640
Later,

355
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,880
I'll put some malt sugar
into your medicine.

356
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,079
My brother!

357
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,039
Hurry up. The show will start soon.

358
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,599
I don't want to live anymore!

359
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,240
Cheng Shi won't just leave him to die.

360
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,279
Old Madam, please don't be silly!

361
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,880
Sister-in-law,

362
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,960
(Aunt Dong)
even if you wish to die, this is not the time!

363
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,559
If you die right now,

364
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,400
all hope will be lost for brother!

365
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,079
What has the Dong Family done wrong?

366
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,799
Why are they raiding our home?

367
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,279
If we set up a stage in the courtyard,

368
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,480
Grandmother can play
the entire troupe herself.

369
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,519
I don't want to live anymore!

370
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,160
Let me end my life!

371
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't stop me!

372
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,079
It's Father's turn.

373
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,759
I don't want to live anymore!

374
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,359
I'll end my life!

375
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
-Aunt!
-Old Madam!

376
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,960
Mother!

377
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,079
Why did you use so much force?

378
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,599
Were you truly trying to
push me into the well?

379
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,640
I was just scaring them.

380
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,519
Get out of the way.

381
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,039
What are you up to again?

382
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,839
Look at how small the well is.
Do you think you can fit inside?

383
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,279
You heartless scum!

384
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,319
Look at Grandmother.

385
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,720
Look at her strong limbs
and sturdy body.

386
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
It's a waste that she wasn't a general.

387
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,559
Even if she jumps into the well,

388
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,440
we should be grateful
if she doesn't create a new well

389
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,160
with the impact of her jump.

390
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,440
The well is small?

391
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,240
I can't fit inside? If so, I...

392
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,440
I'll bang my head into the wall!

393
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,400
I'll bang my head into the wall
and join your father!

394
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Hey, you should drag me.

395
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,279
I'll bang my head into the wall!

396
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,240
Old Madam!

397
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,279
Old Madam, are you okay?

398
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,000
Try it and tell me.

399
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,240
You should drag my arm!

400
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,839
Why did you drag my sleeve?

401
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,319
I didn't expect you
to exert that much force.

402
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,880
Do you really wish to see me die?

403
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,319
Uncle is still staring at us.

404
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,920
My goodness!

405
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,880
Say,

406
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,279
do you think Master

407
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,519
will fall for the Old Madam's trick?

408
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,319
Although Father is kind-hearted,

409
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,119
he's a general who has been through
numerous wars

410
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,759
and killed countless enemies.

411
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,880
Of course he won't be duped.

412
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,079
Old Madam!

413
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,839
He has been alongside Mother
for many years.

414
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,160
He has already mastered every trick

415
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,400
there is.

416
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,839
He won't lose if he engages

417
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,599
Grandmother in a battle of wits.

418
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,799
It's all my fault!

419
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,279
I was too incompetent to save Uncle!

420
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,039
I'm so pitiful!

421
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,640
Too pitiful!

422
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
General.

423
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,440
Brother-in-law, you...

424
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,319
Aren't you making things
difficult for Old Madam here?

425
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,240
We're a family.

426
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,440
No matter how difficult it was, saving
Uncle Dong should've been your priority.

427
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,559
My husband is going to kneel
in front of Old Madam.

428
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,079
Sister-in-law, you better
get out of the way.

429
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,200
Don't tell me you wish
to accept his bow too?

430
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,839
You're not worthy.

431
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,759
Get out of the way!

432
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,359
What are you doing?

433
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,079
Do you wish to laugh at me?

434
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,440
I told Mother before

435
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,359
that Uncle was a devious man.

436
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,640
Father is the son of Grandmother indeed.

437
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,640
His acting is pretty good too.

438
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,680
Young Lady, I guess
you take after your father too.

439
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,880
Why was he captured?

440
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm so pitiful!

441
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,039
All of my brothers are either dead
or separated!

442
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,559
Your uncle is the only surviving son
of the family!

443
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,640
He wouldn't have turned into
a greedy person

444
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
if it weren't for the terrible days
he had endured back then!

445
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,480
Why don't we

446
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,920
send all of our money

447
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,440
to him?

448
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,799
Wait...

449
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,039
That's right!

450
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,519
My nephew,

451
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,240
by saving your uncle,

452
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,359
you'll be saving your mother too!

453
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,559
We're a family and
we shouldn't be separated.

454
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,359
It's not that I don't want to save him!
I just can't!

455
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,839
That Ling Buyi

456
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,640
is just like Justice Pao.

457
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,880
If it weren't for the fact

458
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,039
that I had rendered merits
on the battlefield before I came back,

459
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,960
he would've arrested me

460
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,079
together with Uncle!

461
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,880
I don't dare to plead with him!

462
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,880
You heartless scum!

463
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,440
Are you going to do nothing
and let your uncle die?

464
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,799
Precisely!

465
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,039
Fine.

466
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,279
I'll report you to
the government office right now!

467
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,240
I'll report you for being unfilial!

468
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
I heard that our current emperor

469
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,279
emphasized filial piety the most.

470
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,079
If an official was reported for
being unfilial,

471
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,200
they'd be fined and given the rod.

472
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
If it was serious, they might be removed
from their positions too.

473
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,559
Let's see if you're afraid of that.

474
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,359
Old Madam,

475
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,880
do you know that going against
the filial code is a huge crime?

476
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,799
Getting the rod and his position removed
isn't a big deal.

477
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,279
What if they seize our assets
and execute the entire family?

478
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,319
What will you do by then?

479
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,200
Execute the entire family?

480
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,400
No one told me about that.

481
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,160
Mother, you can go ahead.

482
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,759
If you're reporting me
just because I didn't obey you

483
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,920
and help uncle to escape,

484
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,240
I have nothing to be afraid of

485
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
even if you report me

486
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,200
to His Majesty.

487
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,839
So, you're pressuring me
with national affairs

488
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,319
now that you're an official, huh?

489
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,000
From now on, I won't eat or drink.

490
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,400
Say,

491
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,319
do you think the Old Madam
is truly trying to kill herself here?

492
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,119
Why don't we make a bet?

493
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,559
She'll give up

494
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,000
within half a month.

495
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,559
Are you guys done?

496
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,759
Of course not.

497
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,319
This is just the first round.

498
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,000
Greetings, Mother.

499
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,440
Young Lady, did you catch a cold?

500
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,640
Maybe I caught a cold

501
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,079
when I was taking a walk just now.

502
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Mother, don't worry about me.

503
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,000
Why didn't you rest in your room

504
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,839
since you were feeling unwell?

505
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,039
It's windy out here.

506
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,799
You should rest in your room.

507
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,559
Don't come outside.

508
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,240
Yes, Mother.

509
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,200
I thought

510
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,319
my days would be happier

511
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,480
after Father and Mother returned home.

512
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,720
But now,

513
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,400
it seems like my days
won't be as carefree as before.

514
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,880
Even so, it's better for your mother
to discipline you than your aunt.

515
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,039
Madam feels sorry for you.

516
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,640
They're doing this for your sake.

517
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,160
You don't need to deceive me.

518
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,519
I won't fall for it anyway.

519
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:23,880
Spare me!

520
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,680
I'll confess!

521
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,079
I'll confess!

522
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,799
Please spare me!

523
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,160
Where are you bringing me?

524
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,440
This guy is so insensible.

525
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,960
He just had to lie

526
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,039
when Young Master
was asking him questions.

527
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,799
Young Master is
an intelligent individual.

528
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,480
Of course he could tell
that he was lying.

529
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,960
That's why he rewarded him
with a knee break.

530
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,640
What's a knee break?

531
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,240
It's when you stab

532
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,400
a person's knee with a knife

533
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,720
and dig out their kneecaps...

534
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,079
Please stop it.

535
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,799
We've already gone easy on him.

536
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,240
Last time, there was
another stubborn guy.

537
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,960
Have you ever heard of lead-filling?

538
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,359
It's when a person drills a hole
in another person's eyes

539
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,359
and fill them with lead.

540
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,680
Open the door!

541
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,720
General Ling!

542
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,680
General Ling!

543
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,279
General Ling!

544
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,000
General Ling! Please spare me!

545
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,240
Head Armorer Dong.

546
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
Please spare me!

547
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,960
General Cheng has already requested me

548
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,680
to enforce the law impartially.

549
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,759
No matter what you plan to do now,

550
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,960
it is all but futile.

551
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,880
I hate it the most
when people lie to me.

552
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,920
Whenever I encounter liars,

553
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
I will despise them

554
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,799
and kill them.

555
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,880
Now, I have the ledger
of Ge's fabric store with me.

556
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,119
How dare you lie to me?

557
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,359
General Ling! I was innocent!

558
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,200
Someone!

559
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,839
Sir!

560
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,160
Take him away.

561
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,440
Let's go!

562
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,880
General Ling!

563
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,640
I'll confess!

564
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,759
I'll confess everything!
Please spare me!

565
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,440
Please spare me!

566
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,319
My good sister,

567
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:59,720
let me take a look at you.

568
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,960
Why did you become so thin?

569
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,920
Old Madam, I thought I would
never be able to see you again!

570
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,440
Later, I'll find Ling Buyi

571
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,880
and inquire about Uncle's condition

572
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,400
so that Mother can stop worrying.

573
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,480
After all, Uncle was arrested
after Niaoniao sold him out.

574
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,559
I'm afraid Mother would make things
difficult for her.

575
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,880
Dear,

576
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,640
there is a way to kill
two birds with one stone.

577
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,039
Do you still remember Hu Ao?

578
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,160
Who?

579
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,440
Do you mean Mother's confidante

580
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,759
back then?

581
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,110
(Hu Ao)

582
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,200
It was chaotic out there.

583
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,079
I wouldn't be here

584
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,799
if your son didn't save us back then.

585
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,799
Back then, I was surrounded by bandits.

586
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,079
They were

587
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,359
trying to slash me.

588
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,160
Luckily, Colonel Cheng came
to our rescue together with his troops.

589
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,960
He intercepted the bandit's attack
with his spear.

590
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,440
It was a close shave.

591
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,799
Colonel Cheng's weapon wasn't
as durable as the bandits'.

592
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,640
His spear was broken.

593
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,480
Even without his trusty weapon,

594
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,000
with a body full of injuries,

595
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,400
he took the bandit's
long blade from his hands!

596
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,519
That was how he saved our lives!

597
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,240
A body full of injuries?

598
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,559
My son!

599
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,480
Were you hurt anywhere?

600
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,599
Take off your clothes
and show them to me.

601
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,920
Madam Hu is still here.

602
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,440
It's fine. Madam Hu has seen everything!

603
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,880
Hurry and take off your clothes...

604
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,880
Shi?

605
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,079
Shi!

606
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,519
I told you to join the war

607
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,880
to win honor and make a fortune from it.

608
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,279
I didn't ask you to sacrifice your life!

609
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,880
I have no choice but to risk my life

610
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,799
since I don't have any good weapons.

611
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,599
I've already notified her.

612
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,640
I think

613
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,079
we can make Old Madam see the truth

614
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,240
and tell right from wrong now.

615
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,359
On the battlefield,

616
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,680
one's weapon is their life source.

617
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,480
Some scoundrels actually

618
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,200
swapped the good weapons
with counterfeits

619
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,680
and sold them to our soldiers!

620
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,359
What a scoundrel!

621
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,319
Old Madam,

622
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,599
Madam Dong requests an audience.

623
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,319
Okay.

624
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Great timing.

625
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,720
Invite her in.

626
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,079
Yes, Madam.

627
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,839
My sister,

628
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,880
you may leave for now.

629
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,680
Thank you, Old Madam.

630
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,240
I'm sure Aunt is here
to make things difficult for you

631
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,319
because of Uncle's issue.

632
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,880
It's all because of
my incompetency and low rank.

633
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,559
Even if I beg Ling Buyi,

634
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,359
he might not let Uncle off.

635
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,640
Why don't I bear the blame for Uncle?

636
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,480
I'll say that Uncle Dong embezzled

637
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,839
the armaments under my order.

638
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,279
I will be executed.

639
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,000
Uncle Dong will be rescued.

640
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,160
The Cheng Family will be executed

641
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,599
instead of the Dong Family.

642
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,160
That's great!

643
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,200
That's a great idea!

644
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,480
That's an excellent idea!

645
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,680
My nephew,
you're a high-ranking official.

646
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,480
Even if you do commit a crime,

647
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,519
His Majesty will be
more lenient toward you.

648
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,839
At most, His Majesty will just fine you.

649
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,200
Sister-in-law,

650
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,200
why don't we let your son

651
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,400
bear the blame for him?

652
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,720
You vicious wretch!

653
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,880
How dare you try to harm my son?

654
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Yesterday,

655
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,519
there was no smoke
coming out from our chimney.

656
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,440
I thought something was off.

657
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,559
That's why I performed a divination.

658
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,319
It actually said

659
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,559
that the Cheng Family

660
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,800
would be in turmoil due to disturbance
from relatives.

661
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,199
The deities were right.

662
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,800
The Cheng Family will
perish in your hands!

663
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,559
My second daughter-in-law's fabric store

664
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,840
was also seized because of you two!

665
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,159
You and your family,

666
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,920
all of you are rotten apples!

667
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Someone!

668
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,119
Chase this vicious wretch away!

669
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,079
I'll break the legs of the person

670
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,800
who allowed her in!

671
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,719
Sister-in-law,

672
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,599
he was the one who said...

673
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,159
Shut up!

674
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,880
He said so himself!

675
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,400
He said that himself!

676
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,880
Mother, this is the result

677
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,360
when you only listen
to one side of the story.

678
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,519
Mother, you were duped by Uncle
and his family

679
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,400
into thinking that
they were closer to you.

680
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,039
You bullied and deceived

681
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,039
your own family instead.

682
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,719
The Cheng Family was
only able to lead a good life

683
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,480
because Yuanyi and I risked our lives

684
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,559
on the battlefield for many years.

685
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,920
Don't tell me you're going
to abandon everything

686
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,679
because of Uncle Dong's crime?

687
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,519
No!

688
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
I don't want that!

689
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,320
I don't want that!

690
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,920
I don't want that!

691
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,559
The Old Madam has been
in her room the entire day.

692
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,079
She said she wouldn't eat anything.

693
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,119
Mother was always the first
when it came to eating.

694
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,519
Now, she's not eating?

695
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,599
I'm afraid she has finally
straightened out her thoughts.

696
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,960
Finally.

697
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,800
Father, it's all because

698
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,440
you touched her heart with your words.

699
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,519
No matter how biased Grandmother is,

700
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,719
she shouldn't sacrifice
the entire Cheng Family

701
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,679
in exchange for Uncle Dong's life.

702
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,519
When eating, do not converse.
When in bed, do not speak.

703
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,239
Your parents are having a conversation.

704
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
You shouldn't interfere.

705
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,800
You guys haven't started eating yet.

706
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,000
Your grandmother isn't eating

707
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,000
partly because of your fault.

708
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,880
Fine. Let's eat.

709
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,239
Father,

710
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,400
I suddenly feel sick.

711
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,480
I'm afraid my stomach
hasn't fully recovered yet.

712
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Niaoniao is just like me.

713
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,880
She'll have a stomachache
whenever she listens to lectures

714
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,440
during mealtimes.

715
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,840
An ancient sage once said

716
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,119
that we must not lecture our child
during mealtimes.

717
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,440
Which sage was it?

718
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,639
Niaoniao,

719
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,800
you should have more meat.

720
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,119
I'm sure you starved yourself
when you were in the village.

721
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,519
Thank you, Father.

722
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,400
She shouldn't take meat
if her stomach is feeling uncomfortable.

723
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,159
It's better for her to
have an empty stomach.

724
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,599
Mother,

725
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,119
you must be starving.

726
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,159
Here, have some snacks.

727
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,199
Here.

728
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,639
It's been over 10 years
since I last saw you.

729
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,440
See how I changed.

730
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,719
Mother, I know you're worried about me.

731
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,000
You're

732
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,639
my first son.

733
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,599
How could I not worry about you?

734
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,840
You had only sent me

735
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,159
a few bamboo slips

736
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,079
over the past 10 years!

737
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,639
I thought you were slaying enemies
and rending merit on the battlefield.

738
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,719
I never expected you to suffer so much.

739
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,519
Mother, I wanted to write to you.

740
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,599
But you don't know how to read.

741
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,840
I just didn't want

742
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,320
Madam Ge to read the letter
I wrote to you.

743
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,719
No matter how vile she was,

744
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
you still used her dowries

745
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,079
to provide aid to
the Xiao Family, didn't you?

746
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:06,199
I don't know where her dowries went.

747
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,480
I, Cheng Shi, am
an honest and upright man.

748
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
No matter how vile I am,

749
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,280
I wouldn't use the dowries
of my sister-in-law

750
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,000
to support the family of my wife.

751
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,559
Xiao Yuanyi remarried!

752
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,719
Her family was shattered into pieces.

753
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,280
All of their assets had been sold off.

754
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,960
Even so, you still liked her.

755
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,000
That's right.

756
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,480
I won't marry anyone else besides her.

757
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,440
My son,

758
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,199
I dote on you
and your third brother the most.

759
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,239
However, ever since you two got married,

760
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,559
you two were only
concerned about your wives.

761
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,760
You two only spoke to your wives.

762
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,679
You two neglected your mother.

763
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,119
Isn't that the case

764
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,760
when a man establishes a family?

765
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,800
Even if it were 100 years later,

766
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,159
Mother, you should be
buried together with Father

767
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,239
while we would be buried together
with our wives.

768
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,519
They can't just bury
the three of us together, right?

769
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,760
I understand now.

770
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,760
Mother, you're just envious
of our spouses.

771
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:08,920
I?

772
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,760
I am not.

773
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,239
Father passed away
when we were still young.

774
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,400
I know you feel lonely.

775
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,559
Mother, is there anyone you fancy?

776
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,719
If there's someone you fancy,

777
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,360
remarrying him won't be a problem.

778
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,239
You!

779
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,960
As your juniors, we will never stop you.

780
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,599
What nonsense are you talking about?

781
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,639
When did I say I wanted to remarry?

782
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,880
You brat!

783
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,639
Mother, you need not be shy.

784
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:40,239
We knew that you'd contributed a lot

785
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,719
to the Cheng Family.

786
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,119
Mother, if you wish to remarry,

787
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,519
I and my siblings won't object to it.

788
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,360
Mother, if you give birth
to new siblings for us,

789
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,400
we will surely treat them
like our own siblings.

790
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,159
I!

791
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,880
Fine.

792
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,280
Fine then.

793
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,840
If you pass away early,

794
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,960
I'll definitely find another man

795
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,920
for your wife to remarry.

796
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,719
By then, she'll give birth
to a bunch of kids.

797
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,320
I'm not afraid of that.

798
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,079
Yuanyi isn't
an irresolute person like you.

799
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,400
You better scram!

800
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,480
You unfilial brat!

801
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,079
I'll beat you to death!

802
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,360
Scram!

803
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,199
You brat!

804
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,119
Mother, stop hitting me!

805
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,480
Father made Grandmother angry again.

806
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,719
Mother is always one step ahead.

807
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,360
She's letting her husband
doing her work on her behalf.

808
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,840
There's no need for her to make
threatening gestures in front of her.

809
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,039
Are you saying

810
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,000
all of this is part of my plot?

811
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,440
As a girl,

812
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,199
not only did you eavesdrop
on your elders,

813
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,679
but you also judged your elders.

814
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,519
This is preposterous.

815
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,239
Give me your hand.

816
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,800
From tomorrow onward,

817
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,599
Niaoniao is to read and copy
"The Book of Rites" in her room.

818
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,519
She's not allowed to go out
until she finishes copying it.

819
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,199
But...

820
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,960
But Father said

821
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,559
there would be a lantern party
during Lantern Festival.

822
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,800
I've never attended one in my life...

823
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,880
Elders make the call in the house.

824
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,480
You will stay at home and study.

825
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,000
Mother brought a ruler with her

826
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,559
just to find faults with me.

827
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,119
Young Lady, you misunderstood Madam.

828
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,440
Madam didn't bring the ruler here
in order to discipline you.

829
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,599
Madam cared about you.

830
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,960
She just did that in a fit of rage.

831
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,719
I will try to speak to Madam again.

832
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Young Lady,

833
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:09,519
don't be sad.

834
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,440
What's there for me to be sad about?

835
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,280
I don't care about
Mother's opinion of me anyway.

836
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,599
A loving mother and filial child

837
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,960
is the direct opposite
of our relationship.

838
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,079
I won't feel sad

839
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,480
about losing it

840
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,119
since I don't own it in the first place.

841
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:16,840
What's wrong with you?

842
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,719
Don't tell me Old Madam beat you up?

843
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,559
Mother was jealous of our love.

844
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,079
I suggest her to remarry
out of kindness,

845
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,199
but she threw a fit instead.

846
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,760
What did you say?

847
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,119
You suggested her to remarry?

848
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,840
Was I wrong?

849
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,679
She's been pretty irritable
these few days.

850
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:37,159
I'm afraid it's because of
the imbalance in Yin and Yang.

851
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,880
Old Madam did the right thing.

852
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,440
I should give you another beating
to complement hers.

853
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,039
Back then,

854
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
I thought Erlang
could join the government office.

855
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,360
When you don't discipline a child well,

856
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,639
they will grow up
to be prodigals or criminals.

857
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,800
No matter how willful a girl is,

858
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:01,599
at least we can protect her.

859
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,480
Moreover, the battlefield is dangerous.

860
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,119
I didn't want her
to suffer alongside us.

861
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,599
But I didn't expect Niaoniao

862
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:09,559
to be a troublemaker as well.

863
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,400
I regret my decision

864
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,360
for entrusting our girl to Madam Ge.

865
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,039
She actually learned
all the bad things from her.

866
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,360
Eavesdropping on people,
tricking people,

867
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,800
even teasing her elders.

868
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:22,159
Those are not the behaviors
of an excellent lady.

869
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,960
Dear, calm down. Please be appeased.

870
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,000
Since Madam Ge didn't teach her well,

871
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,719
we could take our time to teach her.

872
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,719
Take our time?

873
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,639
We cannot afford to take our time.

874
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:33,360
Do you expect her husband to teach her

875
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,559
if I fail my duties as her mother?

876
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,440
Look at this.

877
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
What is this?

878
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,800
Yesterday, there was no smoke
coming out from our chimney.

879
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,119
I thought something was off.

880
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,280
That's why I performed a divination.

881
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,840
This is because Niaoniao

882
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,519
modified the chimney in secret.

883
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,960
She was trying
to frighten Old Madam.

884
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:00,000
She preyed on Old Madam's
superstitious beliefs

885
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,559
and tricked her.

886
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,480
I was wondering
why the chimney wasn't working.

887
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,960
Niaoniao is so intelligent.

888
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:10,159
She's actually capable of that?

889
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,719
You're still trying
to be protective of her?

890
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,119
I would've given her the military rod

891
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,000
if she was one of my soldiers.

892
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,159
Niaoniao's current apparel
doesn't fit her body.

893
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,039
Get me the ruler.

894
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,480
I'll order new apparel for her
once I'm done taking her measurements.

895
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:56,320
Dear, I know you wish
to make it up to her.

896
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,800
You want to discipline her
in the shortest time possible.

897
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,320
However, it takes 1,000 days
to raise an army.

898
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,920
We've only been home for a few days.

899
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,360
I'd already made the wrong decision once
back then.

900
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,119
That's why Niaoniao

901
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,519
ended up like this.

902
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,840
I mustn't repeat the same mistake.

903
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,320
If I leave her be,

904
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,960
her future will be ruined.

905
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,000
I have to discipline this child
no matter what.
