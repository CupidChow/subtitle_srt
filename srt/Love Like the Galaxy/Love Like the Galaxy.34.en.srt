=Episode 34=

3
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,440
Does it still hurt?

4
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,479
It doesn't.

5
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,679
I'm sure you've heard about

6
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,720
my parents' divorce.

7
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,480
But don't worry.

8
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,640
I just want you to meet my mother

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,679
before we are engaged.

10
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
In the future,

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,559
both of you
don't have to see each other often.

12
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,640
I am never afraid.

13
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,559
Your mother is just sick

14
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,520
but she is not at fault.

15
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,599
The one at fault
is the person who ruined her life.

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,040
Marquis Chengyang is nice to me

17
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,040
but I am cold against him.

18
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,159
Everyone says

19
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,599
I am cruel.

20
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,640
They say I am unfilial.

21
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,119
What's this talk about being filial?

22
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,520
A person can only be filial
when his parents are good to him.

23
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,999
The parents are
obviously the ones at fault.

24
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,760
They have no right
to say the children are unfilial.

25
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
Zisheng.

26
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,640
I don't think you are a cruel person.

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Also.

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,439
You don't have to

29
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,200
worry too much about your mother.

30
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,760
That man I met just now

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,279
was very caring towards Madam Huo.

32
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,080
I'm sure he can take good care of her.

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
That man

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
was General Cui You.

35
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,439
He loves my mother when he was young

36
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,760
and wouldn't get married.

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,559
After that,

38
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,839
he was forced to get married
by Old Madam Cui.

39
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,480
However, his wife

40
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,240
passed away from difficult labour.

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,760
Soon after,

42
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,679
my mother divorced Marquis Chengyang.

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
Uncle Cui

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,839
also swore

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,480
to not marry again.

46
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:55,240
He stays single for my mother.

47
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,960
There's still
such an affectionate man in this world.

48
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,999
Someone who

49
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,559
loves sincerely.

50
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,760
His affection

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,159
cannot be exchanged with gold.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,680
It's the same

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,960
for me towards you.

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,799
Madam Huo still doesn't know me.

55
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,159
I will visit her in your place often
in the future.

56
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Sure.

57
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,560
When you marry me,

58
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,239
you will be

59
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:40,159
a lady of this place.

60
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,719
You can come here as you wish.

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
No one dares to stop you.

62
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:49,680
Zisheng.

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,160
There's no need to send me
before the sun rises.

64
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,760
It's too difficult for you.

65
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,039
What if I miss you?

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,239
If I miss you

67
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,960
and want to see you for a while more,

68
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,200
what should I do?

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,399
Just wait for me
in front of the palace gates

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,520
and we'll go inside together.
How is that?

71
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,120
In that case,

72
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,239
don't you need to wake up
an hour earlier?

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
It's fine.

74
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,599
I can yawn in front of Her Majesty.

75
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,440
But you enter Changqiu Palace

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,080
to learn from Her Majesty.

77
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,320
If your progress is hindered
because of me,

78
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,399
won't it...

79
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,960
I can't do two things at once.

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,279
I can either focus
on Her Majesty and palace matters

81
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:38,239
or focus on you.

82
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,159
Pick one.

83
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,000
I want you to focus on me.

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,719
Oh.

85
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,960
At night,

86
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,839
if you are busy,

87
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,359
I can wait for you.

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,039
We can eat dinner at Changqiu Palace

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,279
and walk home after that.

90
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,760
Think of it as digesting the food.

91
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,440
If you are not busy,

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,560
we will eat at home. How is that?

93
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,359
I want to marry you soon.

94
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,320
Why does time

95
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,760
pass so slowly?

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Shaoshang.

97
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,520
Why don't we

98
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,200
throw a banquet
and get engaged tomorrow?

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
How is that?

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,599
Sure.

101
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,479
Sure?

102
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,560
That's impossible.

103
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,479
I'm just kidding.

104
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,839
Three days later is the earliest date.

105
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,039
If we are getting engaged tomorrow,

106
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,080
it would be too rushed.

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,279
I can only wish

108
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,799
for these three days to pass quickly

109
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,080
so I can be relieved.

110
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,640
That's not necessary.

111
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,239
When I got engaged previously,

112
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
many people were invited too.

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,840
But the marriage still ended up...

114
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,039
Why did you kiss me again suddenly?

115
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,919
In the future,

116
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,440
if you still say something
that I don't like to hear,

117
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,599
I will also use this method

118
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,919
to block your mouth.

119
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,640
A banquet in three days?

120
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,120
That's too rushed.

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,000
Zisheng said

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
to leave everything to him.

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,039
We don't have to worry.

124
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,080
We only need to

125
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,560
give him a guest list.

126
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,239
He will prepare the invitations.

127
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,279
Niaoniao.

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,759
How can an engagement be so sloppy?

129
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,519
The banquet is less than two days

130
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,119
but parents from both sides
have yet to meet each other.

131
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,839
We can't even

132
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,479
prepare for other things.

133
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,680
Yangyang.

134
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Zisheng already thought about that.

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,359
He said

136
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,759
all the preparations

137
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,200
will be decided by us.

138
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,519
There's no need to care
about other people's opinions.

139
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,680
I've never thought

140
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,599
Ling Buyi to be such a rash person.

141
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,200
He is not cautious

142
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,080
in his actions as well.

143
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,920
Madam. Young Ladies.

144
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,440
Marchioness Chengyang is here.

145
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,080
Why is she here?

146
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,920
She pretended to be sick
and wouldn't send betrothal gifts then.

147
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,759
She wouldn't even meet us
when we went to visit her

148
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,160
yet she came to visit today.

149
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,080
Lianfang.

150
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,519
Bring Young Lady

151
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,320
back to her room to change

152
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,280
and welcome the guest at Jiuzhui Hall.

153
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,519
Yes.

154
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,359
Shaoshang

155
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,560
is a pretty lady indeed.

156
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,080
I like her the moment I saw her.

157
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,440
No wonder Zisheng is
in a rush to marry you.

158
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,800
I didn't send betrothal gifts

159
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,639
because of my weak body.

160
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,920
I won't miss the opportunity this time.

161
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,719
Marchioness Chengyang is so forgetful.

162
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:17,119
We met in Lord Ruyang's Mansion before.

163
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,519
You even wanted to punish me

164
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,800
for Lady Wang.

165
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,280
Besides,

166
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,519
Zisheng is not young.

167
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,920
How is he in a rush

168
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,280
to get married?

169
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,479
Yes.

170
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,960
You are not Zisheng's biological mother.

171
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,639
Maybe you forgot about his age.

172
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,200
Shaoshang.

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,400
You must be feeling dissatisfied

174
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,440
because you heard Zisheng's complaints.

175
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,160
But everything's in the past.

176
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,960
Even if you ignore me,

177
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,639
can you ignore the Marquis?

178
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,479
Zisheng has to stay firm

179
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,119
because of Junhua.

180
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,839
I have to be the one

181
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,280
to take this step.

182
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,639
Marchioness Chengyang

183
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,479
is well-informed.

184
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,040
As Shaoshang's mother,

185
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,440
I just found out

186
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,239
about their engagement in three days.

187
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,040
You do act quickly.

188
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,560
I know everything about Zisheng

189
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,239
as long as my heart is with him.

190
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,280
Madam.

191
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,999
I have a question to ask you.

192
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,119
Go ahead.

193
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,239
When did you start living as a widow
in the Ling Family?

194
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,080
Was it before Madam Huo
married over there

195
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,359
or after that?

196
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,920
I am unlucky.

197
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,960
I had nowhere to go
when my former husband passed away.

198
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,839
I had no choice but to
rely on my aunt's family.

199
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,239
I'm grateful to Junhua
for taking care of me.

200
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,920
That means it was after the marriage?

201
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,239
Apparently, Marchioness Chengyang

202
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,519
got along well
with Madam Huo just like sisters.

203
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,759
You were always

204
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,680
serving her considerately.

205
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,239
I did get along well with Junhua.

206
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,920
That was why I'm willing to sacrifice

207
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,560
and serve my cousin and Junhua.

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,680
But I don't know why

209
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,200
Junhua

210
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,359
was still angry at me.

211
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,960
-She wanted to kill me.
-I know.

212
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,719
I'm sure it's because Madam Huo
likes to sleep on a big bed

213
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,519
and didn't want to share it with you.

214
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,080
It's better

215
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,639
to not talk about the past.

216
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,320
I came here today

217
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,239
to discuss the arrangements

218
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,920
for the marriage in three days.

219
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,400
Oh.

220
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,119
I also brought some gifts for Shaoshang.

221
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,560
I bought these two servants

222
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,440
from the south with 100,000 qian.

223
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
They are good at
performing and cooking.

224
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,960
They will stay in your house

225
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
and serve you and Zisheng
in the future.

226
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,639
Marchioness Chengyang
is really interesting.

227
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,999
Right now,

228
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,479
I haven't even touched Zisheng's bed

229
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,839
and you're already
sending me two beautiful servants

230
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,800
to share my future husband's bed?

231
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,320
What now?

232
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,800
Do I need to thank you for that?

233
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,519
Little Lady.

234
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,359
How can you say something so vulgar?

235
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,440
Madam, do you think this is vulgar?

236
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,080
There's actually someone

237
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,719
who can do vulgar things

238
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,479
but can't listen to vulgar words.

239
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,280
How is that logical?

240
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,599
Cheng Shaoshang.

241
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:37,320
How dare you humiliate me like this?

242
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,999
Did I ever offend you?

243
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,639
Is that how

244
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
the Cheng Family treat your guests?

245
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,680
Marchioness Chengyang,

246
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,999
Zisheng is a future husband
in our family.

247
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,119
The Cheng Family

248
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,999
will definitely stand together with him.

249
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,960
Instead of trying to
probe around at my house,

250
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,519
why don't you go and look for Zisheng?

251
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:58,920
If he thinks
it's water under the bridge,

252
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,719
all of us

253
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:03,199
will naturally treat you as a guest.

254
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,200
Otherwise,

255
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,160
we'll definitely not act
against Zisheng's will.

256
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,839
Mother is right.

257
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,999
Your words are exactly my thoughts.

258
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,800
Marchioness Quling.

259
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
Do you know

260
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,920
Shaoshang can be punished
for being unfilial

261
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,999
for what she said today?

262
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:22,320
If you spread the news,

263
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,519
we will definitely not admit it.

264
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,320
Although my husband

265
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,680
did not contribute to the empire
as early as Marquis Chengyang,

266
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,719
he is still reputable

267
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,519
among the generals of the capital.

268
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,200
Even His Majesty and Her Majesty

269
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
are always praising Shaoshang

270
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,800
and granting us gifts.

271
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,680
I wonder who in this capital

272
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,839
will believe in your words.

273
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,119
Fine.

274
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,479
Fine.

275
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,479
I finally know your true nature today.

276
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,239
Cheng Shaoshang.

277
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,359
If you won't recognise me
as your mother-in-law,

278
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,239
you can just forget about

279
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:08,160
the engagement banquet
in the next few days.

280
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Don't even think of
marrying into the Ling Family.

281
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,280
Let's go.

282
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,160
Qingcong.

283
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,680
Send her off.

284
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,359
No need.

285
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,759
I can't afford to be your guest.

286
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Niaoniao.

287
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,440
Why did you keep
making Madam Chunyu angry today?

288
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,440
Although she isn't
Zisheng's biological mother,

289
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,200
she is still
his mother in name nonetheless.

290
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,639
Even if you don't get along with her,

291
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,920
you will still meet her.

292
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,400
Seriously.

293
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,479
How can you be so capricious?

294
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,200
You are not even afraid
of causing trouble for the family.

295
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,599
Mother.

296
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,479
I met Madam Huo yesterday.

297
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,839
If it wasn't for her,

298
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:59,320
Zisheng and his mother
would not have suffered.

299
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,560
I hate people

300
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,200
who steal other people's love.

301
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:04,160
I can't bring myself to act courteously

302
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,920
with these people.

303
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,239
Young Lady.

304
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,280
If she really

305
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,239
stops you from entering the banquet,

306
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,839
won't it become a joke?

307
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,680
No bride-to-be
would be stopped at the gate.

308
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,479
Just wait.

309
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,999
We still don't know

310
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,680
who is the one who can't enter the gate

311
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,560
when the time comes.

312
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,520
(Ling's Residence)

313
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,759
Isn't it General Ling

314
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,599
and Lady Cheng's
engagement banquet today?

315
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,400
Why aren't there any guests?

316
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,119
Marchioness Chengyang,
you've made a mistake.

317
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,639
The banquet today is not
being held at Young Master's residence.

318
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,400
It is being held
at Marquis Quling's residence.

319
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,479
Zisheng is not
going to marry into their family.

320
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,200
Why is the banquet being held
at the Cheng's residence?

321
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,639
Why did no one tell me

322
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,239
about something so important?

323
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,599
I was wondering as well.

324
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,040
Why did no one

325
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,440
tell Marchioness Chengyang
about something so important?

326
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,960
Come. Let's go
to Marquis Quling's Residence.

327
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,719
Young Master instructed

328
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,039
for all guests
to Marquis Quling's residence

329
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,840
to show their invitation.

330
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Without an invitation,

331
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,719
no one can enter the place.

332
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,600
It's better for you
to not go there, Marchioness Chengyang.

333
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,160
You might waste your time
travelling there.

334
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,279
Give me the invitation.

335
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,239
I've sent all the invitations.

336
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,479
I didn't miss out on anyone

337
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,719
that should be invited.

338
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,319
Trying to make a joke out of me?

339
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,319
Without me today,

340
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
don't even dream of getting engaged.

341
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,279
Marquis Quling is really lucky

342
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,519
to give birth
to such an outstanding lady.

343
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,279
Everyone in the capital

344
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,559
wants General Ling
to become their husband

345
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,920
but he picked

346
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,719
your daughter Fourth Lady Cheng.

347
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,999
I can finally

348
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,640
live a good life now.

349
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,920
When Shaoshang is married,

350
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,160
it's time for Song
to get married as well.

351
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,360
Am I right?

352
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,840
Is there a marriage between
the Cheng and Wan family?

353
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,960
Why isn't there any news?

354
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,920
Didn't the Thirteenth Lady only
want someone to marry into her family?

355
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,479
Everything in my family

356
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,079
is decided by the general
and my mother-in-law.

357
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,519
I know nothing about it.

358
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:42,360
Marry into her family?

359
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,759
Don't speak nonsense.

360
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,079
The Wan Family did not say this.

361
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,600
Why didn't I see General Ling?

362
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,039
It's the day of the engagement.

363
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,999
Why is the groom not here?

364
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,479
Indeed.

365
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,479
Come.

366
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,120
Raise your wine glass.

367
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,400
Let's be joyful for this occasion.

368
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,319
Young Lady.

369
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,440
General Ling asked me to send a message.

370
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,759
He wants you to not be worried.

371
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,840
He'll be here soon.

372
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:21,039
No matter who you meet

373
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,039
and what happens today,

374
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,479
you don't have to panic.

375
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,600
You can scold and throw a tantrum.

376
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,719
He will cover for you.

377
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,720
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

378
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:31,920
Please come inside.

379
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:42,500
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

380
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:44,759
Please come inside.

381
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,799
Sure. Please come inside.

382
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Please come inside.

383
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,999
Young Master.

384
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,799
Don't you hate coming
to banquets like these?

385
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:04,039
You said it was a waste of time.

386
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,200
It's better to read books

387
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,279
at home

388
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,999
rather than watching others getting married.

389
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,960
So, why did you come here today?

390
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,960
You know nothing.

391
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,079
I'm here to rescue my student
from a life of suffering.

392
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,239
The thing that harms one the most

393
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,479
is getting married.

394
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,039
I used to be
Cheng Shaoshang's teacher after all.

395
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,920
I can't put her in danger

396
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,600
even if I know
she will lead a life of suffering.

397
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,559
If getting married is suffering,

398
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,559
why do so many men and women

399
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,840
want that?

400
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,079
Because not everyone

401
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,400
sees the world as clearly

402
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,079
as your young master.

403
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,960
All right.

404
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,519
Young Master
who has seen the world clearly,

405
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,360
may I ask who are they?

406
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,519
Madam, your invitations.

407
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,600
I have no invitations.

408
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,999
I'll see who dares to stop me,
Lady Ruyang.

409
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,960
Move!

410
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,559
Great.

411
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,680
There's no need for me
to interfere now.

412
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,479
Where is Cheng Shaoshang?

413
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm here.

414
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,479
Lady Cheng.

415
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,759
Why aren't you kneeling down
and admitting your crimes?

416
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,920
What are my crimes?

417
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,999
You are not talented, virtuous,

418
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,440
loyal and filial.

419
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,279
Isn't that a crime?

420
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,400
Lady Ruyang.

421
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,960
Please forgive me for not welcoming you

422
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,680
after your long trip.

423
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,519
Why don't I invite you

424
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,519
to the upper seat of the banquet?

425
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,279
I didn't receive your invitation.

426
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,279
How can I be so shameless
to attend the banquet?

427
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Without my guards,

428
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
I'm sure I couldn't even enter

429
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,160
the gates of Marquis Quling's residence.

430
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,719
Upper seat?

431
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,920
I have no right to be there.

432
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,920
It was careless of us.

433
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,999
Lady Ruyang has a noble status.

434
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,920
You may enter

435
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,999
even without an invitation.

436
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,600
It sounds nice.

437
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,279
The young people now

438
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,079
forgot about their elders' grace.

439
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,440
It's fine if you don't invite me

440
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,920
but you didn't even invite
your future mother-in-law.

441
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,519
Isn't that

442
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,400
too rude of you?

443
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,360
Marchioness Quling,

444
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,920
I will

445
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,759
help you educate

446
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
this rude lady today.

447
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,519
Someone.

448
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:35,960
Take her away.

449
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,319
Yes!

450
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,120
This is crazy.

451
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,319
They are humiliating the Cheng Family.

452
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,079
Madam.

453
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Lady Ruyang.

454
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,799
You might be a noble

455
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,239
but my husband

456
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,160
is not a normal citizen as well.

457
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,519
Everyone here today

458
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,160
is a family member
of court officials.

459
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:04,079
Isn't it too much for Lady Ruyang

460
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,239
to punish my daughter unauthorised?

461
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,039
Even His Majesty has to

462
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,559
greet me with the title of Aunt.

463
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,039
You are just a wife of a general.

464
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,799
Helping you educate your daughter

465
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,519
is to make you look good.

466
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,039
How is that too much?

467
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,360
Someone.

468
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Slap Cheng Shaoshang's mouth.

469
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,759
Yes.

470
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,840
Who dares to do it?

471
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:25,840
Go away!

472
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,200
Old Consort.

473
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,239
They even hit people
from Lord Ruyang's Mansion.

474
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,239
They are obviously shaming you.

475
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,120
Everyone in the Cheng Family is rude.

476
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,600
How can a daughter
from a rude general's family

477
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,239
match for Zisheng?

478
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,759
I might be rude

479
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,680
but I know about shame.

480
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,120
Unlike someone

481
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,840
who did something shameless

482
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,719
like climbing

483
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:52,600
onto her cousin's bed.

484
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,559
You...

485
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,279
How dare you humiliate

486
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,559
your future mother-in-law
in front of all the elders?

487
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,279
I didn't mention who it was.

488
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,680
Old Consort.

489
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,600
There's no need to
assume who I'm talking about.

490
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,640
Besides,

491
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,079
I just went to visit

492
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,440
my future mother-in-law
a couple of days ago.

493
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,920
She is currently recuperating
at Xinghua Side House.

494
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,640
I don't know who is the mother-in-law

495
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,400
who came today.

496
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,360
How dare you!

497
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,160
I'm talking about Marchioness Chengyang!

498
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,039
It's the Marchioness Chengyang

499
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,479
who climbed onto her cousin's bed?

500
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,600
You...

501
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,799
This is getting out of hand.

502
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,079
I have to teach you a lesson.

503
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,440
I'll see who dares to stop me!

504
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Aunt.

505
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,799
What if I'm the one
who's going to stop you?

506
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

507
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,079
Greetings, Your Majesty.

508
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,960
Spare the formalities.

509
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,600
I came here today

510
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:09,120
for Zisheng and Shaoshang's engagement.

511
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
Just treat me as a normal elder.

512
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,279
There's no need to be polite.

513
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,960
Madam Cheng.

514
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,719
Do you have
a quiet place in your residence?

515
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,960
I want to have a talk

516
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:24,799
and not spoil other guests' fun.

517
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Yes.

518
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,719
Your Majesty, let's go together.

519
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,400
Aunt.

520
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:33,479
Marchioness Chengyang.

521
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,479
Let's go together.

522
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,079
Yes.

523
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,680
Shaoshang.

524
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,319
You too.

525
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,360
Yes.

526
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,999
Zisheng

527
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,239
had a good marriage.

528
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,319
She is His Majesty's niece

529
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,999
and Lady Ruyang's granddaughter,
Princess Yuchang.

530
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,999
However, he rejected the marriage

531
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,120
and angered the Old Consort.

532
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,279
Now, he chose
a daughter of the Cheng Family

533
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,960
who lacks knowledge

534
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,680
and likes fighting.

535
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,319
If he really marries this lady,

536
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,239
I'm afraid his ancestors

537
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,519
will also feel humiliated.

538
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:44,719
I thought

539
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:45,999
the officials of the court

540
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,160
are all righteous people.

541
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,120
I didn't expect them

542
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,999
to gossip like the women on the streets.

543
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,279
Attending the Cheng Family's banquet

544
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,999
while laughing at their daughter.

545
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,960
I think

546
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,400
all of your ancestors

547
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:02,400
were the ones who will feel humiliated.

548
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,239
How is it?

549
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:05,999
Calm down.

550
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,239
Let's wait for a while.

551
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,239
Aunt.

552
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,759
In the few months
that Shaoshang was serving me,

553
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,680
she has been kind, courteous,
benevolent and open-minded.

554
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,719
There has been nothing wrong with her.

555
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,519
You came here furiously today

556
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,799
and even wanted to detain Shaoshang.

557
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,160
Your actions might be too much.

558
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,960
I was only educating the young people

559
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,160
about being filial.

560
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,039
The Cheng Family was too much.

561
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,999
Besides having the banquet
in the bride's family,

562
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,840
they didn't even send an invitation

563
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,440
to their in-laws at
Marquis Chengyang's residence.

564
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,239
It was so unfilial of them.

565
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,400
Marquis Chengyang is sick today

566
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,519
and can't be here.

567
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,999
He asked his wife to handle this

568
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,120
yet she couldn't even enter the house.

569
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,840
It's the Cheng's Family's
first time marrying their daughter.

570
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,920
There will be some mistakes.

571
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,160
Besides,

572
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,319
Zisheng asked His Majesty's opinion

573
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,600
about organising the banquet
at Marquis Quling's residence.

574
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,519
If you don't believe me,

575
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,120
you can send someone to ask His Majesty.

576
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,200
How is that?

577
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,600
There's no need

578
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,559
to trouble His Majesty

579
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,519
for a trivial matter
like punishing the young people.

580
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,200
Your Majesty.

581
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,279
You really don't have
an opinion of your own.

582
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,999
Her Majesty has her own opinions.

583
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,559
Consort, it is too rude of you

584
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,680
to simply criticise Her Majesty.

585
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,479
You are the rude one.

586
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,120
Who are you

587
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,160
to even interrupt when we are talking?

588
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,519
Greetings, Your Majesty.

589
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,920
Your Majesty

590
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
is not as strict as Consort Yue.

591
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,840
A servant like her

592
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,559
should be slapped

593
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
so she will not talk back in the future.

594
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,600
Aunt, you really do miss me.

595
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,400
You keep mentioning me.

596
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Aunt.

597
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,440
Your Majesty.

598
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,400
Cheng Shaoshang is full of nonsense.

599
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,039
She is a disgrace to the royal family.

600
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,559
You must not spoil her any longer.

601
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,360
The Old Consort also said

602
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,120
there's no need to trouble Your Majesty
for such a trivial matter.

603
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,799
Right now, she is the one
who is troubling Your Majesty.

604
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,239
You're rebelling now.

605
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,160
This lady

606
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,319
is obviously belittling
the royal family's might.

607
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,999
She's rebelling.

608
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,680
I think you are the one
who is rebelling, Old Consort.

609
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,160
Are you going to tell

610
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,319
His Majesty what he should do?

611
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,519
When did I do that?

612
00:32:45,718 --> 00:32:47,278
Isn't it the
young people's responsibility

613
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,319
to beg for an elder's love?

614
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,479
Look who's speaking.

615
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,160
Did Zisheng propose to Shaoshang

616
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,840
because she is loved by you?

617
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,440
You did love Yuchang a lot.

618
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,960
Did she get married?

619
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,680
Don't even mention Yuchang.

620
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,640
She became a nun because of you.

621
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,680
Are you dead?

622
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,200
Why are you staying silent

623
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,039
when they are
badmouthing your granddaughter?

624
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,759
Shut up.

625
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Who are you to scold me?

626
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,440
If you didn't instigate Yuchang,

627
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,360
I would've found a husband for her.

628
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,440
She wouldn't have to
suffer at the temple.

629
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,360
My Yuchang

630
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,799
is a hundred times better
than this lady of the Cheng Family.

631
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Let me ask you.

632
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,160
What will you do

633
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,319
about humiliating Marchioness Chengyang
a few days ago?

634
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,680
Zisheng's fiancee.

635
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,400
Stand up and answer her.

636
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,160
Thank you, Consort Yue.

637
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,440
Your Majesty.

638
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,759
I have never humiliated
Marchioness Chengyang.

639
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,239
I only spoke the truth.

640
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:08,639
I swear...

641
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,280
What's the use of swearing, Old Consort?

642
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,999
Were you there?

643
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,240
Did you hear or see anything?

644
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,840
You only listened
to Marchioness Chengyang's words.

645
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,240
Perhaps

646
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,199
you were even fooled.

647
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,240
I swear on my life.

648
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Your Majesty.

649
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,360
If I also swear on my life

650
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,679
and say Marchioness Chengyang

651
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,559
had the intention to harm General Ling,

652
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,800
will the Old Consort be just

653
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,360
and punish her as well?

654
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,039
Why are you swearing?

655
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,999
You are always misbehaving.

656
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,920
Marchioness Chengyang's oath

657
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,440
is more honest.

658
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,519
Old Consort.

659
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,280
That's wrong.

660
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,159
I got married honestly

661
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,039
by listening to my elders' instructions.

662
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,039
I can't be compared to

663
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,599
Marchioness Chengyang
who organised her own marriage.

664
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:06,320
She relied on the Huo Family

665
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,559
and stayed by Madam Huo's side
for many years

666
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,679
only to replace Madam Huo

667
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,440
when she didn't notice.

668
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,720
So,

669
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:14,479
my oath can be trusted.

670
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,159
Her oath

671
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,639
cannot be trusted.

672
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,159
Although I have a poor background,

673
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,440
I still can't allow Cheng Shaoshang

674
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,360
to humiliate me.

675
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,679
If Your Majesty won't say anything,

676
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,559
I'll have no choice but to kill myself.

677
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,159
I'm impressed with Madam's courage

678
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,159
to die instead of being humiliated.

679
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,479
Marchioness Chengyang,

680
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,840
if you were

681
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,639
this courageous back then,

682
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,159
Madam Huo won't have to be divorced.

683
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,559
Many things

684
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,760
might be different today.

685
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:57,519
Zisheng.

686
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,280
Your future wife is really smart.

687
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,320
She just said what's on my heart.

688
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
Consort Yue is right.

689
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,440
Consort Yue.

690
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,720
Who is Huo Junhua?

691
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,800
You hated her back then

692
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,039
but you are

693
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,559
helping her right now?

694
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,479
You are obviously against me.

695
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,679
My grudge against Huo Junhua
is one matter.

696
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,519
But she has never done
anything bad to the Ling Family.

697
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:26,559
She even meant a lot to Ling Yi.

698
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,639
She helped him in every aspect.

699
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,999
But Ling Yi

700
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,479
had an ambiguous relationship
with Madam Chunyu

701
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,119
when his wife and son
went missing for less than a year.

702
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,360
Can he face the Huo Family with dignity?

703
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,920
When Huo Junhua and her son
were left with nowhere to go,

704
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,400
she wrapped Zisheng in leather

705
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,199
and gave him the remaining food.

706
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,320
Where was Ling Yi back then?

707
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,440
He was preparing

708
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,800
with his marriage to a second wife.

709
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,920
When Huo Junhua was found,

710
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,999
she was only skin and bones.

711
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:04,159
I couldn't even recognise her.

712
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:07,479
Yes. Her behaviour is bad

713
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,840
but she is

714
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:11,240
also a good mother.

715
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,079
She never let Zisheng down.

716
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,440
So, Zisheng shouldn't let her down

717
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,119
by flattering Madam Chunyu.

718
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,240
Not even if His Majesty says anything.

719
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,280
I will say this today.

720
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,599
From today onwards,

721
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,079
Madam Chunyu

722
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,800
cannot enter the palace
without being summoned.

723
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,039
I feel disgusted

724
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,400
when I see people like her.

725
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,159
Your Majesty.

726
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
No matter how
Madam Chunyu has misbehaved,

727
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,559
she is still my saviour.

728
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:44,087
Humiliating her today
is the same as humiliating me.

729
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,999
If you don't give me an explanation,

730
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,960
I will...

731
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,920
Kill yourself?

732
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,960
That's wonderful.

733
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,440
I'm going outside
to scream for injustice!

734
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,760
All the family members
of the officials are here today.

735
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:01,960
I want to show them

736
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,479
how His Majesty

737
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,800
treats his aunt
who protected his siblings.

738
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,159
I want to show them

739
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,519
whether their reputation
can be protected!

740
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,920
Your Majesty. Look.

741
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,519
What a crazy woman.

742
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,840
She starts throwing a tantrum

743
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,800
when something doesn't go her way.

744
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,639
I wanted to abandon her

745
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,159
but you told me not to abandon
a wife who suffered with me.

746
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,639
You even gave me a bad idea

747
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,079
about living separately.

748
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,360
You wanted me to become a friar
outside of the capital.

749
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Seriously.

750
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,320
I don't even know much
about Tao Te Ching.

751
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,960
Why would I go study?

752
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:34,960
Fine.

753
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,199
I won't abandon her.

754
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,039
I'll divorce her.

755
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,519
I want a divorce!

756
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,639
I gave birth to your children

757
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,519
and helped you with your chores!

758
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,599
I have some contributions at least!

759
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,999
All of you

760
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,599
are treating me like this?

761
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,559
You...

762
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,840
This is ridiculous.

763
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,400
Your Majesty.

764
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,360
I can't take this anymore.

765
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,800
I can't stand her anymore!

766
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,199
No way.

767
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,999
Uncle, please stand up.

768
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,320
It is not my intention to trouble you.

769
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,920
Confucianism is popular nowadays.

770
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:25,639
If you start to talk about divorce now

771
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,999
and abandon your wife,

772
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,199
the students

773
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,280
might gossip about you.

774
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,599
Uncle loves having fun.

775
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,960
Why should he go study?

776
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,280
In my opinion,

777
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,039
Old Consort

778
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,039
should go to Sancai Temple
to nurture her character.

779
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,159
You...

780
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,559
What Consort Yue suggested

781
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,440
is a perfect solution.

782
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:47,999
All of you...

783
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,159
All of you...

784
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,039
Lady Ruyang is old and senile.

785
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,760
She will sometimes act crazy

786
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,720
and disgrace me.

787
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,199
Send her to Sancai Temple

788
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,920
to nurture her character.

789
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Your Majesty!

790
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,800
Zisheng.

791
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,199
Send more men

792
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,599
to take good care of her.

793
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,199
Don't let outsiders

794
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,639
disturb her anymore.

795
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,800
Yes.

796
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,720
Your Majesty!

797
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,960
Guards.

798
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,199
Take good care of the Old Consort.

799
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,800
Yes!

800
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,280
All of you are bullying me!

801
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:41,559
All of you are bullying me!

802
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,400
All of you are bullying me!

803
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,240
All of you!

804
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,360
I heard Marquis Chengyang is sick.

805
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:54,920
Marchioness Chengyang

806
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,599
should take good care of him.

807
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,679
From now on,

808
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,920
you shouldn't step outside
your residence anymore.

809
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,960
Today is Zisheng's marriage.

810
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,079
It is also an auspicious day for me.

811
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,440
A few days ago, I just
received a few jars of good wine.

812
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,519
It is pure and fragrant.

813
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,280
Let's have a drink.

814
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,199
Come. Let's drink!

815
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:40,960
Let's go!
