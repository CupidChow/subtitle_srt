00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,800
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,800
You are lucky.

4
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,280
I won't forgive you

5
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,070
if there is no imperial banquet later.

6
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,320
You better be careful
during the banquet.

7
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,960
Don't let me catch you
doing anything funny.

8
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,240
Otherwise,

9
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,070
I want the whole Cheng Family

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,590
to apologise.

11
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,720
Thank you for coming to my aid.

12
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,360
It was really scary

13
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,670
when nobles got angry.

14
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
I am Luo Jitong.

15
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
My father is Luo Zhu, Colonel Changshui.

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,110
I was appointed as Fifth Princess' reading partner
by  Empress a few years ago.

17
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,400
Shaoshang, you can just call me Jitong.

18
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,070
Sure. Jitong.

19
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,590
His Majesty and Her Majesty
are both kind and friendly.

20
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,440
Why is Fifth Princess so bossy?

21
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,240
She is His Majesty's youngest daughter.

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,880
She was born when the land is peaceful.

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,990
She didn't suffer like her siblings
when she was young

24
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
and lived a lavish life after growing up

25
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,440
so she is a bit spoiled.

26
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,110
But the rules of the imperial palace are strict.

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,720
We shouldn't badmouth the nobles

28
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,070
or we might bring trouble to our family.

29
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,110
Thank you for your reminder, Jitong.

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,670
Luckily,

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,800
I won't be
coming to the palace frequently.

32
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,760
Lady Cheng, follow me.

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,070
Lady Cheng, you may sit here.

34
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,990
Thank you.

35
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,470
Anyone can
attend the imperial banquet nowadays.

36
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,990
In the palace,

37
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,590
everyone is seated
according to the status.

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,630
Shaoshang has a low status

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,590
so you have to sit at the end naturally.

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
If I'm not here,

41
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,510
this seat will be yours.

42
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,150
How can you talk about me
in your current situation?

43
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,590
How dare you laugh at me?

44
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,720
It's so noisy.

45
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,960
Why are people
from the Changqiu Palace so rude?

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,070
As the niece of the Empress,

47
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,030
aren't you afraid of
embarrassing your aunt?

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,630
Consort Yue taught all of you

49
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,920
that the people of Yongle Palace
need to follow the rules.

50
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,760
Why didn't you

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,030
bring Prince Consort Xuan today?
[*Prince Consort Xuan: Third Princess' husband]

52
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,800
Did Third Sister argue
with Prince Consort Xuan again?

53
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,510
Or did you keep Prince Consort Xuan

54
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,030
back at the residence
because Zisheng will be here today?

55
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,920
Fifth Sister.

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,800
Instead of worrying
about other people's family affairs,

57
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,110
you should think about

58
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,440
your house's reputation.

59
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,400
If you don't chase all those toyboys away,

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,280
I'm afraid the whole capital

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,070
will find out about it in a few days.

62
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,920
You...

63
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,400
Today is the family banquet,

64
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,670
stop arguing.

65
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,880
No one will die from that.

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,190
If you can't suppress your urge,

67
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,990
you can say what you just said

68
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,320
to Father and Mother

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,510
when they are here later.

70
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,440
See if you will get embarrassed.

71
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,070
I'm talking to you.

72
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,150
You were the one who was arguing with me

73
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,440
at Changqiu Palace, right?

74
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,440
The banquet hasn't begun,

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,360
and Father and Mother haven't come here,

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,760
you already started eating.

77
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,510
How can you be so rude?

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm sure you don't know, Your Highness.

79
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,030
Her father fought in battles in the past

80
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,510
and left her at home
with no one to teach her.

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,920
She can be considered

82
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,880
as an uneducated child from the rural area.

83
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,590
It is her first time in the palace

84
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,590
so it's natural for her
to not know the palace's rules

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
and come here to see His Majesty
with an empty stomach.

86
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,720
No wonder she's acting impolitely.

87
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,110
She was lack of teaching from parents.

88
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,030
How dare you eat a biscuit
before the imperial banquet starts.

89
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
This is not a biscuit.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,590
Are you trying to fool me? Do you think
I can't recognise a biscuit?

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,320
This is not a biscuit.

92
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,110
This is a millet naan.

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,630
Every family in the rural areas

94
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,070
eat this during meals.

95
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,590
Eating a naan can
keep your stomach full for six hours.

96
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,670
Don't you know that, Your Highness?

97
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,240
I heard from my parents

98
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
that His Majesty
and Her Majesty are frugal.

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,880
How could you
not know about this, Your Highness?

100
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,670
That's reasonable.

101
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,720
Your Highness is
a proud daughter of the royal family.

102
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,760
You are always in the palace

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
so you haven't
seen many things naturally.

104
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,510
You...

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,070
I'm not feeling well.

106
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm going to the bathroom.

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,440
Lady Cheng, you have a silver tongue.

108
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Now, show me

109
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,360
your footsteps.

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,240
Someone is really impolite.

111
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,960
She hops in a ridiculous manner.

112
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,600
What are you trying to do?

113
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,430
I'm wondering who it is.

114
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,840
Turns out it's Lady Cheng's saviour.

115
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,520
General Ling, I can...

116
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,350
Allow me.

117
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
Ling Zisheng,
what is the meaning of this?

118
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,190
I heard His Majesty

119
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,680
already found Prince Consort Yue
for Fifth Princess.

120
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,600
He is a dissolute man

121
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,560
and a rare kind nowadays.

122
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,390
He is a good match for you.

123
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,760
I will

124
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,560
congratulate you in advance.

125
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,520
You...

126
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
How dare you laugh at me?

127
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,990
Zisheng.

128
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,560
When Third Princess
married the heir of Marquis Xuan,

129
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,920
I was out in battle

130
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,430
and couldn't congratulate you.

131
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,190
This is

132
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,680
a late congratulation from me.

133
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,350
Let's go.

134
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,070
Wait.

135
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,110
Such a cheap woman.

136
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,520
Lady Luo.

137
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,190
Lady Cheng

138
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,840
seems close to General Ling.

139
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,430
We should mind our business

140
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,430
and not gossip about others.

141
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,840
Prepare the liquor and serve it.

142
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,960
But didn't

143
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,880
Her Majesty talked about marrying you

144
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,110
to General Ling?

145
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,480
Don't talk nonsense here.

146
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,270
Her Majesty

147
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,190
has never taken it seriously.

148
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,920
If you still talk about this,

149
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,600
I'll punish you.

150
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,560
Yes.

151
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,600
General Ling, what are you doing?

152
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,760
Why aren't you letting go?

153
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,880
It's more embarrassing for you
to refusing me here.

154
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,560
Do you want us

155
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,640
to become the joke of the palace?

156
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,030
Sit here.

157
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,760
Isn't it against the rules

158
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,640
for me to sit here?

159
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,800
It's fine.

160
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,920
Sit.

161
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,990
The palace is a place
free from rules nowadays.

162
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,390
Even a woman

163
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,190
can sit beside the Crown Prince.

164
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,230
Brother.

165
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,560
You have such a good temper.

166
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,390
Brother, don't scare the lady.

167
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,640
This is a family banquet.

168
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
It's not strict on etiquette.

169
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,760
Besides,

170
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,190
Zisheng took her to this seat.

171
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,880
Brother, you are wrong.

172
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,390
We can see a lot from a small matter.

173
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,070
If one treats family matters
with no orders,

174
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,390
how can he govern the empire?

175
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,680
(Fifth Prince)
Every man wants a nice lady.

176
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,560
Since you sit here,

177
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,070
you need to tell us your name.

178
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,480
I am Cheng Shaoshang.

179
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,190
You are Fourth Lady Cheng

180
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,430
who broke off the engagement with Lou Yao.

181
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,990
You are pretty.

182
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,230
If I take you as my concubine,

183
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,560
we will become a family.

184
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,230
Sitting here as a family

185
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,920
is not against the rules.

186
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Brothers,

187
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,760
am I right?

188
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,920
Fifth Brother,

189
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,800
Father always scolds you

190
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
because you are fickle in love.

191
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,760
What is it?

192
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,070
You still

193
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:41,990
won't change?

194
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,990
Fifth Prince, it's too late
to have eyes on her.

195
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,230
Shaoshang already has an engagement.

196
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
Zisheng, are you lying to me?

197
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,150
Everyone in the capital knows

198
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,110
that the Cheng Family and
Lou Family broke off the engagement.

199
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,030
Yes.

200
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,070
So,

201
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,960
I can marry her now.

202
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,520
General Ling, calm down.

203
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
Don't spoil your marriage

204
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,920
just to help me.

205
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,560
I'm afraid you are spending too much time
with the Crown Prince.

206
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,680
You are not as domineering
as you were in the past.

207
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,030
Even a lady

208
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,880
dares to defy your orders.

209
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,760
His Majesty is here!

210
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,960
What are you talking about?
All of you look so happy.

211
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,390
This is a normal family banquet.
Spare the formalities.

212
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,110
Niaoniao, why are you sitting here?

213
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,270
Your Majesty.

214
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,110
Zisheng, what are you...

215
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,310
Please do your duty in place of my elder

216
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,270
to propose

217
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,230
to Fourth Lady Cheng.

218
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,430
Wonderful!

219
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,390
Wonderful!

220
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,680
Wonderful!

221
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,190
I thought this would take a long time
for it to happen.

222
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,270
In that case,

223
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,880
let's do it today.

224
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,560
General Cheng. Come.

225
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,920
General Cheng.

226
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,560
I started raising Zisheng

227
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,920
when he was ten.

228
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,270
He is no different
from my biological son.

229
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,270
Today, I'll act in place of his father

230
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,270
to propose the marriage to you.

231
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,480
General Cheng, what do you think?

232
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,520
Cheng Shi. This is a good marriage.

233
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,990
Don't just stand there.
Agree to it immediately.

234
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,110
Of course, I...

235
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,390
This is a good thing.

236
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,230
It's a good thing.

237
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,430
Naturally, I...

238
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,920
This marriage cannot happen.

239
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,600
Your Majesty, please retract your order.

240
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,520
Madam Cheng.

241
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,150
Are you not satisfied

242
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
with Zisheng?

243
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
My wife dares not be dissatisfied
with General Ling.

244
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,030
General Ling is a young hero.

245
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,310
General Ling is a young hero.

246
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,760
It's my daughter, Shaoshang,

247
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,960
who is not worthy of General Ling.

248
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,310
My daughter

249
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,990
lacked education from young

250
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,600
and she has bad behaviours.

251
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,520
Since my return home,

252
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,960
she is bad at study and martial arts,

253
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,430
She has no virtue
and always runs her mouth.

254
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,030
I should have educated her strictly.

255
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,430
However,

256
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,720
she was intractable
and disrespectful of elders.

257
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,110
How would I dare lie to Your Majesty?

258
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,840
If Shaoshang is not my child,

259
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,800
I won't allow a lady like her

260
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,600
to marry into the Cheng Family.

261
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,920
If it was other ladies
from the Cheng Family

262
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,880
to receive Your Majesty's grace,

263
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,190
our family

264
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,310
will be proud of it.

265
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,150
Your Majesty.

266
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,560
Shaoshang is stubborn.

267
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,110
I'm afraid

268
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,840
she will cause a huge trouble
in the future

269
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,480
and harm the Cheng Family

270
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
if she marries General Ling.

271
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,430
Your Majesty.

272
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,520
This is a great marriage.

273
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,150
Only Shaoshang

274
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,390
is not worthy of it.

275
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,480
General Cheng.

276
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,270
Is Madam Cheng

277
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,030
telling the truth?

278
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,920
It's not my daughter's fault.

279
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,680
When my wife and I were out in battles,

280
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,270
we kept her at home

281
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,960
and neglected her education.

282
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,310
It is our fault as parents.

283
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,350
No one would
wash their dirty linen in public.

284
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,070
I want to spare my daughter
from embarrassment as well

285
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,720
but she isn't qualified.

286
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,480
General Ling.

287
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,600
You didn't know her for a long time.

288
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,480
She looks obedient and intelligent

289
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,840
but she actually is cunning

290
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,430
and reckless.

291
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,560
Lady Cheng.

292
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,030
Do you think

293
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,520
you are as bad

294
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,070
as your mother said?

295
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,800
Your Majesty.

296
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,070
Everything my mother said

297
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,390
is the truth.

298
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,830
With my behaviours,

299
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,030
even my mother looks down on me.

300
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,190
How can I fit to be General Ling's wife?

301
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,270
Yes.

302
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,990
Why don't Your Majesty

303
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,480
withdraw your order?

304
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,190
What did you say?

305
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,230
What a surprise.

306
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
I didn't expect

307
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
someone would condemn
their own daughter as worthless

308
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,640
so she doesn't have to marry Zisheng.

309
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,150
As far as I know,

310
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,880
every lady in the capital

311
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,840
wants to marry Zisheng.

312
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,640
But the Cheng Family

313
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,760
would rather defy an imperial order
to not marry him.

314
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,070
I wonder if this is
Madam Cheng's well intention

315
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,990
or if Zisheng
causes fear in your family.

316
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,190
Third Brother. Mind your words.

317
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,390
This is a matter of royal family's reputation.

318
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,310
General Cheng.

319
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,070
Please consider your actions.

320
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,800
Well,

321
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,800
if she's not married to Ling Buyi,

322
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,150
she can get married to me.

323
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,480
Lady Cheng is a perfect match for me.

324
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,880
She is impolite

325
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,110
while I am unruly.

326
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,840
We should be a couple.

327
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,720
What are you talking about?

328
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,840
Fool!

329
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,640
Know your place!

330
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,680
Cheng Shi.

331
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,230
An emperor's words are absolute.

332
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,800
I've shown my sincerity

333
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,150
by making the proposal.

334
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,920
How dare you decline it.

335
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,920
You...

336
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,030
You are embarrassing me!

337
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,190
You will make your family suffer!

338
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,680
I will

339
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,430
allow you to consider it
before giving me a reply.

340
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,560
I deserve death for
going against the imperial will.

341
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm willing to resign

342
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,390
and leave the capital with my family

343
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,070
so I won't disturb Your Majesty.

344
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,110
My daughter is really not worthy
of General Ling.

345
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,990
Your Majesty, please grant my wish.

346
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,440
Cheng Shi, how presumptuous!

347
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,920
Are you threatening me
with your resignation?

348
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,070
Guards!

349
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,880
Your Majesty!

350
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,600
Your Majesty, calm down.

351
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,110
General Cheng is only anxious.

352
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,190
Give them some time to think about it.

353
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,480
Your Majesty.

354
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,920
Your Majesty.

355
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,480
General Ling is good
in academics and martial arts.

356
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,640
He contributed a lot when he was young.

357
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,800
He is an ideal husband

358
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,310
that every lady in the capital
wants to marry.

359
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,480
But I know

360
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,230
I am unworthy

361
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,430
of General Ling.

362
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,110
In Hua County,

363
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,310
General Ling almost lost his arm

364
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,840
to save me.

365
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,360
After that, he hurt his old wounds
at Mount Tugao

366
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,720
to save me once again.

367
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,430
I am indebted to him.

368
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,030
But today,

369
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,150
his sudden proposal

370
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,310
caught me

371
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,030
and my family by surprise.

372
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
But my mother

373
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,920
did one thing right.

374
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,350
She told the truth.

375
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,150
I am rude and reckless

376
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,270
just as my mother said.

377
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,920
I also cause trouble normally

378
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,390
and don't know how to
be considerate to my parents.

379
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,270
I don't even know
how to serve my future husband.

380
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,990
Leaving those matters aside,

381
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,080
I have a question
for General Ling today.

382
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,560
General Ling.

383
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,110
The wife you get in the future

384
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,310
will be a lot better than me.

385
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,720
I am stubborn since young.

386
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,070
I won't be educated

387
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,350
and won't listen to you.

388
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,720
Will you still

389
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,430
marry someone like me?

390
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,640
Of course.

391
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,230
I never knew

392
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,800
how wonderful I am to you.

393
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,680
Similarly, I'm sure you don't know

394
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,600
that in my eyes,

395
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,800
Cheng Shaoshang

396
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,070
is the best lady in the capital.

397
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,720
General Ling.

398
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Madam Cheng.

399
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,990
Don't interrupt me.

400
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,310
Everyone says

401
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,840
to marry a gentle and virtuous lady.

402
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,800
Madam Cheng

403
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,960
is fierce in battle

404
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,350
and doesn't lose to men
on the battlefield.

405
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,030
But off the battlefield,

406
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,350
you are also in love with General Cheng.

407
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,760
It's clear to see
that every couple is different

408
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,800
and not as everyone says.

409
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,270
Shaoshang might not be

410
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,070
an obedient lady in everyone's eyes.

411
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,520
But to me,

412
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,230
she is the whole capital

413
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,030
and the whole world's

414
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,600
best lady.

415
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,230
Indeed.

416
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,680
She is pure and decisive.

417
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,800
She dares to love and hate.

418
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,070
She's the only one

419
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,920
who can walk alongside me in this world.

420
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,760
I will

421
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,430
only marry her in my life.

422
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,800
Good!

423
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,990
Wonderful!

424
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,070
Lady Cheng.

425
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,520
Since Zisheng's intention is firm,

426
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,270
what about you?

427
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,990
Don't look at them.

428
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,030
They can't make decisions for you.

429
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,230
I will decide for you today.

430
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,600
No matter how important being filial is,

431
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,430
it's not as mighty as the imperial will.

432
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,990
You can say

433
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,150
anything you want.

434
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,310
I want to see

435
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,110
who dares defy me.

436
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,230
I don't need

437
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,230
other people to decide for me.

438
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,430
I will decide for myself.

439
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,920
I am

440
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,600
willing to marry General Ling.

441
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,640
Wonderful.

442
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,230
Lady Cheng.

443
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,640
You are the one

444
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,430
who agreed to this marriage.

445
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,800
It's a promise.

446
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
If anyone dares to disagree with this,

447
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,070
I will

448
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,480
definitely reprimand them.

449
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,720
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

450
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,430
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

451
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,150
Good.

452
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,110
Cheng Shi.

453
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,990
Thank His Majesty's grace.

454
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,190
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

455
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,350
All right.

456
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,390
Stand up, everyone.

457
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,990
Guards.

458
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,520
What's wrong?

459
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,640
Your Majesty.

460
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,840
Princess Yuchang

461
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,840
probably passed out

462
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,680
after hearing about
General Ling's engagement.

463
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,600
Look at these ladies.

464
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,560
It's ridiculous.

465
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,560
She's already drunk
before the banquet begins.

466
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,480
I should

467
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,840
really send her to Changqiu Palace

468
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,600
to learn some rules.

469
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,150
Yes.

470
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,030
Zisheng.

471
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Stand up.

472
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,960
Stand up now.

473
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,960
I'm happy today. Drink more.

474
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,990
Everyone, let's drink together!

475
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,840
Kneel!

476
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,390
Look.

477
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,920
Look at her!

478
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,920
Yuanyi.

479
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,110
Come.

480
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,840
It was a shock today.

481
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,150
I still can't

482
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,430
get over it let alone her.

483
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,720
She was shocked?

484
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,760
She was acting mighty today.

485
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,430
She agreed to a marriage in public

486
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,480
with no fear of the imperial might.

487
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,990
Before I entered the palace,

488
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,270
Mother had taught me many rules.

489
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,600
But defying the imperial order
is not one of them.

490
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,110
How dare you!

491
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,310
Niaoniao.

492
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,030
You can't hurt your mother like this.

493
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,190
Previously,

494
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,030
you were the one who guaranteed

495
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,960
that there's nothing
between you and Ling Buyi.

496
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,760
That was why
we risked angering His Majesty

497
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,920
to reject the marriage for you.

498
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,680
Why did you change?

499
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,640
I wanted to marry Yao previously.

500
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,720
Mother was not satisfied.

501
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,190
She always mentioned Ling Buyi to me.

502
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Ling Buyi proposed,

503
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,030
but Mother is still not satisfied.

504
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,720
Are you not satisfied
with the husband I choose

505
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,230
or me?

506
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,430
I...

507
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,560
Enough.

508
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,960
Niaoniao.

509
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,720
Don't misunderstand your mother.

510
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,600
Compared to the Lou Family,

511
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,990
Marquis Chengyang's family

512
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,480
is more complicated.

513
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,720
Ling Buyi's mother, Huo Junhua

514
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,720
was very famous

515
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,430
as Huo Chong's younger sister.

516
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,950
Now,

517
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,680
look how she ended up.

518
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,390
Why do you have to go and suffer?

519
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,430
What happened

520
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,600
between Ling Buyi's parents?

521
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,430
I've never heard anyone mention it.

522
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,070
You don't even know
what happened with his family

523
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,350
yet you spoke of marriage?

524
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,720
You deserve to suffer in the future.

525
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,720
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

526
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,190
I'm marrying Ling Buyi

527
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,190
and not his parents anyway.

528
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,190
I don't really want to know

529
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,070
about Marquis Chengyang's family.

530
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,680
It's not that your mother
doesn't want to tell you.

531
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,430
But this is a long story.

532
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,110
During His Majesty's crisis,

533
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,430
General Huo Chong

534
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,920
used a single city

535
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,760
to resist Emperor Li's 200,000-men army.

536
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,190
After the city had been captured,

537
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,480
the Huo Family died in the massacre.

538
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,270
Madam Huo and Ling Buyi went missing.

539
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,600
Marquis Chengyang

540
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,150
remarried his cousin, Madam Chunyu

541
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,070
who stayed in his house.

542
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,720
Less than a year after they had married,

543
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,640
Madam Huo returned with Ling Buyi.

544
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,480
Don't the officials

545
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,480
pity the abandoned wife and child?

546
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,990
Why didn't they

547
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,640
ask Marquis Chengyang
to divorce Madam Chunyu

548
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
and reunite with Madam Huo?

549
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,720
Besides,

550
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,800
Father.

551
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,520
The whole Huo Family
sacrificed for the empire.

552
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,840
In terms of contributions,

553
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,920
the He Family
cannot be compared to them.

554
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,150
Marquis Chengyang's family
and the Lou family are different.

555
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,760
Madam Chunyu and Lady Ruyang
had a close relationship.

556
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,480
How could Marquis Chengyang divorce his wife?

557
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,920
Lady Ruyang?

558
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Why does it sound so familiar?

559
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,760
Princess Yuchang's grandmother?

560
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,560
This is a statue

561
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,880
I made with pure gold for you.

562
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,720
Putting it in the house
can help ward off evil spirits.

563
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,600
It's enough to come and visit me.

564
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,110
There's no need to
bring expensive gifts for me every time.

565
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,760
Any gifts

566
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,880
are nothing in front of you.

567
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,960
If you didn't take care of me
for all these years,

568
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,840
I wouldn't have a foothold in the residence

569
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,760
with Zisheng's misunderstanding of me.

570
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,150
It's all because of
Huo Junhua's interference.

571
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,800
She used her brother, Huo Chong's fame

572
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,800
to order the Wen Family around.

573
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,880
You are different.

574
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,520
You are virtuous and caring.

575
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
When I was hurt in the battle,

576
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,760
you saved me

577
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,560
by taking care of me without rest.

578
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,800
I owe Junhua after all.

579
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,150
What do you mean?

580
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,110
Everyone thought she died.

581
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,600
There's nothing wrong with
the Marquis Chengyang remarrying someone else.

582
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,270
Even if she didn't die,

583
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,640
she went missing for two years

584
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,430
and there was chaos.

585
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,600
Who knew if she still kept her chastity?

586
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,640
You requested both of you
to be Marquis Chengyang's wife

587
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,150
but Huo Junhua was not satisfied

588
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,640
and threatened to hurt you all the time.

589
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,720
You had a miscarriage

590
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,990
because of that shock.

591
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,960
You don't even have a child until now

592
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,070
but Huo Junhua always pretends to be insane

593
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,920
and sows discord among you and Zisheng.

594
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,560
When Yuchang marries Zisheng,

595
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,270
I will ask Yuchang to persuade her.

596
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,030
Grandmother!

597
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,070
Now I'm a joke in the capital.

598
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,960
You need to
set things straight for me, Grandmother!

599
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,310
Don't stop me!

600
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,720
-I will go to Sancai Temple
-Princess.

601
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,920
to accompany Grandfather

602
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,680
and live the rest of my life there.

603
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,800
-My dear.
-Grandmother.

604
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,840
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

605
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Grandmother!

606
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,960
Everyone in the capital
knows that I like Ling Buyi

607
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,150
but he proposed

608
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,960
to Fourth Lady Cheng today
in front of everyone.

609
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,840
How am I worse than Fourth Lady Cheng?

610
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,070
How am I worse than her

611
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,480
and let him embarrass me?

612
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,230
Who is Fourth Lady Cheng?

613
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,990
How could she be compared to you?

614
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,910
It's that Lady Cheng
who fought with Lady Wang.

615
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,760
She also

616
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,110
had an engagement with the Lou Family.

617
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,680
Grandmother.

618
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,520
Now, Zisheng wants to marry her

619
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,390
and I became a joke in the capital.

620
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,070
Princess, don't worry.

621
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,390
Lady Cheng is rude.

622
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Marquis and I don't like her.

623
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,520
This marriage will not go on.

624
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,350
I'm going to find the Marquis

625
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,840
and ask him to talk to Zisheng.

626
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,720
Stand up.

627
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:05,990
Come.

628
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,960
Look how aggrieved she is.

629
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,880
Don't cry.

630
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,480
Don't cry.

631
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
Lady Cheng?

632
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,390
Your mother and I

633
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,720
both think Marquis Chengyang's residence
is a very complicated place

634
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,680
so we declined the marriage.

635
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,190
Niaoniao.

636
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,310
You might think our words are harsh

637
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,640
but it was for your own good.

638
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,520
Niaoniao.

639
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,960
Madam Chunyu is just one of the reasons.

640
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,190
What worries me and your father

641
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,600
is Ling Buyi.

642
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
Ling Buyi is different from Lou Yao.

643
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,150
His heart is firm.

644
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,840
When he puts his heart into something,
he will definitely do it.

645
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,350
You are also a stubborn person.

646
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,880
How can two stubborn people

647
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,350
get married?

648
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,960
If you have arguments in the future,

649
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,310
who will be the one to concede?

650
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,480
Your father and I can't protect you.

651
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,600
I know he is hard to get along with.

652
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,270
Why did you agree to marry him then?

653
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,070
Father.

654
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,390
Do I have another choice?

655
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,190
Today,

656
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,720
Mother condemned me in front of everyone.

657
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,800
Did you see

658
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,110
the face of the ladies

659
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,920
who usually laughed at my rudeness?

660
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,350
Mother was firm

661
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,680
on rejecting a troublesome son-in-law

662
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,800
and condemned me

663
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,310
until I'm worthless.

664
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,110
I have self-esteem

665
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,110
and pride as well.

666
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,480
I want to live with dignity.

667
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,600
Mother.

668
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,270
Let me ask you.

669
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,600
If Cheng Yang was the one
granted by His Majesty today,

670
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,880
would you humiliate her
in front of everyone

671
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,070
like how you did today?

672
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,430
You...

673
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,560
If it was Yangyang,

674
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,520
I wouldn't have to be this worried.

675
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,840
Why did you involve Yangyang?

676
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,270
Niaoniao.

677
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,230
Your mother didn't
condemn you on purpose.

678
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,230
If she didn't say that,

679
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,800
how could she persuade His Majesty?

680
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,480
Even if we said the wrong things

681
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,390
and hurt you,

682
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,150
you shouldn't act recklessly
and put your marriage at stake.

683
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,480
I didn't act recklessly.

684
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,390
I thought about it seriously.

685
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,150
I won't change my personality.

686
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,430
No matter who I marry,

687
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,960
Mother will still be worried.

688
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,430
In that case,

689
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,800
I should marry someone
as soon as possible

690
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,920
so Mother can be relieved.

691
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,480
Do you know how difficult this world is?

692
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,190
When a woman marries the wrong man,

693
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,390
it'll be a life of unhappiness.

694
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,960
I am the only person who will suffer

695
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,600
if I marry the wrong man.

696
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,270
It's better than defying
an imperial order and harming the family.

697
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,480
Both of you never taught me.

698
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,110
I had a grudge in the past.

699
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,720
But I understand now.

700
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,230
I have never been filial
to both of you as well.

701
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,600
So,

702
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,190
we are even.

703
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,720
I don't want Father
to lose his position because of me.

704
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,720
I also don't want both of you

705
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,760
to give up the glory of the Cheng Family
from abandoning me in the past

706
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,680
because of me.

707
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,600
If that's the case,

708
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,760
it'll make me feel like

709
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,640
I was born as a joke.

710
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,270
Father. Mother.

711
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,270
I'm the one
who decided on this marriage.

712
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,880
I won't regret it.

713
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,920
No matter what my future looks like,

714
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,070
I will take responsibility alone

715
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,520
and not involve the family.

716
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,190
Fine.

717
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,800
Fine.

718
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,190
I will not interfere with your future.

719
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,430
If you want to marry Ling Buyi,

720
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,760
I will agree to it.
