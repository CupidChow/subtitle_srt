(Ling)

21
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,960
Decree for Ling Buyi.

22
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,920
Ling Buyi, the former general,

23
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,000
killed numbers of enemies

24
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,920
and won a victory for the nation.

25
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,239
He humbled the enemies

26
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
and put an end to the war.

27
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,639
The end of the war

28
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,079
has brought peace to the world.

29
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,920
His contribution
will be remembered forever.

30
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,480
(Ling Buyi)
Ling Buyi will be bestowed

31
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,119
(Ling Buyi)
with the title of Deputy Superintendent,

32
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,400
and lead the left cavalry
of the Yulin Guards.

33
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,239
He will also lead the Yueqi Guards of
the Five Schools of the Northern Army.

34
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,159
He will earn an extra title
as the Palace Attendant,

35
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,400
and is allowed entry
to the inner palace.

36
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,280
He's allowed to meet His Majesty
with his shoes and his swords.

37
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,039
He's allowed to walk at a normal pace
in the royal court.

38
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
He's allowed to omit his name
in the royal court.

39
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,800
I received the decree

40
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,599
with great gratitude.

41
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,400
General Ling, please get up.

42
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,519
Please receive the decree, General.

43
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,960
I was told that His Majesty
couldn't sleep at night,

44
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,840
(Attendant Cao)
anticipating your return.

45
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,119
His Majesty intended
to receive you personally,

46
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,199
but was stopped by Official Zuo,
the Imperial Counsellor.

47
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,000
General Ling.

48
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,440
Hurry up and change into the gown
gifted by His Majesty.

49
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,000
We'll return to the palace first.

50
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,960
His Majesty has ordered a banquet
to celebrate your return.

51
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,840
Please relay my message to His Majesty.

52
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,679
I have received news
about a very important case.

53
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,280
I'll return to the palace
and have a meal with His Majesty

54
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,199
after I resolve the issue.

55
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Then,

56
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,559
I'll also personally ask
for His Majesty's forgiveness.

57
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,519
Let's go.

58
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,360
Sure.

59
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
What's the matter?
Why is he in such a hurry?

60
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,159
Will she die in there?

61
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,599
They say a bad person
always lives a long life.

62
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,320
She's only sick
for slightly more than a month.

63
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,840
She wouldn't die so soon.

64
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,880
I told you before.

65
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,639
Fourth Lady fell severely ill
because you abandoned her

66
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,880
and left her in the village.

67
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,519
She hasn't recovered,
so she can't leave yet.

68
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,280
She has to leave regardless.

69
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:20,840
Master will be back

70
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,760
in two weeks.

71
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
She has to come with me

72
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,599
whether she's sick

73
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,639
or dead.

74
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,599
Fourth Lady.

75
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,280
I suppose it's been a while

76
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,320
since you last had warm food, right?

77
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,800
I brought you a lot of food today.

78
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,440
We shall depart
after you fill your stomach.

79
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
If you still refuse to open the door,

80
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,480
I'll throw away all the food in the box.

81
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:54,599
This...

82
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,599
How useless.

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
Be careful.

84
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,640
You've been ill.
Don't stuff yourself with the food.

85
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Don't you know how long
I've been starving?

86
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,199
How can I eat slowly?

87
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,479
You'll hurt your stomach

88
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,800
if you gobble them down.

89
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,039
You need to first stay alive
before you can care about your stomach.

90
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,680
Enough of knocking.

91
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,079
(Cheng Shaoshang)
What's with that hurry?

92
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,520
How dare those shameless guys come here?

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,199
Young Lady, you almost lost your life
a month ago in the fire.

94
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,079
They never sent their regards.

95
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,760
And they are now here

96
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
only after you've recovered.

97
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,560
(Lianfang)
I'm sure they have an agenda.

98
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,960
Even my parents don't care
about me,

99
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,239
despite the fact
that I'm on my deathbed.

100
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
Now, someone is actually
paying me a visit?

101
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,119
It's quite a surprise.

102
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,600
Over the past few years,

103
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
First Madam has never stopped
sending letters to you.

104
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,800
It's obvious
that they care for you.

105
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,840
The only thing I received
over those years

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,800
are just a few letters.

107
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,119
Is that all their care is worth?

108
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Too bad for them,
I'm too stubborn to die.

109
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,239
Otherwise, they might receive a letter

110
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,840
informing them about my passing.

111
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,079
Are you done yet?

112
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,840
Once you're done with the food,

113
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,039
you have to come with us.

114
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,359
You're not getting the food
from the Cheng Family for free.

115
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,479
Young Master, shall we arrest her?

116
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,279
There's no need to hurry.

117
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,560
After all, Fourth Lady is your master.

118
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,520
(Fu Deng)
After all, Fourth Lady is your master.

119
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,760
You're now

120
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,039
defying your master.

121
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,920
She is just a lady no one cares about.

122
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,800
How dare she call herself our master?

123
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,920
Are you going to open the door or not?

124
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,920
Open it now, or I'll break in.

125
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,119
What are you doing?

126
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,680
Move.

127
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,920
I will definitely

128
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,639
(Head Housemaid Li)
bring you with me today.

129
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,199
bring you with me today.

130
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,199
I...

131
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:53,359
I...

132
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,319
Come with me.

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,359
Who told you to put the dregs here?

134
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,239
Are you trying to sabotage me?

135
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,720
Housemaid Li.

136
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,760
You must have forgotten about this,

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but some time ago,

138
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,479
I sent Lianfang to inform Second Aunt

139
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,600
that there are too many insects here,
and it's uninhabitable.

140
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,520
Second Aunt said,

141
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,600
that I was here to reflect on myself,

142
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,960
not for a vacation.

143
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,079
Then, she told me to prepare
some wood ashes.

144
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,960
I heard Housemaid Li
knocking on the door just now,

145
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,760
and I worried that you'll get choked
by the wood ashes.

146
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,399
That's why I told Lianfang

147
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,239
to bring all of these out right away.

148
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,960
Little did I know you were this rude.

149
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,319
You burst in on me.

150
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,960
You're making things very difficult
for a junior like me.

151
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,319
Leave me alone.

152
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
You...

153
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,680
Fourth Lady.

154
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,279
Don't try to brush me off with excuses
that no one will believe.

155
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,520
I know you're still holding grudges,

156
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,640
but

157
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,439
you have only yourself to blame.

158
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,319
Old Madam kept you here
so that you could reflect upon yourself.

159
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:31,960
She wanted to teach you a lesson,

160
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,159
so that you'll be obedient
in the future.

161
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,880
Lest you do something
that will sabotage the Cheng Family.

162
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,119
Old Madam is coming from a good place.

163
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,560
Fourth Lady, you should be grateful
for that.

164
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,720
Of course, I'm grateful.

165
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,560
I need to thank you

166
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,039
for not starving me to death here.

167
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,000
(Old Madam Cheng)

168
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,159
Look.

169
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,439
These golden earrings I just got.

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,239
Don't they look way more lavish

171
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:20,640
than the jade

172
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,840
Old Madam Wan, our neighbor,
was wearing the last time?

173
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,560
My eyelid has been twitching

174
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,000
since this morning.

175
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,039
I'm feeling a little uneasy.

176
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,920
Mother-in-law, do you think something
is going to happen?

177
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,279
Stop bothering me.

178
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,960
Shi has won the war

179
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,319
and is on his way home.

180
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,279
There's nothing that he can't overcome.

181
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,199
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

182
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,760
(Madam Ge)
From what I know,

183
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,840
you sent Fourth Lady to the village,

184
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,680
so that you could teach her a lesson.

185
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,960
Those who don't know

186
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:53,079
might think that we're working together
to bully her.

187
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,319
What if the girl

188
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:55,159
said something inappropriate

189
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,920
before Cheng Shi?

190
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,760
If Xiao Yuanyi found out about this,

191
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,600
he would think

192
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
that you made Fourth Lady stay,

193
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,880
so that you could torture her.

194
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,079
For as long as you were there,

195
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,600
Old Madam has never stopped worrying

196
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,640
about Fourth Lady's health condition.

197
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,960
She sent me here today,
so that I can bring you home.

198
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,079
Young Lady has not fully recovered yet.

199
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,159
She can't travel far.

200
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,720
Fourth Lady is not that weak.

201
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
She can still travel.

202
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,399
Stay out of my way.

203
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,439
Guys.

204
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,720
Escort Fourth Lady to the carriage.

205
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:26,479
There's no need for that.

206
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,520
I can walk myself.

207
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,239
The old woman is getting ready
to enter the carriage.

208
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,680
(Liang Qiufei)
It seems Thief Dong is not in the carriage.

209
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,279
You need to improve your eyesight.

210
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:50,800
Old woman?

211
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,159
(Liang Qiuqi)
She's obviously a young girl.

212
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:53,880
From which residence
is this Young Lady from?

213
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,960
Why is she dressing so shabbily?

214
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,560
What are you doing?

215
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,760
Get in the carriage now.

216
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,119
You...

217
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,159
Hurry up!

218
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,520
Move!

219
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:29,840
Move out of my way.

220
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,399
Why does the carriage smell like sweat?

221
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,079
It stinks very badly.

222
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,680
Is it from Housemaid Li?

223
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:38,760
Let's go.

224
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,520
This servant does know
how to enjoy herself.

225
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,239
She has no respect for the Young Lady.

226
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,319
It's not the smell of Housemaid Li.

227
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,800
It smells like a man
who hasn't showered for days.

228
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,600
Man?

229
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,840
Leave now.

230
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,119
Hurry up.

231
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,359
What do men smell like?

232
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
They stink.

233
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,880
I hope Master and Madam
will come home soon.

234
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,840
Then, we'll eat everything we want.

235
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,239
My parents' return
won't guarantee us food.

236
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,159
No one knows

237
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:32,600
how will our future

238
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,800
turn out.

239
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,039
At least, we won't get bullied

240
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,239
like what we went through.

241
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
We're rushing home despite the illness.

242
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,680
Why is there such a hurry?

243
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,079
What is this for?

244
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,520
This is exactly what it's for.

245
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,399
I'm sure something happened at home

246
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,720
that's more important
than getting me killed.

247
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,279
Fourth Lady

248
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,520
is just like her mom.

249
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,600
Both are annoying.

250
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,520
Xiao Yuanyi is just a divorcee.

251
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,039
What is so good about her?

252
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,800
Why is Shi determined to marry her?

253
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:06,880
This...

254
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,079
Forget it.

255
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,079
Oh, right.

256
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,880
Fourth Lady.

257
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,079
Didn't you send someone
to bring her home this morning?

258
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,640
Yes.

259
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,159
She's suffering? It won't be half as bad
as what I went through.

260
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,760
I raised three kids all by myself.

261
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,920
Your father-in-law passed away too early.

262
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,760
She's back.

263
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,399
Old Madam, she is back.

264
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,720
Fine. She's back,

265
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,439
but there's no need for all the yelling.

266
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,359
I was just feeling all the emotions.

267
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,560
Send her back to her room
and let her get some rest.

268
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,439
I'm not talking about Fourth Lady.

269
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,760
Master is back.

270
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,079
Who?

271
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,279
Shi is back?

272
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,960
My son is back.

273
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,199
That's too early.

274
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,239
Shi is back.

275
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,800
My son is back.

276
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,840
My son is back.

277
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,760
It's been more than 10 years.

278
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,800
(Cheng's Residence)
Thank God.

279
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,119
Thank God. My son is back.

280
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:13,399
(Cheng's Residence)

281
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,991
(Cheng's Residence)

282
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,239
(Xiao Yuanyi)

283
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,039
Mother-in-law.

284
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,479
You're back.

285
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,439
You're back.

286
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,439
Where is Shi?

287
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,720
Yuanyi.

288
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,279
Yuanyi,
this is your favorite honey pastry.

289
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,720
Son.

290
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,000
Son.

291
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
Son.

292
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,399
Son.

293
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,359
Yuanyi.

294
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:46,640
My son.

295
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,079
It's been more than 10 years,

296
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,560
(Cheng Shi)
and the old woman is still making this.

297
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,960
Try it while it's hot.

298
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
Why didn't you come home
right after you were back in town?

299
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,760
You went to the pastry shop

300
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,039
to buy pastry for your wife,

301
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,960
but you didn't even bother
buying anything for your mom.

302
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,960
Son.

303
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,159
Son.

304
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,399
Mother.

305
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,720
Shi.

306
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,279
Shi.

307
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,439
Mother.

308
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,039
Shi.

309
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,880
Mother, did you have onions again today?

310
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,399
You obviously had too much of it.

311
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,159
It's been more than 10 years,

312
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,039
and you still haven't changed the habit
you picked up in the country.

313
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,520
How dare you?

314
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,520
I spent years farming
in the countryside,

315
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:48,880
so that I could raise the three of you.

316
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,119
Your punch is still as powerful

317
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,279
as before.

318
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,119
Shi.

319
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,960
Old Madam.

320
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,760
General spent years
fighting for the country,

321
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,239
and he has been worried about you.

322
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,479
Now, it seems

323
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
you're still as strong as before.

324
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,359
Seeing how healthy you are,

325
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,000
we can now rest assured.

326
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,039
Old Madam.

327
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,680
Has Niaoniao been doing well at home

328
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,880
in the past decades?

329
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,159
Thank you, Old Madam,
for taking care of her.

330
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,199
Where is Niaoniao?

331
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,359
Why isn't Niaoniao here to receive us?

332
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,079
She

333
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,720
is not here.

334
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,600
Stop ahead for inspection.

335
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,119
Pull over.

336
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,279
General, why did you stop us?

337
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,079
We were decreed to capture the suspect.

338
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,119
Search the carriage.

339
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:50,840
Wait.

340
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,399
The carriage is carrying
the Fourth Lady of Colonel Cheng, Cheng Shi.

341
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,520
There's no one else here.

342
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,760
Generals.

343
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,119
Our Young Lady is still single.

344
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,640
It's not appropriate
for the men to search the carriage.

345
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,159
Shut up, Housemaid Li.

346
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,560
We are the family of the General.

347
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,560
All the more reason
why we should obey the laws.

348
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,960
We shouldn't stand in their way
while the Generals carry out their duty.

349
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,800
Generals.

350
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,520
Look at

351
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,000
how stupid and ugly she is,

352
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,279
please forgive her.

353
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,319
Young Lady, are you really allowing them
to search the carriage?

354
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,880
The royal court is looking
for a suspect.

355
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,800
Of course, I will comply.

356
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,600
I never do anything wrong,
so there's nothing I should worry about.

357
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,079
However, can I say a few words
to General

358
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:31,600
before you begin the search?

359
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,079
What is it?

360
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,319
General.

361
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,439
It's no fun searching just the carriage.

362
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,920
The haystack right next to my house

363
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,359
is where we hide all the fun stuff.

364
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,800
The weather is really dry.

365
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,399
If the haystack accidentally
catches fire,

366
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,119
we might even be able
to catch a living man.

367
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,680
Things will get
way more interesting then.

368
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,560
General.

369
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,000
Our Young Lady has been having a fever
for almost a month,

370
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,399
and she has been spouting nonsense.

371
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,640
General, please don't take it seriously.

372
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
We'll find out
whether I'm saying the truth

373
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,039
after we burn the haystack.

374
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,399
General.

375
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,359
Although we're not
from a wealthy family,

376
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,760
we can still afford to burn a haystack.

377
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,680
You can't burn it.

378
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,520
You can't.

379
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,800
You can't.

380
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,039
You can't.

381
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,319
You can't.

382
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,439
Young Master.

383
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,159
We can't trust her.

384
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,640
Let's escort the Young Lady
out of the carriage,

385
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
so that we can run a search in it.

386
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,720
It's on fire.

387
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,039
It's a misunderstanding, General.

388
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,199
Don't arrest me.

389
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,319
It's just a misunderstanding.

390
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,279
Let her go.

391
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,039
This...

392
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,920
Housemaid Li.

393
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
General told you to go.

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,439
Why are you still here?

395
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,520
Fourth Lady, you...

396
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,520
Cut the nonsense
if you still wish to stay alive.

397
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,319
Keep it low.

398
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,079
Wait.

399
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,000
Is there a misunderstanding?

400
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,760
Please spare my life.

401
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,359
General, please spare my life.

402
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,239
I'm the uncle

403
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,920
(Head Armorer Dong)
of Colonel Cheng, Cheng Shi.

404
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,159
We are all comrades,

405
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,640
so please have mercy on me.

406
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,800
Is the lady in the carriage

407
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,720
really the Fourth Lady
of the Cheng Family?

408
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,279
Are you really her father's uncle?

409
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,720
It's true.

410
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,760
Please have mercy on me.

411
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,560
Fourth Lady, you had been forgiven
for what you did,

412
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,640
but now

413
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,880
you did this to Old Master Dong.

414
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,319
Even Old Madam can't help you this time.

415
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,479
Compared to what Second Aunt did

416
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:52,680
and sabotaged the entire Cheng Family,

417
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,239
me betraying Granduncle Dong

418
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,680
is just a trivial matter.

419
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,800
Fourth Lady.

420
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,159
It'll take another half a month
before your parents return.

421
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:04,880
Now, you only have yourself to rely on.

422
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,199
Master and Madam are coming back.

423
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,960
It's too early to celebrate.

424
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,800
If they really care

425
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,680
for their daughter,

426
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,880
they wouldn't have abandoned you

427
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,239
at birth.

428
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,479
Cheng Shaoshang.

429
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,560
That little brat.

430
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,199
She grew up parentless,

431
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,960
and she ended up being
an uncultured troublemaker.

432
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,680
What does she know about family?

433
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,640
I...

434
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,479
General,

435
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,720
can you just do it for Colonel Cheng
and spare me this time?

436
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,159
Cheng Shaoshang.

437
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,279
My son.

438
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,439
I've missed you so much.

439
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,640
Here. Open your mouth.

440
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,560
I can do it myself.

441
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:34,960
My son.

442
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,079
What Madam Ge said just now

443
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,279
is not completely wrong.

444
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,439
Fourth Lady

445
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,039
is a very stubborn woman.

446
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,279
We sent her to the countryside,

447
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,800
only hoping to teach her a lesson.

448
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,319
Moreover, we...

449
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,520
Stop!

450
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,760
Stop!

451
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,319
Hurry up!

452
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,720
Quick!

453
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,279
Old Madam.

454
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,439
Old Madam.

455
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,079
Something happened, Old Madam.

456
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,600
What happened?

457
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,800
Old Madam.

458
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,800
Something major happened, Old Madam.

459
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,079
The uncultured Fourth Lady

460
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,800
tried to hurt Old Master Dong...

461
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,119
Shut up!

462
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,880
What are you talking about?

463
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
Old Master Dong?
What happened to my brother?

464
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,319
Who did you

465
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,279
just call uncultured?

466
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
Cheng...

467
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,079
Shaoshang.

468
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,680
Master.

469
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,199
Help, Master.

470
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,680
Young Lady's fever is not subsiding.

471
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,600
They left her in the village to die.

472
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,760
She almost lost her life.

473
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
Today, Housemaid Li
dropped by unannounced.

474
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,520
She said

475
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,760
that she would bring Young Lady home

476
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,520
even if she was dying.

477
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,399
Where is Niaoniao?

478
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,399
Father.

479
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,079
Mother.

480
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,359
You're finally back.

481
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,439
Niaoniao.

482
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,560
Niaoniao.

483
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,560
Niaoniao.

484
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,319
Why does my beloved Niaoniao

485
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,279
look so tired?

486
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,600
Father.

487
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,000
Mother.

488
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,720
I...

489
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,359
I've finally lived long enough
to see your return.

490
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,319
For the past 15 years,

491
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,159
I had been fighting for the country
out there.

492
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,479
I thought that someone back home
would take care of Niaoniao

493
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,279
and made sure
she was well-looked-after.

494
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,000
Little did I know

495
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,439
she would end up like this.

496
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,399
Shi.

497
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,720
Are you

498
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,239
blaming me?

499
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,279
Indeed.

500
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
I'll get despised

501
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,039
once my age catches up with me.

502
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,479
My son.

503
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,720
You were away for so many years.

504
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:41,439
The moment you came home,
you bought pastry for your wife,

505
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,279
and tried to seek justice
on behalf of your daughter.

506
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,920
But what about your mother?

507
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,079
I've been working very hard for years,

508
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,920
and I've fallen ill because of that.

509
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:52,880
Mother.

510
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,800
Young Lady.

511
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,600
Niaoniao.

512
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:57,960
Niaoniao.

513
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
What did you and your brothers say

514
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,439
when your father passed away?

515
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,640
You said that when you grew up
and managed to achieve something,

516
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,600
you would take good care of me.

517
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,840
But look at what you're doing now.

518
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,159
You obviously want your mother dead.

519
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:22,319
Brother-in-law.

520
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,079
I should be blamed

521
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,720
for this matter.

522
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,960
I always listen to Shaoshang,

523
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,640
and because of that,

524
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,880
Fourth Lady has turned unruly.

525
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,720
She almost got my youngest nephew

526
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,600
killed the last time.

527
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,079
That's right.

528
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,840
We sent her to the village,

529
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,920
hoping

530
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,960
to tame her temperament.

531
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,000
We didn't expect Fourth Lady
to be this weak.

532
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,239
She couldn't stand the stay
in the village.

533
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:48,800
Over the past decades,

534
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,199
I put in a lot of effort

535
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,520
to take care

536
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,119
of Fourth Lady.

537
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,319
A lot of effort?

538
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
And why didn't the Young Lady

539
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,359
own even a proper gown?

540
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,560
Even the stupid and lowly woman

541
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,039
(Qingcong)
can humiliate our Young Lady like that.

542
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
Who are you?

543
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,039
This is about the Cheng Family.

544
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,479
You're in no place to interfere.

545
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:09,319
Old Madam.

546
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,079
Qingcong is not just anyone else.

547
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:13,039
She is my sworn sister.

548
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,239
She has been following me

549
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,960
for the past few years
when I served the army.

550
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,479
Even the outsider cares more for her
than her own family does.

551
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:20,840
Someone

552
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,399
send the old woman to the woodshed.

553
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,000
- Shi.
- Yes.

554
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,199
Teach her a lesson.

555
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,239
I'm wronged.

556
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,640
My son.

557
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,279
You were away for the past 15 years.

558
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,159
Old Madam.

559
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,720
You...

560
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,640
Who instigated you?

561
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,520
You have been acting all arrogant
since the moment you got home.

562
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,840
Do you still consider me your mother?

563
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,680
Old Madam is getting a heart attack.

564
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,920
Help!

565
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,720
Mother.

566
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,520
Such a good actress.

567
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
Someone, please help.

568
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,960
I kept old ginseng in the house.

569
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,720
Young Lady.

570
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,800
What's the matter, Young Lady?

571
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,520
Niaoniao.

572
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,439
Niaoniao.

573
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Niaoniao.

574
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,079
Where is Niaoniao's room?

575
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:03,920
On the second floor.

576
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,359
I...

577
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,159
Old Madam.

578
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,720
Drink the ginseng soup,
and it'll keep you warm.

579
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,960
However much you care
for your granddaughter,

580
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,600
you should never neglect
your own health.

581
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,159
Her parents don't think
that I care a lot for her.

582
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,600
They think you and I

583
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,199
have been abusing her
over the past years.

584
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,840
But it hasn't crossed their mind

585
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,520
that during their years

586
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,119
of absence,

587
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,319
we were the ones

588
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:28,840
raising the baby up.

589
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,960
They don't give us any credit for that.

590
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,960
All kids get sick.

591
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,680
It's just a few days of fever,

592
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,560
but they're making a huge fuss
out of it.

593
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,119
If you're really worried about your kid,
you can take care of her yourself.

594
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,800
Old Madam, that's really funny.

595
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,279
You're saying as if
Fourth Lady stayed here

596
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,359
because Madam Xiao refused
to take care of her.

597
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,359
No mother

598
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,199
in this world

599
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:50,279
would want to abandon their newborns.

600
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,319
She only did that
because she was forced.

601
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,560
Qingcong.

602
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,000
You lowly maidservant.

603
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,680
How dare you talk back?

604
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:00,920
Someone

605
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:02,359
get me a stick.

606
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,439
Talk back?

607
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,319
Did Qingcong say anything wrong?

608
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,760
We left Niaoniao behind because
we didn't want to disobey the elders.

609
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,119
Now, you made it sound

610
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,439
as if we refused to raise her.

611
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,920
You made us the terrible children
who brought trouble to our mother.

612
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,319
Brother-in-law.

613
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,000
You're hurting Old Madam.

614
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,119
You're only feeling sorry

615
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,760
for Fourth Lady
because she's now sick.

616
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,880
What you don't know

617
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,399
is how Fourth Lady usually misbehaves.

618
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,439
Old Madam was overworked
because of her.

619
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,800
Everyone in this world

620
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,520
loves their children
more than their parents.

621
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,359
Then, I have a question for you.

622
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,680
Brother-in-law.

623
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,319
You are the eldest son.

624
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,880
You must take care of Old Madam, right?

625
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,079
Niaoniao.

626
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,760
You're awake.

627
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,600
Can you please help me up?

628
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,920
I want to greet my parents.

629
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:18,439
You're still ill.

630
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,399
You can skip the manner.

631
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,199
I'm so sorry
to have worried Father and Mother.

632
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,640
Ever since Niaoniao can remember,

633
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,920
this is my first meeting
with Father and Mother.

634
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,840
I had never greeted you properly
before this.

635
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,319
That's why

636
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:35,760
I must send my greetings

637
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,920
and express my gratitude to you today.

638
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,840
Niaoniao.

639
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,520
Get up.

640
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,800
Get up. Quick.

641
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,119
I was too immature.

642
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,000
I deserved to be punished

643
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,800
by Second Aunt.

644
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Good girl. Go take a rest.

645
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,520
Niaoniao is so sick,

646
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,960
yet she is still so polite.

647
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:04,359
However, you wronged her
and called her a stubborn kid.

648
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,079
I'm her father.

649
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,680
Don't I have the right
to know what happened?

650
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,279
Do you want me

651
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:11,119
to pay with my life?

652
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:11,840
Old Madam.

653
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:15,880
You got yourself a new wife
and forgot about your own mother.

654
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,239
What does this have anything to do
with Yuanyi?

655
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:20,359
Mother, there's no need
to involve her in this.

656
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,399
Ever since you married
into the Cheng Family,

657
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,119
no matter

658
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,680
what happens,

659
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,880
Shi always agrees

660
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,960
with everything

661
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,079
you say.

662
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,880
Does he still care about his Mother?

663
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,119
Let's not talk about anything else.

664
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,600
In the past years,

665
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,079
you've received so many rewards

666
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:44,079
and titles out there.

667
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,880
Yet, you told me none of them.

668
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,880
And no one else wanted
to tell me anything.

669
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,800
I'm a foolish old woman,

670
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,600
only because you never told me anything.

671
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,680
Mother.

672
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,119
It's getting late.

673
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,479
Thank you, Old Madam,
for paying Niaoniao a visit.

674
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,640
It's time Old Madam
go home and take a rest.

675
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,560
Take a rest?

676
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
You'll be pleased

677
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,239
when I'm resting in my grave, right?

678
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,600
You're making me out of breath.

679
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,039
I need to take a breather.

680
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,079
Niaoniao.

681
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:38,720
You should take a good rest too.

682
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,560
I'll tell the chef

683
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,439
to cook you some food you like.

684
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,680
Mother, do you know what food I like?

685
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,239
Master.

686
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:10,880
It's bad.

687
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,199
Our yard is surrounded

688
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,560
by a huge number
of black armored guards.

689
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:21,920
Is General Ling paying us
a visit personally?

690
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,199
You're right.

691
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,920
Colonel Cheng,
how do you know who I am?

692
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:26,720
General Ling, are you kidding me?

693
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,880
All the generals

694
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,119
have heard of your name before.

695
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,039
Ling Buyi.

696
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,279
We all know how General Ling
is undefeatable.

697
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,119
I was decreed

698
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,680
to catch a thief

699
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
who was suspected of embezzlement
and theft of firearms.

700
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,560
I accidentally scared your daughter,

701
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,800
so I hope Colonel Cheng
will forgive me for that.

702
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,199
Embezzlement?

703
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
You should never let him go.

704
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,199
Good job, General Ling.

705
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,239
Like father, like daughter.

706
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,760
I admire how understanding

707
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:55,560
Colonel Cheng is.

708
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:58,199
Why would General Ling say that?

709
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:00,640
Does General Ling know our Niaoniao?

710
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,520
We're not friends,

711
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,079
but

712
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:12,720
we have met each other before.

713
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:19,359
Come and take a look.

714
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,720
These are the guys

715
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,600
who were
on Granduncle Dong's tail today.

716
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,960
It sounds like it.

717
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,840
Is Old Master Dong going
to drag the Cheng Family into this?

718
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm more worried
about myself getting involved in this.

719
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,159
General Ling.

720
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,479
This way, please.

721
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,720
General Ling, please have a seat.

722
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,520
Bring that rat here

723
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,359
and show him to Colonel Cheng.

724
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
He is the person

725
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,479
who committed the theft of firearms?

726
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,119
He should be punished.

727
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,760
We're soldiers who fight
for our country.

728
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,920
What we hate the most are the rats.

729
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,720
They caused the death
of many soldiers on the front line.

730
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:16,279
General Ling,

731
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,439
if you ever need my help,

732
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,760
I'll go all out.

733
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,399
Can't Colonel Cheng tell who he is?

734
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,640
Help!

735
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,359
Shi.

736
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,159
It's me.

737
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:38,960
Uncle.

738
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,520
What... What's going on?

739
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:41,840
This...

740
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:44,760
You have to thank your daughter for this.

741
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,960
General, are you thirsty?

742
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,319
I cooked some warm soup for you.

743
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,680
Do you think I'm not pathetic enough?

744
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,520
General Ling,

745
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,800
this...

746
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,039
Is there any misunderstanding?

747
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,920
I'm sure Colonel Cheng

748
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,920
knows Head Armorer Dong better than I do.

749
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:07,279
We have evidence to prove
his embezzlement.

750
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm here today

751
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,119
to send Colonel Cheng a message.

752
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,720
No matter how high one's rank is,

753
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,640
I'll not let him go

754
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,039
if he ever betrays the country.

755
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,039
There's one more thing.

756
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,680
I would like to send my gratitude.

757
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,800
Gratitude?

758
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,640
That's right.

759
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,600
Young Lady, they never spoke ill of you.

760
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,199
Instead, they are here
to send their gratitude.

761
00:41:58,479 --> 00:41:59,560
Loyalty to the country

762
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,119
comes ahead of family.

763
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
She stood up for justice

764
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,199
and was not afraid
of turning her family in.

765
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,319
A heart like Fourth Lady Cheng

766
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,239
is something I've only seen
on my colleagues

767
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:11,680
of the Ministry of Justice
who carries out the punishments.

768
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,760
I am sure Fourth Lady Cheng

769
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,319
will have a very bright future.

770
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,399
No one shall underestimate
her capability.

771
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,399
I'm too flattered.

772
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,039
I'll see you around.

773
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,720
Is he talking about me?

774
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,680
Loyalty to the country comes first?

775
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,560
Is he saying that
I've failed my family?

776
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,000
Not afraid of turning my family in.

777
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,720
He's saying that I have no respect
for the elders.

778
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,920
What else?

779
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,920
He said that I was just like the lords
in the Ministry of Justice.

780
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,159
He's saying

781
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:58,520
that I'm hot-tempered
and don't act like a lady.

782
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,600
Does he really think
I don't know what he's saying?

783
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,279
Ling Buyi.

784
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,039
How dare you, Ling Buyi?

785
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:13,960
How can you repay good with evil?

786
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,239
