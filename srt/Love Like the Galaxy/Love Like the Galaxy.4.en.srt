3
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,839
No, you can't enter.

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,559
You can't enter.
Young Lady is practicing calligraphy.

5
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,120
Cheng Shaoshang.

6
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,839
I've underestimated you.

7
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,480
You scheme worse than I thought.

8
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
You pretended to help me,

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,480
so I'll keep staying in the main house.

10
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,639
You didn't even hesitate
to discredit your biological mother.

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,959
This is odd.

12
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,080
You don't want
to move out of the main house

13
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,839
because of Cheng's offspring.

14
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,480
And I did it to anger Mother.

15
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,279
The two of us

16
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,199
have the same goal.

17
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,519
How can you blame me?

18
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,839
I know you've been
holding grudges for years.

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,360
Hence you deliberately try to divide us.

20
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,159
Your Father ordered your
Second Uncle to move to the new residence

21
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,000
while leaving me here.

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,279
You and your mother
must have instigated this.

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,719
Second Uncle can't walk well.

24
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:35,799
Father thought

25
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:36,839
the new residence is bigger

26
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,600
and the furniture
can be placed more sparsely

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,240
so that Second Uncle won't bump into them.

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,719
That was kindness.

29
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,880
Stop explaining.

30
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,439
I swore

31
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,520
that I'll never leave
before I give birth to a son.

32
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,320
But now you've moved Second Uncle

33
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,719
to the new residence.

34
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,600
How can I

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,799
get a son alone?

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,919
Since ancient times

37
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,719
hens lay eggs and roosters crow.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,839
Why does a woman

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
need a man for a child?

40
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,320
Who are you calling a hen?

41
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,439
Men and...

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,680
I don't know how to talk to

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,960
a kid like you.

44
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,079
Don't be complacent.

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,639
You and your mother are just lucky

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,199
to have the help of
your Father's merit.

47
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,079
There's nothing so great about it.

48
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,799
If I were lucky,

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,799
I wouldn't have been abandoned as a baby.

50
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,480
My parents didn't take care of me
since I was young.

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,760
If I were lucky,

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,040
why would I be left

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,160
by you in a small village?

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,359
I was so sick that I almost die.

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,440
You think my mother is lucky

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,519
because my father is healthy.

57
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,440
Second Uncle has a disability.

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,480
But all these years,

59
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,519
Second Uncle treated you well

60
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,480
and obeyed your every request.

61
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,560
Why can't you be content?

62
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,399
Obey to me?

63
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,600
That's because he's useless.

64
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,799
If he weren't useless

65
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,280
and unable to be the head of the family,

66
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,679
why would I be cold-shouldered

67
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,639
by you and your mother?

68
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,639
He's just a cripple.

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,880
Only your family
treats him like a treasure.

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,280
How dare Second Madam reprove

71
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,639
her husband in front of Young Lady?

72
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,320
Can't you tell?

73
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,760
She was talking irresponsibly
because Niaoniao agitated her.

74
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,880
You mean, Young Lady did it intentionally?

75
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,160
Take some servants to the main house.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,679
Roger.

77
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,519
Cheng Cheng.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,919
You're a man after all!

79
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,160
Your wife is being bullied,

80
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,840
yet you didn't say a thing.

81
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,079
Why don't...

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,520
Why don't I give you my dress

83
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,960
so you can put it on
to show your brothers?

84
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,919
You're neither successful in your studies

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,840
nor your career. You're even a cripple.

86
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,559
What can you do?

87
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:06,559
What can you do?

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,239
Why am I so unfortunate?

89
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,160
I married an useless person like you.

90
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,119
That's enough!

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
If you're so unsatisfied,

92
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,200
you may go back to your Ge Family.

93
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,759
Brother

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,999
will give you more money.

95
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,679
Dream on.

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,999
When I married you,

97
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,600
your family was in distress.

98
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,960
Now that your brother is successful,

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,960
you want to leave me?

100
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,799
Dream on!

101
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,679
If you had told me to go back
to my family earlier,

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,999
I would say that you're courageous.

103
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,319
What now?

104
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,640
You've been
a worthless wretch your entire life.

105
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,679
Now that your brother is successful,

106
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,280
you dare to talk against me!

107
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,679
Don't even think about it!

108
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,879
You useless wretch!

109
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:18,960
You're just relying on your brother.

110
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,879
Stop it.

111
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,280
Put it down.

112
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,520
Sister-in-law.

113
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,200
Qingcong.

114
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,480
General found some good liquor

115
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,359
and would like to
enjoy it with Second Master.

116
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,919
Go ahead.

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,319
Okay.

118
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Ms. Qingcong.

119
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,359
Don't help me.

120
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,319
I can walk myself.

121
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,520
I don't dare to disobey First Madam's order.

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,520
Please don't make things hard for me.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
Get lost.

124
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
Get lost!

125
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,080
Xiao Yuanyi.

126
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,319
How dare you hit me?

127
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm not just going to hit you,

128
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,040
I'm going to expel you.

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Dream on!

130
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,640
When the Cheng Family was poor,

131
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,919
my family helped you all.

132
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,960
So what?

133
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,239
Now that the Cheng Family is strong
and the Ge Family is weak,

134
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,999
I can hit you and expel you as I like.

135
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,759
What can you do to me?

136
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,840
How dare you?

137
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,439
My father

138
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,119
helped the Cheng Family.

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,999
What help?

140
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,319
Sponsoring ration?

141
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,200
Every family in the village
and the district has done that.

142
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,679
We protect the village

143
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
so that the folks

144
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,640
don't end up in wars.

145
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,480
We protected so many lives.

146
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,520
You only contributed
some rations and money.

147
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,640
So what?

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,319
Shut up!

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,879
You indecisive foolish woman.

150
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,040
My brother is kind enough
to endure you up until today.

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,720
Do you think this is your credit?
Is he afraid of you?

152
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,319
We'll move in three days.

153
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,999
You just stay put here

154
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,640
and wait for the Ge Family to pick you up.

155
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,319
What do you mean?

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,040
What do you mean?

157
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:50,559
Are you going to tell
my family that you will expel me?

158
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,999
Haven't you been trying to remarry?

159
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm just helping you out.

160
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,480
I know, you treat me so

161
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,200
to avenge your daughter.

162
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,440
But I have never harmed her.

163
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,920
It's she who doesn't live up to your expectation.

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,800
You're hating the wrong person.

165
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,399
I don't hate someone easily,

166
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,519
and nor will I hate the wrong person.

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,560
You're getting more
and more jealous every day.

168
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,200
How can I just let you be?

169
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,200
I know

170
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,039
everything you did.

171
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,159
I know

172
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,119
everything you did to Niaoniao

173
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:36,039
in the past years.

174
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
So what?

175
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,840
I'll just take Yangyang back to my family.

176
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,320
Dream on.

177
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,519
Yangyang is a child of the Cheng Family,

178
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,399
she's part of Cheng.

179
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,600
But you must leave.

180
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,560
I have to let you know

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,440
how I felt when you forced me

182
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,039
to abandon Niaoniao

183
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,840
in the name of Old Fairy.

184
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,999
It's a boy.

185
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,279
Old Madam.

186
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,200
Old Fairy was right.

187
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,639
Don't forget.

188
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,279
Old Fairy said

189
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,960
the baby has to be left here

190
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,879
to protect you from the disaster.

191
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,960
Don't forget.

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,800
I didn't.

193
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,519
How dare you mention

194
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,759
the words of a mountebank to Mother?

195
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,440
What are you scheming?

196
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,920
You're going to a battle soon.

197
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
It's normal that you loathe
being apart from the child.

198
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,279
Yes.

199
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,119
That's right.

200
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,600
Sister-in-law is weak after giving birth.

201
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,480
Why don't

202
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,159
we leave her and her son here?

203
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,239
So that

204
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,080
she can take care of her child

205
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,159
and the words of Old Fairy are followed.

206
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,840
Old Madam may also then
be protected from the disaster.

207
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,320
Isn't it a win-win solution?

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,159
You want to separate us as a couple.

209
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,399
No one shall stay behind.

210
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,560
Our family will live and die together.

211
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,320
What...

212
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,840
What about me?

213
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm not your family?

214
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,840
Do you want to sacrifice me?

215
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,440
Old Fairy...

216
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,200
Old Fairy mentioned

217
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,239
that I may face a disaster this year.

218
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:27,399
A baby from the main house
must stay behind to avoid it.

219
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,519
You unfilial son.

220
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,800
Do you want me to die?

221
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,560
I've raised you for nothing.

222
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,960
Hubby, I no longer want to live.

223
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,039
Mother.

224
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,759
This is a lie of a mountebank.

225
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,840
Nonsense.

226
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,879
Old Fairy is accurate.

227
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,119
He said that Sister-in-law
will have a baby boy.

228
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,920
Isn't that right?

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,879
Yes, that's right.

230
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,759
He foretold correctly.

231
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,080
Okay, I shall kill him now.

232
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,080
Let's see if he can foresee his disaster.

233
00:12:58,999 --> 00:12:59,840
General.

234
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,800
General.

235
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,639
Military order. Gu City is in danger.

236
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,320
You're needed for the rescue immediately.

237
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,119
What?

238
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,639
His Majesty just gave that order.

239
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,440
The entire army shall depart in two hours.

240
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,600
Head to Gu City

241
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,879
to assist Marquis Huo.

242
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,159
You may leave.

243
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,519
But the baby must stay.

244
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,639
Or else

245
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,239
you must step past my dead body.

246
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,320
Old Madam.

247
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,239
Yuanyi.

248
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,399
What did Old Madam say?

249
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,080
Only if the child is left behind,

250
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,080
Old Madam can avoid the disaster.

251
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,279
Yes.

252
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,080
Yes.

253
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,039
It must be this baby.

254
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,279
Yes, this baby.

255
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
In that case,

256
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,239
leave the baby girl behind.

257
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,399
Baby girl?

258
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,759
It's a pigeon pair.

259
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,680
First Madam also gave birth to a daughter.

260
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,720
Who will be left behind?

261
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,800
I'll leave my daughter behind.

262
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,720
This is our way

263
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,759
to show our filiality to you.

264
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,519
I'll take my son along.

265
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:30,960
Yuanyi.

266
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,840
General.

267
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,399
Mr. Huo is in danger. We can't delay it.

268
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,239
Depart immediately.

269
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,519
Without my order,

270
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
you can't leave this house.

271
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,080
Yes.

272
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,759
Where's Second Master?

273
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,800
Master is accompanying him.
Don't worry, Madam.

274
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Keep an eye on Madam Ge.

275
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,080
We're moving soon.

276
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,200
Don't let her spoil
our positive atmosphere.

277
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,720
Don't worry, Madam.

278
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,320
It's not that I look down on Second Madam,

279
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,239
but I don't think she would

280
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,519
kill herself.

281
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,320
The misfortune in our family

282
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:44,600
isn't a good thing.

283
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,960
Don't be happy.

284
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,720
Noted, Madam.

285
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,159
If she had behaved,

286
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,159
I would have let her
spend the rest of her life

287
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,239
in this old house.

288
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:05,680
It seems

289
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,119
there's no use for it now.

290
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,519
Young Master.

291
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:23,519
The iron smiths in town are normal,

292
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,840
except for this one.

293
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,759
Since Head Armorer Dong is arrested,
it has been closed.

294
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,119
The people said

295
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,960
that the business is bad
due to the location.

296
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,119
But we noticed

297
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,359
that there are still servants

298
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,039
who bring food to that shop every day.

299
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,320
But the people in this shop

300
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,960
never once came out.

301
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,200
Search.

302
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,399
Roger.

303
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,279
Young Master.

304
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,799
All the iron smiths

305
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,839
respect Zhu Rong.

306
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,920
They wouldn't leave His statue stained.

307
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,799
Don't run.

308
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,200
You're good

309
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,200
that you found this place.

310
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
But you should know

311
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,440
that I won't say a word.

312
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,200
I don't have a family,

313
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,360
you can't threaten to kill them.

314
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,759
I know. You have many ways
to make someone talk.

315
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,120
Being caught by you

316
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,120
is worse than death.

317
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,559
Therefore...

318
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:17,720
He's taking poison.

319
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,599
I'll do it myself.

320
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,279
It's highly toxic. He can't be saved.

321
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,559
Hurry.

322
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,480
These weapons came just in time

323
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,360
to save us from the urgency.

324
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Take them into the warehouse.

325
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,920
Hurry.

326
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Qi, Fei.

327
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Arrest all the staffs

328
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,039
who work in this shop

329
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,440
and all the servants

330
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,120
who work for the Xu Family.

331
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,680
I want to interrogate all of them.

332
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,960
I want to see

333
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,759
how many families of his I can kill.

334
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,559
Young Master,
do you remember this birthmark?

335
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,039
I will never forget it

336
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,920
even if he's turned into ash.

337
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,440
He's the one
who replaced the inferior weapons

338
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,599
in the warehouse.

339
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,920
I actually let him die so easily.

340
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,960
Take down this shop.

341
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,480
Search every inch of it.

342
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,680
Roger.

343
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,200
Hold on.

344
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,239
Don't make too much noise.

345
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,360
Don't let anyone know
about Xu Jinzhong's death.

346
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,839
Investigate his contact with others

347
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,680
secretly.

348
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,160
Don't miss any clues.

349
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,079
Roger.

350
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,120
(Cheng's Residence)

351
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,319
Master Ge.

352
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
(Master Ge)
Father-in-law.

353
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,759
I apologize

354
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:46,999
to you.

355
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,680
No, we owe it to you.

356
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,960
(Aunt Ge)
No, we owe it to you.

357
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,799
Our family should apologize to you.

358
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,440
I bid my greetings

359
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,759
to Grandpa and Aunt Ge.

360
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,400
Get up.

361
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,799
You have grown up.

362
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,039
She grew into a beauty.

363
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,039
Yangyang grew so well

364
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,519
because of your gentle care.

365
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,079
Yangyang.

366
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,480
I brought you many good things.

367
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,920
Yangyang is weak.

368
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Cheng Cheng's legs are injured.

369
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,999
Master Ge is old.
So let's don't stand around here.

370
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,999
Let's go in, Master Ge.

371
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:31,920
That's right.

372
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:32,880
This way, Master Ge.

373
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,839
This way.

374
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,160
Take her to me.

375
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,200
Go.

376
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,920
Okay.

377
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,080
(Cheng's Residence)

378
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,200
I

379
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,599
feel pity for her because
she lost her mother at a young age.

380
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,839
I've spoiled her.

381
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,160
I know she has many problems

382
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,720
yet I shamelessly

383
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,640
let her marry you.

384
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,319
I'm so sorry.

385
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,839
Thank you

386
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,680
for your tolerance for many years.

387
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:24,999
Today,

388
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,680
I came here...

389
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:29,999
Master Ge.

390
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,480
To apologize.

391
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,999
Don't do this, Master Ge.

392
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,200
Please stand.

393
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,039
Father.

394
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,400
Father.

395
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,920
The Cheng Family has wronged me.

396
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,759
Scoundrel!

397
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,360
Sister-in-law.

398
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,400
Ever since you were born,

399
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,400
Father-in-law has answered your every wish

400
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,759
and given you much love.

401
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,160
Have you been filial even for a day?

402
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,319
You're causing trouble all the time.

403
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,400
Father-in-law is old now.

404
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,239
Because of you, he came

405
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,079
despite the bad weather and long journey,

406
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,999
yet you're not sorry at all.

407
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,599
You...

408
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,319
You're

409
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,519
heartless.

410
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,920
Master Ge, you're embarrassing us.

411
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,160
When I was in the battle,

412
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,640
if it weren't for you
who helped with the ration...

413
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,880
General, don't mention that.

414
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,720
Only a woman like my daughter

415
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,839
will keep mentioning that.

416
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,200
During the chaos,

417
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,120
our family was capable

418
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,279
but had no one to rely on.

419
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,239
It was just a small part

420
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,640
of our asset.

421
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,239
Thanks to your help

422
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,799
our village is safe.

423
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,839
There's nothing to thank.

424
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm not worthy of it.

425
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,039
You're too humble.

426
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,839
In the past decades,

427
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:00,720
I stayed uninformed in the village.

428
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,279
I thought

429
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,319
she would grow better with age,

430
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,680
her temper would improve.

431
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,960
I didn't expect,

432
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,519
according to the report,

433
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,160
not only that she didn't improve,

434
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,239
she has become worse.

435
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,400
It has been hard for you.

436
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,759
I didn't raise my daughter well

437
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
and have troubled you.

438
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,279
Father-in-law.

439
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,239
Please don't say that.

440
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,759
I'm also wrong.

441
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,400
She was...

442
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,519
Cheng Cheng.

443
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,039
I've watched you grow.

444
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,599
I know your personality.

445
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,400
It was supposed to be an honor
to be your father-in-law.

446
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,759
But I've troubled you

447
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,200
and sapped your will away.

448
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,680
How can I

449
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,839
not be embarrassed?

450
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,759
Today,

451
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,839
please write the repudiation paper

452
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,680
and I shall take this evil spawn back.

453
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
Isn't the Ge Family here?

454
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,400
Old Madam must have arranged a banquet.

455
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Why are you here?

456
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,039
They're a family.

457
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,720
Why should I stay there?

458
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,880
I used to think Cheng Yang was unlucky

459
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,400
to have an ignorant mother.

460
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,200
But I know today

461
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,680
that she's the luckiest.

462
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,160
Aunt Ge loves her so much.

463
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,559
Second Madam dislikes
that Third Lady isn't a son.

464
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
She abandoned her
before she was a week old.

465
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,559
What's so lucky about her?

466
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,279
Little chips can start great fires.

467
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,599
If Yangyang had grown up at home

468
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,160
like me,

469
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,079
she would have been as hated

470
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,360
as Second Aunt.

471
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,400
Now she grew up with Grandpa,

472
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,239
the Ge Family treats her like a treasure.

473
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,319
Unlike me,

474
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,319
neither Grandmother nor Mother loves me.

475
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,920
And I have a malicious Second Aunt
who raised me.

476
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,680
I'm the unlucky one.

477
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,279
No one dislikes you.

478
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,799
How could you leave

479
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,720
without greeting Master Ge?

480
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,360
That was rude.

481
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,200
Master Ge isn't here to visit

482
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,680
but to handle something important.

483
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,599
Why should I be there?

484
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,599
To watch Second Uncle
write the repudiation paper?

485
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,440
Second Aunt has tortured me a lot.

486
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,960
Should I have

487
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,400
listened to Master Ge

488
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,120
apologize to a junior like me?

489
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,720
But I wasn't right

490
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,200
about today's matter.

491
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,920
I'll change myself.

492
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,799
I'll surely change myself.

493
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,999
You should still greet Master Ge

494
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,239
and Aunt Ge.

495
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,079
Don't make them wait.

496
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,519
Aunt Ge, take me home.

497
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,200
I want to go home.

498
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,839
Don't be silly.

499
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,160
The Cheng Family is your home.

500
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,319
Your parents and your family are here.

501
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,480
You'll only have a future here.

502
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,799
I don't want a future.

503
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,759
I want you and Uncle Ge.

504
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,680
Sister.

505
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,880
Come in.

506
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Okay.

507
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,680
Yuanyi.

508
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,239
Greet Aunt.

509
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,839
Is this Niaoniao?

510
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,279
You're a good girl.

511
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,079
Here.

512
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Take a seat.

513
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,239
My sister-in-law...

514
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,480
Stop it, Sister.

515
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,720
Our families are close.

516
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,279
We understand.

517
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,759
You've also suffered a lot.

518
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,839
But since she joined your family,

519
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,960
it was your turn to suffer.

520
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
Now that Master Ge is taking her back,

521
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,440
you have to suffer again.

522
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,599
Speaking of which, I'm sorry.

523
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,160
Yangyang.

524
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,680
Don't feel embarrassed
when you hear others

525
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:52,319
talking about your mother.

526
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,160
What we got from our parents

527
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,519
isn't just our body,

528
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,079
but also our character.

529
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:01,039
If your parents have good character,

530
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,319
you should learn from them.

531
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,160
If your parents

532
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,920
aren't good enough,

533
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,680
you should take it as a warning.

534
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:11,839
Remember.

535
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,079
Your behavior is your best accessory.

536
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,079
Raise your head.

537
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
A man can aspire anywhere.

538
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,759
But should ladies

539
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:32,480
rely on their parents forever?

540
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,480
Parents can't be your backer forever.

541
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,120
Only when you're determined,

542
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,999
you'll have no fear.

543
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,839
It doesn't matter when and where,

544
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,440
you must be strong
and independent like a big tree.

545
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,519
If you can

546
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,480
learn one thing or two

547
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,720
from your Aunt Yuanyi,

548
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
you will have no worries.

549
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,999
Why don't you drink your buttermilk?

550
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,039
Aunt Ge.

551
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,120
Try our buttermilk.

552
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,400
It's tasty.

553
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,200
Niaoniao is a good girl.

554
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,279
You're still as broad-minded as before.

555
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,880
You raised Yangyang

556
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:25,599
to be a well-behaved

557
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,239
and dignified lady.

558
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,239
Unlike Niaoniao,

559
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,319
who is raised by Madam Ge...

560
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,559
I wonder if it's too late.

561
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,960
Educating children

562
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,480
is never too late.

563
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,480
Even when our children are old,

564
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,480
as long as we're still alive,

565
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,599
we're responsible to educate them.

566
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,640
Although Yangyang

567
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,160
isn't so sharp,

568
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,920
she's honest and obedient.

569
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,640
I hope that

570
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,400
you won't dislike her.

571
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,120
I've always liked you.

572
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,440
I of course like Yangyang

573
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,839
who is raised by you,
why would I dislike her?

574
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:15,799
From today on,

575
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,200
I'll treat Yangyang like my daughter.

576
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
I won't let her suffer.

577
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,400
Stand right there.

578
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,799
I have an order.

579
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,039
Aren't we going to greet Master Ge?

580
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:25,999
Why are we going back?

581
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:26,999
Do you think

582
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,440
Master Ge is really resting?

583
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,999
If I go there now,

584
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,400
I may see Second Aunt being scolded.

585
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,759
Do you

586
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,920
want to eavesdrop?

587
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,599
If yes,

588
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,280
I shall go with you.

589
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,599
Let me ask you,

590
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,760
why did you rush
to serve Aunt Ge buttermilk?

591
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,679
Yangyang was there.

592
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,240
What should she do
when you put yourself in the limelight?

593
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,719
I just liked what Aunt Ge said.

594
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,280
I like someone with her character,

595
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,559
so I did it.

596
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,119
Why would you think that about me?

597
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
You obviously dislike me.

598
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,800
You always

599
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,480
guess me from the worst.

600
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,320
You always think

601
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,079
Yangyang is kind

602
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,760
and I'm never kind.

603
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,880
Everything I do

604
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,440
is a scheme.

605
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,400
If it weren't for
your usual extreme behavior,

606
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,920
I wouldn't misunderstand you.

607
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,119
If you were like Yangyang,

608
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,240
who's gentle and diligent,

609
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,480
people would

610
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,880
think kind of you.

611
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,599
I'm stupid.

612
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm not like Yangyang.

613
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,880
I'm really envious of her.

614
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,719
She was raised by Aunt Ge since childhood.

615
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,199
No one raised me.

616
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,880
How can I be like her?

617
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,880
Don't be angry.

618
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,999
I have a thought.

619
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,240
For the sake of your health,

620
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,159
from now on,

621
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,719
stop keeping an eye on me,

622
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,079
instead, look at my perfect cousin.

623
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
So that

624
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,079
you can be happier.

625
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,599
It's okay.

626
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,800
I can train the worst soldier.

627
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,199
You're just a stubborn girl.

628
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,559
In the future,

629
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,800
I'll have more ways

630
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,599
to educate you.

631
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,119
(Cheng Shaoshang.)

632
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,159
(Rather than pleasing those people)

633
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,999
(who have a prejudice against you,)

634
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
(why not)

635
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,639
(be more detached?)

636
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,679
(Anyway, you have no family to rely on)

637
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,119
(and no friend to share your burden.)

638
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,280
(There are more people)

639
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,440
(who hate you than love you.)

640
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,880
(Without Madam Ge,)

641
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,800
(there'll be other people.)

642
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,039
(Just treat yourself better)

643
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,280
(and expect less from others)

644
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,559
(so you can live more freely.)

645
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,839
(Ruyang)

646
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,440
My mother is old,

647
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,519
so she can't travel far.

648
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,599
How can I have

649
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,920
your mother send me off?

650
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,519
Cheng Cheng.

651
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,159
You have studied hard
since you were young.

652
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,960
Family matters have troubled you.

653
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,079
Since you have the will
to continue your studies,

654
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,639
go to Mount Bailu.

655
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,599
You'll be successful there.

656
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,159
Thank you for your compliment.

657
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,039
Sorry.

658
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,920
Don't feel sorry
because of your disability

659
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,840
or your age.

660
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,840
Many sages gained their success

661
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,079
at an old age.

662
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,480
We may not be as successful as the sages,

663
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,639
but we can have their spirit.

664
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,240
When you're successful in your studies,

665
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,559
come back to the village

666
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,679
and open a school.

667
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:14,079
So that everyone,

668
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,320
despite their background,
can study if they want.

669
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Then my hard work won't be in vain.

670
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,320
May your wish come true.

671
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,719
I will not disappoint you.

672
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,039
Okay.

673
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:27,960
Father.

674
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,480
Focus on your studies, Father.

675
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,599
I will learn to manage the household.

676
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,360
Your mother is going back to the Ge Family

677
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,599
and I may have to travel far.

678
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,360
From now on,

679
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,559
we can no longer take care of you.

680
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:50,920
Sister-in-law.

681
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:53,199
Yangyang is weak.

682
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,679
Although she has servants to help her,

683
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,599
I'm still worried.

684
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,159
I hope

685
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,920
Brother and Sister-in-law
will take care of her,

686
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,280
so I can study in peace

687
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,679
in the school of Mount Bailu.

688
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,440
Don't worry.

689
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
I'll treat her

690
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,760
like my own.

691
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,119
I won't let her

692
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,960
suffer one bit.

693
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,079
Yangyang.

694
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:26,760
When you face anything,

695
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,639
discuss it with your Aunt Yuanyi.

696
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,240
Remember,

697
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,960
the Cheng Family is your home.

698
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,480
Don't worry, Aunt Ge.

699
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,320
I will.

700
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,679
Child,

701
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,880
obey your Uncle Cheng Shi and Aunt Yuanyi.

702
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,400
All right.

703
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,840
Farewell is inevitable.

704
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,679
Thank you for seeing us off here.

705
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,159
Goodbye.

706
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:58,039
Safe journey, Master Ge.

707
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,599
I'll leave her in your care,
Brother and Sister-in-law.

708
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:09,880
I bid

709
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,679
my gratitude.

710
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,360
Cheng Cheng.

711
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,039
Take care.

712
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,240
Take care.

713
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,079
Don't be sad, Yangyang.

714
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,800
Your grandparents

715
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,760
have sent a letter to Mount Bailu.

716
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,599
When your father is there,

717
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,880
someone will look after him.
