(Court of Hua County)

4
00:01:59,133 --> 00:01:59,852
You are...

5
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,772
I'm Cheng Zhi,
Hua County's new county magistrate.

6
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:03,613
May I know

7
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,533
if Old Official Cheng is here?

8
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,732
Official Cheng,
the Old Official Cheng...

9
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:08,453
He's...

10
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:09,212
What's wrong?

11
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:12,053
He and his descendants had died
martyrs for the city.

12
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:17,933
Help me inside.

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,740
(Zhubi Court)

14
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,173
General, your wound is festered.

15
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,812
Please bear with the pain.

16
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,372
I must remove the blood stasis

17
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,173
and dying flesh first.

18
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,252
General, don't be scared.

19
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:54,332
Do it.

20
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:03,613
Your Majesty,

21
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:06,133
my wound is unsightly.

22
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:07,732
Why don't

23
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,453
you step aside first?

24
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:10,332
Why should I?

25
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:11,852
I have seen enough of the world.

26
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,700
(Emperor Wen)

27
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,332
You knew how heavily wounded you are.

28
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:26,933
If you waited another day,

29
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:27,772
not only you'll lose your arm,

30
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,173
you could have lost your life.

31
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:30,812
I've been telling you

32
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,133
to settle down.

33
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,613
You fight and kill all day.

34
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,493
In the end,

35
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:36,933
you'll have no one
to see you off for your funeral

36
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,692
or make your funeral banner
after you die.

37
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,332
If Your Majesty wants to force me

38
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,732
to marry Princess Yuchang
as you did four years ago,

39
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,692
I'll go on another expedition again.

40
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,812
Even if I had to start a war
with the barbarians in their territory,

41
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,852
I shall sacrifice my life there.

42
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,212
Thus,

43
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:56,653
Your Majesty will have
no such worries anymore.

44
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,453
You lad.

45
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,812
That is such a foolish thing to say.

46
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:05,892
You two.

47
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:08,053
Useless things.

48
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:10,453
Your general had suffered such
a serious injury.

49
00:04:10,973 --> 00:04:12,453
Were you blind
or were you incapacitated?

50
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,292
Why didn't you return

51
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,173
and seek treatment earlier?

52
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:17,013
Your Majesty,
I'm to be blamed in this matter.

53
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:18,653
Military orders can't be defied.

54
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,013
So they had

55
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:21,613
to comply.

56
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,053
Don't act recklessly

57
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:25,493
because I won't blame you.

58
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:28,332
I raised you like you're my own son.

59
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:30,252
You're not taking care
of yourself at all.

60
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,772
What exactly do you want?

61
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,332
Can't you be more gentle?

62
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:36,252
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:37,093
It's all right.

64
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,053
Go on.

65
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:44,892
Your uncle and I

66
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,093
were closed like brothers.

67
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:47,933
Since we were young,

68
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,292
we did everything together.

69
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,852
For the sake of the country,

70
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,173
your uncle
and his family were sacrificed.

71
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:59,212
I was heartbroken and blamed myself
for not being able to save him.

72
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:02,212
Thus, granting you
all the honor and glory

73
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:03,852
of the Huo Family

74
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:06,892
with the hope that you'll live well.

75
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,013
But look at you,

76
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:09,772
you refused to find a wife
and continue your family line.

77
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,093
All you do are fight and kill all day

78
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,332
instead of cherishing your body.

79
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,653
Are you planning to let your mother's

80
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,173
family bloodline end in your hands?

81
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:19,133
I just want to be like Uncle

82
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:21,933
who had a wife
where they loved each other.

83
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:24,453
To have someone capricious
like Marquis Chengyang

84
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:26,453
who abandoned my mother,

85
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,133
which led to a life of hatred,

86
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:29,692
I

87
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:31,573
would rather be alone.

88
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,692
Your Majesty,
no need to persuade me anymore.

89
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:42,332
What are you looking at?

90
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:43,772
I want you

91
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:45,173
to get out.

92
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:51,252
Be gentle.

93
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:51,973
Yes, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,332
Fan Chang is capable now.

95
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:17,533
He could actually inflict

96
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,973
such a serious injury
to your Young Master.

97
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,212
Your Majesty,
you think too highly of Fan Chang.

98
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,812
He wasn't the one
who wounded Young Master.

99
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:25,053
He was the one who delayed it.

100
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:27,093
What are you doing?

101
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,412
Speak.

102
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:30,412
What exactly had happened?

103
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:35,892
These two sure

104
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,573
are comparable to their master.

105
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,852
When Zisheng speaks,

106
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,212
both of you

107
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,892
would speak even lesser. Am I right?

108
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:45,933
Stop laughing.

109
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:48,573
I want you to tell me.

110
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:49,772
If you don't,

111
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:52,252
I'll punish your Young Master
along with you.

112
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:54,533
Young Master was initially ordered

113
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:57,173
to attack Fan Chang's rebel army
in Hua County.

114
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:58,692
When the rebel army was just subdued,

115
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,292
we heard
the newly appointed county magistrate

116
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,412
haven't taken office yet.

117
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:02,812
He was worried
they might run into danger.

118
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:05,412
So he turned around to save them.

119
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:08,292
That's why his treatment was delayed.

120
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,013
The newly appointed county magistrate?

121
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,212
Didn't they say
the newly appointed county magistrate

122
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,292
went to Qing County?

123
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:17,653
Since your master went to rescue

124
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,013
the new county magistrate,

125
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,812
he could have treated his injuries
in Qing County.

126
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,613
Young Master didn't go to Qing County
to rescue the new county magistrate.

127
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,653
He went to rescue
his female family member.

128
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:28,732
Female family member?

129
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:29,412
Yes.

130
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:31,412
It was that young lady he saved

131
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,453
who pulled out the arrow.

132
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,173
And that young lady acted blindly.

133
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:35,892
Then Young Master was occupied trying
to capture Fan Chang,

134
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:37,252
which delayed the treatment.

135
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:42,212
(Pulled the arrow? Treat injuries?
A young lady?)

136
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:43,772
Who was that young lady?

137
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:47,732
Don't look at him.

138
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,332
I want you to tell me.

139
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:54,292
It was Marquis Quling's
youngest daughter,

140
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:55,892
Cheng Shaoshang.

141
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,133
Cheng Shaoshang?

142
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:07,933
What does she look like?

143
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,613
Is Third Uncle feeling better now?

144
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:43,692
He's still blaming himself.

145
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,453
He said if he didn't delay the journey,

146
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,732
Old Official Cheng didn't have
to face the strong enemies alone.

147
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,212
Old Official Cheng and your Third Uncle

148
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:56,173
got along together like father and son
in the past.

149
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:58,292
Your Third Uncle kept talking

150
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:01,252
about letting him try food
from the capital city all the way.

151
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:02,852
But who knew

152
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,212
they're now forever separated..

153
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,973
Old Official Cheng was already
in his sixties.

154
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:14,292
Why did he have to take the risk
and leave the city?

155
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,812
Can't he let the soldiers
who guard the gates go?

156
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:17,973
Moreover,

157
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:20,292
he was old and not in a good health.

158
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,613
Even if he didn't fight,

159
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,692
His Majesty wouldn't blame him.

160
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:27,093
His Majesty may not blame him.

161
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,133
But the people
of Hua County were in the city.

162
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,412
All of them were watching.

163
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,732
If they didn't have the drive
to fight the enemies,

164
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:39,573
how do they deserve to be officials?

165
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:45,533
Niaoniao,

166
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:47,732
those who are capable will do their part

167
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,892
in turbulent times.

168
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,412
Your parents too had

169
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,332
to set out

170
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,613
to save the fallen city
without hesitation back then.

171
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:02,133
Third Madam. Young Lady.

172
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,013
I've found her.

173
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:05,013
Old Official Cheng's granddaughter,

174
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,452
Cheng Xiaomei is being treated
at the infirmary.

175
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,693
She was kicked in the chest
by a bandit

176
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:09,572
and seriously injured.

177
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:10,813
I'm afraid she won't be able
to hold on much longer.

178
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:12,612
Let's go and see her.

179
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:14,853
Take me there.

180
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:15,332
Yes, Young Lady.

181
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:16,572
Shaoshang, wait for me.

182
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,260
(Infirmary)

183
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:46,492
Hold it.

184
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:48,532
Bear with it.

185
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:51,733
Hold it.

186
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,693
Grandfather.

187
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:55,933
Father.

188
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,332
Brother.

189
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:07,173
Grandfather.

190
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:09,252
Father.

191
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:11,773
Brother.

192
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:18,612
All of you left

193
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,372
for battle.

194
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,212
Don't...

195
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:25,532
Don't leave me.

196
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,412
Don't leave me here.

197
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,332
Shaoshang, come and play with us.

198
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:42,572
No, I want to practice my swordsmanship.

199
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,292
My father and brothers are heroes.

200
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,412
They went to the battlefield

201
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,572
to defend the country.

202
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:52,053
I want to fight the enemy like them

203
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,853
in the future.

204
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:55,292
Don't be ridiculous.

205
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,412
My grandfather said

206
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:57,813
your parents obviously

207
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:58,973
didn't want you

208
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:00,332
because you're a girl.

209
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:02,412
They only brought your brothers
to their war expeditions

210
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:03,452
except for you.

211
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:04,733
You're the one spouting nonsense.

212
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,893
My parents didn't abandon me.

213
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,893
Then why didn't they come back
and visit you?

214
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,693
They obviously didn't want you.

215
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:12,572
That's why they left you
at Grandaunt's house.

216
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,933
Just ignore her.
We can play by ourselves.

217
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,093
Are you

218
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:57,853
the new female physician?

219
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,412
You look beautiful.

220
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:05,572
The new country magistrate is
my Third Uncle.

221
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,652
I especially came
to visit you on his behalf

222
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,133
and also on your father
and brother's behalf.

223
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,053
They're worried sick about you.

224
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:15,853
But

225
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,093
my father and my brother...

226
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:20,332
They're already

227
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,332
dead.

228
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:31,773
The death of Old Official Cheng

229
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,053
was announced by the bandits

230
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,973
when the city was breached.

231
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:36,612
She already knew.

232
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,332
What a bunch of animals.

233
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:46,053
Dear one,

234
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:48,733
your father and brother didn't mean
to leave you.

235
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:50,252
I hope you won't blame them.

236
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,452
I never blamed

237
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:56,093
Grandfather, Father, and Brother...

238
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,612
They died

239
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,492
to save the people

240
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:02,252
in the city.

241
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:04,332
Everyone said

242
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,572
they were heroes.

243
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:11,452
But I don't want heroes.

244
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:13,572
I only want

245
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:15,492
to talk to them.

246
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:18,813
You can talk to me.

247
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,933
I'll listen.

248
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,693
When I was ill

249
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:25,813
in the past,

250
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,693
Grandfather would

251
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,412
hold me in his arms.

252
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:33,332
Father

253
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:38,252
would comfort me
by telling me many stories.

254
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,093
He would also

255
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,893
let me eat

256
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:45,332
the delicious maltose candy.

257
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:47,372
Shaoshang.

258
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,212
But

259
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,773
it's painful this time.

260
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:53,853
It's really painful.

261
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:56,492
But

262
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:59,212
they're no longer here.

263
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,532
Dear one,

264
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,133
it's all right.

265
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,853
The pain will be gone soon.

266
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:10,612
The people of Hua County
also missed them

267
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,652
as you do.

268
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:18,612
Shaoshang,

269
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:20,452
don't cry.

270
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:25,492
You can have my maltose candy.

271
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,933
Brother gave these

272
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,452
to me secretly

273
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,733
before he left.

274
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,332
So you're eating maltose candy
in secret here.

275
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,652
I'm telling Aunt on you now.

276
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,492
Do you think you can leave
after stealing?

277
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,572
My parents told someone
to deliver these for me.

278
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:03,572
You're lying again.

279
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:06,173
Your parents have gone to war.

280
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,372
No one sells maltose candy
on the battlefield.

281
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,853
Your father has no time
to buy maltose candy.

282
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,532
You obviously stole these candies

283
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,093
that Second Aunt bought for Yangyang.

284
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:15,133
Shameless!

285
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:17,013
Shameless!

286
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:20,053
No parents, no shame!

287
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:23,612
The shameful Cheng Shaoshang!

288
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:24,332
Shaoshang,

289
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:26,572
they look too good to eat.

290
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,133
You can eat it.

291
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,412
After you eat it,

292
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,252
you won't be sad anymore.

293
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,292
Mister,

294
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:49,452
Xiaomei...

295
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,973
She was kicked in the chest
by the bandit,

296
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,252
which caused lung injuries.

297
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:55,933
She'd suffer
from unbearable pain every day.

298
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,212
We've fed her with medicine
to relieve her pain.

299
00:17:58,492 --> 00:17:59,733
But she won't last much longer

300
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,053
because of her internal injuries.

301
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:03,612
What medicine do you need?

302
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:05,372
Can you give me the list?

303
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,693
No matter how expensive or how scarce,

304
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,013
I'll find ways to get them.

305
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,053
She must live.

306
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,053
She must survive for her family.

307
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:13,173
Yes.

308
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:14,813
Why did you save me?

309
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,492
I've lost my leg.

310
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:21,212
I'll only be a burden if I live.

311
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,612
It's better to die.

312
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:25,813
Lest I'd be a burden to my family.

313
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,372
You can still walk with walking sticks.

314
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:29,492
Don't ever give up.

315
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:31,093
Give up?

316
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,452
Even children of noble families like you

317
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:36,133
also know not to give up.

318
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:37,853
My father and brother's limbs

319
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,773
were chopped off

320
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,292
by those bandits.

321
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:44,733
They died in agony.

322
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,773
I was the one who gave up on them.

323
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,933
I should be the one who died.

324
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:54,693
Your father and your brother
had died tragically.

325
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:57,013
Yet, a man like you
can't keep on living?

326
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:58,532
If I were your father and your brother,

327
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,212
I'd crawl out of the grave
in the middle of the night

328
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:01,933
to scold you to your senses!

329
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,532
They gave their lives so you could live.

330
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,412
How could you give up
on your life so easily?

331
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:07,733
If I were you,

332
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,133
I'd make an effort to drink my medicine

333
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,053
and cooperate with the treatment.

334
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:12,332
When I'm all recovered,
I'd build a family

335
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,292
and live my life together with them.

336
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,173
Bring the medicine.

337
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,492
Take it!

338
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,372
Here.

339
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,173
She was violated by a bandit.

340
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,652
She refused to eat or drink
after she woke up

341
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,053
and kept making a scene to kill herself.

342
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,133
She's afraid her fiancé
no longer wants her.

343
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:10,933
Pretend you were bitten by an animal.

344
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:14,773
I know you're having a hard time.

345
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,492
But killing yourself is not
your way out.

346
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,133
My companion

347
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,332
was kidnapped by the bandits.

348
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:25,053
But they didn't leave her remains whole body.

349
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,252
I kept praying in those days.

350
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:30,893
Even if she was humiliated,

351
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,212
I'd be grateful if she lived.

352
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:35,252
Being alive is the best way.

353
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,532
Now that you've survived,

354
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:38,893
your husband ought

355
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,252
to be happy about it.

356
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:42,053
If he doesn't mind,

357
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,252
why do you want to give up on him

358
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,292
because heaven was blind?

359
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:46,933
If you do it,

360
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,173
you'd be a fool.

361
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:51,813
If he minds,

362
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,612
to kill yourself over a heartless man

363
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:56,693
is even more foolish.

364
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,292
Hua County was attacked by bandits.

365
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:17,572
I know some of you lost your family,

366
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:19,733
became incapacitated,

367
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,173
and faced many agonizing experiences.

368
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,212
But did you know?

369
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,133
If it weren't for Old Official Cheng
who stalled the bandits

370
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:27,853
with this entire family's life,

371
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:29,893
you wouldn't even live to this day.

372
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,893
Now, Old Official Cheng's
only descendant

373
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,532
is still lying there dying.

374
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:39,612
She just told me she must keep on living

375
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:41,853
because it was a chance

376
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,133
her grandfather and family exchanged
with their lives.

377
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,372
Even a child knows this,

378
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:49,733
why can't you understand it?

379
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:52,893
How will you face

380
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:53,612
all those people

381
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,572
who died fighting for your lives
and your families who died

382
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,853
if you give up this easily?

383
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:16,372
Mister,

384
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:19,053
I'm not afraid of pain.

385
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:20,773
Help me set my bones.

386
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:23,372
Mister,

387
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,133
I want my medicine.

388
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:26,572
I want my medicine too.

389
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:27,973
Me too.

390
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:28,973
Mister,

391
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:32,093
I want my medicine too.

392
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:33,612
All right.

393
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:34,853
Hurry. Apply for the medicine.

394
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:36,532
Hurry.

395
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:40,133
Here, be careful.

396
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,600
Here is the medicine.

397
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,420
Come and have the medicine.

398
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:26,693
Shaoshang,

399
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:28,093
you've just recovered from your cold.

400
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,652
Are you sure you don't want to rest?

401
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:31,773
No.

402
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:33,572
If I rest,

403
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:35,053
I'll keep thinking about Cheng Xiaomei.

404
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,372
If you feel tired,

405
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:39,532
you can get some rest.

406
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:16,013
Why don't I help you with the account?

407
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:17,612
You're working so hard.

408
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:31,013
You're really considerate.

409
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:35,292
Help me with this then.

410
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:39,212
The money we have in the treasury

411
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:41,133
is only enough to buy 30 cars of wooden

412
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:42,332
and 40 carts of sand.

413
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:44,133
But there are
about 50 damaged houses outside

414
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,532
that need to be repaired.

415
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,173
We don't need to calculate

416
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,093
to know we don't have enough materials.

417
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:50,733
But there's only this much money

418
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:52,252
in the treasury.

419
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,212
Money?

420
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,292
I have a jade pendant

421
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:01,693
and...

422
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,372
I also have this jade.

423
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:06,332
My mother said

424
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:07,693
this jade is the Lou Family's heirloom.

425
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:08,572
It's worth a lot of money.

426
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,933
Also this fan

427
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:21,452
and this money.

428
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:25,093
Are these enough?

429
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,372
These are all I have.

430
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,773
So are these

431
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,612
all you have, Mr. Lou?

432
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,372
Since I was young,
my eldest brother taught me not

433
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:43,933
to be obsessed with money

434
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,773
because it's a worldly possession.

435
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:48,492
So I don't carry many valuable items.

436
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:50,853
Besides,
I don't lack anything since young.

437
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:52,652
So I never carry any money.

438
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,452
Aristocratic families
like you don't worry

439
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,933
about food or clothing.

440
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:00,173
So what do you usually do
to keep yourself occupied?

441
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,773
Naturally, to be an exemplary person.

442
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:06,173
He gains knowledge from learning,
questions morality,

443
00:26:06,452 --> 00:26:08,693
treats others with tolerance,
acts with kindness,

444
00:26:09,212 --> 00:26:10,572
continuously strives to improve oneself,

445
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:12,133
and accommodates everything
through virtue...

446
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,053
I know now.

447
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,173
It's to gain a good reputation.

448
00:26:23,372 --> 00:26:24,133
Yao,

449
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,013
I just came up with an idea.

450
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:28,332
You've been a great help this time!

451
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:33,572
Shaoshang!

452
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:35,013
Why didn't you hit yourself?

453
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,013
Because it'll hurt!

454
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:51,093
Niaoniao, it's not hard

455
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:53,053
to write a commendation letter

456
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:54,813
for merchants who made donations.

457
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:56,452
But once it's stamped
with an official seal,

458
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:59,532
it's not something to joke about.

459
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:00,292
Third Uncle,

460
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:01,933
don't be anxious just yet.

461
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:03,332
Let me explain first.

462
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:04,693
If we do this,

463
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:06,733
we may not be able to announce
asking to do good deeds.

464
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:08,412
But we can tempt with recognition.

465
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:10,973
Who in the world doesn't want
a good reputation?

466
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:13,532
Third Uncle,

467
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:15,652
you can write some pleasant phrases

468
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:16,853
like

469
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:18,212
"benevolent and caring,

470
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:19,492
perseverance in actions,

471
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:20,452
an exemplary person,

472
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:21,332
or a person of great value."

473
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:23,372
As long as they donate more
than 300 Liang,

474
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:24,572
we'll award them a plaque.

475
00:27:24,813 --> 00:27:26,652
A plaque only costs several Liang.

476
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,332
Yet, it could motivate the merchants

477
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:29,933
to pay for the reconstruction
of Hua County.

478
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:33,612
Pay for the reconstruction
of Hua County...

479
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:37,053
Third Uncle,

480
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,412
why did you take so long to respond

481
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,053
to a simple reason like this?

482
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,572
I was trying to figure out

483
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:45,693
who taught you

484
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:46,773
this little tactic.

485
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,093
No one needs to be taught

486
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:49,652
a simple strategy like this.

487
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:52,452
Third Uncle,

488
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:54,973
are you looking down on my strategy

489
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,292
or me?

490
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:00,332
It's simple logic.

491
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:02,013
You use several Liang
to gain hundreds of Liang.

492
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:05,173
Third Uncle,

493
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:06,933
don't tell me you're that stingy

494
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,612
to spend a few Liang.

495
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:11,693
Just look at yourself.

496
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,893
You don't behave like
a young lady at all.

497
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,372
Sit on your knees
and put your hands down.

498
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:18,652
Promise you'll do it first.

499
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,212
All right, I promise.

500
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:24,693
Write it now.

501
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:26,252
Now?

502
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:28,572
If not now, when?

503
00:28:57,173 --> 00:28:57,693
Yao!

504
00:28:58,013 --> 00:28:58,492
Lady Cheng.

505
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,173
(The wooden beam
should be built higher.)

506
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,813
(Higher roof ridge provides
better lighting.)

507
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:03,853
(We can save the use of candles.)

508
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:04,452
(All right.)

509
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:05,733
(Plaster is here.)

510
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:07,813
(Did you mix cassava flour
in the plaster?)

511
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:08,572
(All right.)

512
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:11,252
(It'll be stronger after adding it.)

513
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:12,652
(Young Lady, you're sure impressive.)

514
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:13,973
(This young lady knows a lot.)

515
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:18,053
Shaoshang,

516
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,492
rest and drink some water.

517
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:27,532
Your roof beam is well-drawn.

518
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:29,933
This roof ridge too.

519
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:31,773
What is this then?

520
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,173
And this?

521
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:35,452
What about this?

522
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:37,452
Stop bothering me.

523
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:43,452
Xiaomei is awake.

524
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:48,853
You're up.

525
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:51,933
After I've recovered,

526
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:53,893
I want to build houses

527
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:55,332
with Shaoshang.

528
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:57,733
You're really amazing.

529
00:29:58,053 --> 00:29:59,652
You know how to build anything.

530
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:03,733
What kind of house
do you want to build, Xiaomei?

531
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:05,612
You can draw it for us.

532
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:06,612
All right.

533
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,853
We'll draw it on Yao's face.

534
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:11,013
All right.

535
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:15,773
Yao,

536
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:17,492
why don't you be the house?

537
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:28,612
All right.

538
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:35,853
I want...

539
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:37,813
I want

540
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:40,173
my house with a window.

541
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,893
And another window.

542
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:55,332
I want my house

543
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:59,733
to have flowers on the roof too.

544
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,853
I also want

545
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:19,973
a butterfly on the top of my house.

546
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,173
Butterfly?

547
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:23,813
Butterfly?

548
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,252
We have a butterfly now.

549
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,933
It's beautiful.

550
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,053
I really want

551
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:44,372
to see Hua County go back to how it was

552
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:47,292
when Father and Brother
were still alive.

553
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,173
When that time comes,

554
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:50,693
Shaoshang will build

555
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:53,973
the most beautiful house.

556
00:31:55,773 --> 00:32:00,612
But I don't know if I'll live to see it.

557
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:05,492
Xiaomei,

558
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:06,973
you'll definitely see it.

559
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:08,973
You will.

560
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:10,372
Yes, Xiaomei.

561
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,612
Shaoshang and I will turn

562
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,532
Hua County back to how it was.

563
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,053
We'll definitely rebuild it.

564
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:18,252
After that, we'll build a new house,

565
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:20,372
which is better and more beautiful

566
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,252
than the one on my face.

567
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:22,532
All right.

568
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:40,452
It's only been several days
since you recovered.

569
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:42,532
Yet, you left to go after the remnants
of Fan Chang's rebel army.

570
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:44,893
Your condition is getting worse.

571
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:47,412
His Majesty's glare almost pierced
us to death.

572
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:48,773
It's only a minor injury.

573
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:51,532
Did you complete the task

574
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:52,652
I asked you?

575
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:53,733
It's all done.

576
00:32:57,013 --> 00:32:58,813
If your wound didn't relapse,

577
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:00,813
you could've handed over the money
to Lady Cheng yourself.

578
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,412
Young Master, if only you could see

579
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:04,332
how Lady Cheng managed to bring

580
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,733
the dispirited city back to life
in just a few days.

581
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,492
That was really impressive.

582
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,332
When the people were rewarded
with plaques of recognition,

583
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:11,412
everyone was in great spirit.

584
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:15,652
It's unfortunate that you ordered us
to keep a low profile

585
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:17,652
Lady Cheng still doesn't know

586
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,492
you donated the most money.

587
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,133
We're not merchants anyway.

588
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:22,773
We need to make ourselves unnoticeable.

589
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,893
If those merchants found out
about my identity,

590
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:27,212
they would suspect she deliberately used

591
00:33:27,532 --> 00:33:29,452
our identities
to force them to donate money.

592
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,813
It's better to go unnoticed.

593
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:33,853
This can help her

594
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,173
and not cause any trouble.

595
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,532
This is doing good deeds anonymously.

596
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:39,893
Even Fourth Lady Cheng doesn't know
about this.

597
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,173
As long as I can help her is enough.

598
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:46,372
She doesn't need to know.

599
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:03,933
Shaoshang,

600
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:05,292
what do you think about the honey cake?

601
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:07,332
It's quite sweet.

602
00:34:07,693 --> 00:34:09,053
But the honey is a little thick.

603
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:10,452
It'll make me feel heavy
if I eat too much.

604
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:13,612
I'll buy it from another shop next time.

605
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,893
Are you craving anything else?

606
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:22,053
Ring-shaped cake from the He's shop

607
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:24,133
and lamb patties.

608
00:34:24,492 --> 00:34:25,572
I want sweet dumplings too.

609
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:26,893
But

610
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:28,372
you don't have to buy them all.

611
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,133
Even if you want
frozen dessert in winter

612
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,292
or hot pot in the summer,

613
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:32,853
I'll find them for you.

614
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:35,652
Yao,

615
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:37,013
you're a wonderful person.

616
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:43,013
No one has complimented me so.

617
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:45,093
My elder brother always says

618
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,173
that I'm fine but still lacking.

619
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:51,013
You can find so many delicacies
even after the disaster.

620
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:53,332
It shows you do things
meticulously and appropriately.

621
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,652
I'm not as good as you.

622
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,532
The people were inspired

623
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,492
to donate money and materials.

624
00:34:58,572 --> 00:35:00,773
Hua County has hope because of you.

625
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:06,492
Yao,

626
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:08,933
I noticed you have another strength.

627
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:10,093
What is it?

628
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:10,973
A good judgment.

629
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:13,853
Only you and my father know

630
00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:14,853
how to appreciate me

631
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:16,133
in this world.

632
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,093
When my father meets you in the future,

633
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:20,733
I think

634
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:22,412
you two will get along with each other.

635
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:23,532
Shaoshang, are you willing...

636
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:25,652
Are you willing to take me
to meet your father?

637
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:27,412
Why not?

638
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:30,893
Shaoshang, I've already decided.

639
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:32,733
When we're appointed
as officials in the future,

640
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,372
You'll direct the work
in building constructions

641
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,252
while I'll take care
of your everyday life.

642
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:38,212
Our days will surely improve
for the better.

643
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:40,893
Wait here.

644
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:42,452
I'll find some sweet dumplings for you.

645
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:47,292
Construction building?

646
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,053
Official Cheng. Mrs. Cheng.

647
00:35:58,173 --> 00:35:59,412
Third Aunt. Third Uncle.

648
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,372
Niaoniao,

649
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:02,133
your idea was brilliant.

650
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:03,893
Now, the money we've raised

651
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:05,212
had been spent on reconstruction.

652
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,133
You had saved the people in the county

653
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,093
the trouble from raising money.

654
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:14,212
I don't deserve all the credit.

655
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:15,733
Speaking of which, Third Uncle.

656
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,652
An anonymous donor donated
the largest amount.

657
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:18,492
Have you found out who that was?

658
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:21,013
Not yet.

659
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:22,973
Since this person donated anonymously,

660
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:24,973
I'm sure
this person arranged it thoroughly

661
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:26,212
to hinder us from finding out.

662
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:29,572
I wonder who's this kind-hearted person
who helped me.

663
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:30,372
I meant

664
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:32,853
to help the people of Hua County.

665
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:35,053
No matter who that is,

666
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:36,813
is that person as attentive
and considerate

667
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:37,973
as Mr. Lou?

668
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:39,252
Naturally, incomparable.

669
00:36:39,412 --> 00:36:40,693
After meeting Yao,

670
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,492
I have a ledger
and money from the donation.

671
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,893
I even have a helper
to build houses.

672
00:36:44,973 --> 00:36:45,813
Look.

673
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:47,933
Even food is available.

674
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,532
Hua County.

675
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:56,813
Hua County?

676
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:00,933
A female family member.

677
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:01,652
Yes.

678
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:03,652
It was that young lady he saved

679
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:04,773
who pulled out the arrow.

680
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,492
And that young lady acted blindly.

681
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,173
Then Young Master was occupied trying
to capture Fan Chang,

682
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:09,572
which delayed the treatment.

683
00:37:12,572 --> 00:37:15,053
Is this the memorial sent by Cheng Zhi,

684
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,532
the acting county magistrate
of Hua County?

685
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:17,733
Yes, Your Majesty.

686
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,652
"More than 109 houses were destroyed,

687
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:21,813
and nearly 100 people
were injured and killed.

688
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:24,252
In just a few days,

689
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,532
more than 20 houses
had been reconstructed."

690
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:28,572
Well done.

691
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:29,813
Well done.

692
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:31,412
It looks like Cheng Zhi

693
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:32,893
is really capable.

694
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:34,773
He is, Your Majesty.

695
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:40,412
It's said that he has a niece
of virtue and talent.

696
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:43,212
Not only did she treat the wounded
and rescue the dying,

697
00:37:43,212 --> 00:37:45,452
but she also inspired the restoration.

698
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:48,973
Does this young lady have

699
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:50,252
a marriage prospect?

700
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:52,292
Of course,

701
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:54,252
such a talented young lady

702
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,212
must have many suitors worn out
her residence's threshold

703
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:58,893
from visiting her residence.

704
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:00,492
Your Majesty,

705
00:38:00,492 --> 00:38:03,652
Young Lady Cheng doesn't have
a marriage prospect yet.

706
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:05,332
No marriage prospect?

707
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:09,252
Your Majesty,

708
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:11,813
Old Official Cheng died
a martyr for the city

709
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:13,013
along with his children
and grandchildren.

710
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:14,412
His loyalty was incomparable.

711
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:15,853
Shouldn't he

712
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:16,893
be rewarded?

713
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,412
You're finally waked up.

714
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:23,652
Yes, I do have the intention.

715
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,053
I was planning to order someone

716
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:29,173
to deliver this imperial edict
to Hua County.

717
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:31,212
I have the utmost respect
for Old Official Cheng.

718
00:38:31,212 --> 00:38:32,252
So I'm willing to deliver
this imperial edict.

719
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,693
Get up. Your injury...

720
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:34,452
I've recovered.

721
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:38,173
I've fully recovered.

722
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:40,612
That's good.

723
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,412
Since Zisheng wants
to deliver it himself,

724
00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:46,252
you can make the arrangement.

725
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,492
I shall obey your order, Your Majesty.

726
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,173
That was a speedy recovery.

727
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:01,013
Youth.

728
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,853
Youth is the reason you recovered fast.

729
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:05,292
Nothing can beat that.

730
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,013
Nothing.

731
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:08,492
Thank you, Your Majesty.

732
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:38,733
Master.

733
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:41,973
Have you inquired

734
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:43,173
if any of the female family members
of the Cheng Family

735
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:44,853
had met with any danger?

736
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,452
I've inquired around.

737
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,372
There were indeed female family members
of the Cheng Family.

738
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:49,693
There wasn't only one.

739
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,973
Fourth Lady Cheng was also
in the carriage.

740
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:54,652
Why is she also in Hua County?

741
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:58,332
It's said she was in the company
of the county magistrate of Hua County.

742
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:00,933
They didn't expect to run into bandits.

743
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,292
There were many casualties.

744
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,652
They were rescued by General Ling
who was with His Majesty.

745
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:07,093
Now, they've gone to Hua County.

746
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,093
You're dismissed.

747
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:10,093
Yes.

748
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:15,292
No matter what,

749
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,652
I must set out immediately to meet her.

750
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:20,053
After this incident,

751
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:22,893
I can't delay it anymore.

752
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:25,412
I've owed her too much.

753
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:28,093
If I don't tell her

754
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:30,372
of my guilt and shame in person.

755
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:33,973
I can never die in peace

756
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:37,853
in this life.

757
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:44,173
All right.

758
00:40:44,532 --> 00:40:46,173
I shall accompany you

759
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:47,652
to Hua County.

760
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:53,693
Of all women in this world,

761
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:56,212
why is she so unlucky?
