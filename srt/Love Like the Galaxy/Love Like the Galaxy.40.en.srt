= Love Like The Galaxy=

00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,420
=Episode 40=

3
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,120
She went there with my cloak.

4
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,600
Liang Shang couldn't
recognise Youtong that day

5
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,680
and chased her out
like he was chasing me.

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,760
When the servant was moving books,

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,439
he discovered Liang Shang

8
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,400
lying on the bookcase

9
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,439
with a knife stabbed into his body.

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,040
Madam.

11
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,399
I really didn't kill him.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,959
Don't worry.

13
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,000
With General Ling and Yuan Shen here,

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,639
they will definitely crack the case

15
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,040
and prove your innocence.

16
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:21,959
Pin her down!

17
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
Now that he's dead,

18
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,239
you can say anything you want.

19
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,280
Liang Xia

20
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,200
questioned the guards

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,959
and you were the only one
who came and left the place.

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,079
Do you think

23
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,920
Youtong was the one who killed my son?

24
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,519
Dishonest woman

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,280
who committed adultery
with the Crown Prince.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,399
Who would believe you?

27
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,200
Who was the one who killed him
if it weren't you?

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,280
Madam Yuan.

29
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,639
There are still many mysteries.

30
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,200
Please let me investigate it.

31
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,160
Investigate the case?

32
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,799
Look what you are doing.

33
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,760
Even if His Majesty
asks you to help the empire,

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,920
I'm sure you will agree to it.

35
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,239
Why are you looking at me?

36
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:02,119
Am I wrong?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,079
Seriously.

38
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,559
There is not a single lady

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,720
who is as presumptuous and a show-off

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,119
as you in the capital.

41
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,200
You have no skills

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,239
yet you're investigating a case?

43
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,320
Are you really going?

44
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,799
Mother.

45
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,679
Shanjian and Lady Cheng
will be going to investigate the case.

46
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,920
We are leaving.

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,959
Cheng Shaoshang!

48
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,920
Aren't you here to investigate the case?

49
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,200
Why are you staring at me?

50
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,399
You are different from your mother.

51
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,200
You usually dressed

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,880
like the son of a noble family

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,799
but your mother is plainly dressed.

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,399
She is serious

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,920
yet you are mean.

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,839
A family

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,480
has to complement
each other's weaknesses.

58
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,920
My mother doesn't like to laugh or talk.

59
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,280
If I were the same,

60
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,799
my house would be more boring

61
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,960
and harder for me to stay there.

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,840
You are right.

63
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,799
It's the same for me and my mother.

64
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,879
We cover each other's weaknesses

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
and are both different.

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Stay away.

67
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,879
A lady investigating a case.

68
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,239
Don't you think it's horrible?

69
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,199
I came to investigate

70
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,520
because I think there's something fishy.

71
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,239
Zisheng didn't allow me
to come at first.

72
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,799
Why are you still here then?

73
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,040
Just wait at home
until he closes the case.

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,359
This case is related to
the reputation of Qu Lingjun.

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,480
It is also related to Her Majesty
and Crown Prince's reputation.

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,759
Why should I wait at home?

77
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,799
I'm not the kind of woman
who obeys my husband.

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,520
Actually, Ling Buyi is right.

79
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,239
This case involves the Crown Prince.

80
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,359
Many people might be involved.

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,999
You might find out too much if you
go too deep into the investigation

82
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,359
but if you investigate too less,
you might end up with nothing.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,040
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
(That's weird.)

85
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,199
(If there's no the third person in this house,)

86
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,799
(how did the murderer
kill Liang Shang from inside?)

87
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,559
Your temper is getting better recently.

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
In the past,

89
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,999
you would've argued with me
after three sentences.

90
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,160
I think so too.

91
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,960
Perhaps it's because I have Zisheng.

92
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,359
He treats me very well

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,640
and loves me.

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,679
Naturally, I won't

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
have anything else
to argue with other people.

96
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,960
I never thought

97
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,239
I would marry a man
with his personality.

98
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
But when I think about it,

99
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,559
I might have some regrets in my life

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,799
if I didn't meet him.

101
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,080
Why am I saying this to you?

102
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,199
You should go for an arranged date soon

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,600
and find yourself a fiancee.

104
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,759
Why should I

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,160
go for an arranged date
and find a fiancee soon?

106
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,640
You're in love with Ling Buyi,
it has nothing to do with me.

107
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,999
Why did you get me involved?

108
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:34,879
It's because you have no one you love

109
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,239
so you feel annoyed deep down
when you see a loving couple

110
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:38,280
like us.

111
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,679
However,

112
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,359
I know you envy Zisheng

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,319
for marrying an excellent lady like me.

114
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,999
But let me tell you.

115
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,080
You can lower your standards.

116
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,080
After all, an excellent lady like me

117
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
is hard to find.

118
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,280
You think

119
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,799
I envy Ling Buyi?

120
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,280
Of course, you do.

121
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,239
Otherwise, why would you
make noises when you see him

122
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,799
like you have an itchy throat?

123
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,319
I was...

124
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,319
What?

125
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Something in your throat?

126
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:11,999
It was because

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,999
I saw you being intimate all the time

128
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,480
and I felt disgusted.

129
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Disgusted?

130
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,720
Get out if you feel disgusted.

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,199
Fine.

132
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,920
Get out.

133
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,359
Do it yourself.

134
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,999
Sour grapes.

135
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,080
If you're tired,

136
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,359
why not come out and take a break?

137
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,520
This place is as big as a palm.

138
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,840
As big as a palm?

139
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,799
One, two, three, four...

140
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,640
Careful.

141
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,960
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

142
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,559
11, 12, 13,

143
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,920
14, 15, 16...

144
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,400
What are you doing now?

145
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,799
18. 19, 20,

146
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,040
21, 22, 23, 24,

147
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,920
25, 26.

148
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,479
One, two, three, four,

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,040
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

150
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,640
11, 12, 13,

151
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,520
14, 15, 16,

152
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,559
17, 18, 19,

153
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,599
20.

154
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:07,760
That's not right.

155
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,719
Why is it 26 steps
from the outside

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,479
but only 20 steps inside?

157
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,199
Where are the remaining six steps?

158
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,760
I, Liang Wuji,

159
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,400
am just an adopted son
of the Liang Family.

160
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,400
When Liang Shang died,

161
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,920
I took over
as the temporary house master.

162
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,439
Liang Shang and Liang Xia
have the same mother.

163
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
They have Grand Duke Liang's lineage.

164
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
When Liang Shang was buried,

165
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,760
I handed over
the position of house master

166
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,959
to my third brother, Liang Xia.

167
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,160
Was the relationship

168
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
between Liang Xia and Liang Shang good?

169
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,000
He...

170
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,839
Where is Liang Xia?

171
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:44,280
Quiet.

172
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,679
Third Young Master Liang?

173
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,679
Are you the murderer?

174
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,640
Nonsense.

175
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,520
I didn't kill him.

176
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,839
Why are you hiding here then?

177
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,880
You are even pointing a knife at me.

178
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,880
I haven't asked you.

179
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,839
Why did you come here to your death?

180
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,439
Third Young Master Liang,
do you think you will be safe

181
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,040
by killing me?

182
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,439
If I go missing in the Liang residence
for no reason,

183
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,360
you won't be safe.

184
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,760
This secret room is hidden.

185
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,839
I'm the only one who knows about it.

186
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,400
You came in

187
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,240
because you got lucky.

188
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:22,760
They might not find this room.

189
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,599
I can kill you

190
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
and wait for them to leave,

191
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,679
then I'll find out a method to escape.

192
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,040
Who will find out

193
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,079
that I am the real murderer?

194
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,400
If I can guess it,

195
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,360
do you think they can't?

196
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,400
You stabbed Liang Shang
when he was angry

197
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,319
and pinned the crime on Qu Lingjun.

198
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,199
After that, you hid in this hidden room

199
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,760
and took off your bloodied robe

200
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
to change into a servant's clothes

201
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,479
before sneaking out among the chaos.

202
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
You are hiding here

203
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,920
because you were scared
by Ling Buyi just now

204
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
and came to destroy the evidence.

205
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,240
Right?

206
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,599
Shut up!

207
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,000
I will kill you if you say another word!

208
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,400
You had a bright future ahead.

209
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,199
Why did you take the risk
to kill your brother?

210
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm sure you have a reason.

211
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,079
I wasn't wrong.

212
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,199
Liang Shang forced me.

213
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
He inherited the position
of house master

214
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,679
but he was addicted to
jewel collections

215
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,240
and abandoned
the Liang Family's business.

216
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
He was not fit
to become the house master.

217
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,880
I am supposed to be the eldest son!

218
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,120
I am the one who is more ambitious!

219
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,479
Why didn't I get anything?

220
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:29,280
I had accomplished nothing
for more than 20 years.

221
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,599
If he didn't die,

222
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,959
I would have
accomplished nothing forever.

223
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,199
You've been enduring
for more than 20 years.

224
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,280
Why did you take the risk now?

225
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,719
Someone must have duped you.

226
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,400
In that case,

227
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,479
I have an idea to help you.

228
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:51,679
Young Master.

229
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,719
We searched the whole house.

230
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:53,880
Lady Cheng is not inside.

231
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,079
I am Ling Buyi's Fiancee.

232
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,799
I am very important to him.

233
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,920
Use my life to exchange for your life.

234
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm sure he will let you go.

235
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,799
How is that?

236
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:17,079
Get to work.

237
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,400
Tear the house down.

238
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,280
Yes!

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
Ling Buyi, are you crazy?

240
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,079
You can't tear the house down!

241
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:33,559
This is the Liang Family's old house.
You can't do it!

242
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,439
Do it!

243
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,439
Yes!

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,040
Liang Xia.

245
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,439
Don't hesitate.

246
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,959
Escape with me as your hostage.

247
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,760
You only have this method now.

248
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,400
Don't lie to me.

249
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,000
I will kill you now.

250
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,479
I'll escape

251
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,439
when all of them have left.

252
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,599
Isn't that safer?

253
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,880
Faster!

254
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,799
If you still hesitate,

255
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,479
you will no longer be able to escape

256
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:34,679
when Ling Buyi

257
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,959
comes in and tears the place down.

258
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,920
Shut up!

259
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,319
Come here.

260
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,599
She's here.

261
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,319
Don't come near!

262
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,839
Xia.

263
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,079
A good man always avoids taking risks.

264
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,719
Shen, don't go.

265
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,520
Xia.

266
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,799
Step back!

267
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,120
Otherwise, I'll kill her!

268
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,120
Back off!

269
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:20,760
Third Young Master Liang.

270
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,640
Let her go.

271
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,880
Can I still escape alive
if I let her go?

272
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,400
Don't think everyone is stupid!

273
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,199
Surround them!

274
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,839
General Ling,

275
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,599
don't trouble my people.

276
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,880
If he lets her go,

277
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,559
I'll spare the Liang Family

278
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,920
and your mother.

279
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,079
General Ling.

280
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,839
Why would you trouble a woman?

281
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
The Liang Family is
a century-old family.

282
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,319
Uncle.

283
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,599
If Lady Cheng
of Changqiu Palace is in danger,

284
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:59,400
it will also offend Her Majesty
and anger His Majesty.

285
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,599
The Liang Family

286
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,679
will also be finished.

287
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,439
Zisheng.

288
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,520
I saw the bloody robe
in the secret room.

289
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,280
He is the murderer.

290
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,959
Shut up!

291
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:10,959
Don't move.

292
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,559
Third Young Master Liang.

293
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,199
We have you surrounded
and we have evidence.

294
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,719
You have nowhere to go now.

295
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,599
But I can guarantee

296
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,160
your mother's safety

297
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
if you don't hurt my fiancee.

298
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,000
Xia.

299
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,799
Escape. Leave me.

300
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,040
I won't surrender!

301
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
I will drag someone with me
even if I die!

302
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,719
If you want to kill this old woman,

303
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,839
just do it!

304
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,439
I won't change my decision.

305
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Xia!

306
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,760
Move.

307
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,719
You said it.

308
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,679
I will cut off her arm.

309
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,120
Let's see
who will change his decision first.

310
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,599
Son!

311
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,199
Son!

312
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,719
My son!

313
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,279
My son!

314
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,759
I said there's no need for you
to investigate this case

315
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,959
but you still wanted to take the risk.

316
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,719
What would I do

317
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,959
if something happens to you?

318
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,120
I've been bringing

319
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,080
the blade Uncle Wan gave me just in case.

320
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,279
But I saw that he didn't want to die

321
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,600
so I tried to find a way
to let him take me out.

322
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,800
If I would die,

323
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
I still wanted to see you
one last time before dying.

324
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:52,351
Forget that.

325
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,160
I'm already so scared

326
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,759
and yet you still scolded me

327
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,999
without comforting me.

328
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,880
It's my bad.

329
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,120
I was scared.

330
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,920
Will the great Ling Buyi feel scared?

331
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm scared

332
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,959
when it's related to you.

333
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,880
Since we have the murderer,

334
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,320
I will take him

335
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,999
back to the Ministry of Justice
for interrogation.

336
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,999
My pitiful child.

337
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,840
Mother.

338
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:31,080
There's no need to pretend here.

339
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
First Brother is an adopted child.

340
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
He was recommended by Father
to become governor of Liang.

341
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,719
You wanted me to become the house master

342
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,759
but Father gave it away

343
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,479
to Liang Shang.

344
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,519
You...

345
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,880
You didn't even argue with his decision.

346
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,080
Liang Shang.

347
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,360
He was mediocre.

348
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,199
He was useless!

349
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,199
But you and First Brother

350
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,080
and even everyone in the family

351
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,999
saw him as a treasured child.

352
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,920
Why?

353
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,400
Why?

354
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,519
What a joke.

355
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,199
You were the one
who didn't attempt to improve.

356
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,080
Your mother caused what happened

357
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,840
because she spoiled you.

358
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,719
A good mother spoils her child.

359
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,439
My son.

360
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:36,999
Why are you so obsessed?

361
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,719
My son.

362
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:43,039
I end up this way

363
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,239
because of you!

364
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,400
You always blow up every matter

365
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,360
which makes it so hard for me to end it.

366
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,920
Liang Xia.

367
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:59,759
I advise you to be honest

368
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,880
about the person who forced you
to pin the blame on Crown Prince.

369
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,439
Otherwise,

370
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,160
it will involve your whole family.

371
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,239
Take him away.

372
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:10,999
You...

373
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,679
My son!

374
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,640
Son!

375
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,239
My son!

376
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,800
Son!

377
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,239
My son.

378
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,439
I'll go to the palace
with you to see His Majesty

379
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
and confess what I have done.

380
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:49,920
How dare you!

381
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,160
Zisheng wanted
to capture Liang Xia alive

382
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,279
but you shot him dead.

383
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:56,840
Tell me.

384
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,600
Are you the culprit who asked Liang Xia

385
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,920
to pin the blame on Crown Prince?

386
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,279
Are you afraid

387
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,880
that Liang Xia will expose you

388
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,679
after Zisheng captures him alive?

389
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,279
Your Majesty.

390
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm not.

391
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,519
What is it then?

392
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,679
The Liang Family of Hedong

393
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,560
used to be a huge family

394
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,279
but Emperor Li was violent

395
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,560
and killed most people in our family.

396
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,519
When I was house master,

397
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
there was

398
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,880
already no one left in the family.

399
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,679
The Liang Family of Hedong

400
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,439
was glorious for almost a century.

401
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,880
It was famous back then.

402
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,320
How much it has fallen now.

403
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,999
It pains me

404
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,759
as well.

405
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,439
I still remember

406
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,880
when I started helping Your Majesty

407
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,360
and had some minor achievements,

408
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,800
Your Majesty asked me jokingly

409
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,360
why I didn't request for
my family members to be granted a title.

410
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,039
I couldn't say it

411
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,719
because there were

412
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,120
no other capable young men in my family.

413
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,080
My two brothers

414
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,800
were my father's own children

415
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,360
but they were both good-for-nothings.

416
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,759
As an adopted son,

417
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,199
getting recommended by Father
to become a governor

418
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,800
was already too much.

419
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,239
Right now,

420
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
I'm not sure
how I can repay Your Majesty.

421
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,800
Why are you crying?

422
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,320
Speak nicely.

423
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,080
Your Majesty.

424
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,880
Do you think I don't know
the fact that Liang Shang and Liang Xia

425
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
were both mediocre?

426
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,239
In the past,

427
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,239
they were not even fit
to take care of manors and farms.

428
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:32,560
But what can I do?

429
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,759
I am almost 40 years old.

430
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,360
I can only hope

431
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,679
that the next generation

432
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,360
will produce a few capable men.

433
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,320
I also

434
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,759
understand the Liang Family's suffering.

435
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,880
But,

436
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,039
how does it relate to the case?

437
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:55,360
Crown Prince was involved for no reason

438
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
and got a bad reputation.

439
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,519
Don't you think
Zisheng should capture Liang Xia alive

440
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,600
and ask him what happened?

441
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,560
Now, it's all over

442
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,920
because you shot him dead

443
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,160
with an arrow.

444
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,360
Your Majesty.

445
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,679
If we keep investigating this,

446
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:15,080
I think it's bad for the bigger picture.

447
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I understand.

448
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,279
You may leave.

449
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,999
Zisheng.

450
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,759
Do you

451
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,600
have something

452
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,039
you want to say to me?

453
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:57,279
Your Majesty.

454
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,840
I think

455
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,320
Liang Wuji is not the true culprit.

456
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,600
From what I observed,

457
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,519
Liang Xia was not someone
who could come up with that plan.

458
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,160
Then,

459
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,199
who is the one

460
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,320
pulling the strings?

461
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,560
Who has the knowledge

462
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,840
of Crown Prince

463
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,160
meeting Qu Lingjun
at Zigui Courtyard?

464
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,600
Who is the one

465
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,160
who is willing to do so much

466
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,759
to frame His Highness

467
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,600
and spoil his reputation?

468
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:28,199
It might be

469
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,120
Crown Princess' cousin,

470
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,560
Sun Sheng.

471
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,800
After all,

472
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,400
he is responsible
for guarding Zigui Courtyard.

473
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,519
I already captured Sun Sheng.

474
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,080
If we let him go,

475
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,320
I'm sure

476
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,880
he will be dead in two days.

477
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,640
Tell me then.

478
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,920
Who is the true culprit behind all this?

479
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,039
I'm sure

480
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,560
Your Majesty already know

481
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,840
who the true culprit is.

482
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,360
What he has done

483
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,759
is way more than this thing alone.

484
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,039
Does it hurt?

485
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,600
Yes.

486
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,600
If I didn't feel bad for our parents

487
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,759
who passed away,

488
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,039
I wouldn't have slapped you.

489
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,479
My hand hurts as well.

490
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,679
Heng, don't worry.

491
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,080
I'll take full responsibility.

492
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,199
I won't get you involved

493
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,719
if I have been exposed.

494
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,959
Are you even fit

495
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:48,039
to say you won't get me involved?

496
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,439
You can't even get me involved
with that intelligence of yours.

497
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,080
If you have

498
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,199
half of our late brother's intelligence,

499
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,840
you wouldn't have done something foolish

500
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,800
like framing Crown Prince!

501
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,920
I'm just not satisfied.

502
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
The Yue Family has been sacrificing

503
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,120
our money and lives for His Majesty.

504
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,439
We put our family's lives

505
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:19,120
in his hands.

506
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,519
In the end,

507
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,679
this is how we end up.

508
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,600
There were seven of us in the past

509
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,640
but we are the only two people left.

510
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,320
Who did we do all this for?

511
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,560
The Yue Family of Rao County

512
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,479
was rich and our lives were peaceful.

513
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,199
Why do we have to revolt

514
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,600
with the Wen Family?

515
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,679
Why do you make it sound like
you didn't gain anything out of it?

516
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,439
I am

517
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,880
the consort.

518
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,120
Marquis Yue, as a relative of mine,

519
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,039
you live a lavish life

520
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,759
and have every treasure you want.

521
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,160
Why are you not satisfied?

522
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,840
Think about Huo Chong.

523
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,039
It's exactly because of Huo Chong

524
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,199
that I see His Majesty's true colours.

525
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,640
If His Majesty is really a spirited man,

526
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,239
he should have exiled

527
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,360
Ling Yi and his family

528
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,479
to avenge Huo Junhua.

529
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,959
On the contrary,

530
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,320
he advised Ling Zisheng
to reconcile with his father.

531
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,999
His Majesty always acts the same.

532
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,999
He only wants everyone
to live a harmonious life.

533
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,439
Without His Majesty's benevolence,

534
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,999
I wonder how many times
you'd have been killed

535
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,039
from all your actions.

536
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,239
Heng.

537
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,199
If His Majesty didn't marry Xuan,

538
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,840
you would be the queen.

539
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:55,160
Third Prince would be the Crown Prince.

540
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,360
The Crown Prince might have

541
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,640
cleared his suspicion of murder now

542
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,479
but everyone knows that he went out

543
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,999
to meet another woman.

544
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,719
He already damaged his own reputation.

545
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,920
The more I think about it,
the more I feel aggrieved.

546
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,279
Third Prince was supposed
to be the Crown Prince.

547
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,479
However...

548
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,600
However, he lost the position
because of his mother

549
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,199
and had to stay
under a useless person's shadow.

550
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,360
No way!

551
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
I am the first wife
who was officially married.

552
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,479
I'm not a concubine.

553
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:28,080
Don't pin the blame

554
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,479
of your grievances on me.

555
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
You want to become
the uncle of the emperor

556
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
but I have no interest
in becoming queen.

557
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,999
You said you did it for me

558
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,239
and for Third Prince.

559
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,880
Actually, all the grievances

560
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,600
are yours alone.

561
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,439
Yes.

562
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,880
His Majesty is
indebted to the Yue Family

563
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,400
except for you
who was late to the rescue.

564
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,239
Everyone can cry out for injustice
for Marquis Huo

565
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,439
except for you.

566
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,439
Third Brother.

567
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,800
Let me ask you.

568
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,160
Why were you late in rescuing Gu City?

569
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,199
Did you use the miasma as an excuse

570
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,560
to cause Huo Chong's death?

571
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Nonsense.

572
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,160
Heng, you...

573
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
Don't try to frame me.

574
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,840
Frame you?

575
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,239
Ling Zisheng has been

576
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,320
investigating you for many years.

577
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,360
Are you involved

578
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,679
in Madam Wen Xiu's coinage case?

579
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,120
Are you the one

580
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,759
who murdered the messenger, Han Wu?

581
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,959
He didn't tell His Majesty yet

582
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,999
because he is showing me respect

583
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:48,239
and giving you a chance to confess.

584
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Let me ask you.

585
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,759
You said the miasma was poisonous

586
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,239
but why were the horses alive

587
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:57,080
when all the scouts
were poisoned to death?

588
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,679
Why were there no reports

589
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,600
about the horses
being poisoned to death?

590
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,160
Why?

591
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,800
Yes.

592
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,400
I received Huo Chong's messenger's
request for help.

593
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,039
On our way there,

594
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,759
we were told that
there was miasma in front

595
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,600
so I sent someone to investigate.

596
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,719
The scouts said

597
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,519
the miasma was safe.

598
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,400
It was then

599
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:40,080
that Lord Qian'an's army arrived.

600
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:41,439
You should know

601
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,120
that our relationship with
the Xuan Family wasn't good.

602
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,279
Lord Qian'an was Empress Xuan's uncle.

603
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,640
When I thought about it,

604
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,479
if I could delay Lord Qian'an

605
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,999
in rescuing Huo Chong,

606
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,439
His Majesty

607
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:59,920
would definitely scold Empress Xuan.

608
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,439
So,

609
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,640
I killed the scouts.

610
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,039
But there was discord between
the two families for a long time.

611
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,279
Why would Lord Qian'an

612
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,519
believe Marquis Yue?

613
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,719
Heng,

614
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,279
you set me up.

615
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,880
Is this setting you up?

616
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,999
I'm obviously helping you.

617
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,039
You...

618
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,479
You are so cruel.

619
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,840
She's not as cruel

620
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,039
as you, Marquis Yue.

621
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,640
Tell us honestly.

622
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,239
How did

623
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,999
Lord Qian'an die?

624
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,479
Lord Qian'an

625
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,360
was in a rush to rescue Gu City

626
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,679
and took an army

627
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,039
to investigate the miasma.

628
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,679
However,

629
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,439
he never returned.

630
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,920
After that, I heard
his subordinate, Peng Kun,

631
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,279
saying Lord Qian'an
was poisoned by the miasma

632
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,920
and died in the forest.

633
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,239
But I thought about it and remembered

634
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,880
the report

635
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,880
saying the miasma was safe.

636
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:24,279
Unless...

637
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,679
Unless Peng Kun was the culprit.

638
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,600
It was Peng Kun
who murdered Lord Qian'an

639
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,560
and snatched the Xuan Family's army.

640
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,360
Even so,

641
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,279
it wouldn't
have caused the fall of Gu City.

642
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,959
When you arrived three days later,

643
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,719
why did Gu City

644
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,039
still fall?

645
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,959
Your Majesty.

646
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,239
I don't know about this as well.

647
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,679
Because Lord Yong

648
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,759
switched the armament.

649
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,519
Gu City was supposed
to hold on for ten days

650
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,999
but it couldn't even hold
for more than two days.

651
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:13,640
Lord Yong?

652
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,039
It was you!

653
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,360
Because of selfishness.

654
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,199
Because of greed.

655
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,560
You killed all the soldiers at Gu City.

656
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,479
You killed my uncle!

657
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,360
No wonder...

658
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:34,400
Zisheng, no wonder...

659
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:39,479
Switched the armament?

660
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,039
Your Majesty!

661
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,039
Your Majesty! This is injustice!

662
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,199
Although I was planning

663
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,600
to delay the rescue,

664
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,039
I knew

665
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,400
the rescue army would still arrive

666
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,519
if Gu City could hold on
for a few more days.

667
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,199
Although I had selfish intentions,

668
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,759
I never wanted Lord Qian'an dead.

669
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:59,199
It was even impossible

670
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,080
for me to switch the armament.

671
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,239
Your Majesty.

672
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:04,920
The fall of Gu City

673
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,320
was not related to me.

674
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:10,720
If you didn't lie intentionally,

675
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,760
Lord Qian'an would not die!

676
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,119
Gu City would not fall

677
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,680
if you didn't delay your rescue!

678
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,680
Until now,

679
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,880
do you still think you are wronged?

680
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,479
With the law

681
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,400
and Your Majesty here,

682
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,680
I confess to everything

683
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,119
I did.

684
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,840
Your Majesty,

685
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,920
which crime

686
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,159
did I commit?

687
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,519
Marquis Yue.

688
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,800
Even if we can't try you

689
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,039
for your malicious acts in the past,

690
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,200
you worked

691
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,639
with Liang Xia to frame Crown Prince

692
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,320
and caused Liang Shang's death.

693
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,360
How do you explain that?

694
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,320
Your Majesty.

695
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,200
I was only dissatisfied

696
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,400
with marrying
the shameless Fifth Princess

697
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,479
so I instigated Liang Xia

698
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,959
and brought about Crown Prince's meeting
with Qu Lingjun.

699
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,880
I only wanted

700
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,200
to damage Xuan's reputation.

701
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,920
I didn't expect Liang Xia

702
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,079
to use the opportunity

703
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,599
to kill his brother, Liang Shang!

704
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:17,999
Your Majesty.

705
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,720
I did not kill Liang Shang!

706
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,599
You did not kill Liang Shang

707
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,920
but he died because of you.

708
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,159
There are many people

709
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,920
who murdered someone indirectly.

710
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,479
Are they all guilty of their crimes?

711
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,479
Shut up!

712
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,439
I won't kill you

713
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,800
since the whole Yue Family

714
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,720
perished in battle

715
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,639
except for you two.

716
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,999
But from today onwards,

717
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,119
you will be stripped of your status

718
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,280
and sent to
the imperial mausoleum to guard it.

719
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,639
Your Majesty.

720
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,639
Your Majesty's indecisive punishment

721
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
made me look down on you.

722
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,320
Thank you

723
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
for sparing my life, Your Majesty!

724
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,639
Zisheng.

725
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,559
I will investigate

726
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,559
Peng Kun's case thoroughly.

727
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,639
It's already late.

728
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,039
You should return to Changqiu Palace

729
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,800
and rest well.

730
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,559
Didn't I ask you to go home?

731
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,840
Why are you still in Changqiu Palace?

732
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,519
I won't go back.

733
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,360
Her Majesty

734
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,479
is the only one
who won't scold me in this world.

735
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,159
If my parents and brother

736
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,559
find out what happened today,

737
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,200
they'll definitely nag me
for half a month.

738
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,599
So, you are actually scared of that.

739
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,800
Didn't I tell you

740
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,720
not to be reckless?

741
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,119
Why do you have to put yourself at risk?

742
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,920
How could I do nothing?

743
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,240
If I didn't do anything,

744
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,280
who would help prove Her Majesty
and Crown Prince's innocence?

745
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,479
Both of them are benevolent

746
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,840
but they were framed
because of the Liang Family.

747
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,439
I can't accept that.

748
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,200
There's Qu Lingjun as well.

749
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,840
If she was not proven innocent,

750
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,400
how would her children face the world?

751
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,760
I didn't do it for myself.

752
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,400
Don't blame me.

753
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:32,360
Fine.

754
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,079
I'm not blaming you.

755
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,880
I didn't stop you from doing it.

756
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,920
I'm just worried about you.

757
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
I can't forgive myself if you get hurt.

758
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:58,800
The Gu City case
has already been solved.

759
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,479
Apart from Peng Kun,

760
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,840
everyone else
has already been captured.

761
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,400
Why are you still unhappy?

762
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:08,959
Shaoshang.

763
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,720
If someone hurts your family

764
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,519
and you know that person is guilty

765
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,920
but you can't punish the person by law,

766
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,760
what will you do?

767
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,760
You still have a grudge?

768
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,280
I'm just saying.

769
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:36,920
What if?

770
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,039
You know

771
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,800
how petty I am.

772
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,559
If someone hurts a person close to me,

773
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,840
I won't forgive them.

774
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,400
I'll return the pain

775
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,200
1,000-fold back to them.

776
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,880
What if

777
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,400
taking revenge

778
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,519
means hurting someone you love?

779
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,119
As humans, making choices is inevitable.

780
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:15,079
When you put the choices together
side by side,

781
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,479
one will definitely be more important
than the other.

782
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,500
(Late Husband Yuan Yu's Memorial Tablet)

783
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,360
Shanjian.

784
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,999
You are already 21 years old.

785
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,920
It's time to find a fiancee.

786
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,200
Mother, you've never
mentioned my marriage.

787
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,840
Why did you mention it today?

788
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,360
Today,

789
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,360
I can see that you
have feelings for Lady Cheng.

790
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,519
Do you like her?

791
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,079
She...

792
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,079
She has never been in my plans.

793
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,079
Don't you

794
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,999
want to get married?

795
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,519
Since I was young,

796
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:56,280
I already had a list of fiancees.

797
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,920
Their background, family, reputation,

798
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,320
father and brother's
position in the imperial court,

799
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:02,519
the factions that will be involved
after getting married,

800
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,840
the lady's personality, talents

801
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,479
and also appearance.
I thought about everything.

802
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,320
But after seeing you and Father

803
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,159
eating and sleeping separately

804
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:13,439
and even missing a different person,

805
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,479
I no longer want to get married.

806
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,519
If this is how
every marriage in the world goes,

807
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,880
why do we still need to
get married and have children

808
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,880
to hurt the next generation?

809
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,800
We let you down as your parents.

810
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,559
Your father had someone he loves.

811
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,439
I used to be your uncle's wife as well.

812
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,320
(Late Husband Yuan Yu's Memorial Tablet)
But a marriage between noble families

813
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,119
(Late Husband Yuan Yu's Memorial Tablet)

814
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,800
is usually complicated

815
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,920
and we had no choice.

816
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,720
So,

817
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,880
we didn't get along well
after our marriage.

818
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,479
We didn't think

819
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,880
it would hurt you.

820
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,800
It's fine if I don't get married.

821
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,999
If I get married,

822
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,479
there might be another
troubled couple in the world.

823
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,559
Today,

824
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:18,280
I saw you investigating the case
with Lady Cheng.

825
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:22,720
You were nervous
when she was in danger.

826
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,320
Wasn't it because you like her?

827
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,959
Ever since Lady Cheng was engaged,

828
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,159
I've been dragging

829
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,760
my marriage with
many ladies in the capital

830
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:34,800
because I wasn't satisfied.

831
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,280
I didn't know why at first.

832
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,439
Now that I think about it,

833
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,559
it's because all of them
are different from her.

834
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,559
So, what?

835
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,760
Acting slow

836
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,800
causes one to lose the game.

837
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,360
Even if Cheng Shaoshang
is married today,

838
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,599
my life

839
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:00,639
still has to go on.

840
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,479
I wonder why did Consort Yue
look for me

841
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:43,119
so late at night.

842
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,039
Zisheng.

843
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,039
Do you know why I help you try

844
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,720
and punish Marquis Yue?

845
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
For the Yue Family.

846
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:58,999
For His Majesty.

847
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:02,400
For the people.

848
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,959
The Yue Family has His Majesty.

849
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,639
His Majesty has his people.

850
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,920
The people have the world.

851
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,920
What do they have to do with me?

852
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,599
I did it

853
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,360
for the Huo Family.

854
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,680
For Huo Chong.

855
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:25,720
And also for you,

856
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:27,519
Ling Buyi.

857
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I know.

858
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,280
You are not satisfied with

859
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,479
the His Majesty's punishment
to my Third Brother.

860
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,159
If you think

861
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:38,920
his life alone

862
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:41,559
is enough to exchange for
every life lost in the Huo Family,

863
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,320
I will allow you to kill him.

864
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,159
If you won't go,

865
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,280
I'll go.

866
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,680
His Majesty

867
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,320
has already ordered
a thorough investigation on Peng Kun.

868
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,840
He will give you an explanation.

869
00:44:57,999 --> 00:44:58,760
His Majesty and I

870
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,240
both want you to let go of the past

871
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:02,999
and get married with no worries.

872
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,519
You should learn how to live normally.

873
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,519
Live a good life

874
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,840
for the whole Huo Family.

875
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,360
His Majesty's punishment was correct.

876
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:22,720
There's no blood of the Huo Family

877
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,280
on Marquis Yue's hand.

878
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,320
Besides, the whole Yue Family
perished in battle.

879
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,240
Marquis Yue is
the only remaining male in the family.

880
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,439
Due to their contributions, His Majesty
didn't give a severe punishment.

881
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,400
I understand
His Majesty's consideration.

882
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:46,280
Zisheng.

883
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,479
The Yue Family

884
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,880
owes you for the delay in rescue.

885
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,720
I will always

886
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,400
remember this

887
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,479
and am willing to make amends anytime.

888
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,599
There's no need.

889
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:07,159
Thank you for your fair judgment,
Consort Yue.

890
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,720
From now onwards,

891
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,439
I no longer need
the Yue Family to make amends.

892
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,680
But some people's crimes

893
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,320
can never be amended

894
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,439
even if it takes a lifetime.
