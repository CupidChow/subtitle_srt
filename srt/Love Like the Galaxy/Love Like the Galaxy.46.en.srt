=Episode 46=

3
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,020
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

4
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,580
(Five days later)

5
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,599
General.

6
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,000
Take it slow.

7
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
Is the medicine too bitter?

8
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,479
There's no place like home.

9
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,319
When I was in Tongniu County
for a long time,

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,359
I missed home,

11
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,880
you,

12
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,880
the children

13
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,759
and my mother as well.

14
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,639
I was so worried.

15
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
We missed you too.

16
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,519
When we were in prison,

17
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,359
we kept mentioning you.

18
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,840
Old Madam said
you're a filial son.

19
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,759
Song and Shaogong

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,440
said you are a kind father.

21
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,000
Niaoniao too.

22
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,880
She went everywhere for you

23
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,680
because she cares for you.

24
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,560
What about you?

25
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,440
We have been married for 30 years.

26
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,359
We help each other

27
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,280
and love each other.

28
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Do I have to say anything else?

29
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,440
I didn't know

30
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,639
our family will get involved
in the Tongniu case.

31
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,280
That day,

32
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,720
Yan Zhong discussed with me

33
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,359
regarding the storage of refined copper.

34
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,079
I was worried
that Tongniu County might fall

35
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,799
and the military funds would be stolen

36
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:47,519
so I suggested

37
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,840
to hide the refined copper

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,919
outside the city.

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
However, we were ambushed.

40
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,639
Ma Rong took the cart

41
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,120
and even killed
Yan Zhong and his family.

42
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,199
I used all my might to defend

43
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,639
and got injured.

44
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,919
I escaped with my life on the line

45
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,319
and passed out in the bushes.

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,160
But I heard Niaoniao say

47
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,039
you were very energetic

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
when she found you.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,719
You didn't look like
you passed out for a long time.

50
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,040
It's all Lou Ben's fault.

51
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,600
I woke up in the hut

52
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,240
and my body was full of injuries.

53
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,800
He said

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,079
I was rescued by
the people working in the mines.

55
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,600
He heard about it and
went to take care of me for two days.

56
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,839
He told me

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,279
Tongniu County had fallen

58
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,560
and the county assistant governor,
Li Feng, had defected.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,519
He told me Li Feng framed me and Yan Zhong

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,240
by saying we defected
while taking the refined copper with us.

61
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,000
He also told me His Majesty
had ordered for us to be captured.

62
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,880
Did you believe him just like that?

63
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,880
He is Lou Yao's brother

64
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,759
and had a marriage discussion with us.

65
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
I never thought

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,279
he would lie to me.

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,759
When I recovered,

68
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,279
I wanted to find a chance to return
to the capital and defend myself

69
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,719
but he lied to me again
and said I can't show myself

70
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,920
because Ma Rong would kill me

71
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,600
when his spy found me.

72
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:20,759
If I died, it would be hard to explain

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,120
and everyone in the Cheng Family

74
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
would be acquitted

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
and be imprisoned.

76
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,000
He also guaranteed

77
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,319
to tell all of you about my survival

78
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,560
so all of you could be relieved

79
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,120
and we could reunite

80
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,120
when I have been proven innocent.

81
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,040
I was afraid of involving all of you

82
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,000
so I hid in that small area.

83
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,120
It was so frustrating for me.

84
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,680
It was tough for you.

85
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,839
You actually managed to escape alive

86
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,480
from his clutches.

87
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
He still had some conscience

88
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,279
and didn't kill me.

89
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,719
Perhaps

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,159
it was because Niaoniao

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,759
used to be engaged with Lou Yao.

92
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,399
He acted kindly

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,399
because his plans failed.

94
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,680
If he was successful,

95
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,719
do you think he could hide you forever?

96
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,159
If he was successful,

97
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,560
the first person he would kill

98
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,759
is you!

99
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,759
Shi!

100
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,279
Shi!

101
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,000
Shi!

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,560
You are finally awake!

103
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:36,560
Mother.

104
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
You scared me.

105
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
You have been

106
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
sleeping here for three days.

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,759
Stop shouting, Mother.

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,399
I have yet to fully recover.

109
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,920
Your screams almost killed me.

110
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,600
You unfilial son!

111
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,120
Do you know

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,159
how I lived for the past few days?

113
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,600
You only care about your wife!

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,519
Why didn't you show any concern

115
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,600
about my suffering?

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,000
Why are you not concerned?

117
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,159
You unfilial son!

118
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,880
That's not right, Mother.

119
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,279
You were in prison for some time

120
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,680
but you look fatter than you do before.

121
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,800
Look.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,719
Yuanyi lost weight

123
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,120
to take care of all of you.

124
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,800
You didn't look like you had suffered.

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Nonsense!

126
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,600
Because of what you did,

127
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,480
I used up all my family property!

128
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,199
My family property! My...

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,040
Why don't you feel bad at all?

130
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,000
The trash you've been collecting?

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,040
Trash?

132
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,079
You...

133
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,719
You prodigal son!

134
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,440
Prodigal son.

135
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,639
All of you always say

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,959
I am a stingy person.

137
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,639
Without these treasures
I had been collecting,

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,519
what would your daughter
have to use for her money

139
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,000
to go to Tongniu County

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
to rescue you?

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,040
Back then,

142
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,759
if I didn't feed you
with the food I saved,

143
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,480
could you have survived

144
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,839
until today?

145
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,199
Without the money

146
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,079
I saved,

147
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,560
can your life be rescued?

148
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,279
Can your life be rescued?

149
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,880
That's enough, Old Madam.

150
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,399
Old Madam.

151
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,600
Old Madam survived
a period of chaos before.

152
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,960
The Cheng Family
will not have its glory today

153
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,919
without Old Madam's
frugal way of living.

154
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,279
How sensible.

155
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,799
Yuanyi is so sensible.

156
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,159
They say a son is reliable.

157
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,639
In my opinion,

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,799
a daughter-in-law

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
is way more reliable than a son.

160
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,639
Old Madam.

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,279
Wait a second.

162
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,919
What happened

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,399
when I wasn't around?

164
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,639
Why aren't you two arguing?

165
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,559
Nothing really happened.

166
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,880
However,

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,840
we understand now.

168
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,679
What do you understand?

169
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,200
-Be united as one.
-Be united as one.

170
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:22,720
Does your hand hurt?

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,960
No.

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,919
Yao.

173
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm really sorry.

174
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,960
Lady Cheng, no need to apologise.

175
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
You did nothing wrong.

176
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,799
It was all my brother's fault.

177
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,880
Thankfully, I didn't
get banished to my hometown

178
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,600
together with Uncle.

179
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,279
Take care, Your Highness.

180
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,559
I will

181
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,559
be leaving now.

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,240
Grand Tutor Lou, take care.

183
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,720
Why did you choose to go to Hua County?

184
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,600
If I have to say,

185
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,720
when I was in Hua County,

186
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,960
it was the happiest moment in my life.

187
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Now that I think about it,
it felt like a dream.

188
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,559
You were

189
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,600
sincere and brave back then.

190
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,399
I was

191
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,080
pure and fearless back then.

192
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,720
What a pity.

193
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,919
If I get to choose again,

194
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:25,759
I'd rather not meet you

195
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,840
and go to Hua County

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,559
in my life.

197
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Please

198
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,600
take care.

199
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,639
Cheng Shaoshang.

200
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,600
If we didn't encounter
this life-and-death incident,

201
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,679
we might still be friends.

202
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,480
I don't want to be your friend.

203
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,000
Me neither.

204
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Why did you come to send us off?

205
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,840
Both of you

206
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,200
came to Lou's residence
to capture Lou Ben

207
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
and forced him to commit suicide
in public

208
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,480
yet you came here now
to send us off together.

209
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,159
Aren't you hurting Yao

210
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,840
by doing that?

211
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,600
Thankfully, Yao knows what's right

212
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:45,840
and won't blame you two.

213
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,639
He just doesn't know

214
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,200
how he should face you.

215
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,600
I believe he is weighing
the right and wrong inside his heart

216
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,519
and knows what his brother did

217
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,600
was a humiliation.

218
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:04,639
As time goes by,

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
I'm sure he will think it through.

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
That's how Yao is.

221
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,759
Upright

222
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,159
and straightforward.

223
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,360
Cheng Shaoshang.

224
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,000
When we meet again in the future,

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,799
I'll definitely prepare a feast for you.

226
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,039
But in our current situation,

227
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,200
we don't welcome you.

228
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't be sad.

229
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,639
Without your recommendation,

230
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,799
they won't be able to go to Hua County.

231
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,840
Hua County is a safe place now.

232
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,600
I believe

233
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,320
they can realise their ambitions there.

234
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,279
Why aren't First Madam Lou

235
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,600
and Yanji here?

236
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,360
After hearing Lou Ben's last words,

237
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,559
the master of Lou Family

238
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,200
criticised Grand Tutor Lou

239
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,120
for hindering his nephews' future

240
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,919
which caused this incident.

241
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,039
Grand Tutor Lou pushed all his crimes

242
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,200
onto his wife.

243
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,840
The crime was having
no filial piety, no virtue

244
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,960
and alienating his nephews.

245
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,679
A few days ago,

246
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,240
First Madam Lou was exiled
back to her hometown.

247
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,639
A couple

248
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,360
really abandons each other

249
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,399
even though they are married.

250
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,799
Not every married couple is the same.

251
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,639
Young Madam Lou

252
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,039
doesn't treat Lou Ben

253
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,360
that way.

254
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:04,559
Dear.

255
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,159
You left before us.

256
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,039
Your child and I will soon

257
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
meet you in the underworld.

258
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,120
(You went everywhere)

259
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,159
(and promised to find me a fabled abode.)

260
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,479
(You wouldn't break your promise.)

261
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,760
(Just lead the way)

262
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,719
(and guide me.)

263
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,479
(The current at night was rapid.)

264
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,280
(Every guard of the Lou Family
went into the river)

265
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,919
(but they couldn't find her.)

266
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,080
(Right now,)

267
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
(Wang Yanji and her child)

268
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,760
(are dead with their body missing.)

269
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,840
Yanji helped me many times.

270
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
Apart from Yao,

271
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:22,959
she was the one
who treated me best in the Lou Family.

272
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,760
Right now,

273
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,959
she died together with his husband
because of me.

274
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,999
The day when Lou Ben died,

275
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,280
I was anxious to find my father

276
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,280
and didn't comfort her.

277
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,360
Young Madam Lou is a reasonable person.

278
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,600
Meanwhile,

279
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,159
Yao is a kind man.

280
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,199
He didn't really hate us

281
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,280
even though
there is a tragedy in their family.

282
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,520
I'm sure

283
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,600
he is suppressing himself today.

284
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,719
I remember Yao told me

285
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:23,280
his favourite place

286
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,280
is his brother's study.

287
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,320
His brother traversed the world

288
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
with benevolence

289
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,560
and saw various things.

290
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,159
He got acquainted
with many interesting people.

291
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,280
No one would imagine

292
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,080
both of them

293
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,080
to end up like this.

294
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,880
Lou Ben made a mistake.

295
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,159
When one mistake is made,
what comes next will also be a mistake.

296
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
Sometimes,

297
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
one wrong step in the world

298
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
will take you to the point of no return.

299
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,439
Zisheng.

300
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,800
I don't ask for a lavish life.

301
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,199
I just want to be safe and happy.

302
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,959
We must not do anything wrong.

303
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,159
Then, we won't have
anything to regret in our lives.

304
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:36,880
What's wrong?

305
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,760
Mother is seriously ill again.

306
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,159
Are you willing

307
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,360
to visit her with me?

308
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:57,080
Did I do a good job?

309
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,679
It's amazing.

310
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,679
I'm sure Li will like it.

311
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,800
Li, you're here. Come quickly!

312
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,439
I made your favourite almond cake.

313
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,999
It's your favourite.

314
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,399
Come.

315
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,800
Quick, try it.

316
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,919
See if it's sweet. Come.

317
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,959
Try it.

318
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,280
What's wrong?

319
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,919
Are you blaming me...

320
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,999
No.

321
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,760
You did well.

322
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,719
I'll eat it.

323
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,080
Come. Try it.

324
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,679
Li.

325
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,280
Why are you frowning

326
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,159
while eating the almond cake?

327
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,360
Did I make it badly?

328
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:54,639
Is that it?

329
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:55,560
No.

330
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,239
It's delicious.

331
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,159
It's very sweet.

332
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,159
Really?

333
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,040
It's great to see you like it.

334
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:08,479
The city is short
on many things right now

335
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,399
but the almond tree bears fruit.

336
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,639
You can eat

337
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:14,880
as many almond cakes as you want.

338
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,679
I won't treat you badly.

339
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,479
Sure.

340
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,120
Eat more if you like it.

341
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,560
Hurry up.

342
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:23,800
Hurry.

343
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,760
Silly child. Eat slowly.
There are many left.

344
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,120
Madam Huo still sees Zisheng as a child.

345
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,399
Why do I feel like

346
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:03,159
Madam Huo looks better
when she is seriously ill?

347
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,560
Junhua is old

348
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,360
and can't stand the illness anymore.

349
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:09,840
She might look energetic

350
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:12,840
but she is near her life's end.

351
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,800
She was born prematurely

352
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,919
and has a weak body.

353
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,760
That is why she was being pampered.

354
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,360
She risked her life

355
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,360
and gave birth to Zisheng for Ling Yi

356
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,439
but this is how she ended up.

357
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,199
Not just Junhua.

358
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,080
Zisheng was also born prematurely.

359
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,880
I remember the time

360
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,320
when he was born,

361
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,080
he looked like a kitten.

362
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,399
Everyone thought he wouldn't survive

363
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
so they named him Li.

364
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,159
However, the first madam
of the Huo Family

365
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,639
gave birth to a few children.

366
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,199
All of them were healthy

367
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,520
and strong.

368
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,800
For safety,

369
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:01,040
she gave his own child's name

370
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,880
to Zisheng.

371
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,760
What is General Huo Chong's son's name?

372
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:10,080
Buyi was given to Li

373
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,199
and Wushang, the name of Junhua's son,

374
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,120
was given to the nephew
of the Huo Family.

375
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,040
Huo Wushang.

376
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,399
They say a nephew looks like his uncle.

377
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:27,600
Buyi and Wushang

378
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,679
looked similar when they were young.

379
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,840
So, Junhua

380
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,120
liked to

381
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,800
dress them up in identical outfits

382
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,320
and let Huo Chong guess them.

383
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,280
But Ling Yi

384
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,919
always pretended

385
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,120
to be a kind father
and fooled everyone.

386
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,760
Actually, he only
carried Zisheng a few times.

387
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,479
Sometimes, he would even mistake them.

388
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,399
Do they look so alike?

389
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,560
Even Marquis Chengyang
made a mistake telling them apart?

390
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,840
It was because

391
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,719
he interacted with his son less.

392
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,120
Although both of them looked similar,

393
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
their personalities

394
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,760
were very different.

395
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,040
One of them was active

396
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,239
and liked

397
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,280
climbing on trees and high places.

398
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,999
The other

399
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,959
was quiet and reasonable.

400
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,919
He liked to read and write.

401
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,040
Although their personalities
were different,

402
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,239
they got along well.

403
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,360
Li liked to eat almonds.

404
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,520
Although Zheng

405
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,760
would get rashes
when he touched almonds,

406
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:40,760
he was still willing to climb
on almond trees to pick almonds.

407
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:49,639
Zisheng is the last surviving member
of the Huo Family.

408
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:53,360
He should not risk his life anymore.

409
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,679
If something happens to him,

410
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,399
Junhua will...

411
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,280
Shaoshang.

412
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,919
I'll leave Zisheng to you.

413
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,479
When you get married,

414
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,040
I'll prepare the same dowry for you

415
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,840
as your parents.

416
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:20,239
What do you think?

417
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:21,999
There's no need.

418
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:24,120
Her Majesty said the same thing.

419
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,679
I have many dowries.

420
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,159
No one complains about
having too many dowries.

421
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,040
Besides,

422
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,919
if you have fewer dowries,

423
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,320
what will you do
if you can't see Princess Yuchang

424
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,560
on an equal standing?

425
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,239
What does the amount of my dowry

426
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,919
have to do with Princess Yuchang?

427
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:46,800
She is good at everything

428
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,999
including the four arts and cooking.

429
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,040
She is also famous for being virtuous.

430
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:54,479
What about you?

431
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,919
I heard

432
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,719
you made a chicken wing

433
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,360
when you tried to repair armour.

434
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,120
Zisheng became a joke

435
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,280
among the officials for many days.

436
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,679
You won't be able
to compete with her in anything

437
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,600
if you don't have many dowries.

438
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,520
Uncle Cui.

439
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,239
I think

440
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,880
our relationship ends here.

441
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,399
Farewell.

442
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,800
There's no need

443
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,159
to send me off.

444
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:32,880
It was a mandarin duck.

445
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,399
Not a chicken.

446
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,560
She has a temper.

447
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,719
This kid

448
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:49,919
is interesting.

449
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,479
What's wrong?

450
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,840
It's nothing.

451
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,560
Why are there so many rashes?

452
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,320
I think I was bitten by bugs

453
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,120
during training.

454
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,120
How can there be bugs

455
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,679
in such cold weather?

456
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,520
Show me.

457
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,320
You are heating up.

458
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,439
Let me lean on you.

459
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,239
The physician said

460
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,800
Young Master was heating up
because he couldn't eat almonds.

461
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
He will recover after sleeping.

462
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:52,239
Why did Young Lady leave
without saying a word?

463
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,399
She didn't even wait
for Young Master to wake up.

464
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,760
She must be angry because
Young Master was careless.

465
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,520
I hope Peng Kun

466
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,679
can explain everything
about the Gu City case

467
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,880
so the knot

468
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,479
in Young Master's heart can be untied

469
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,040
and marry Young Lady.

470
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,040
Young Master.

471
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,320
Didn't the physician say you should rest more?

472
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,639
Why did you get up?

473
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,840
I can't wait any longer.

474
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,360
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

475
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,479
We'll go to the Ministry of Justice

476
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,239
and take Peng Kun.

477
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:21,800
-Yes.
-Yes.

478
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,679
Tell me!

479
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,760
Why did you kill Lord Qian'an?

480
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,639
Why did you attack Gu City?

481
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,199
Ling Buyi.

482
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,479
You abducted me from
the Ministry of Justice

483
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,159
to this Northern Army Prison
without authorisation.

484
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,439
You are obviously trying
to use unauthorised punishment.

485
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,320
I can guarantee that every whip

486
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,360
lands in the same position.

487
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,679
I wonder how many whips

488
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,919
can General Peng take.

489
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,280
Tell me!

490
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,959
I risked my life with my soldiers

491
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,760
yet Lord Qian'an was
taking all the credit

492
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,199
and kept getting promoted.

493
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,919
Was I wrong to kill him?

494
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,399
Junior Lord Qian'an was useless

495
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:23,600
and was only waiting to inherit the army

496
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,320
and the position of the lord.

497
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,560
The son succeeds his father.

498
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,760
When could soldiers like us

499
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,800
get promoted?

500
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,600
Only when Lord Qian'an dies in battle

501
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,360
and Junior Lord Qian'an
couldn't handle the army,

502
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,239
then,

503
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:41,880
only can I stop being the vice general.

504
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,840
As for the failure

505
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,439
of saving Gu City in time,

506
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,120
it was purely because

507
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,479
Huo Chong was unlucky.

508
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,600
Impossible!

509
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:01,919
That day at Shouchun,

510
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,719
you said Ling Yi was involved in this.

511
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,760
What did you mean?

512
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,239
Did Gu City fall

513
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:06,959
because Ling Yi

514
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,679
was acting as a spy?

515
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,479
You are already

516
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:14,919
a dog of the Wen Family.

517
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
What?

518
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,840
Are you trying to take credit

519
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,199
by blaming

520
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,520
your own biological father?

521
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,040
I know nothing.

522
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I dare you

523
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
to kill me.

524
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,760
Do you think I dare not kill you?

525
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,639
I killed Lord Yong,

526
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,999
demoted Madam Wen Xiu

527
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,199
and chased Marquis Yue off
to the imperial mausoleum.

528
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
You...

529
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,280
Killing you

530
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,399
is easy for me.

531
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,560
I want you

532
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,719
to suffer.

533
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,479
Right here,

534
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,800
there are
more than 100 types of torture.

535
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,439
General Peng.

536
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,760
Are you willing to
try them out one by one?

537
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:51,760
Why did you space out

538
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,239
looking at General Huo's portrait?

539
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,760
I think General Huo

540
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:57,959
looks similar

541
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,760
to Zisheng.

542
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,120
They say a nephew looks like his uncle.

543
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,600
Buyi and Wushang

544
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,559
looked similar when they were young.

545
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,439
Although their personalities
were different,

546
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,760
they got along well.

547
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:17,200
Li liked to eat almonds.

548
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,439
Although Zheng

549
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,680
would get rashes
when he touched almonds,

550
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,479
he was still willing to climb
on almond trees to pick almonds.

551
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,200
Why are there so many rashes?

552
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,119
I think I was bitten by bugs

553
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,559
during training.

554
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,599
Shaoshang.

555
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,800
Your Majesty, why are you still awake?

556
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,320
I wasn't feeling well recently.

557
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,760
I didn't sleep well.

558
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,519
I saw light in your room

559
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,760
and came to see you.

560
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,479
Your Majesty, are you troubled
because of Crown Prince?

561
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,919
Grand Tutor Lou
was Crown Prince's tutor.

562
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,479
During this period,

563
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,200
something happened to
Madam Wen Xiu, Wang Chun, Fifth Princess

564
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:39,360
and Grand Tutor Lou one after another.

565
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,320
Even if the Eastern Palace

566
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,919
was safe from this,

567
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,599
I'm afraid Crown Prince

568
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,039
still won't feel comfortable about it.

569
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:55,919
Your Majesty.

570
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,519
I caused harm to Crown Prince

571
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,249
because I sneaked out of the capital

572
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,720
and exposed Lou Ben.

573
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,559
Won't you blame me, Your Majesty?

574
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,599
Why would I blame you?

575
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,320
You are obedient.

576
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,360
I know how you feel.

577
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,760
Actually,

578
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:25,439
I respect you

579
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,680
from the bottom of my heart.

580
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,439
If I was

581
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,519
as courageous as you were in the past,

582
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,439
perhaps

583
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,680
I might also save my parents.

584
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,320
Your Majesty, you have to take care.

585
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,720
Besides Crown Prince,

586
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,599
you still have
many things to worry about.

587
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,200
Yes.

588
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,999
I am only worried about

589
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,119
your marriage with Zisheng.

590
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,720
Your Majesty.

591
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,720
Tell me about Zisheng.

592
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,959
Has his personality always been so cold?

593
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,880
I heard

594
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,919
he looked similar to Marquis Huo's son.

595
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,680
Many people
mistook them when they were young.

596
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,479
They looked alike yet they didn't.

597
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,720
Zisheng was very joyful
when he was young.

598
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,280
Wushang was quiet

599
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,640
and was mature at a young age.

600
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:43,430
However, something like that happened.

601
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,360
Zisheng

602
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,240
became like Wushang
and no longer likes to smile.

603
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,680
Actually,

604
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:56,559
he has many habits similar to Wushang.

605
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,559
His Majesty asked him as well.

606
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,640
He said

607
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,880
he wanted to live for Wushang who died.

608
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,599
He couldn't be reckless.

609
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,559
This child

610
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,119
suffered at an early age.

611
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,280
Fortunately,

612
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,559
he has you for the rest of his life.

613
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,519
I am also lucky

614
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,200
to have Your Majesty by my side.

615
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Actually,

616
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,959
Zisheng helped us a lot.

617
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,519
No matter what happens,

618
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,039
we need to look ahead.

619
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,959
Don't worry about him.

620
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,800
He knows

621
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,079
what he is doing.

622
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,439
Sleep earlier.

623
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:02,959
Perhaps

624
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,519
it will be better tomorrow.

625
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Your Majesty.

626
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,999
Can you accompany me tonight?

627
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:19,439
Why not?

628
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,559
Madam Peng.

629
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,760
It's fine if Her Majesty is not here.

630
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,999
Get Cheng Shaoshang to see me.

631
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,200
Madam Peng, don't make noise here.

632
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,039
This is Changqiu Palace.

633
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,640
I don't care!

634
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,320
I want to see Cheng Shaoshang right now!

635
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,720
Don't stop me!

636
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,479
Madam Peng!

637
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,200
Lady Cheng.

638
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,959
I was wrong in the past.

639
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,880
I came here to apologise to you.

640
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,240
Please ask Zisheng
to release my husband.

641
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:48,320
You didn't beg in this manner

642
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,599
when your mother was almost executed.

643
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,760
Yet you are doing this now

644
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,959
for your husband.

645
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:57,959
Where is your dignity?

646
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:04,280
If the child inside my body
loses his father,

647
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,599
why do I still need dignity for?

648
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:18,200
Get up.

649
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,240
Hurry and get up!

650
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,919
No.

651
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:22,760
I beg you. Help me.

652
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,200
Can you help me?

653
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,519
You can throw away your dignity

654
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:27,880
but Changqiu Palace can't.

655
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:30,999
Is it worth it

656
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,720
to do so much for a disloyal man?

657
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,680
To all of you, he might be disloyal.

658
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,599
But to me,

659
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,079
no one is more loyal than him.

660
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,479
Yes.

661
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,640
He committed treason

662
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,640
and even killed my family members.

663
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,320
But do you know
how these family members behaved?

664
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,240
Do you know what kind of life
was I living in my home?

665
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,880
My father was a coward

666
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,479
and my brother was a good-for-nothing.

667
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,999
My mother only cared about
my uncle's family.

668
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,399
She could order me to sacrifice my life
for them at any time.

669
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,320
No one cared about what I liked.

670
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,079
No one even cared about what I wanted.

671
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Except for him.

672
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,160
So, what?

673
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,640
Wang Ling, wake up.

674
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,399
He is a traitor of Gu City after all.

675
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,919
When he was in Gu City,

676
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,919
the miasma harmed his body

677
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,399
and he suffered from asthma.

678
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,360
So, his house never had any plants.

679
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:36,800
When he knew I like gardening,

680
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,200
he risked his own life

681
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,320
and ordered for people
to bring many rare plants

682
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,399
and planted them in our house

683
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,320
just to cheer me up.

684
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:46,919
Because of that,

685
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,320
he dared not step foot in my residence

686
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,919
which made me feel relief.

687
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,800
One night,

688
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,160
my room's heater

689
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,079
lit up the mosquito net
and caused a fire.

690
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,680
I thought I would die in Shouchun.

691
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,840
However,

692
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,479
he risked his life

693
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,559
to rescue me.

694
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:12,599
Do you think

695
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,079
my parents could do that?

696
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,840
He is a good husband indeed.

697
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,800
You didn't even want

698
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,320
to marry him back then.

699
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,880
Since then,

700
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:25,439
I swore

701
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:27,720
to give my life to him.

702
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,800
Lady Cheng.

703
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:32,320
I beg you.

704
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,559
Help him.

705
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:35,039
Please help him, all right?

706
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,559
Peng Kun committed treason.

707
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:40,880
It is a crime punishable
by annihilating the whole clan.

708
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,399
Do you think a lady like me

709
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:43,919
can persuade His Majesty to save him?

710
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,800
No!

711
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,360
I don't want you to forgive him.

712
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,959
I don't want you to rescue him.

713
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:54,680
If he has committed treason,

714
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,079
he has to die.

715
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:58,880
However, Ling Buyi took him away
from the Ministry of Justice

716
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,160
and interrogated him overnight
at the Northern Army Prison.

717
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:03,680
Ling Zisheng is cruel.

718
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,919
He will definitely use inhumane methods
to interrogate my husband.

719
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:08,320
Yes.

720
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,079
My husband committed a crime.

721
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,320
But isn't Ling Buyi wrong
by forcing him to confess

722
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,160
with unauthorised punishment?

723
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,119
Peng Kun's crime is unforgivable.

724
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,640
There's no need to force him to confess!

725
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:18,399
Wang Ling.

726
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,800
I can't help you.

727
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,280
Leave.

728
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Cheng Shaoshang.

729
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,240
Seems like you know nothing

730
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,039
about Ling Zisheng.

731
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,559
Ling Zisheng is

732
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,840
the most unpredictable

733
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,479
and terrifying man in this world.

734
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,880
My husband had many spies in the capital

735
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,399
and he told me before.
