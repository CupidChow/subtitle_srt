=Episode 14=

3
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:41,113
An edict to the county magistrate
of Hua County, Cheng Shicheng.

4
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:43,794
He was benevolent and righteous.

5
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,354
He treated his people well and amicably.

6
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:47,314
His achievements will be recognized
by future generations.

7
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,834
A praiseworthy virtuous official
under the land of heaven.

8
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:53,593
He's hereby conferred
as Second-ranked Secondary Marquis.

9
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,713
Raise the coffin!

10
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:27,673
Rise!

11
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:34,274
Farewell Official Cheng!

12
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:05,673
I, Zheng Gang bid farewell
to Old Official Cheng!

13
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:11,233
I, Zheng Zhiming bid farewell
to Old Official Cheng!

14
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:17,434
Students of Hua County bid farewell
to Old Official Cheng!

15
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,553
I, Song Qilin bid farewell

16
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,633
to Old Official Cheng.

17
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:23,553
I bid farewell to Old Official Cheng!

18
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:26,834
I, Yu Chengli bid farewell
to Old Official Cheng!

19
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:30,274
I, Ji Jiameng bid farewell
to Old Official Cheng!

20
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:32,394
Oh, Old Official Cheng!

21
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:56,954
My elder brother always tells me

22
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,274
that a young man should strive

23
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,113
to render merits as an official.

24
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:02,673
At first,

25
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:04,193
I didn't understand

26
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,434
why must one accomplish
achievements

27
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,633
or be an official.

28
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:10,994
Is it not good to live a simple life

29
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:13,314
without worrying
about food and clothing?

30
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:19,193
I've finally come to a realization

31
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:21,354
after witnessing Old Official Cheng's
funeral procession.

32
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:29,593
Shaoshang,

33
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:31,914
I want to be an official.

34
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:34,354
I want to be an official
like Old Official Cheng

35
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:36,073
who cared for his people,

36
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,994
who wasn't a disgrace to his family,
and lived up to his name as an official.

37
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:42,474
Someone who's worthy of heaven and earth

38
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:45,073
and worthy of the people.

39
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:47,354
Be it troubled times or peaceful times,

40
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,073
I want to protect the stability of a city.

41
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:51,954
I shall never allow another young girl

42
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,633
to lose her family again.

43
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,354
Those who are capable will do their part

44
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,113
in turbulent times.

45
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:00,434
Your parents too

46
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,633
had to set out

47
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,474
to save the Gu City
without hesitation back then.

48
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,113
Forgoing is

49
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:15,914
to make things happen.

50
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:19,354
Only when one forgoes themselves

51
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,193
and their families

52
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,553
that they can ensure the well-being
of the people.

53
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:02,874
Master,

54
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,474
we're finally here.

55
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,593
But where are you going?

56
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:09,394
I feel at ease

57
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:11,994
after seeing her safe.

58
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:14,513
I changed my mind.

59
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,233
I'm not going to meet her.

60
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:32,474
Shaoshang.

61
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:34,874
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,233
I think

63
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,794
I'm going to be with Grandfather,

64
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:43,233
Father, and Brother.

65
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:45,474
Dear one, be good.

66
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:47,193
Don't go.

67
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,994
Don't go to them.

68
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:50,954
You must keep on living.

69
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,633
Shaoshang, don't cry.

70
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,954
Grandfather used to say

71
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:00,153
that my future

72
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:03,193
is filled with good luck

73
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,593
and I'll find
an affectionate man in life.

74
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,274
Shaoshang,

75
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:13,994
you kept saying

76
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:16,393
you have bad luck.

77
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:18,674
Now,

78
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,353
I'll

79
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:23,954
give

80
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:25,754
all

81
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,834
of my good luck

82
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,193
to you.

83
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,273
You'll be happy.

84
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:53,313
I'll hear you play

85
00:08:54,514 --> 00:09:01,954
your flute from heaven.

86
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:16,674
Dear one,

87
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:20,634
I brought you a maltose candy.

88
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:23,514
It's sweet.

89
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:29,193
You can sleep without worry now.

90
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:33,514
You won't feel pain anymore.

91
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,180
(In Memory of Cheng Xiaomei)

92
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,193
How about I play the flute

93
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:42,954
for you?

94
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:56,473
Shaoshang,

95
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,514
I know you're sad.

96
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,353
But you mustn't stay in the rain.

97
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:02,794
You'll get sick.

98
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:11,393
Just let me be sick.

99
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:14,153
It's useless

100
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,514
for people like me to live.

101
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:19,594
No, you're not.

102
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:21,153
You're good.

103
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:23,473
You're the most perfect lady in the world.

104
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:24,514
No, I'm not perfect.

105
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:27,554
Can my perfection save Miao

106
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:30,754
who was dismembered?

107
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,353
Or can it intercept

108
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,273
the blades from striking
Old Official Cheng?

109
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:37,674
Or can my perfection bring

110
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,754
Cheng Xiaomei to life?

111
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,353
I can't do anything at all.

112
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,393
I despise those

113
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,353
whose hands are tainted with blood.

114
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,594
But what can I even do about it?

115
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,153
I can't help anyone.

116
00:12:58,353 --> 00:12:59,634
Don't disdain and degrade yourself.

117
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:02,954
Xiaomei said

118
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:04,634
she had no regrets

119
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:07,273
because you had shown her

120
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:08,834
her home again before she died.

121
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,473
She was grateful to you.

122
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:12,473
Also, those patients at the infirmary.

123
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,193
They had no will to live.

124
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:16,033
It was you who motivated them

125
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:17,313
that they have the will to live again.

126
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:18,834
They're grateful to you too.

127
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:21,954
And me.

128
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:24,834
I thought I was

129
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:27,834
a useless person all this time.

130
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,514
But we've spent time together

131
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:32,594
these few days

132
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,073
going through ancient books,
rebuilding houses,

133
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:37,073
and visiting door-to-door
to provide help.

134
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,193
That's how Hua County is restored
to its present appearance.

135
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:41,193
If you go outside

136
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:43,033
and hear what the people said,

137
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,193
you wouldn't think you're useless.

138
00:13:46,353 --> 00:13:47,193
Really?

139
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:51,353
I swear

140
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:54,033
if I'm appointed as an official
in the future,

141
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,794
I want to build

142
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:58,794
a land of peace with you.

143
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:01,834
I promise that children

144
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,594
like Cheng Xiaomei can live there

145
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:08,273
and never have to suffer
from separation again.

146
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:13,313
Shaoshang,

147
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:16,674
I have a strong admiration for you.

148
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,193
You dare say and do

149
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,313
what others dare not.

150
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,193
I was taught to follow rules
when I was young.

151
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:29,153
Following you here is also

152
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,393
a decision I made myself

153
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:33,233
for the first time

154
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,433
after ignoring my elder's order.

155
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:37,113
Because I wanted

156
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:38,393
to be fearless like you.

157
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:39,714
After this,

158
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,514
I'll strive to be stronger
and more independent.

159
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,273
I no longer want
to be indifferent and weak.

160
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,033
You and I share the same fate.

161
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:56,794
Our existence

162
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,433
was predestined

163
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:01,153
to be manipulated.

164
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:04,273
But from today on,

165
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,393
we share the same aspiration.

166
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:08,834
I'll believe you

167
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:11,153
just like how you'll forever trust me

168
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:12,834
without question.

169
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:15,273
After this,

170
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:17,994
I'm willing to walk with you.

171
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:19,714
I shall never question your past

172
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:21,393
and your morality.

173
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,634
I only ask to walk side by side with you.

174
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:26,353
All right.

175
00:15:58,834 --> 00:15:59,714
Young Master,

176
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:01,994
did you meet Fourth Lady Cheng?

177
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,033
I'm here to pay my respect
to Old Official Cheng,

178
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,794
not Fourth Lady Cheng.

179
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,113
I'm afraid she doesn't wish to see people

180
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,914
who commit acts of bloodshed like us.

181
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:19,073
But the bloodshed we committed was

182
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:20,994
to protect.

183
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:23,393
But still,

184
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,834
these hands are tainted with blood.

185
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:33,834
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

186
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:39,834
Have you really decided

187
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:41,473
to ask for Niaoniao's hand in marriage?

188
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:43,914
I've made up my mind.

189
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:45,514
And

190
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:46,794
I know

191
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:48,914
Shaoshang and I share
the same aspiration.

192
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:51,634
If I can serve as an official
in the future,

193
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:54,634
I want to be a respectable official
like Old Official Cheng.

194
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,874
Shaoshang told me

195
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,473
she's willing to walk that path with me.

196
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:01,073
After that, we'll work together
for the people.

197
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:02,393
Mr. Lou,

198
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:06,193
your private promise isn't considered
a marriage proposal.

199
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:08,754
Marriage should be decided
by the family elders.

200
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,073
How can you act in private
without the elders' consent?

201
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:14,714
My wife meant

202
00:17:15,313 --> 00:17:16,754
you need to inform the elders

203
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,393
and let them arrange the betrothal.

204
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:23,473
I understand.

205
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:24,914
A few days ago,

206
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:26,313
I sent a letter to Eldest Brother

207
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,554
asking him to bring up the betrothal
to General Cheng on my Mother's behalf.

208
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:30,073
I supposed

209
00:17:30,554 --> 00:17:31,554
this letter had reached the capital.

210
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:36,233
You don't usually handle things this quick.

211
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,393
Mr. Lou, your action

212
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,433
has taken us by surprise.

213
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,113
It may not be a bad thing.

214
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,153
Sister-in-law has written asking
about Niaoniao.

215
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,073
Then I have to inform her
of this matter quickly.

216
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,073
Thank you, Official Cheng and Mrs. Cheng.

217
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:52,914
I'll be off to see Shaoshang then.

218
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,954
It's nice to have Yao beside Niaoniao.

219
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,233
Not bad at all.

220
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,060
(Hua County Magistrate's Court)

221
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:16,634
Father!

222
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:18,514
Niaoniao.

223
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,554
Father.

224
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:22,834
Eldest Brother.

225
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,273
Zhi.

226
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,433
When I heard Hua County was attacked,

227
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:29,433
I was scared out of my wits.

228
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:31,193
Luckily, Niaoniao is blessed with a fortune

229
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:35,073
that she could escape
from Fan Chang's rebel army.

230
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:37,113
It's been so long since I saw you. Come.

231
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:38,634
Let me take a look at you.

232
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,714
This place is short
of food and clothing.

233
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,514
You must have suffered.

234
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:45,994
But you look like you've gained weight.

235
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:50,153
I meant you lost weight.

236
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:50,994
You lost weight.

237
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:51,794
Shaoshang!

238
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,353
I've bought lamb patties
and rice dumplings.

239
00:18:56,754 --> 00:18:58,313
I was wondering why she gained weight.

240
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:01,153
I've lost my appetite.

241
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:02,794
Father said I gained weight,

242
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:03,754
and it's your fault.

243
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,353
I want to check myself in the mirror.

244
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:15,714
Eldest Brother,

245
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:18,473
this is Lou Yao I mentioned in my letter.

246
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,273
So you're that lad, Lou Yao?

247
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:22,794
Yes, Sir.

248
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,113
Eldest Brother,

249
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,794
smile for a bit.

250
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,193
I can't.

251
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,433
Mr. Lou,

252
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:37,914
let's speak in private.

253
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:54,193
So is this how you fattened Niaoniao?

254
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:55,033
No,

255
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,233
she's not fat at all.

256
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:59,113
She's the most beautiful lady

257
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:00,473
I've seen in the capital.

258
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:05,994
I've met Grand Tutor Lou.

259
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,353
Have you ever discussed with your family

260
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:09,834
about marrying Niaoniao?

261
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:10,754
Official Cheng,

262
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:14,073
I've informed Mother and Eldest Brother.

263
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,634
But I don't think

264
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:18,634
my Cheng Family is worthy

265
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,514
of the Lou Family of Hedong.

266
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,634
No, I'm the one
who's unworthy of Shaoshang.

267
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:26,153
Shaoshang is

268
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:27,954
the most upright,

269
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:29,554
straightforward,

270
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,634
and broad-minded young lady
I've ever met.

271
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:33,433
It's a lifetime blessing

272
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,233
for me and the Lou clan

273
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,233
if she can be my spouse.

274
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:38,714
You lad.

275
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:41,954
What about me?

276
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,834
You have good judgment!

277
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,313
Very good! Good.

278
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:53,353
Preposterous!

279
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,353
I sent her there
to reflect on her mistakes.

280
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,193
Yet, she agreed
to a betrothal in private.

281
00:20:57,794 --> 00:20:59,273
They had even delivered
the betrothal presents here.

282
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:01,233
Yet, no one discussed this with me.

283
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,033
Madam, please calm down.

284
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:04,714
Didn't General and Third Madam already

285
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:06,433
send you letters?

286
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,594
How is this discussing it with me?

287
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,113
This is obviously telling me
after it's decided upon.

288
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:12,594
They were just notifying me.

289
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:15,033
I'm Niaoniao's mother.

290
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,554
How can they decide on it

291
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:17,794
and notify me?

292
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:19,994
We can't treat children's marriage

293
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,193
in such a hasty manner.

294
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:22,754
General also intends

295
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:24,834
to ask you

296
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,794
and Young Lady's thoughts first
before making a decision.

297
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,433
He didn't treat this matter hastily.

298
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:29,514
That's what he's doing.

299
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:32,433
Lou Yao is the son
of the Second Chamber.

300
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,834
Yet, General consulted with Grand Tutor Lou.

301
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,033
How can the First Chamber
make decisions for the Second Chamber?

302
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:38,714
The Lou clan's

303
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,634
First Chamber has always had more say
than the Second Chamber.

304
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,073
Mr. Lou's father had passed away.

305
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,874
So it's reasonable for Grand Tutor Lou

306
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:45,313
to approve this marriage
on his late father's behalf.

307
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:49,514
Then why did you say
General wasn't rash in this matter?

308
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:52,473
When General and Grand Tutor Lou
discussed this marriage,

309
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:53,794
had it occurred to them

310
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:57,233
if this is a good marriage?

311
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,153
That Lou Family is obviously a deathtrap.

312
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:02,033
The Lou Family had their way

313
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,834
and delivered the betrothal gifts here.

314
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,353
The Eldest Son
of the Lou Family also said

315
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:07,994
the Lou Family's
Second Madam will come in person

316
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,433
to seek a marriage

317
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:10,834
after his youngest brother returns.

318
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,153
We'll have to consent to them
if we accept the gifts.

319
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,433
We made no decision regarding this marriage.

320
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:17,834
How can we accept such lavish gifts?

321
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:20,954
Order them to return the gifts politely.

322
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:22,353
I'm afraid

323
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:24,754
it's too late.

324
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:32,073
Old Madam,

325
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:33,874
what are you doing?

326
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:40,313
Yuanyi,

327
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:42,073
you're here.

328
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:45,033
Do I look pretty?

329
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:49,113
They're too heavy

330
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:51,393
that I can't lift my head.

331
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,554
The Lou Family of Hedong's
mean sure is impressive.

332
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,754
Niaoniao is so fortunate!

333
00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:00,353
What are you doing? Stop it!

334
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:02,714
Old Madam, there's no reward without merit.

335
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:03,794
We must return

336
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:05,554
all these betrothal gifts.

337
00:23:05,674 --> 00:23:07,514
How are these rewards without merits?

338
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:09,193
Don't give them back!

339
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,914
Of course, we deserve to have these.

340
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,954
Niaoniao must marry into this family.

341
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:14,794
Marriage comes

342
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:17,153
from parents' orders
and a matchmaker's words.

343
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,554
If I refuse to accept this marriage,

344
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:20,794
I shall see

345
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,473
who dares marry her off.

346
00:23:22,473 --> 00:23:23,233
You...

347
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:24,353
You're insolent!

348
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:25,954
You're her mother.

349
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,473
But I'm your mother-in-law.

350
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:29,634
If you dare to disobey me
and refuse this marriage,

351
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:30,433
that means

352
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:31,794
you're unfilial.

353
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:34,153
I'll take you to the government office
and charge you!

354
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,033
Madam, you must never do that.

355
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:39,754
If you charge her,

356
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:42,073
Fourth Lady Cheng's marriage
will be ruined.

357
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:42,914
She's right.

358
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,554
That's not all.

359
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,954
If the news of the Cheng Family

360
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:47,994
being unfilial gets out,

361
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:50,393
it'll be hard for Yangyang
to find a marriage prospect too.

362
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,634
Those decent families also won't

363
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,073
let their daughters marry
into the Cheng Family too.

364
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:56,514
Then your beloved grandsons

365
00:23:56,794 --> 00:23:58,554
won't be able to find a wife.

366
00:23:58,714 --> 00:23:59,473
Also,

367
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:02,874
General was given
the title Marquis Quling.

368
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:05,113
You can't go to
any government office to charge me.

369
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:08,393
His Majesty ordered the Crown Prince
to handle state affairs now.

370
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:09,994
If you want to charge me,

371
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:11,714
you must go to the Eastern Palace.

372
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:14,153
If you don't know the way there,

373
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:14,594
I...

374
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:16,514
I can tell you the direction.

375
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:18,073
I...

376
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:21,674
I can't...

377
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:23,353
I can't reason

378
00:24:23,353 --> 00:24:24,393
with an unreasonable person like you.

379
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:25,554
I'm so livid.

380
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:28,033
I... I... I need to rest.

381
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:28,874
But

382
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:30,994
let me tell you.

383
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:32,874
No one is allowed to return

384
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:34,473
these betrothal gifts
without my permission!

385
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:39,954
Why are you still standing there?

386
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,273
Move the in-law's betrothal gifts

387
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:43,554
into my room now.

388
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:44,794
Yes, Old Madam.

389
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:49,554
I'll set out to Hua County
to refuse this betrothal now.

390
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,914
Gifts by the Lou Family shall be sealed
for safekeeping immediately.

391
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:53,514
I shall hold all of you accountable

392
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:56,594
if one is missing.

393
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:58,594
You wouldn't dare.

394
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:01,674
Out of my way!

395
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:07,954
I shall see who dares
to take these away.

396
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:11,674
Qingcong,

397
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,914
send Old Madam to her room.

398
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:14,874
Yes, Madam.

399
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,073
Old Madam, my apologies.

400
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:21,794
I dare you to touch me.

401
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,233
Don't touch me!

402
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:24,914
I said don't touch me!

403
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:26,634
These are all mine!

404
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,660
Stop dragging me! Let go of me!

405
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:31,754
As long as I'm here,

406
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:32,714
They're all mine!

407
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,674
I shall not allow any of you
to behave willfully.

408
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:36,874
I will not approve

409
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:38,834
of this marriage.

410
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,720
(Don't be hasty about Niaoniao
and the Lou Family's youngest son.)

411
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:42,594
What?

412
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:45,033
Mother is coming to Hua County?

413
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:48,313
This concerns your big day.

414
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,994
How could your mother not feel anxious?

415
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:52,914
Niaoniao,

416
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:54,914
I must ask you this.

417
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,914
Are you serious about accepting
Lou Yao's marriage proposal?

418
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:59,153
Third Aunt,

419
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:02,433
does Yao have a bad record
that's unworthy of our family?

420
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:04,033
Well, no.

421
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:07,233
His ex-fiancée, He Zhaojun is unruly and a shrew.

422
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:08,914
If something is wrong with Mr. Lou,

423
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,794
she'd have exposed him
to the entire capital.

424
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:12,554
Does that mean the elders
of the Lou Family dislike me

425
00:26:12,714 --> 00:26:14,674
because of my bad reputation

426
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:15,754
and insignificant family background?

427
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:17,714
Stop overthinking.

428
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:19,994
Seeing how excitedly the Lou Family sent
the betrothal gifts,

429
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:21,914
we can say they have
no prejudice against you.

430
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:27,473
Since that's the case,

431
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,674
why can't I accept Yao's proposal?

432
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:32,233
Don't you want to consider

433
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:35,353
and for better marriage prospects?

434
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,554
I never ask

435
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:42,113
for the best in the world.

436
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,233
I only choose the one suitable
in front of me.

437
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,820
(Unforgivable crime punishable by death
to repay for Your Majesty's kindness.)

438
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:55,634
Your Majesty,

439
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:58,914
Fan Chang confessed
to all of his crimes.

440
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,514
This is Fan Chang's confession

441
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:01,634
written in blood

442
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:03,994
after tearing a piece of his clothes
in the dungeon.

443
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:06,994
(Ji Zun)
He feels remorse for the foolish obsession

444
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:09,514
and resentment he had for you.

445
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:12,433
Now it's too late for him to regret it.

446
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,994
So he asked to be executed
for his punishment.

447
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,554
Back then, in the battle in Kunyang

448
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,594
Fan Chang was badly wounded

449
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:21,714
and almost lost his life.

450
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:24,393
Still, he fought to conquer
the city for me.

451
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,193
It's only been more than ten years.

452
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,794
My comrades who risked their life for me

453
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,273
are now...

454
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:38,794
Forget it.

455
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,874
I'll give him another chance.

456
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:43,113
If he truly is repentant, I'll...

457
00:27:43,113 --> 00:27:44,473
How would a ruthless

458
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,473
and ambitious person truly repent?

459
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,754
He's only using his past tie

460
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:51,193
as Your Majesty's comrade
to beg for his life.

461
00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:55,153
General Ling, why do you say so?

462
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,994
Fan Chang's family members
have always been in their lairs

463
00:27:58,273 --> 00:27:59,273
and never go into hiding.

464
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,273
He left his family unprotected

465
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,153
and was not afraid
they would be executed

466
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,914
after assassinating His Majesty.

467
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:06,193
This can conclude

468
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,634
he'll succeed in the assassination.

469
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,634
After he succeeds,
the royal court will be in chaos.

470
00:28:10,794 --> 00:28:12,233
They will be too occupied
to hold someone responsible.

471
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,514
Fan Chang plotted this scheme first

472
00:28:14,514 --> 00:28:15,954
with his accomplices helped him after.

473
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:17,674
But today,

474
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:19,634
he only mentioned brotherhood

475
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,113
and was unwilling to name
his accomplices.

476
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:22,834
How is this sincere repentance?

477
00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:25,153
Your Majesty,

478
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:27,714
General Ling has a point.

479
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,514
Your Majesty,

480
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:31,554
I've ordered the men

481
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:33,353
to escort Fan Chang back to the capital
for interrogation.

482
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,193
We must apprehend the mastermind
behind this incident.

483
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:39,313
I want you to treat your injuries.

484
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,233
Stop worrying about this.

485
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,634
Be happy for a bit.

486
00:28:42,914 --> 00:28:44,594
Stop pulling a long face.

487
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:46,954
You either hold trials or fight all day.

488
00:28:46,954 --> 00:28:48,353
If you have a wife in the future,

489
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:49,674
you'll only scare her.

490
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:52,554
Your Majesty always mention marriage
whenever you could.

491
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:53,634
If you marry one,

492
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:55,634
I'll stop bringing it up.

493
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,193
Why?

494
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:59,634
Is General Ling going to be wedded too?

495
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:01,153
Why?

496
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:03,073
Which family is going to have a wedding?

497
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:04,273
It's Grand Tutor Lou.

498
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,473
The second son
of the Lou Family's second chamber.

499
00:29:07,193 --> 00:29:09,634
Everyone knows how he went after
Young Lady Cheng to Hua County

500
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:12,554
and the story of saving
a damsel in distress.

501
00:29:12,914 --> 00:29:14,834
I heard General Cheng and Grand Tutor

502
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,794
had approved of this marriage.

503
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:18,313
Even the betrothal gifts were delivered.

504
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:21,273
General Cheng especially went
to Hua County

505
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,594
to meet his handsome
and talented son-in-law.

506
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:27,073
I heard his wife will arrive soon too.

507
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,073
Your Majesty. Official Ji.

508
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,113
I still have some matters to attend to.

509
00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:39,073
So I'll excuse myself.

510
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:48,874
Official Ji,

511
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,754
how many daughters does
Cheng Shi has?

512
00:29:54,153 --> 00:29:55,393
They only have one.

513
00:29:55,954 --> 00:29:57,433
She's the youngest child in the family.

514
00:30:01,914 --> 00:30:03,834
Why does he only have one daughter?

515
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:06,834
Cheng Shi is too useless.

516
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,280
(Hua County Magistrate's Court)

517
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:41,514
You must be the First Madam
of the Cheng Family.

518
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:42,554
Allow me to notify them.

519
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:43,313
No need.

520
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,980
(Hua County Magistrate's Court)

521
00:30:53,594 --> 00:30:54,433
Yao,

522
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:55,554
go higher.

523
00:30:56,473 --> 00:30:57,273
Yes.

524
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:58,954
Use more strength.

525
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:03,153
Yao, you're amazing.

526
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:06,794
I don't even dare to climb up
so high to get it.

527
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:07,994
I'll get it soon.

528
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:09,834
Go higher.

529
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:11,594
You almost have it.

530
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:14,554
What are you doing?

531
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:15,954
Mother.

532
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:18,514
Yao!

533
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:21,153
Are you all right?

534
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:22,594
Did you hurt yourself?

535
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:26,273
The Lou Family is a family of scholars.

536
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:29,033
It's not easy for Mr. Lou to be agile.

537
00:31:29,994 --> 00:31:31,033
You're indeed not simple.

538
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:34,794
I'm Lou Yao, greetings, First Madam Cheng.

539
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:36,794
Since Yao was young,

540
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,954
he practiced martial arts and archery
with the He family.

541
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,233
His martial arts skills

542
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:42,433
are not inferior to two brothers.

543
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:45,794
All you utter is Yao.

544
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:47,193
Who's Yao?

545
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,634
My first name is Yao
with Lou as my last name.

546
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:52,794
Yao is a term of endearment
that Shaoshang calls me.

547
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:55,193
My mother also addresses me
with this name.

548
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,113
The Lou Family is a prominent family.

549
00:31:58,674 --> 00:31:59,914
You should know

550
00:31:59,914 --> 00:32:01,113
a gentleman wouldn't do anything

551
00:32:01,113 --> 00:32:02,714
to arouse suspicions.

552
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:04,433
You and Shaoshang

553
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,273
aren't betrothed or married.

554
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:07,634
How can you address each other's

555
00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:10,113
pet names intimately without hesitation?

556
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:12,113
Father and Grand Tutor Lou

557
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,674
had agreed to this betrothal

558
00:32:13,754 --> 00:32:14,954
and delivered the betrothal gifts.

559
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:16,554
How are we not considered betrothed?

560
00:32:16,554 --> 00:32:17,433
Am I right, Father?

561
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:19,233
Yes, she's right.

562
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:21,874
They're considered betrothed
after we accepted the betrothal gifts.

563
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:25,113
Did they send a matchmaker to propose?

564
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:26,594
Did they ask for the bride's name
and date of birth?

565
00:32:31,554 --> 00:32:32,273
No.

566
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:33,433
Did they exchange
their names and birth dates?

567
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:35,153
Did they have these read
at the fortune teller?

568
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:37,433
No.

569
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:38,994
Did they ask her mother!

570
00:32:41,153 --> 00:32:42,594
None of the rituals were followed!

571
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,594
How is this a betrothal?

572
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:45,313
We've already accepted
the betrothal gifts.

573
00:32:45,594 --> 00:32:47,273
We can't just return them.

574
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:49,073
As the bride's family,

575
00:32:49,073 --> 00:32:50,353
we can't ask it back if we return them.

576
00:32:58,634 --> 00:32:59,594
Mr. Lou,

577
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:02,153
Shaoshang grew up without her family
so she behaves differently.

578
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:04,313
The Lou clan is well connected

579
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:06,193
and the First Chamber
is highly prestigious.

580
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,313
The Cheng clan dares not claim ties
with your family.

581
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:11,273
I hope you'll talk
to your uncle and mother

582
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:13,313
to write a letter refusing
this betrothal.

583
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,113
It's for Shaoshang

584
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:17,874
and your own good.

585
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,353
Madam, please don't put it that way.

586
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,113
Shaoshang is the best woman

587
00:33:22,393 --> 00:33:23,393
I've ever met.

588
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:25,393
She's bold, responsible,

589
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:27,594
wise, skillful, and filial to her aunt.

590
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,073
She also has compassion
for children and the weak.

591
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:31,033
Even so,

592
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:32,634
it'll be a waste

593
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:34,313
if she's not a suitable match for you.

594
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:37,834
How are we not suitable for each other?

595
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:38,714
When your elder is talking,

596
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:40,353
how can you behave as you wish?

597
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:42,594
I told you to study

598
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:43,674
and learn some manners,

599
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,914
did you learn how
to talk back to your elders?

600
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:46,754
Why?

601
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:48,754
Are you going to reprimand me
for being defiant again?

602
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:52,153
Go to your room!

603
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:53,433
From now on,

604
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,273
to avoid any rumors with Mr. Lou,

605
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:57,153
you're not to meet each other!

606
00:33:58,954 --> 00:33:59,914
Go to your room first.

607
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:02,233
It's all right now.
Go back to your room first.

608
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:04,794
Mr. Lou,

609
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,994
you should go back and think
about this in your room.

610
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,433
We'll discuss whether
to break off this marriage

611
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:10,634
some other time.

612
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:11,834
We'll discuss this again.

613
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:13,113
But I...

614
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:20,514
Shaoshang, I'll...

615
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:28,153
First Madam Cheng had a long journey.

616
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:29,954
Please get some rest.

617
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,113
I shall excuse myself first.

618
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:38,994
It's all right now.

619
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:39,874
General,

620
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:42,473
is this the great deed you did?

621
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:48,834
Do you dislike Yao

622
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:51,594
or me?

623
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:53,954
Why are you trying to stop our marriage
through all means?

624
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:59,113
If I weren't your mother,

625
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:02,193
I wouldn't care if you were married off
to the underworld.

626
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,273
(After facing death,)

627
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:12,393
(I wanted to be closer to you.)

628
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,033
(But Mother remains the same.)

629
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:16,874
(She never changed.)

630
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:50,073
Shaoshang.

631
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:51,073
Yao.

632
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:53,433
Won't meeting in secret

633
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:54,914
upset your mother?

634
00:35:56,193 --> 00:35:57,473
Yao, don't worry.

635
00:35:57,594 --> 00:35:59,273
My mother's behavior
is not directed at you.

636
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:02,233
She just doesn't want me
to have it easy.

637
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:04,233
No matter who I'm marrying,

638
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,033
she'd behave this way too.

639
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:08,273
But we have to comply

640
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:09,754
with our elder's orders.

641
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,153
Who says we must follow

642
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:15,473
what elders tell us?

643
00:36:17,353 --> 00:36:18,874
Who says you can defy

644
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:20,794
your elder's order?

645
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:36,113
Madam Cheng.

646
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:43,594
Mother,

647
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,834
Yao and I are discussing
our marriage publicly.

648
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,473
We had to meet in secret

649
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:48,994
because you made it so.

650
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:50,794
How is this our fault?

651
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:53,113
Publicly?

652
00:36:53,874 --> 00:36:54,994
In the middle of the night?

653
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:56,674
Acting in private?

654
00:36:57,473 --> 00:36:58,554
How is this discussing it publicly?

655
00:36:58,914 --> 00:36:59,674
Madam Cheng,

656
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:01,714
I'm to blame for behaving impetuously.

657
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:03,473
Please don't blame Shaoshang.

658
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:05,233
Shaoshang,

659
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:06,874
don't be upset.

660
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:08,834
Talk nicely to Madam Cheng.

661
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:11,514
I'll excuse myself first.

662
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:23,954
Come back inside with me.

663
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,714
Do you know all the way to Hua County,

664
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,754
be it the wounded or the sick
and being ambushed by the bandits,

665
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:30,994
it was Niaoniao's leadership

666
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:32,834
that kept all of us alive.

667
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:36,033
Niaoniao is not a child anymore.

668
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,714
So what if that happened?

669
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:39,794
She was only lucky.

670
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,714
More than half of the properties
in Hua County were destroyed.

671
00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:43,674
It was Niaoniao who led the craftsmen
to make drawing plans

672
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:45,193
and helped the people rebuild their homes.

673
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,714
Not forgetting the farmer's tools,

674
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:48,313
she too modified them

675
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:49,914
so they could restore
their livelihood quickly.

676
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,313
What's there to it?

677
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:52,954
These are merely some little tricks.

678
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:54,473
Third Aunt,

679
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:56,073
you don't have to take my side.

680
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:58,473
Only Cheng Yang is praiseworthy.

681
00:37:58,914 --> 00:38:00,313
How would Mother be impressed

682
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:01,994
with my insignificant skills?

683
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:04,554
Sister-in-law,

684
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:06,634
Niaoniao only started learning.

685
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,153
Yet, she could help the people.

686
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,313
If you didn't hold her back
and forbid her to learn all these,

687
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,153
she would know more
than these insignificant skills.

688
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:15,313
Now, Niaoniao and the Lou Family
are discussing marriage.

689
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,754
Are you trying to hinder her

690
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,073
by stopping her from marrying?

691
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:20,433
I never said I wouldn't let her marry.

692
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:23,674
It's just not the right time
to marry yet.

693
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:25,273
If it were Cheng Yang,

694
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,674
will you stop her in this manner too?

695
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:30,193
If you can assure me as Yangyang does,

696
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:32,193
I wouldn't stop you from seeing Lou Yao.

697
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:34,233
How am I not making you feel at ease?

698
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:36,634
I meant

699
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,313
am I even worthy

700
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:40,233
for you to feel not at ease?

701
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,073
Let me ask you this then.

702
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:46,594
Do you really have feelings

703
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:48,153
for Lou Yao?

704
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:49,514
How do you know

705
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:51,433
I don't have feelings for Yao?

706
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,073
Your Third Aunt has described

707
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:55,514
how you and Lou Yao interact
with each other

708
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:56,754
to me in her letters.

709
00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:58,313
If that's what you do,

710
00:38:58,393 --> 00:38:59,834
how is there any affection?

711
00:39:00,153 --> 00:39:02,634
Do you feel parting
with him is unbearable

712
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,874
or does it feel like ages
when you don't see him for a day?

713
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:07,554
Do you have the affection
that ordinary couples should have?

714
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:12,714
There are countless

715
00:39:12,914 --> 00:39:15,153
couples in this world.

716
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:17,714
Why must everyone be the same?

717
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:20,914
Can't they each get what they need

718
00:39:20,914 --> 00:39:22,393
and live together as partners?

719
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:24,514
But you don't even love him.

720
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:25,794
How are you going to live

721
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:27,674
and face hardships with him
for the rest of your life?

722
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:29,033
Who says I don't like him?

723
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:30,594
I truly like him.

724
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:34,914
You don't know anything about love
between husband and wife.

725
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:40,914
All of you always say I'm clueless

726
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:44,233
and ignorant.

727
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:47,754
I admit

728
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,113
I don't know about anything.

729
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,393
That's because no one taught me
when I was a child.

730
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:57,033
You abandoned me after I was born.

731
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,634
Now, you've returned.

732
00:40:00,874 --> 00:40:02,554
How are you qualified to restrict me?

733
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:05,353
All right.

734
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:08,433
I shall wait and see

735
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,834
how you and Lou Yao lead

736
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:12,714
a good life.
