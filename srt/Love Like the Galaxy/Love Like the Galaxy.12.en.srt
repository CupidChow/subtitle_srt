3
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,760
- Kneel!
- On your knees!

4
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,480
Come here!

5
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,600
Stop. Please let him go!

6
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
Let him go!

7
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,120
People of Hua County, listen up!

8
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,000
These people are your family members.

9
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
If your magistrate refuses
to open the gate and surrender,

10
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
I'll kill them all!

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
I'll cut out their hearts

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
and dig out their livers

13
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,040
in front of you!

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,640
Please let him go!

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,080
Let him go!

16
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,040
-Kill!
-No!

17
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,440
You monsters!

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm going to kill you!

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
I'll kill one person
every quarter of an hour!

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,720
I shall see who will be tougher,

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,040
your magistrate

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,680
or these lowly live's necks.

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,400
I dare you to come out and fight!

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,600
Then I may spare your people's lives!

25
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,240
Father.

26
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,880
Sir.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
There are too many bandits out there.

28
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
You must never open the gate.

29
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,480
As the magistrate of Hua County,

30
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,840
how can I just watch

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,840
those bandits slaughter the people

32
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,320
while I hide like a coward?

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,280
The reason

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,600
they attacked Hua County is simply

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,760
to take the advantage
to lay an ambush on His Majesty

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,880
who's traveling the west.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,160
I will never let them get
what they wanted.

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,720
They must walk

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,720
over my dead body

40
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,120
to capture Hua County.

41
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Father, you can't.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,240
I'll go outside

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,680
to lure those bandits away.

44
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,160
Let the best soldiers
in the city break the siege.

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,800
You must report Hua County's situation
to His Majesty

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
and ask for General Ling's support.

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,560
- Father!
- Sir!

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,040
- Allow us to go with you!
- Let us go with you!

49
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,520
Grandfather, let us come with you!

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
We are willing to follow you

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,560
to fight the enemies to our deaths!

52
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,320
You're indeed Hua County's fine men.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,520
Smelt the copper.

54
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,720
When we go outside the city,

55
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
weld the latch of the city gate.

56
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,200
If the enemies are not wiped out,

57
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,160
you shall not let them inside the city!

58
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,880
Fight to the death! Fight to the death!

59
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,560
Open the gate!

60
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,280
Attack!

61
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,040
Come back!

62
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,160
Come back!

63
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,200
Come back!

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,320
Come back!

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
Niaoniao!

66
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
I dozed off

67
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
because I was too tired.

68
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
I even had a nightmare.

69
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,240
First Aunt, you should get some rest.

70
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,080
You can leave this accounting to me.

71
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,040
You're thoughtful,

72
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
unlike Niaoniao,

73
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,520
who only upsets me.

74
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,880
Even when you're dreaming,
you're still worried about Niaoniao.

75
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,760
It shows you do miss her.

76
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
It's already late.

77
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,280
You should get some rest.

78
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
You can take your time

79
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
to learn how to manage the household.

80
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,560
Yes.

81
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,280
When you were on war expeditions
with the General,

82
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,640
you often dozed off
while reading military reports too.

83
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
You even kept muttering
Forth Lady's name.

84
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,200
I didn't expect you'd still be worried

85
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
about Forth Lady now that you're home.

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,600
It shows every parent will always worry

87
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
about their children

88
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,520
no matter where they are.

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,160
I wasn't worried about her safety.

90
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,680
I was only worried

91
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,880
she'll cause trouble.

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
There are only the two of us here now.

93
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,320
What's wrong
if you're worried about her?

94
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,920
I can't do anything even if I missed her.

95
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,600
She thinks it's miserable
to stay at home all these years.

96
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,160
It's because
she hasn't experienced true misery.

97
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,720
How would she know

98
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,800
what we've gone through

99
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,680
all these years?

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Attack!

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Attack!

102
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,680
You, little runt!

103
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Die!

104
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
It's the black armored guards!

105
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,560
It's General Ling.

106
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,440
Kill them all!

107
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,760
Attack!

108
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,360
Retreat!

109
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,160
Mister,

110
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,160
are you the new county magistrate?

111
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
My grandfather wanted me

112
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,280
to hand this over to you.

113
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,600
Good girl,

114
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,480
do you still remember

115
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,280
the red box in my study room?

116
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,960
Yes.

117
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,840
I want you to take it and hide it.

118
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,400
When Mr. Cheng,
the new county magistrate arrives,

119
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,720
give it to him.

120
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,720
Tell him

121
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,920
I'll leave him

122
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,920
the people of Hua County.

123
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,320
All right.

124
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,000
Young Master!

125
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,520
A sneak attack!

126
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,440
Are you hurt?

127
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,720
Mister, are you all right?

128
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm fine.

129
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,600
Young Master.

130
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,600
Treat her injuries.

131
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,280
Yes.

132
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,680
Young Master.

133
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
We must head

134
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,680
to His Majesty's camp now.

135
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,920
Only the physician can treat this injury.

136
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,080
Are all bandits wiped out?

137
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,600
Fan Chang and some of his henchmen

138
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,920
are fleeing.

139
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,040
I have sent heavy troops
to encircle and suppress them.

140
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,720
Fan Chang will have nowhere to escape.

141
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
Take this seal

142
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,560
and hand it over
to the new county magistrate.

143
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,280
Young Master,

144
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,680
the new county magistrate

145
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
is Cheng Zhi,
General Cheng Shi's youngest brother.

146
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
I heard Fourth Lady Cheng is

147
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,960
among their convoy here.

148
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,880
Who did you say was with them?

149
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,240
Fourth Lady Cheng, Cheng Shaoshang.

150
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,960
Cheng Zhi set out earlier.

151
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,520
They should've arrived yesterday.

152
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,560
Fan Chang rebelled.

153
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,880
He might have other allies.

154
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,040
Young Master, I'm worried

155
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,440
they might be in danger...

156
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,560
Young Master!

157
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,560
Bring a group of men and search with me!

158
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,720
We'll kill every enemy
we see along the way!

159
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,400
Move out!

160
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,240
I thought Young Master was injured.

161
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,960
Where is he going?

162
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Keep quiet. Go and rescue people!

163
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
Did you send out any messages?

164
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,760
You're scared we sent out messages

165
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,200
because you're not bandits.

166
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,040
The more you know,

167
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,480
the shorter your life will be.

168
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,000
When that time comes,

169
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,440
you'll have the same fate
as your maidservant.

170
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,920
Where's Miao?

171
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
Your maidservant

172
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,640
had a fiery disposition.

173
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,520
She still breathed
after being tortured for hours.

174
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
So I granted her

175
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,320
a quick death.

176
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,240
I'll make you pay with your life.

177
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,960
Attack.

178
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,560
Don't be scared.

179
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm here.

180
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,400
Young Master,

181
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,280
we should return to the villa.

182
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,000
You must not let your injuries be.

183
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,760
Who bandaged your injury?

184
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
Fourth Lady Cheng did it.

185
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,880
She's pretty impressive.

186
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
There are blood
and mutilated flesh everywhere.

187
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
Yet, she's not scared at all.

188
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,560
Did you say
Fourth Lady Cheng bandage it for you?

189
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,640
Yes.

190
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,520
Are you upset about this?

191
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Qi,

192
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
did I do something wrong again?

193
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
It's better for your arm to break

194
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,480
than being bandaged.

195
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,440
Hang in there.

196
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,160
This won't do.

197
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,200
The wound is too deep!

198
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,600
I can't stop the bleeding.

199
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,720
We must use the soldering iron.

200
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,920
Give me a hand!

201
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,720
I'll do it.

202
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,320
Hang in there. You'll be fine soon.

203
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Hurry.

204
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,800
Hold it.

205
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
All right. It's working.

206
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,800
The bleeding has stopped.

207
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,360
This handkerchief is applied
with calming powder.

208
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,520
If you're not used to the bloody stench,

209
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,160
you can cover your nose
with this handkerchief.

210
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,480
Thank you, General Ling.

211
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,080
Lady Cheng,
you don't have to be scared now.

212
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,760
The danger is over.

213
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,320
If you hadn't come and rescued us,

214
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,440
we wouldn't know

215
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
if we could survive until now.

216
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm too weak to fight.

217
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,720
I can see your men are injured too.

218
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,760
To avoid your troops from being delayed,

219
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,600
you can leave
all your wounded soldiers here.

220
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll take good care of them.

221
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
Do you want all wounded soldiers

222
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,840
under my command to stay?

223
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,520
Yes.

224
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
If you have another plan,

225
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,200
we dare not question it.

226
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,560
Why only them?

227
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Can't I

228
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,480
stay here?

229
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,680
Why do you want to stay here?

230
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,360
Treat my injuries.

231
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,200
Young Master didn't rest
all day and night.

232
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
To rescue you,

233
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,920
he didn't even get his injuries treated.

234
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,680
Fei,

235
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,960
don't be rude.

236
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,040
General Ling,

237
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,480
you broke the tail
of the arrow yourself.

238
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,120
Now, the arrowhead only shows less
than half an inch from your skin.

239
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,280
There's no way to pull it out now.

240
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm afraid

241
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
we have to cut it open.

242
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,000
Cut it then.

243
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,960
But I lack the art of suturing.

244
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
If we insist on cutting it open,

245
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,080
I'm afraid you'll suffer from bleeding.

246
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,440
I only know the simple art of healing.

247
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
I have no skills to heal your wound.

248
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,920
Please forgive me.

249
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,280
Young Master, endure it for a while.

250
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,360
I'll leave for the military physician.

251
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
Even the fastest horse will take days

252
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,000
for you to reach.

253
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,600
Can Young Master wait that long?

254
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,640
I have a way.

255
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,280
But I don't know

256
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,720
if it'll work.

257
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
It'll work.

258
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,080
Young Master,

259
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,240
Lady Cheng hasn't said what it was...

260
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,040
If Young Master says it'll work,
means it'll work.

261
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Is this string

262
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,200
solid enough?

263
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,720
It's not an ordinary string.

264
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,240
It's Shaoshang string.
[*Shaoshang: name of Guqin's string]

265
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
That's where my name comes from.

266
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
In that case,

267
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,520
I'll leave this to you.

268
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,640
I believe you.

269
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,760
Did someone you like

270
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,200
give this Shaoshang string to you?

271
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,560
You can say it's someone I like.

272
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,640
It's Qiqi who gave it to me.

273
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,200
She has very good taste.

274
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,240
You can start now.

275
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
General Ling,

276
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,440
is it painful?

277
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,000
Do your hands hurt?

278
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,680
I'm glad to hear that.

279
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,120
Bandage him now.

280
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,520
Do you find anything wrong
with this arrow?

281
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,600
This is the latest refined iron weapon
in the army.

282
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,200
It has always been stored

283
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,680
at the armory supervised
by Head Armorer Dong.

284
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,120
Now, it's in the hands of these people.

285
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,320
It shows...

286
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,040
It shows it's what you've expected.

287
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,560
Shu is going to raise a rebellion.

288
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,280
These people acquired
military weapons in secret

289
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,400
to revolt.

290
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
Those outside aren't bandits

291
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
but the rebel army.

292
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,520
I...

293
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,760
I was only guessing.

294
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
You can't take my word for it.

295
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,640
You can't count on it.

296
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
His Majesty received the news

297
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,560
that Hua County was attacked.

298
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,600
I was ordered to suppress the bandits.

299
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,000
Fortunately, the disaster was put out

300
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,800
as soon as it started.

301
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,760
General Ling,

302
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,600
what do you plan to do

303
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,760
with those rebels out there?

304
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,520
Why did you leave so many survivors?

305
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,720
These coward scoundrels were vicious

306
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
toward women and children.

307
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,240
They surrendered rather quickly
when they were no match for us.

308
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,800
Rebel will cost you your life.

309
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,800
Stealing and using military weapons

310
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,640
will only be exiled.

311
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,160
You can choose

312
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,120
which punishment you want.

313
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,880
Really?

314
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,960
We just stole and used military weapons.

315
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Someone sold us

316
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,480
this batch of armaments.

317
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
Who sold them to you?

318
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,040
About this,

319
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,800
we don't know.

320
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,480
All right.

321
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,840
Take them away and behead them.

322
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,600
Yes, sir!

323
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,880
You can't take back your words!

324
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,960
Hold it.

325
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,760
Listen up.

326
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,640
There's no need

327
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,720
to keep my word with people like you.

328
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
As a soldier,

329
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,880
you knew military weapons are

330
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,520
as important as a soldier's life in battle.

331
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,760
How dare you steal military weapons?

332
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,560
It's a crime where you deserve to die.

333
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,680
We had no choice.

334
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,760
General Fan Chang made us do this.

335
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,880
He's unhappy that His Majesty sent him
to the garrison in Shu.

336
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,560
So he stole the military weapons

337
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,800
to gather more weapons.

338
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,960
How is that coercion?

339
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,120
You were obviously greedy
for power and wealth.

340
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,440
You deserve all of this.

341
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,920
Stop trying to gain sympathy.

342
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,760
Young Master,
it's ominous to kill surrenderers.

343
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,040
I'll do it, then.

344
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,080
I'll kill them.

345
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
It's ominous to kill surrenderers.

346
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,600
But they never surrendered to me.

347
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,760
It's all right if I kill them.

348
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,080
They killed

349
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,640
my maidservant, Miao,

350
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,560
the male servants, and coachmen.

351
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,200
That woman,

352
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,680
we only found some parts of her remains.

353
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
Are you even humans?

354
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,360
Since you don't want to be humans,

355
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,600
then you can be

356
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
animals today.

357
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,480
I'll treat you as animals.

358
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,040
I'll slaughter you as I wish.

359
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,960
You wouldn't dare!

360
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,400
When we turn into ferocious ghosts,

361
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,600
we'll tear you apart!

362
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,640
Take them away.

363
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Come!

364
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,760
Just stay here.

365
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,800
You didn't witness any of this.

366
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,920
You'll have nightmares if you watch.

367
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,240
I won't have nightmares.

368
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,320
I want to witness

369
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,800
how these animals die myself.

370
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,520
Listen to me.

371
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,280
Stay here.

372
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,200
It wasn't your fault
your maidservant was captured.

373
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,520
You've done very well

374
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,840
under such conditions.

375
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Before you sleep tonight,

376
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,600
you must drink a bowl of calming soup.

377
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Remember to drink it.

378
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,760
Misappropriating of armaments.

379
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,520
Die!

380
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,280
Who's there?

381
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,200
I told you not to come.

382
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,560
Niaoniao!

383
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,880
-Shaoshang!
-Niaoniao!

384
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,000
Be careful, Master.

385
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,800
Niaoniao!

386
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,480
Niaoniao,

387
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,560
are you all right?

388
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,160
Where's your Third Aunt?

389
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,040
Shunhua!

390
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,120
Shunhua!

391
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,480
Shunhua!

392
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,760
Shaoshang, are you all right?

393
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,480
Shaoshang,

394
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,560
I'm truly sorry.

395
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,480
No matter what happened after this,

396
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,920
I wouldn't leave your side.

397
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,240
You may not know this.

398
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,160
Lou Yao is so weak

399
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,560
that he was frightened.

400
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,440
He passed out three times along the road.

401
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,520
Luckily,

402
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,280
I was calmed.

403
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,960
Tell me.

404
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,160
I asked you to request reinforcement.

405
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,400
Why did it take you so long?

406
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,960
I...

407
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,480
I'll tell you.

408
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,240
Don't be angry.

409
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,360
It's because Official Cheng

410
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,600
fainted several times.

411
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
Official Cheng,
something bad had happened.

412
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
Shaoshang and Madam Sang were ambushed.

413
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,560
So only you managed to escape?

414
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,680
We must go and rescue them.

415
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Shunhua!

416
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,160
Niaoniao!

417
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,880
I...

418
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,400
I was still too late.

419
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,680
Official Cheng!

420
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,760
Sir!

421
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,120
Official Cheng.

422
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,600
Official Cheng.

423
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,440
Official Cheng, we must go
to Shaoshang and the rest quickly.

424
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,400
Shunhua!

425
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,040
Niaoniao.

426
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,240
I...

427
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,480
I'm still too late.

428
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,200
What...

429
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,120
Official Cheng! Official Cheng!

430
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,400
Official Cheng!

431
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,560
These...

432
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,480
These belong to Shunhua.

433
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,760
Official Cheng.

434
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm fine.

435
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
I can hold on.

436
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,040
These are Shunhua's belongings.

437
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,920
Shunhua's belongings.

438
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,880
I...

439
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,840
I'm still too late.

440
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,320
Does that means

441
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,360
you went around in circles

442
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,880
at the foot of the mountain all day

443
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,920
to find Third Aunt and me?

444
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,480
It's all day and all night.

445
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,560
So you didn't encounter

446
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,360
any of the bandits along the way?

447
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,400
You were safe all this while?

448
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,960
I supposed the bandits came here
to surround you.

449
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,880
So we are safe

450
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,520
all the way.

451
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,520
Third Uncle is indeed born
with great fortune.

452
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
We were in dire situations

453
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,520
and being hunted

454
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,000
along the way.

455
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,960
Yet,

456
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,720
none of you suffer any infliction.

457
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,880
Heaven sure is partial.

458
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,840
No, Shaoshang.

459
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,200
You are beautiful and kind-hearted.

460
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,920
You're surely favored by heaven.

461
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,160
See?

462
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,760
Didn't you run into General Ling?

463
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,760
He even dispatched
the black armored guards to protect us.

464
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,080
He's indeed a good man.

465
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,440
Halt.

466
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,200
The blood trail is still fresh.

467
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,640
Fan Chang is not far away from here.

468
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,600
Search in front.

469
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,400
Yes, sir.

470
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,840
(This handkerchief is applied
with calming powder.)

471
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,880
(If you're not used to the bloody stench,)

472
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,440
you can cover your nose
with this handkerchief.

473
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Thank you, General Ling.

474
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,000
Isn't this...

475
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,600
Just speak your mind.

476
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,800
You did everything you could

477
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,960
to come and rescue Fourth Lady Cheng
with your injuries.

478
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,280
Why did you ask Qi

479
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,000
to escort her to Hua County?

480
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,520
She's after all the family member
of Hua County's new county magistrate.

481
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,040
We don't know if there are

482
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,200
any remnants of Fan Chang's
along the way.

483
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,480
So we must be careful.

484
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,800
Is that all?

485
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,840
Or else?

486
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,280
Put out your hand.

487
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,920
Guard this area.

488
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,880
I'll take the men forward

489
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,280
so Fan Chang has no place to escape.

490
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,400
Yes.

491
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,800
Since you have arrived

492
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,120
Hua County safely,

493
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
I shall take my leave now.

494
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,360
Thank you for escorting us, Sir.

495
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,880
(Hua County)

496
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,760
Father.

497
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,239
