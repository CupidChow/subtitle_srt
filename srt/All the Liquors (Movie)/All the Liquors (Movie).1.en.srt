Hello, Merry Christmas!

4
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:23,158
Hello. We're from Paektusan Soju.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,430
You're drinking “As If Your Last Bottle”, right?

6
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:27,547
Why don't you try Paektusan Soju

7
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:29,422
instead of “As If Your Last Bottle”?

8
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:31,437
If you order Paektusan Soju now,

9
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,212
we'll give you a hangover cure!

10
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:35,351
Would you like to try clean

11
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:36,633
and clear Paektusan Soju?

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,220
Ah, yes.

13
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:40,585
Thank you for choosing Paektusan Soju

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,070
on a Christmas day like this.

15
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:44,040
- Merry Christmas!
- Excuse me...

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,219
Could you possibly give me

17
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:47,572
one more hangover cure?

18
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:50,172
Well, this is actually not allowed,

19
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:51,884
but since today is a special day,

20
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,180
here's a Christmas gift!

21
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:55,868
Thank you.

22
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:57,533

You're here?

25
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,308
It's snowing outside, isn't it cold?

26
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:22,698
This place again?

27
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,268
Excuse me, boss,

28
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:31,252
please bring what I ordered earlier.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,370
I ordered ishidai fish.

30
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:39,010
Is that food more important to you

31
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:40,303
than Christmas?

32
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:42,354
No,

33
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,433
you told me to eat what I want.

34
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:47,455
But that didn't mean coming to

35
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:48,736
a place like this, did it?

36
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:54,886
I said I'd try to change,

37
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:56,894
but isn't this too much?

38
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:01,011
Where are you going?

39
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,229
Let's break up.

40
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:06,992
How can you say that

41
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:09,933
before the ishidai fish is served?

42
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:12,956
I'm leaving.

43
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:15,644
Hey!

44
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
Hey!

45
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:19,644
Hey.

46
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:25,073
Ishidai fish is served.

47
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,244
Have a great meal.

48
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,885
It feels like chewing rubber.

49
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:55,661
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

50
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:57,579
- May I have some water?
- Yes.

- He's so handsome!
- I'm so shy.

53
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,525
- Hey.
- Could it be that he's aware?

54
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,299
Hey, did you see that?

55
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:19,204
He's crazy handsome!

56
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,604
It's not just his face.

57
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,430
He's got this mysterious vibe.

58
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,376
He even declined appearing on TV shows,

Hey, you know what?

95
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,194
You're using your broken heart

96

as an excuse to drink.

97
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,896

Yes,

112
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,261
right now?

113
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,839
Wait a moment.

114
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:24,864
Okay.

115
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:31,245
Where are you going?

116
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,079
My friend called me.

117
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:37,206
- They're in front of my house now.
- Shut up and sit down.

118

It's my treat.

119
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,307
Then I'll finish it all.

120

to celebrate good things. You and me,

123
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,339
okay?

124

You talk too much. Just Leave.

125
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,307
- I'll give you a call.
- Sure. Just go.

126
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,977
I want something refreshing.

00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:10,536
Haa...

128
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:12,778
So hungry.

129
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:16,419
I should have finished the side dishes.

130
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,427
Tteokbokki, tteokbokki.

131
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,005
I want some tteokbokki.

132
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,333
One serving of tteokbokki, please.

133
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:50,309
Oh? Where's Grandma?

134
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:52,997
Grandma?

135
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,565
Grandma... Where is she?

136
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,573
Grandma?

137
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,441
I'm sorry, but it's break time now.

138
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:11,546
Don't you have tteokbokki?

139
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:16,465
I want tteokbokki right now.

140
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,484
This is not a tteokbokki shop.

141
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:26,525
Gosh, I'm starving.

142
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:29,256
- I want some tteokbokki.
- Please leave.

143
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:31,328
Sure.

144
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,780
I'll leave.

145
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,515
Fine, I'll leave.

146
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,341
I'm leaving, but...

147
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,507
- Please leave.
- Fine.

148
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,880
Is this really not a tteokbokki shop?

149
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,335
- Since when has this shop existed?
- Please get out.

150
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,038
I am leaving.

151
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,026
Where am I?

152
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,643
This is a restaurant,

153
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:20,837
and it's break time.

154
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:22,181
But you lost consciousness

155
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:23,487
and bumped into me.

156
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,276
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,979
But you seem to be fine.

158
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:32,941
I'm sorry. I'll leave now.

159
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:44,076
You see...

160
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,450
I digest well when I'm drunk.

161
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:51,074
Do you want some cold noodles?

162
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:55,513
It's our meal time.

163
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,346
Are you two acquaintances?

164
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,632
I just need to boil another serving.

165
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:03,060
If that's the case, thanks.

166
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:05,677
Thank you.

167
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,403
Wow, it's so refreshing.

168
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:26,897
Is he simple or clueless?

169
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,644
That hit the spot.

170
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:32,842
By the way,

171
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:35,834
do you have soju?

172
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:38,967
What?

173
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:42,584
I think it would be great with soju.

174
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,600
You behaved rudely while

175
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:49,896
you were wasted,

176
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,404
now you want soju?

177
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:53,459
No, I just thought

178
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:54,844
it'd go well with...

179
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:55,921
Food's good because of alcohol.

180
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,834
In a pleasant mood because of alcohol.

181
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,819
When you're moody, you demand alcohol.

182
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,100
We don't serve alcohol!

183
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:05,850
Is that something

184
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,060
to get so angry about?

185
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:09,669
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:11,435
I think it's best if you leave now.

187
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:32,789
Gosh darn.

188
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:38,008
What kind of unfriendly place is this?

189
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:42,680
Kind people are really hard to find.

190
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,662
But

191
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,005
at least the cold noodles were good.

192
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:53,873
Let's go.

193
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,810
If the cold noodles were good,

194
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:56,915
that's all that matters.

195
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
Haa...

196
00:11:57,991 --> 00:11:58,991
Dammit.

197
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:04,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

198
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,790
(Hangover cure)

199
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:30,754
Yes?

200
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Jiyu?

201
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,575
Did you drink again last night?

202
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:36,662
Just a little.

203
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,673
I'm fine, Deputy Chief.

204
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:47,494
I'm not asking if you're fine right now.

205
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:49,930
Do you think it's okay to come to work

206
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:52,145
smelling like alcohol in the morning?

207
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,806
Do I really smell like alcohol?

208
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,384
You smell rotten.

209
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:03,096
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:04,665
Keep your drinking in check

211
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:06,205
so it doesn't interfere with work.

212
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,744
- You know we have a meeting later, yes?
- Yes, I know.

213
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,415
Chef Choi Seongjoon rejected the offer

214
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,009
because the contract terms didn't match.

215
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:15,704
- So we're meeting with Chef Kim Seok.
- Yes.

216
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,776
I'll secure the contract

217
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,285
with Chef Kim Seok at all costs.

218
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,353
Gosh, it really stinks.

219
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:28,901
Keep fighting.

220
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Keep fighting.

221
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:42,163
- Regrading the contract...
- My apologies.

222
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,781
Yes?

223
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,194
I really wanted to work with you,

224
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:48,859
but I've decided to quit cooking.

225
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,960
What do you mean?

226
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:54,312
Chef, you're doing so well these days.

227
00:13:54,337 --> 00:13:56,344
My wife said what's the use of money

228
00:13:57,148 --> 00:13:58,702
if you don't have time for us?

229
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:00,484
She handed me divorce papers.

230
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,148
I...

231
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,194
Love my wife.

232
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,890
Yes.

233
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:08,437
Please love her.

234
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:10,608
- We're not opposing that...
- No,

235
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,991
I made this decision to protect my love.

236
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,305
Goodbye.

237
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:21,983
- Chef. Chef.
- Please wait.

238
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,195
What the heck?

239
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,264
Can't he keep both his love and his job?

240
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:30,466
It's good for both sides.

241
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:32,124
This is driving me crazy.

242
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,764
What should we do now?

243
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:36,642
There is a list of

244
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:37,858
previous candidates, right?

245
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:39,171
Let's have a look again.

246
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,311
Goodbye.

247
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:49,889
- Mr. Jiyu.
- Yes?

248
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,164
We need to have a new list

249
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:52,171
by next Monday.

250
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:54,436
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

251
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,670
We have to finalize this next week.

252
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:58,529
I think I can manage.

253
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,038
It's not about whether we can or can't.

254
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,878
We have to.

255
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,522
What if we can't?

256
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,741
If we can't,

257
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:05,889
you might need to start

258
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:07,069
looking for another job.

259
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:09,138
That's scary.

260
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,936
If you want to keep your job,

261
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,761
you'd better find someone.

262
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:15,124
Yes.

263
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:19,515
What's all this?

264
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:22,234
It's for the marketing team.

265
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,414
They say it's for some project.

266
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:26,703
Free booze.

267
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,601
Wow.

268
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:29,881
Mr. Jiyu.

269
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,148
You still have the nerve

270
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:32,177
to think about booze?

271
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:34,186
This isn't a time to be celebrating.

272
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,382
Yes.

273
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:40,115
Please go ahead.

274
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,258
What is it now?

275
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,078
I just noticed no one is waiting in line,

276
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:23,375
so I was curious.

277
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,092
Darn it.

278
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,302
What's with those booze?

279
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,169
It's for work! Hey!

280
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,201
Wait!

281
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,209
So unfriendly, really unfriendly.

282
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:46,366
Would it kill him to help a bit?

283
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:11,831
Thank you.

284
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,150
So he does have a heart.

285
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:34,848
What are you doing?

286
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,054
Oh, you're here?

287
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:37,746
You didn't hear?

288
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:39,669
I know.

289
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,984
I'm going to eat and drink all I want today.

290
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't try to stop me.

291
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,320
Kim Woosoo, that bastard.

292
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:54,976
Didn't you say we'd only drink

293
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:56,209
for good reasons from now on?

294
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,522
Oh, this is a good reason for me.

295
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,612
I broke up with that jerk.

296
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:02,309
That's a great reason.

297
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,211
- Isn't that right?
- Seriously.

298
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,675
Finding new excuses to drink.

299
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,212
Enough, go grab some glasses.

300
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:09,680
I'm starving.

301
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,094
I know.

302
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,711
Kim Woosoo, that selfish jerk.

303
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,335
How dare he break up with me?

304
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,506
Who cares.

305
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:22,336
- Hey, do I have no charm?
- You do.

306
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,820
- What about the glasses?
- Huh?

307
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,172
- Glasses.
- Glasses?

308
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:29,523
How vexing.

309
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,371
The glasses are here.

310
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,570
Are we going to drink from a wine glass?

311
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:38,922
How about soju glasses?

312
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,624
That's more like it.

313
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,282
Cheers.

314
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:56,578
One shot, alright?

315
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,299
Looks delicious.

316
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,479
I'm digging in now.

317
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:24,878
Wow!

318
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:27,542
This is seriously yummy.

319
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:30,525
Don't you know about this place?

320
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:31,659
No, I don't.

321
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,550
You're really clueless.

322
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,399
How can you not know?

323
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:38,776
This place is super hot right now.

324
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:40,581
Where is it?

325
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,808
It's in front of

326
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,143
the elementary school's alley entrance.

327
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,433
What's it called again?

328
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Goosoo.

329
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:49,769
Something like that.

330
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:52,198
The word Goosoo

331
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:54,380
probably means delicious.

332
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:55,887
Anyway, it's really good.

333
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,198
Maybe this place could help.

334
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:05,947
- What are you talking about?
- Huh?

335
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,979
It's nothing.

336
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,464
The booze that you're drinking

337
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,643
it's for our launch party next month.

338
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,135
We're collaborating with

339
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,260
a chef on a project...

340
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:18,493
but we haven't found a chef yet.

341
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,729
We're still finding one.

342
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,370
See? Whenever you're having a hard time,

343
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:25,580
I always show up like a savior

344
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,128
and help you like this.

345
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,136
Right, you moron.

346
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:30,720
Just coincidences.

347
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:32,792
At least pretend to appreciate it.

348
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,751
Anyway, check out this restaurant.

349
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,971
The chef is super handsome.

350
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,065
I even follow him... Hold on.

351
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:41,894
Wait a minute.

352
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:43,595
Here.

353
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:45,331
Look, he's so hot.

354
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:48,448
Oh, it's him!

355
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:50,503
What?

356
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,167
Not bad.

357
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:57,362
Let's contact this chef.

358
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,072
But...

359
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,358
- Well...
- What?

360
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,817
You see...

361
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,293
- Do you have soju?
- What?

362
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,590
You behaved rudely while

363
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,145
you were wasted,

364
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:20,598
now you want soju?

365
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:30,848
Huh?

366
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:32,810
So what do we do?

367
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,706
We need to find another chef.

368
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

369
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,378
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.

370
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:54,534
Let's see.

371
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,004
This is very good.

372
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:04,317
Yes?

373
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,840
He's better looking than

374
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:08,402
Chef Choi Seongjoon and Chef Kim Seok.

375
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,778
He even has a mystique about him

376
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,114
since he doesn't appear on TV.

377
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:13,278
Not bad at all.

378
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:15,246
Let's go with this guy.

379
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,809
Well, you see...

380
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,707
We're still in negotiations.

381
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:23,075
How long are you going to negotiate?

382
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,152
We need results now.

383
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,441
Yes, understood.

384
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:30,760
I'll get the contract signed

385
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:32,659
by the end of the week.

386
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:34,965
Okay,

387
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:37,526
- I'll leave it to you, deputy chief.
- Yes.

388
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,824
- Keep fighting.
- Keep fighting.

389
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:40,849
- Keep fighting.
- Keep fighting.

390
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:42,652
Goodbye.

391
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,245
What are we going to do?

392
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:49,168
We have to try.

393
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,262
- Yes, but how?
- You're not going to do it?

394
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,434
You know my style.

395
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,597
Even so...

396
00:22:55,895 --> 00:22:58,403
Just be quiet if you can't do it.

397
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:00,397
Yes...

398
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:14,232
(Goosoo Restaurant)

399
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:19,753
(Mr. Jiyu, sorry, I'll be late.
Please wait inside.)

400
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,301
(Got it.)

401
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,167
Umm...

402
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:45,822
Can I order something?

403
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:48,940
- We're about to stop taking orders...
- Please, have a seat.

404
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:28,334
Enjoy your meal.

405
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,256
Thank you.

406
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:08,644
Hello.

407
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:10,370
I'm Han Jiyu.

408
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:12,441
I'm from Baeksundang marketing team.

409
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,339
We've met before but didn't

410
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,855
properly introduce ourselves.

411
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:22,839
Our company is launching a new soju.

412
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:25,699
We would like to collaborate with you.

413
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,221
No.

414
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:32,328
Pardon?

415
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:33,933
I said no.

416
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:36,550
If you're done eating, please leave.

417
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:40,073
My boss is sensitive about

418
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:41,889
anything related to liquor.

419
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,714
Oh, I know you don't sell liquor here.

420
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,440
We're not asking you to.

421
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:49,017
We just want you to handle the cooking.

422
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,684
We're planning a major

423
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,097
promotional event afterward,

424
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,190
which will help market your restaurant.

425
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:57,556
I said it's not needed.

426
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:03,682
Then I'll just leave my card here.

427
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:06,721
See you later.

428
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,771
Don't bother,

429
00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:09,216
it'll be a waste of your time.

430
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:12,799
Did he need to be so rude?

431
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:26,276
Deputy chief, where are you?

432
00:26:26,605 --> 00:26:29,159
Sorry. I'm heading back to the office.

433
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,018
Did you talk to him?

434
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:34,901
We might need to find another chef.

435
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:36,573
Why?

436
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:38,806
It's been reported to upper management.

437
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:40,137
Already reported?

438
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:41,450
Is there a problem?

439
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:44,058
They really like Chef Park Kihoon.

440
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,642
I have to go into a meeting now,

441
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,884
let's talk later.

442
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,706
Ugh! This is a disaster.

443
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:53,755
Mmm, yes.

444
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:56,498
Oh!

445
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:59,440
(Close for a day due to personal business)
What? Today's weekday.

446
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:00,465
What?

447
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:03,224
This shouldn't be happening.

448
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:07,865
But it is.

449
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:09,848
Wonder what's going on.

450
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:10,936
Yeah.

451
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:14,907
Looks like we came for nothing.

452
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:17,677
What should we do?

453
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,028
Nothing we can do.

454
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,973
Let's come back another time.

455
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:23,443
- You're done for the day, Mr. Jiyu.
- Yes.

456
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:28,834
Deputy chief.

457
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,404
Wait up, let's go together.

458
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:33,521
Wait for me.

459
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:37,232
Auntie!

460
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,935
- I'm here!
- Oh, you're here?

461
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:40,208
Stir-fried squid, please!

462
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,558
- The same as usual?
- Yes.

463
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,935
- Real spicy, please.
- Got it.

464
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:44,956
I'll have a bottle of soju!

465
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:46,458
Please go ahead.

466
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:24,873
Auntie!

467
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,809
Isn't that stir-fried squid mine?

468
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,904
Yours is right here.

469
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,669
- Oh.
- Geez.

470
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:34,302
We didn't even write it on the menu.

471
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:36,114
Two people ordering the same dish

472
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:37,489
at the same time.

473
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:43,776
I didn't know.

474
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,970
Hey, are you feeling better?

475
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:05,157
I'm perfectly fine.

476
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:07,942
At this rate, I can go to work tomorrow.

477
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,715
You can't serve with a cast on.

478
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,650
What about other friends?

479
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:15,212
I asked my friend,

480
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:17,462
he said he couldn't make it.

481
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,634
What should we do tomorrow?

482
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,619
Don't worry about it and just recover.

483
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:26,501
I'm good on my own, it's no big deal.

484
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:28,290
Maybe I should just come in.

485
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:30,720
No, you can't work in your condition.

486
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,010
It's bad for the restaurant's image.

487
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:34,409
Look at what you said...

488
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:36,504
Do I look like some demonic boss?

489
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,692
You only care about your own reputation.

490
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:41,636
My reputation is terrible now.

491
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:43,387
I'm just worried about you.

492
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,581
I'll hang up now.

493
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:47,598
- I'm going to eat now.
- Wait, Brother...

494
00:30:01,238 --> 00:30:02,564
You have good taste.

495
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:03,605
This place has

496
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,770
the best stir-fried squid.

497
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,058
This hidden menu,

498
00:30:08,192 --> 00:30:09,316
how did you know about?

499
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:11,308
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:13,391
Just eat your meal.

501
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:16,652
I went to your restaurant today,

502
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:17,824
but it was closed.

503
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:19,863
Is your employee sick?

504
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:23,433
Well?

505
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:05,175
Boss,

506
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:08,722
I'm here to propose again.

507
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:12,144
No.

508
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:14,464
Just eat your meal and leave.

509
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:17,652
Why don't you hear me out first

510
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:18,770
before deciding?

511
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:19,973
Well?

512
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,738
Please listen to me first.

513
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:23,902
- Then you can...
- Is it open?

514
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:25,746
Welcome.

515
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,186
Is it just the two of you?

516
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,772
They're open, come on in.

517
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:42,078
We're having a reunion,

518
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,382
and the place we wanted to go is full.

519
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,943
Aunties and uncles like us

520
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:47,248
are welcome, right?

521
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:49,741
Yes, of course,

522
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,053
what would you like to order?

523
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:56,451
Our children are gathered in one house.

524
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:59,366
Can you deliver some food to them first?

525
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:01,858
They're really hungry.

526
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:04,514
I'm afraid delivery

527
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,014
might be a bit difficult...

528
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:09,521
Of course!

529
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,326
Since you've come all the way here.

530
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:13,373
What are you doing?

531
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:17,405
We'll talk later.

532
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:19,170
You don't need my help?

533
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:27,442
I'll leave the delivery to you then.

534
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,185
Alright, leave it to me.

535
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:43,466
I have delivered the food.

536
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:44,903
Thank you.

537
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:47,650
The kids are absolutely lovely.

538
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:50,330
Thank you.

539
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:52,447
I thought you were only good-looking

540
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,409
but it turns out

541
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:54,823
you have a good heart too.

542
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:55,977
Thank you.

543
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,354
If you need anything

544
00:32:57,363 --> 00:32:58,582
let me know anytime.

545
00:32:58,606 --> 00:32:59,606
Alright.

546
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,471
Please enjoy your meal.

547
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,729
Can you recommend some menu items?

548
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:24,065
Also

549
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,511
are there alcoholic drinks?

550
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,203
We're not really in the know.

551
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:29,269
Can you suggest a good pairing?

552
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:32,972
We don't sell alcoholic beverages.

553
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:36,737
- You don't?
- Why?

554
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:38,581
How come?

555
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,315
An alcohol-free restaurant? Really?

556
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:50,964
We don't serve alcohol here.

557
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:53,839
What now?

558
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:57,253
But if you don't mind

559
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,995
I'd like to recommend

560
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,370
some traditional soju.

561
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,831
For free.

562
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:04,722
Really?

563
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,518
Would you mind filling out

564
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:08,528
a quick survey after trying it?

565
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:11,534
Of course, it's free, after all.

566
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,066
Thank you.

567
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:14,940
Today's dish

568
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,847
is a Korean-style pasta that was

569
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:18,137
seasoned with perilla oil

570
00:34:18,162 --> 00:34:19,450
and salted octopus.

571
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:21,824
If you pair it with perilla leaves

572
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:24,112
it'll enhance the fragrance and texture.

573
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:25,940
This is tteokgalbi made with

574
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:26,870
Hanwoo beef.

575
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:29,011
If you pair it with water minari salad

576
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:30,591
it will help manage the greasiness

577
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:32,245
and enhance your dining experience.

578
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:33,901
Have a great meal.

579
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,831
Yes. Thank you.

580
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,142
- Wow that was tasty.
- Hope you get a lot of customers.

581
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,439
It was very delicious.

582
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

583
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:50,598
Thank you.

584
00:34:58,794 --> 00:34:59,794
Thank you.

585
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:02,770
Please reconsider it.

586
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:05,106
My proposal.

587
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:07,348
It's a good proposal.

588
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,958
It will benefit me too.

589
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:13,372
But I can't afford to do that now.

590
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,036
Thank you for your help.

591
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:20,638
And your proposal too.

592
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:28,458
Then, how about...

593
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,177
How did you persuade him?

594
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:33,950
Well...

595
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,817
How about I help you out on weekends?

596
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,810
Sorry?

597
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,317
Aren't you understaffed?

598
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:46,135
I had many part-time jobs

599
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,815
at many restaurant during school.

600
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:50,090
It seems like you might have

601
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,473
trouble on the weekends.

602
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:54,581
What if he doesn't sign the contract

603
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:55,934
even after you help out?

604
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:57,265
Oh.

605
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:03,134
Then...

606
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:05,089
I'll do as you say

607
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:06,362
and look for a new job.

608
00:36:09,392 --> 00:36:11,313
But I'm confident that I'll succeed.

609
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:12,739
Really?

610
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:14,168
Yeah.

611
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:36,414
Hello.

612
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,152
Please take a seat.

613
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:39,484
- Over here, right?
- Yes.

614
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:47,227
Two pastas please.

615
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:49,118
Alright.

616
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,663
(Goosoo Restaurant)
(Alcohol-free. No alcohol is allowed)

617
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,387
Thank you for your hard work.

618
00:37:39,412 --> 00:37:40,894
- Are you hungry?
- Yes. So...

619
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:43,051
Enjoy your meal. I'll take my leave.

620
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:45,816
Yes.

621
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Take care.

622
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,819
- Brother.
- Hey.

623
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:07,835
How are you?

624
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:10,249
I'm perfectly fine.

625
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:11,991
How's it going today?

626
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:13,311
Is the part-timer okay?

627
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,726
Well...

628
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:17,405
Not bad.

629
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:19,038
Are you smiling?

630
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:21,004
You seem to be happy.

631
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:22,515
I'm sulking now.

632
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:25,007
What? Smiling?

633
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:27,445
You saw?

634
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:30,655
No. But you sound happy.

635
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:33,905
It's rough but hang in there.

636
00:38:34,264 --> 00:38:35,452
Keep fighting.

637
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:37,577
I'll go over and have a meal.

638
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,601
Sure.

639
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:40,335
See you later.

640
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,296
- Have a good rest.
- Yeah.

641
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:43,038
Hello.

642
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:44,659
What?

643
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:46,842
Come have some spicy chicken now.

644
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:49,894
I drank too much yesterday.

645
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:51,535
I have an upset stomach.

646
00:39:52,675 --> 00:39:54,605
Drunk from celebrating?

647
00:39:55,113 --> 00:39:57,862
Breaking up with that trash

648
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:00,230
- of course it's a celebration.
- Yeah right.

649
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:03,005
Don't drink. Just eat the chicken.

650
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:04,800
Didn't you hear?

651
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:07,206
I said I have an upset stomach.

652
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:08,946
I'd poop blood if I have spicy food.

653
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,911
Jeez I'm eating you know.

654
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:13,347
There are non-spicy options too.

655
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:14,411
I'm so bored.

656
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:15,753
You jerk.

657
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:16,980
Just end the call.

658
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:18,269
I already said

659
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:20,659
that I have an upset stomach.

660
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:23,386
Pooping blood is tough, you know?

661
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:24,407
Hello?

662
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Perfectly spicy.

663
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:41,605
I can't stop eating spicy food.

664
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Because...

665
00:40:44,924 --> 00:40:46,543
I just can't stop.

666
00:40:47,754 --> 00:40:48,754
If I stop

667
00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:51,778
it'll feel like my mouth will tear.

668
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,925
(AS IF YOUR LAST BOTTLE)

669
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:06,521
Ouch that hurts.

670
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,936
Drinking alone?

671
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,678
Thanks for not helping at all.

672
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:27,121
Why should I help?

673
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:30,092
Forget it.

674
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:34,045
Anyway, what brings you here?

675
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:36,147
I want some fried chicken.

676
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:38,053
Why are you sitting here?

677
00:41:40,472 --> 00:41:42,389
- Should I move?
- No don't.

678
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:43,414
Please sit.

679
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,458
I was just feeling bored.

680
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:50,398
Please eat.

681
00:42:01,504 --> 00:42:02,504
Say

682
00:42:04,284 --> 00:42:05,930
did you want some chicken because you saw me come in here?

683
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:11,038
But it doesn't matter.

684
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:23,675
I eat a lot huh?

685
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:28,941
I...

686
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:31,816
Live to eat, be it food or liquor.

687
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:36,441
I'm just indulging myself.

688
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:38,995
Eating delicious food and

689
00:42:39,993 --> 00:42:41,578
borrowing some energy from alcohol,

690
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:42,627
and chatting with friends

691
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:46,941
can alleviate exhaustion.

692
00:42:48,884 --> 00:42:50,751
That's happiness for me.

693
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:57,454
I'll sign the contract.

694
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:05,087
Come again?

695
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:00,013
Hello I'm chief deputy Kim Yeon-ah.

696
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:01,865
Hello I'm Park Kihoon.

697
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:03,514
I've heard a lot about you.

698
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:05,380
Thank you for signing the contract.

699
00:44:05,405 --> 00:44:06,826
Thank you for your support.

700
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:10,959
What the...

701
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:12,638
He's so handsome.

702
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,053
Isn't he handsome?

703
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,310
Please take a seat.

704
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,201
- Give him the documents.
- Yes.

705
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,881
Here's the contract.

706
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,060
And this is the cooking area.

707
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:46,591
The facilities are not bad at all.

708
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:49,482
Yes. Sometimes I cook and eat here.

709
00:44:50,141 --> 00:44:51,162
But

710
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:53,048
the structure here is different

711
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:54,374
from your kitchen.

712
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:55,930
So it might seem unfamiliar.

713
00:44:56,162 --> 00:44:57,357
But rest assured there are no

714
00:44:57,373 --> 00:44:58,490
other problems.

715
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:01,849
Oh and this is what you requested.

716
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:03,209
Here are the clams.

717
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:05,225
Thank you.

718
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:06,444
Excuse me then.

719
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,608
Where are you going?

720
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:10,677
Yes?

721
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,380
I'm off to work.

722
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:16,286
I have to be here all alone?

723
00:45:17,107 --> 00:45:18,107
Yes.

724
00:45:20,673 --> 00:45:21,735
I'll take my leave.

725
00:45:22,274 --> 00:45:23,656
Yes deputy chief.

726
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,516
I need Mr. Han Jiyu.

727
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:29,992
Excuse me?

728
00:45:30,704 --> 00:45:31,969
What do you mean?

729
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:33,890
It's not easy to come up

730
00:45:33,915 --> 00:45:35,015
with a dish alone.

731
00:45:35,985 --> 00:45:37,547
I'd like to proceed with Mr. Han Jiyu,

732
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:38,711
who is in charge here

733
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:40,930
to help me create with a new dish.

734
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,360
Oh.

735
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,610
If that's the case

736
00:45:44,643 --> 00:45:45,947
I'll find someone more professional

737
00:45:45,963 --> 00:45:47,533
from another department for you.

738
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,274
Creating a new dish

739
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:53,828
isn't a job suited for Mr. Jiyu.

740
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:55,421
He's perfectly suitable.

741
00:45:56,431 --> 00:45:58,195
The Hah Jiyu that I know

742
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,961
is more knowledgeable about food

743
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:01,523
than he looks.

744
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,336
- And...
- It's true though.

745
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:05,164
Mr. Jiyu is very knowledgeable

746
00:46:05,188 --> 00:46:06,188
about food.

747
00:46:06,476 --> 00:46:07,476
Is that right?

748
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:10,523
Alright.

749
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:12,276
Chief deputy Kim

750
00:46:12,546 --> 00:46:13,796
are you okay with Mr. Jiyu

751
00:46:13,819 --> 00:46:14,803
working on that?

752
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:17,359
Supporting menu development

753
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:18,844
alongside his current duties

754
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:20,000
should be manageable.

755
00:46:20,698 --> 00:46:21,698
Is that so?

756
00:46:23,173 --> 00:46:25,937
Very well let's go with that then.

757
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:29,921
- Yes.
- Please take care of Mr. Jiyu.

758
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:33,078
What Chief? I'm not a kid you know.

759
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:35,335
He's not perfect but

760
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,532
I'll make use of him.

761
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:39,641
He's lacking a lot

762
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:41,666
so I hope you'll be prepared.

763
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:50,875
Use me?

764
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,187
Am I just some object?

765
00:46:54,649 --> 00:46:57,295
- That's not what I meant...
- Forget it.

766
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
Let's get to work.

767
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:12,921
There's a menu that requires clams.

768
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,882
Shall we try cooking it first?

769
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:17,984
Yes.

770
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:26,167
Are you alright?

771
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:28,898
I'm fine.

772
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:36,655
I'm alright but your shirt...

773
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:40,632
I'm very sorry. I'm so clumsy.

774
00:47:42,524 --> 00:47:44,698
It's okay as long as you're uninjured.

775
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:47,468
It will dry off soon.

776
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:54,859
But it looks like

777
00:47:56,695 --> 00:47:58,976
I'm not the only one who's wet.

778
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:03,523
Oh right.

779
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:04,936
That's true.

780
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:09,702
It's like

781
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:12,695
a scene in a drama

782
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:14,205
don't you agree?

783
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:33,152
Let's get this sorted out quickly.

784
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:34,472
Oh right.

785
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:45,144
Let me see.

786
00:50:26,278 --> 00:50:27,278
Hey

787
00:50:30,901 --> 00:50:32,534
knowing the taste of soju

788
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:35,026
is helpful in developing a dish right?

789
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:41,331
No, you don't have to drink now.

790
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,667
Alright.

791
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:49,463
I'll try it when I'm ready.

792
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:52,925
Alright.

793
00:50:54,112 --> 00:50:55,924
Let's take it slow shall we?

794
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:05,799
Let's do it tonight.

795
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:26,344
Chef.

796
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:27,714
You're here.

797
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,253
Wow.

798
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:32,604
What's this?

799
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:34,714
This is amazing.

800
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,729
It's beautiful here.

801
00:51:36,754 --> 00:51:37,814
It's the best place

802
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,706
to have a late-night snack.

803
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,799
Come on it's ready.

804
00:51:43,573 --> 00:51:44,714
Wow! Okay.

805
00:51:49,384 --> 00:51:51,071
Can I sit next to you?

806
00:51:52,314 --> 00:51:53,658
- Sure.
- Thank you.

807
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,081
Are you alright?

808
00:52:06,642 --> 00:52:07,642
Yes.

809
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:10,173
It's been a while since I drank...

810
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:13,728
It's just a little bit of tasting.

811
00:52:14,603 --> 00:52:17,220
We need to taste it to develop a dish.

812
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:19,869
Right.

813
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:26,947
Is this your first time?

814
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:29,931
No it's not my first time.

815
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:10,886
How is it?

816
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:18,595
It's good.

817
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:22,286
What a relief.

818
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,321
Chef.

819
00:53:44,494 --> 00:53:46,032
Only one glass?

820
00:53:46,986 --> 00:53:47,986
Chef.

821
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:51,177
Chef.

822
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:53,525
You can't sleep here Chef.

823
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,550
Chef.

824
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,228
Oh no.

825
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,192
(Chef)

826
00:55:32,434 --> 00:55:33,731
Hello.

827
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,754
Are you still sleeping?

828
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:38,231
Oh yes.

829
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:40,645
Wake up wash up and get ready.

830
00:55:41,028 --> 00:55:42,934
- There's no time.
- Come again?

831
00:55:46,841 --> 00:55:48,160
Isn't today a day off?

832
00:55:49,114 --> 00:55:51,347
There's a place I want to bring you to.

833
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:52,372
Where?

834
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:35,301
(Keumgang Restaurant)

835
00:56:45,522 --> 00:56:46,950
Want to grab something first?

836
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:48,498
Sounds good to me.

837
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,810
Wow.

838
00:56:57,244 --> 00:57:00,478
So many customers in the morning?

839
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:02,650
They say this place is a favorite

840
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,165
among the Gunsan locals.

841
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:05,708
There may be other delicious

842
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:07,133
places favored by tourists

843
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:08,345
but nothing beats

844
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:09,806
authentic local flavor.

845
00:57:09,932 --> 00:57:10,932
Yeah.

846
00:57:12,123 --> 00:57:14,314
Is this a full course meal restaurant?

847
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:15,799
Yes.

848
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:16,830
You can call it a

849
00:57:16,846 --> 00:57:18,760
seasonal full course meal restaurant.

850
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:21,290
Just hearing that

851
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:22,979
makes my heart flutter.

852
00:57:31,588 --> 00:57:33,548
Looks delicious.

853
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,470
Spoon and chopsticks.

854
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:40,127
Here's your spoon.

855
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
Thank you.

856
00:58:02,401 --> 00:58:03,534
All done.

857
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:05,752
- Please eat.
- Yes.

858
00:58:06,378 --> 00:58:08,041
I'm digging in.

859
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:38,467
Auntie.

860
00:58:38,873 --> 00:58:40,373
A bottle of soju, please.

861
00:58:41,272 --> 00:58:43,568
One glass of soju please.

862
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:48,396
Wow, thank you.

863
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,964
Please drink moderately.

864
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:01,698
Can you fill my glass for me?

865
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:17,301
Shall we sit here?

866
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:18,434
Sure.

867
00:59:36,279 --> 00:59:39,872
By the way do you also use social media?

868
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,310
No.

869
00:59:42,877 --> 00:59:43,877
Is that so?

870
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,052
I think it's the first time

871
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,693
I've seen you taking pictures.

872
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:50,986
It's good for studying and

873
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,732
helps with remembering too.

874
00:59:52,943 --> 00:59:55,427
Oh, Chef!

875
00:59:55,716 --> 00:59:56,787
You're pretty cool.

876
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:03,052
How was the meal today?

877
01:00:05,764 --> 01:00:06,935
Everything

878
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:09,513
was absolutely delicious.

879
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,411
I can already tell.

880
01:00:16,372 --> 01:00:17,841
How did you know Chef?

881
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:21,145
Only one bite

882
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:22,957
and you immediately ordered soju.

883
01:00:25,607 --> 01:00:26,669
I mean...

884
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:28,258
You're the one who ordered it.

885
01:00:28,283 --> 01:00:29,703
It'd be such a waste

886
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:32,138
so I had no choice but to drink.

887
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,068
That's right.

888
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:37,099
If I hadn't stopped you

889
01:00:37,123 --> 01:00:38,989
would you still be drinking by now?

890
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:41,200
No way. I wouldn't.

891
01:00:44,115 --> 01:00:45,825
Do you like drinking that much?

892
01:00:46,406 --> 01:00:47,927
I said no.

893
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:50,449
Seriously no.

894
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,200
This is my first time here.

895
01:00:57,211 --> 01:00:58,211
Let's go.

896
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,624
(Fish market)

897
01:01:53,302 --> 01:01:55,216
What they sell here is really fresh.

898
01:01:55,263 --> 01:01:56,263
Yeah.

899
01:01:57,724 --> 01:01:58,724
Sigh...

900
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:00,639
Let's go.

901
01:03:04,976 --> 01:03:06,564
You should've woken me up.

902
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:12,655
I'm organizing my thoughts.

903
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:15,929
What's wrong?

904
01:03:18,054 --> 01:03:20,710
Are you still uncomfortable to work with me?

905
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,382
No.

906
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,419
I think I can finally forget everything

907
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:30,132
and start fresh.

908
01:03:34,246 --> 01:03:35,808
I'll change from now.

909
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:38,981
Good.

910
01:03:42,801 --> 01:03:44,496
I really like this place.

911
01:03:58,102 --> 01:04:00,008
It's like I can set my heart free here.

912
01:04:00,321 --> 01:04:01,321
Isn't it nice?

913
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:04,172
I wish time would stop...

914
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:07,508
Why stop time?

915
01:04:07,533 --> 01:04:09,649
Our time is waiting.

916
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:11,735
I beg your pardon?

917
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:14,031
Nothing. Let's go.

918
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:02,575
Please go and have a rest.

919
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:04,559
Yes.

920
01:05:04,856 --> 01:05:06,301
Thank you for the ride.

921
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:08,347
You've worked hard.

922
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:10,169
I didn't work hard.

923
01:05:10,537 --> 01:05:12,021
You're the one who worked hard Chef.

924
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,059
Besides I had fun.

925
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:17,834
Me too.

926
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:20,661
Please go inside now.

927
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:23,833
Alright.

928
01:05:25,662 --> 01:05:27,716
Then please drive carefully.

929
01:05:28,896 --> 01:05:29,896
Alright.

930
01:05:52,837 --> 01:05:53,837
Why

931
01:05:54,939 --> 01:05:56,384
aren't you leaving yet?

932
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,900
I'm leaving.

933
01:05:59,837 --> 01:06:00,837
Chef.

934
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:09,111
You see...

935
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:11,314
Let's

936
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:14,040
have ramyeon together?

937
01:06:16,088 --> 01:06:17,088
No.

938
01:06:17,279 --> 01:06:18,279
I don't want to.

939
01:06:32,616 --> 01:06:34,709
Please eat a lot. I have rice too.

940
01:06:35,654 --> 01:06:36,693
No...

941
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,389
rice, thanks.

942
01:06:39,272 --> 01:06:40,701
How does the ramyeon taste?

943
01:06:41,357 --> 01:06:42,357
Is it good?

944
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:44,545
At a time like this

945
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:46,920
it's right to eat ramyeon.

946
01:06:48,209 --> 01:06:49,209
Right.

947
01:06:58,077 --> 01:06:59,077
What's the matter?

948
01:07:01,826 --> 01:07:03,068
Nothing.

949
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:09,068
I think it's time

950
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:12,951
for you to go home.

951
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:15,061
It's already so late.

952
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:17,350
Oh...

953
01:07:18,256 --> 01:07:19,256
I should leave?

954
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:20,810
Yes.

955
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:23,607
You're not leaving?

956
01:07:24,404 --> 01:07:25,881
No.

957
01:07:32,928 --> 01:07:34,099
Take care on your way home.

958
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:36,123
Yeah.

959
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:37,951
The ramyeon was great.

960
01:07:39,092 --> 01:07:41,660
It tasted better when we ate together.

961
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:43,426
Yeah.

962
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,092
It seems like

963
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:48,724
we get along pretty well.

964
01:07:50,873 --> 01:07:51,873
Hey.

965
01:07:53,342 --> 01:07:55,053
Can I call you brother?

966
01:07:56,037 --> 01:07:57,078
Come again?

967
01:07:57,347 --> 01:07:58,373
Aren't we already

968
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,185
close with each other?

969
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,033
Is that okay with you?

970
01:08:04,586 --> 01:08:05,787
Do whatever you want.

971
01:08:06,036 --> 01:08:07,154
I'll take my leave.

972
01:08:07,905 --> 01:08:08,905
Right.

973
01:08:18,522 --> 01:08:19,522
Us?

974
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:43,455
(Han Jiyu)

975
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:51,249
(Tomorrow should we...)

976
01:09:15,557 --> 01:09:21,290
(Did you get back safe and sound?)

977
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:41,788
(Park Kihoon)

978
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:42,930
Mr. Jiyu.

979
01:10:43,074 --> 01:10:44,074
Yes?

980
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:47,892
Brother.

981
01:10:48,087 --> 01:10:49,646
Why still call me Mr. Jiyu?

982
01:10:50,865 --> 01:10:51,865
Oh...

983
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:52,998
So what is it?

984
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:54,858
I was going to say

985
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:57,045
the dish is now complete.

986
01:10:57,943 --> 01:10:58,943
Oh.

987
01:11:25,402 --> 01:11:26,542
What do you think?

988
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,411
Delicious.

989
01:11:31,046 --> 01:11:32,632
It's a new and refreshing taste.

990
01:11:34,161 --> 01:11:35,161
But...

991
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:37,212
But?

992
01:11:39,014 --> 01:11:41,413
I don't know how to explain it but...

993
01:11:42,148 --> 01:11:43,148
Umm...

994
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,265
It feels like it's lacking something.

995
01:11:46,725 --> 01:11:49,030
Lacking where?

996
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,429
No rather than saying it's lacking

997
01:11:54,036 --> 01:11:57,145
it would be better to add something.

998
01:12:01,412 --> 01:12:02,412
Brother!

999
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:03,816
It's still great.

1000
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:06,528
You have nothing to regret.

1001
01:12:06,848 --> 01:12:08,238
Shall we call other people

1002
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:09,404
later as well?

1003
01:12:09,428 --> 01:12:10,443
Get some opinions by

1004
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,403
having them taste it.

1005
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:12,427
Okay.

1006
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,520
I'll try contacting Wan.

1007
01:12:14,545 --> 01:12:15,545
Yeah.

1008
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:17,512
Next dish.

1009
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,895
- You're here, Wan.
- It's been a while, Brother.

1010
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
You're here.

1011
01:12:31,821 --> 01:12:34,126
- Hello.
- Hello.

1012
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,633
Did you guys come together?

1013
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:39,249
- I'm Choi Wan.
- I'm Kim Yeon-ah.

1014
01:12:39,283 --> 01:12:41,837
- I'm Park Jiha.
- Nice to meet you.

1015
01:12:42,118 --> 01:12:43,727
I'm not that close to him.

1016
01:12:45,568 --> 01:12:46,570
What are you saying?

1017
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,001
Hey what are you doing?

1018
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:50,837
Why?

1019
01:12:52,384 --> 01:12:53,384
Brother.

1020
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:54,737
Oh.

1021
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:56,189
What's the matter?

1022
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:57,524
What should I do?

1023
01:12:57,775 --> 01:13:00,149
Jiyu already helped out.

1024
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:02,287
So you can just sit.

1025
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:17,394
Umm...

1026
01:13:20,043 --> 01:13:21,206
Everything's tasty.

1027
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:22,331
Very delicious.

1028
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,074
It's...

1029
01:13:25,722 --> 01:13:27,175
Not bad at all.

1030
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,339
It's good.

1031
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,027
Adding dried distillers grains

1032
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,035
to the food

1033
01:13:35,252 --> 01:13:36,814
goes really well with the alcohol and

1034
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:37,991
complements its flavor.

1035
01:13:38,015 --> 01:13:39,394
Excellent idea.

1036
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,419
But

1037
01:13:40,444 --> 01:13:42,449
won't you feel irritated

1038
01:13:42,474 --> 01:13:43,697
removing the fish bones

1039
01:13:43,722 --> 01:13:45,612
when eating a full course meal

1040
01:13:45,637 --> 01:13:46,637
like this?

1041
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:53,777
Thank you.

1042
01:13:55,652 --> 01:13:57,324
It is a little annoying.

1043
01:13:59,387 --> 01:14:00,995
That was great.

1044
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,010
Be careful.

1045
01:14:03,263 --> 01:14:05,495
Let's eat more and

1046
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,902
let's all have fun.

1047
01:14:09,058 --> 01:14:10,995
Thank you everyone for coming.

1048
01:14:11,074 --> 01:14:12,511
Take care on your way home.

1049
01:14:13,176 --> 01:14:14,636
Let's keep the fun going.

1050
01:14:14,839 --> 01:14:15,995
Come on.

1051
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:17,332
Hey Park Jiha.

1052
01:14:18,222 --> 01:14:19,339
Hurry up and go home.

1053
01:14:19,928 --> 01:14:21,706
What the heck are you saying?

1054
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,699
Nice meeting you all today.

1055
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:25,074
Let's meet again.

1056
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:26,480
Excuse me then.

1057
01:14:27,035 --> 01:14:28,613
- Goodbye.
- Hey Wan.

1058
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:30,456
- Please see off the deputy chief.
- Sure.

1059
01:14:30,481 --> 01:14:31,972
- I'll see you off.
- Alright.

1060
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:33,777
- Bye.
- Hey Park Jiha.

1061
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:34,802
Go home already.

1062
01:14:35,518 --> 01:14:37,002
I mentioned feeling upset lately

1063
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,010
remember?

1064
01:14:38,222 --> 01:14:40,988
- I know. Let's talk about it later.
- I won't hang out with you.

1065
01:14:42,613 --> 01:14:44,316
I'm coming too!

1066
01:14:44,691 --> 01:14:45,691
Hurry up.

1067
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:48,113
Wait for the fattie.

1068
01:14:49,004 --> 01:14:50,004
Sigh.

1069
01:14:50,029 --> 01:14:51,511
You should get going too.

1070
01:14:52,058 --> 01:14:53,316
I'll clean up the shop.

1071
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:55,550
No way let's tidy up together.

1072
01:14:55,561 --> 01:14:57,519
- Let's help each other.
- No need.

1073
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,800
Go home.

1074
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:01,972
Fine.

1075
01:15:07,651 --> 01:15:08,651
Brother.

1076
01:15:12,016 --> 01:15:13,425
Everything will be fine.

1077
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:14,450
So...

1078
01:15:14,855 --> 01:15:16,449
please don't worry about it.

1079
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:20,144
Alright.

1080
01:15:20,417 --> 01:15:22,355
A bit more effort should be okay.

1081
01:15:24,027 --> 01:15:25,027
Keep fighting.

1082
01:15:25,853 --> 01:15:26,853
Keep fighting.

1083
01:15:28,527 --> 01:15:30,253
I'll be leaving then.

1084
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:35,035
I'll leave now.

1085
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,190
Alright.

1086
01:15:40,527 --> 01:15:41,675
Han Jiyu.

1087
01:15:47,808 --> 01:15:48,808
Yes?

1088
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:00,912
Why?

1089
01:16:02,311 --> 01:16:03,537
Regretting something?

1090
01:16:26,255 --> 01:16:27,622
Pouring.

1091
01:16:34,201 --> 01:16:35,201
Brother.

1092
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:40,145
I'll have one glass.

1093
01:16:42,716 --> 01:16:44,130
Are you sure?

1094
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,130
Yes.

1095
01:16:48,162 --> 01:16:49,904
Thanks for your hard work today.

1096
01:16:51,246 --> 01:16:53,151
Not at all. I didn't do anything.

1097
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:54,411
It's all thanks to you.

1098
01:17:10,596 --> 01:17:11,596
How nice.

1099
01:17:14,328 --> 01:17:15,328
What's nice?

1100
01:17:18,323 --> 01:17:19,323
Nothing.

1101
01:17:20,657 --> 01:17:21,657
What is it?

1102
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:23,830
You're always vague.

1103
01:17:28,838 --> 01:17:29,838
That's right.

1104
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,783
You're all red again.

1105
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:40,810
Again?

1106
01:17:43,213 --> 01:17:44,658
It's always like that.

1107
01:17:46,682 --> 01:17:48,307
What? You only had one glass of beer

1108
01:17:48,315 --> 01:17:49,346
and you're all red?

1109
01:17:52,385 --> 01:17:53,385
That's right.

1110
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,900
Cheers.

1111
01:18:04,787 --> 01:18:05,787
Mr. Jiyu!

1112
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:07,810
A moment please.

1113
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:08,959
Alright.

1114
01:18:12,092 --> 01:18:13,097
What's the matter?

1115
01:18:14,255 --> 01:18:15,990
How is Mr. Kihoon these days?

1116
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:21,171
He seems fine.

1117
01:18:21,812 --> 01:18:23,820
Listen to me carefully.

1118
01:18:25,716 --> 01:18:27,184
It looks like the chief wants

1119
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:28,662
to have Mr. Kihoon featured

1120
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:29,842
on a cooking show.

1121
01:18:29,866 --> 01:18:30,866
What?

1122
01:18:40,364 --> 01:18:42,247
- Please keep your voice down.
- Yes.

1123
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,502
What's the matter?

1124
01:18:54,487 --> 01:18:56,072
The thing is...

1125
01:18:59,619 --> 01:19:01,174
The chief mentioned that

1126
01:19:03,362 --> 01:19:06,096
during the launch event they want you to

1127
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:07,627
go cook on stage.

1128
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:13,457
No way.

1129
01:19:13,924 --> 01:19:16,151
Brother why...

1130
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:34,418
Just now

1131
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,153
he didn't answer my call

1132
01:19:36,178 --> 01:19:37,873
and hasn't replied to my texts.

1133
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,394
What should we do?

1134
01:19:41,715 --> 01:19:43,199
Should we go to his house?

1135
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:45,989
Let's not.

1136
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:49,621
Let's give him some time.

1137
01:19:50,551 --> 01:19:51,793
Still...

1138
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,933
I don't know anymore.

1139
01:20:43,431 --> 01:20:46,024
(Are you upset with me?)

1140
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:58,742
(Are you upset with me?/I'm really sorry about today./
Let me buy you a coffee./Let's go drink./I'm hungry.)

1141
01:22:27,065 --> 01:22:28,065
Brother?

1142
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,016
You said you were hungry.

1143
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:32,477
Even so

1144
01:22:32,502 --> 01:22:34,307
at a time like this?

1145
01:22:36,509 --> 01:22:38,274
Have you ever heard of

1146
01:22:39,485 --> 01:22:40,485
stage fright?

1147
01:22:43,462 --> 01:22:44,462
Of course.

1148
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,382
When you're standing

1149
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:49,455
in front of many people

1150
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:51,055
and your vision becomes blurry.

1151
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,367
I definitely have that.

1152
01:22:55,126 --> 01:22:56,804
My visions becomes blurry

1153
01:22:57,516 --> 01:22:59,813
and I can't see clearly.

1154
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,566
In that situation

1155
01:23:05,671 --> 01:23:06,886
I can't utter a word.

1156
01:23:09,871 --> 01:23:11,160
I see.

1157
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:16,246
I wasn't aware.

1158
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:21,839
I'm sorry.

1159
01:23:27,027 --> 01:23:28,363
Why are you laughing?

1160
01:23:28,821 --> 01:23:29,964
Is it funny?

1161
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:33,885
When you're in front of me

1162
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,285
you tend to talk a lot.

1163
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:43,322
When your vision is becoming blurry

1164
01:23:43,339 --> 01:23:45,096
try to focus on pleasant thoughts.

1165
01:23:45,574 --> 01:23:47,675
- Pleasant thoughts?
- Yes.

1166
01:23:48,785 --> 01:23:50,597
That should help.

1167
01:23:50,769 --> 01:23:53,394
No one is as strong-willed as you are.

1168
01:23:53,934 --> 01:23:55,817
The courage to turn away customers

1169
01:23:55,842 --> 01:23:57,237
for refusing to sell alcohol

1170
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:59,997
and the courage to admit your mistakes

1171
01:24:00,022 --> 01:24:01,794
when you're in the wrong.

1172
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:03,472
Please make use of this courage.

1173
01:24:04,051 --> 01:24:05,722
What kind of courage is that?

1174
01:24:06,738 --> 01:24:09,847
Admitting something isn't easy at all.

1175
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:11,058
After all we care about

1176
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:12,148
how others view us.

1177
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:13,261
Also it takes courage

1178
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:14,402
to be direct like this.

1179
01:24:14,977 --> 01:24:15,977
Well?

1180
01:24:16,713 --> 01:24:17,963
If you put it that way,

1181
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:19,041
I'll give it a go.

1182
01:24:21,624 --> 01:24:22,624
Then...

1183
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:25,984
Shall we be a little more courageous?

1184
01:24:29,282 --> 01:24:31,485
You asked me why.

1185
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,524
I don't selling alcohol.

1186
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:37,246
Are you going to let me know?

1187
01:24:38,138 --> 01:24:39,286
Do you remember?

1188
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:41,646
The tteokbokki shop

1189
01:24:41,671 --> 01:24:43,604
that you were trying to find,

1190
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:45,497
my grandmother opened

1191
01:24:45,505 --> 01:24:46,770
the shop to raise me.

1192
01:24:47,826 --> 01:24:49,341
She had a hard time raising

1193
01:24:49,365 --> 01:24:50,642
her grandson alone

1194
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:52,427
so she drank every day.

1195
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,027
I hated it.

1196
01:24:55,052 --> 01:24:56,935
It made me feel like I was the cause.

1197
01:24:57,691 --> 01:24:58,705
The night before

1198
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,254
the university entrance ceremony

1199
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:02,074
she drank alone again.

1200
01:25:02,591 --> 01:25:04,574
At that time I believed that the alcohol

1201
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,285
was the cause for my loneliness.

1202
01:25:07,169 --> 01:25:08,630
Looking back

1203
01:25:09,014 --> 01:25:10,607
perhaps she was trying to

1204
01:25:10,623 --> 01:25:11,929
congratulate herself

1205
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:14,249
for raising her grandson safely.

1206
01:25:15,553 --> 01:25:17,303
Perhaps she was consoling herself

1207
01:25:17,328 --> 01:25:18,608
for enduring hardships.

1208
01:25:22,443 --> 01:25:24,435
I said something heavy, didn't I?

1209
01:25:25,318 --> 01:25:26,318
No.

1210
01:25:29,945 --> 01:25:31,570
I was surprised

1211
01:25:32,285 --> 01:25:33,625
that you said it so easily.

1212
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:36,979
Is that so?

1213
01:25:39,613 --> 01:25:41,688
It was very difficult.

1214
01:25:43,462 --> 01:25:44,462
Anyway

1215
01:25:47,259 --> 01:25:49,670
there are only pleasant times ahead

1216
01:25:52,983 --> 01:25:54,506
so let's do our best together.

1217
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:58,490
Sure.

1218
01:26:00,343 --> 01:26:01,574
Now that.

1219
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:04,879
I'm by your side

1220
01:26:04,904 --> 01:26:06,402
you don't feel lonely right?

1221
01:26:10,241 --> 01:26:11,342
Who knows.

1222
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:15,147
Brother seriously.

1223
01:26:17,132 --> 01:26:18,709
Can't you tell me honestly?

1224
01:26:30,988 --> 01:26:33,136
It's been a while since I last worked.

1225
01:26:33,161 --> 01:26:34,281
I'm so tired.

1226
01:26:35,171 --> 01:26:36,546
Why are you out here?

1227
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,091
I told you to rest.

1228
01:26:39,254 --> 01:26:40,285
I need to prepare myself

1229
01:26:40,293 --> 01:26:42,231
since I haven't worked for a while.

1230
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:44,319
Now that I'm here, I can help you.

1231
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:46,139
And it's the weekend

1232
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:47,749
we had a lot of customers today!

1233
01:26:48,476 --> 01:26:51,139
Yes there were a lot of customers today.

1234
01:26:51,755 --> 01:26:53,069
Time went by in a flash.

1235
01:26:53,094 --> 01:26:54,359
Shop hours fly by when

1236
01:26:54,384 --> 01:26:55,859
there are many customers.

1237
01:26:56,522 --> 01:26:57,522
Brother

1238
01:26:57,725 --> 01:26:59,530
today is your last day right?

1239
01:26:59,671 --> 01:27:00,671
Yes.

1240
01:27:00,856 --> 01:27:01,983
Drink this.

1241
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:03,983
You must be tired from work.

1242
01:27:09,889 --> 01:27:11,973
Brother Jiyu said today is his last day.

1243
01:27:11,998 --> 01:27:13,707
We can't end it like this.

1244
01:27:17,325 --> 01:27:18,668
What do you want to eat?

1245
01:27:18,738 --> 01:27:19,738
Nice!

1246
01:27:19,842 --> 01:27:21,777
Let's eat expensive food.

1247
01:27:23,942 --> 01:27:25,246
Yes my treat.

1248
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,473
Eat whatever you want.

1249
01:27:27,855 --> 01:27:29,003
Alright!

1250
01:27:29,028 --> 01:27:31,027
What do you want to eat Brother?

1251
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:32,052
Beef?

1252
01:27:32,806 --> 01:27:33,806
Or sashimi?

1253
01:27:38,973 --> 01:27:40,062
Pork belly?

1254
01:27:42,769 --> 01:27:43,769
What's this?

1255
01:27:43,919 --> 01:27:46,231
I wanted beef more.

1256
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:48,728
It looks delicious here.

1257
01:27:49,246 --> 01:27:51,822
How can pork ever be better than beef?

1258
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:54,291
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

1259
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:55,627
Hello.

1260
01:27:55,652 --> 01:27:57,533
Wow he really is handsome.

1261
01:27:59,002 --> 01:28:00,306
Hey, Han Jiyu,

1262
01:28:00,331 --> 01:28:01,924
are you going to expose this place?

1263
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,703
If it's here...

1264
01:28:04,728 --> 01:28:07,453
I don't easily tell others about here.

1265
01:28:07,478 --> 01:28:08,773
Wow really?

1266
01:28:12,726 --> 01:28:14,116
Please allow me to grill.

1267
01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:16,053
I can do it.

1268
01:28:30,842 --> 01:28:32,538
Let me pour you a drink.

1269
01:28:32,563 --> 01:28:33,686
Thank you.

1270
01:28:42,164 --> 01:28:44,258
You two worked really hard.

1271
01:28:44,267 --> 01:28:45,445
Don't hold back.

1272
01:28:45,563 --> 01:28:47,227
Let's raise our glasses for a toast!

1273
01:28:47,563 --> 01:28:50,086
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1274
01:29:04,905 --> 01:29:06,100
- Delicious!
- Delicious!

1275
01:29:07,274 --> 01:29:09,334
Now I understand why you chose here.

1276
01:29:10,022 --> 01:29:12,560
- Pork belly is the best!
- Pork belly is the best!

1277
01:29:12,819 --> 01:29:14,100
What was that?

1278
01:29:14,818 --> 01:29:17,717
After eating some kimchi with pork belly

1279
01:29:18,691 --> 01:29:19,818
and then some garlic

1280
01:29:20,148 --> 01:29:21,818
you wait a little while

1281
01:29:21,843 --> 01:29:24,123
and then wash away the grease

1282
01:29:24,147 --> 01:29:26,280
with a refreshing shot of soju.

1283
01:29:26,289 --> 01:29:27,507
After the bitter taste of

1284
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:28,529
the soju fades away

1285
01:29:28,553 --> 01:29:29,709
you take another bite

1286
01:29:29,734 --> 01:29:31,107
and the cycle repeats.

1287
01:29:32,248 --> 01:29:33,849
I think the most delicious thing

1288
01:29:33,873 --> 01:29:35,248
in the world is pork belly.

1289
01:29:35,273 --> 01:29:37,092
The pork belly that is eaten together.

1290
01:29:38,817 --> 01:29:39,967
It's amazing.

1291
01:29:39,992 --> 01:29:41,226
You gourmet passion

1292
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,827
is quite philosophical.

1293
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:44,357
I respect you.

1294
01:29:44,828 --> 01:29:46,326
It's nothing like that.

1295
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,326
You're exaggerating.

1296
01:29:51,287 --> 01:29:52,600
- Mr. Jiyu.
- Oh, yes.

1297
01:29:53,858 --> 01:29:54,858
Mr. Kihoon.

1298
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:02,381
I'll pour for you.

1299
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,191
Thank you.

1300
01:30:05,176 --> 01:30:07,745
You two look great together.

1301
01:30:08,651 --> 01:30:10,175
What are you saying?

1302
01:30:10,783 --> 01:30:11,965
Let's raise our glasses.

1303
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:14,433
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1304
01:30:17,206 --> 01:30:18,519
That was great.

1305
01:30:19,316 --> 01:30:20,425
Chief deputy when was the

1306
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,691
last time you went on a date?

1307
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:23,136
- Me?
- I'm curious.

1308
01:30:23,629 --> 01:30:24,629
I...

1309
01:30:25,168 --> 01:30:27,222
It's a secret.

1310
01:30:27,371 --> 01:30:30,066
Then what do you think love is?

1311
01:30:30,386 --> 01:30:31,698
As for me.

1312
01:30:32,581 --> 01:30:33,879
I already broke up!

1313
01:30:35,285 --> 01:30:37,933
- Oh no.
- When did you break up?

1314
01:30:38,644 --> 01:30:39,808
That jerk.

1315
01:30:40,751 --> 01:30:42,245
Absolutely selfish.

1316
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,620
- The worst.
- Really?

1317
01:30:43,645 --> 01:30:46,620
He's a douche and selfish.

1318
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:57,231
There's no one on the street.

1319
01:30:57,724 --> 01:30:58,918
You're right.

1320
01:31:00,098 --> 01:31:01,488
Time flies.

1321
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,309
It's tomorrow isn't?

1322
01:31:09,559 --> 01:31:11,024
Are you nervous?

1323
01:31:13,309 --> 01:31:15,902
I would be lying if I said no.

1324
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,884
But I feel better when

1325
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,134
I think good thoughts.

1326
01:31:22,923 --> 01:31:25,861
I wonder what you're thinking about.

1327
01:31:29,337 --> 01:31:30,798
Do you want me to tell you?

1328
01:31:31,548 --> 01:31:32,962
That's alright.

1329
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:34,181
Thank goodness.

1330
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:37,967
Let's go inside.

1331
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:46,881
I...

1332
01:31:48,038 --> 01:31:49,038
What's going on?

1333
01:31:49,063 --> 01:31:50,295
If...

1334
01:31:50,445 --> 01:31:52,326
- you want to continue hanging...
- Forget it.

1335
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:01,358
Oh over there.

1336
01:32:02,134 --> 01:32:03,142
Hello.

1337
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:04,167
Jiyu hi hi.

1338
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,138
You're here.

1339
01:32:07,998 --> 01:32:09,623
I called him over to cheer for you.

1340
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:11,467
Chef.

1341
01:32:11,897 --> 01:32:13,959
You are so cool.

1342
01:32:14,389 --> 01:32:15,490
You're already cool

1343
01:32:15,515 --> 01:32:16,701
even before starting.

1344
01:32:18,108 --> 01:32:19,686
It's not that big of a deal.

1345
01:32:21,256 --> 01:32:22,256
Are you nervous?

1346
01:32:22,592 --> 01:32:23,873
Your face is all red.

1347
01:32:24,764 --> 01:32:25,764
Really?

1348
01:32:26,022 --> 01:32:27,942
There's no need to be nervous.

1349
01:32:27,967 --> 01:32:30,248
What are you nervous about?

1350
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:32,100
Planning to do something really awesome?

1351
01:32:32,686 --> 01:32:34,225
Just like we practiced.

1352
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,522
Don't be nervous.

1353
01:32:35,772 --> 01:32:37,436
No need to be nervous.

1354
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,592
Alright. The event is starting now.

1355
01:32:42,982 --> 01:32:44,325
I'd like to thank all of you

1356
01:32:44,341 --> 01:32:46,054
who came to the launch event for

1357
01:32:46,078 --> 01:32:47,374
Baeksundang's new product

1358
01:32:47,383 --> 01:32:48,382
'Gidalim' today.

1359
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:51,163
I would like to introduce Park Kihoon,

1360
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:52,547
who'll be cooking today

1361
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:53,538
as a collaboration.

1362
01:32:53,562 --> 01:32:55,154
Let's give a round of applause.

1363
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:58,818
(Baeksundang's launch event
for our new product 'Gidalim')

1364
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,039
What should we do? He seems stunned.

1365
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,429
What should we do?

1366
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:18,969
Brother.

1367
01:33:20,592 --> 01:33:22,428
When your vision gets blurry

1368
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:23,936
try to focus on pleasant thoughts.

1369
01:33:24,503 --> 01:33:25,714
Pleasant thoughts.

1370
01:33:25,951 --> 01:33:26,951
Yes.

1371
01:33:27,853 --> 01:33:29,557
That should help.

1372
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,050
Pleasant thoughts...

1373
01:33:31,557 --> 01:33:32,807
Good people...

1374
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,215
Pleasant thoughts.

1375
01:33:48,075 --> 01:33:49,699
I'll start cooking now.

1376
01:34:34,093 --> 01:34:36,319
The first dish that I prepared today

1377
01:34:36,506 --> 01:34:37,812
is arancini

1378
01:34:37,837 --> 01:34:39,516
made from fermented cucumber

1379
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:40,741
and dried distillers grains.

1380
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:42,593
The aroma of the dried distillers grains

1381
01:34:42,609 --> 01:34:44,689
will still be present,

1382
01:34:44,713 --> 01:34:46,316
so when paired with alcohol

1383
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:48,106
the taste is even better.

1384
01:34:48,651 --> 01:34:51,036
I also added rice so that you

1385
01:34:51,148 --> 01:34:52,818
won't experience any stomach pain

1386
01:34:52,843 --> 01:34:54,474
from consuming alcohol.

1387
01:34:55,348 --> 01:34:57,245
For the second course

1388
01:34:57,286 --> 01:34:59,019
we have a Korean-style pasta that

1389
01:34:59,044 --> 01:35:01,051
was created based on the popular pasta

1390
01:35:01,076 --> 01:35:02,299
among the younger generation.

1391
01:35:02,324 --> 01:35:03,658
The grilled Spanish mackerel

1392
01:35:03,683 --> 01:35:05,318
and coriander pasta.

1393
01:35:05,565 --> 01:35:07,191
The mackerel is perfectly grilled

1394
01:35:07,216 --> 01:35:08,433
to retain its flavor

1395
01:35:08,957 --> 01:35:10,355
and it's served with coriander

1396
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,771
which helps reducing the greasiness.

1397
01:35:12,995 --> 01:35:15,895
To make it easier to eat with alcohol,

1398
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,654
I only selected proper fish meat

1399
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,710
for cooking.

1400
01:35:19,504 --> 01:35:21,815
I created these dishes especially

1401
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:23,855
for those who aren't proficient

1402
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,480
in using chopsticks

1403
01:35:26,321 --> 01:35:27,746
or have stomach discomfort

1404
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:28,965
from drinking alcohol.

1405
01:35:29,117 --> 01:35:30,723
These factors motivated me

1406
01:35:30,748 --> 01:35:32,629
to develop these dishes.

1407
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,004
I hope everyone will

1408
01:35:34,279 --> 01:35:35,872
enjoy these dishes and

1409
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:37,380
have a delightful meal.

1410
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:38,765
Thank you.

1411
01:36:08,242 --> 01:36:09,352
How beautiful.

1412
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,804
It smells fantastic.

1413
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:19,605
It's so delicious.

1414
01:36:20,916 --> 01:36:22,902
Why is Kihoon so awesome?

1415
01:36:26,879 --> 01:36:29,015
Chef this is the CEO.

1416
01:36:29,121 --> 01:36:30,191
Bravo!

1417
01:36:32,855 --> 01:36:34,769
You are Chef Kihoon right?

1418
01:36:34,794 --> 01:36:36,074
Hello, I'm Park Kihoon.

1419
01:36:36,099 --> 01:36:37,634
Thanks to your effort

1420
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:39,746
our customers are having a great time.

1421
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:40,918
Thank you so much.

1422
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:43,308
- It wasn't all me.
- Of course.

1423
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,631
I've heard about it.

1424
01:36:44,715 --> 01:36:46,041
Thank you for your effort,

1425
01:36:46,065 --> 01:36:47,170
Mr. Jiyu and Ms. Yeon-ah.

1426
01:36:47,194 --> 01:36:49,418
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1427
01:36:49,925 --> 01:36:51,699
Excuse me. Ms. Yeon-ah.

1428
01:36:53,362 --> 01:36:54,792
Enjoy as much as you want.

1429
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:57,824
Eat drink and have fun.

1430
01:37:00,121 --> 01:37:02,121
- This way, sir.
- Thank you very much, sir.

1431
01:37:02,488 --> 01:37:03,519
Thank you.

1432
01:37:10,292 --> 01:37:11,637
Corporate card from the CEO

1433
01:37:11,662 --> 01:37:13,346
let's fully enjoy ourselves.

1434
01:37:16,412 --> 01:37:18,537
Everyone worked hard.

1435
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,479
Is everyone wearing pants
with elastic waistbands?

1436
01:37:20,513 --> 01:37:21,888
Of course.

1437
01:37:21,901 --> 01:37:24,482
- We need to make the most out of it.
- Hey.

1438
01:37:24,951 --> 01:37:26,560
Why are you sitting here?

1439
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,904
None of your business.

1440
01:37:29,616 --> 01:37:31,240
Enough.

1441
01:37:31,265 --> 01:37:32,857
Mr. Kihun please give a toast.

1442
01:37:34,967 --> 01:37:36,068
I'm not good at doing

1443
01:37:36,093 --> 01:37:37,099
that kind of thing.

1444
01:37:38,326 --> 01:37:39,558
You were awesome just now.

1445
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:42,623
Yeah. You didn't tremble one bit.

1446
01:37:43,303 --> 01:37:44,381
But Chef

1447
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:46,537
weren't you only staring at Mr. Jiyu?

1448
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,136
I don't know how to give a toast.

1449
01:37:51,343 --> 01:37:52,973
It's awkward

1450
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:54,339
but I'll give it a try.

1451
01:37:56,199 --> 01:37:57,425
Let's be happy!

1452
01:38:00,488 --> 01:38:02,081
I can't make myself drink.

1453
01:38:02,724 --> 01:38:03,949
Let's be happy?

1454
01:38:04,066 --> 01:38:05,171
Just like an old man.

1455
01:38:05,976 --> 01:38:07,296
But you said being happy

1456
01:38:07,321 --> 01:38:08,695
is the most important thing.

1457
01:38:08,738 --> 01:38:10,534
Having good friends

1458
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,714
enjoy eating and drinking together.

1459
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,399
- It's nice.
- You're right.

1460
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,820
I think our relationship will be strong.

1461
01:38:18,063 --> 01:38:20,094
- I'm happy too.
- Bottoms up!

1462
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:23,086
- Let's be happy!
- Let's be happy!

1463
01:38:27,182 --> 01:38:28,683
- I'm really happy.
- Yeah.

1464
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:29,955
Absolutely happy.

1465
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,869
- Eat as much as you want!
- Don't hold back.

1466
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,539
- I'm digging in.
- I'll eat so much that I can't walk.

1467
01:38:33,564 --> 01:38:35,307
(AS IF YOUR LAST BOTTLE)

1468
01:38:42,095 --> 01:38:43,295
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes.

1469
01:38:44,258 --> 01:38:46,680
- Please eat a lot.
- Yes.

1470
01:38:47,946 --> 01:38:48,946
Where are you going?

1471
01:38:49,532 --> 01:38:51,051
I'm going for a breath of fresh air.

1472
01:39:01,565 --> 01:39:03,432
Much better.

1473
01:39:05,451 --> 01:39:07,896
The heavy smell of meat and alcohol...

1474
01:39:08,768 --> 01:39:09,998
It's suffocating.

1475
01:39:13,037 --> 01:39:14,295
Shall we take a walk?

1476
01:39:18,389 --> 01:39:19,678
They should be alright, yeah?

1477
01:39:23,854 --> 01:39:25,435
I'm going for a short walk.

1478
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:38,559
Shall we sit here?

1479
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:40,250
Sure.

1480
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:53,729
What were you thinking back then?

1481
01:39:55,526 --> 01:39:58,018
Pleasant thoughts like you told me.

1482
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:01,306
Yeah but what exactly?

1483
01:40:03,268 --> 01:40:04,424
Umm...

1484
01:40:06,276 --> 01:40:08,362
It's fine. You don't have to say it.

1485
01:40:20,253 --> 01:40:21,862
You're also drunk Brother.

1486
01:40:30,034 --> 01:40:31,682
Everything...

1487
01:40:32,345 --> 01:40:33,533
is finally over.

1488
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,721
Our collaboration

1489
01:40:40,593 --> 01:40:42,033
has come to an end.

1490
01:40:44,018 --> 01:40:45,018
Disappointed?

1491
01:41:05,762 --> 01:41:06,762
Sorry.

1492
01:41:14,207 --> 01:41:16,300
You asked about what my thoughts were

1493
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,680
you were on my mind.

1494
01:41:46,898 --> 01:41:49,226
I had a blast today.

1495
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:51,061
See you next time!

1496
01:41:51,086 --> 01:41:52,336
Don't just say next time.

1497
01:41:52,367 --> 01:41:53,467
How about next weekend?

1498
01:41:53,491 --> 01:41:56,216
Let's meet again next weekend night.

1499
01:41:56,241 --> 01:41:58,147
- Sounds great!
- Potluck party!

1500
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,983
I'll find a location.

1501
01:42:01,626 --> 01:42:03,194
Let's go Sister.

1502
01:42:03,219 --> 01:42:04,765
I'll get going first.

1503
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:06,230
- Bye bye.
- Take care.

1504
01:42:06,265 --> 01:42:07,374
Safe travels!

1505
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:09,066
- You too.
- Why do I have to go too?

1506
01:42:09,091 --> 01:42:10,091
Just hurry.

1507
01:42:11,061 --> 01:42:13,460
- Take him with you.
- Hey guys!

1508
01:42:13,914 --> 01:42:15,429
I am not drunk.

1509
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:56,626
Why is my stomach growling?

1510
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:58,296
Be quiet.

1511
01:42:58,351 --> 01:42:59,686
This isn't the time.

1512
01:43:00,913 --> 01:43:01,913
Are you hungry?

1513
01:43:06,945 --> 01:43:08,202
You have ramyeon at home right?

1514
01:43:08,968 --> 01:43:12,155
Yeah I've got all kinds.

1515
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:16,671
Today

1516
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,692
I'll make a delicious ramyeon.

1517
01:43:27,348 --> 01:43:28,559
At night?

1518
01:43:48,817 --> 01:43:50,278
Which flavor do you want?

1519
01:43:53,514 --> 01:43:55,896
Are you really going to eat ramyeon?

1520
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:00,560
What were you thinking?

1521
01:44:01,475 --> 01:44:02,951
What are you thinking?

1522
01:44:04,145 --> 01:44:05,527
We're having ramyeon of course.

1523
01:44:05,982 --> 01:44:07,021
Which flavor?

1524
01:44:16,763 --> 01:44:17,763
Then...

1525
01:44:23,238 --> 01:44:24,303
Shall we

1526
01:44:24,778 --> 01:44:26,178
have ramyeon later?

1527
01:45:09,932 --> 01:45:11,244
Hello.

1528
01:45:11,409 --> 01:45:13,713
Could you call the owner for us?

1529
01:45:13,729 --> 01:45:15,166
Yes this way please.

1530
01:45:17,104 --> 01:45:18,104
Chef.

1531
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:22,877
Hello.

1532
01:45:23,448 --> 01:45:24,947
It's been a while.

1533
01:45:25,745 --> 01:45:27,799
You still remember us?

1534
01:45:29,401 --> 01:45:30,401
Of course.

1535
01:45:30,573 --> 01:45:31,666
It was so memorable

1536
01:45:31,691 --> 01:45:32,885
that I couldn't forget.

1537
01:45:33,526 --> 01:45:34,698
I want to apologize

1538
01:45:34,723 --> 01:45:36,403
for being rude back then.

1539
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,560
No need.

1540
01:45:39,031 --> 01:45:40,038
To be honest

1541
01:45:40,063 --> 01:45:41,874
I also need to apologize to you too.

1542
01:45:43,706 --> 01:45:44,893
It'd be nice if we can

1543
01:45:44,917 --> 01:45:45,918
understand each other

1544
01:45:45,942 --> 01:45:47,152
and move on from it.

1545
01:45:48,276 --> 01:45:49,276
You're really kind.

1546
01:45:50,698 --> 01:45:52,104
Do you sell alcohol now?

1547
01:45:52,517 --> 01:45:53,775
Yes.

1548
01:45:54,596 --> 01:45:56,963
Then we can eat here right?

1549
01:45:58,284 --> 01:45:59,284
Of course.

1550
01:45:59,893 --> 01:46:01,686
I'll assume we're old friends,

1551
01:46:01,711 --> 01:46:03,272
I'll give you special service.

1552
01:46:03,313 --> 01:46:05,397
Enjoy your meal and come back often.

1553
01:46:05,956 --> 01:46:07,089
Thank you.

1554
01:46:12,558 --> 01:46:16,589
(Goosoo Restaurant)

1555
01:46:17,132 --> 01:46:18,667
Closed.

1556
01:46:18,692 --> 01:46:20,816
(Take away service)

1557
01:46:23,894 --> 01:46:29,894
(Closed for the afternoon due to personal reasons)

1558
01:46:36,643 --> 01:46:37,885
Hello.

1559
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:38,962
What's this?

1560
01:46:38,986 --> 01:46:40,400
Everyone came first before me.

1561
01:46:40,799 --> 01:46:42,893
Oh I also ordered chicken.

1562
01:46:43,221 --> 01:46:44,221
Me too.

1563
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:46,963
Is it a chicken party today?

1564
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:49,158
It seems so. There's only chicken here.

1565
01:46:49,409 --> 01:46:51,807
That's why I said we should have

1566
01:46:51,832 --> 01:46:53,619
mentioned our menu first.

1567
01:46:53,644 --> 01:46:54,833
The one who asked me

1568
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:56,721
to keep it a secret was you Park Jiha.

1569
01:46:56,745 --> 01:46:58,432
I already know!

1570
01:46:58,805 --> 01:47:00,697
I really like chicken okay?

1571
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:02,815
I'll be chicken or dog

1572
01:47:02,831 --> 01:47:03,955
or anything today.

1573
01:47:04,308 --> 01:47:06,596
Yeah, just enjoy it.

1574
01:47:06,621 --> 01:47:07,745
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

1575
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,049
What to do?

1576
01:47:15,074 --> 01:47:16,213
It's just chicken here.

1577
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:18,323
But they are all different flavor.

1578
01:47:18,348 --> 01:47:19,373
It's the first time

1579
01:47:19,398 --> 01:47:20,653
I've had five flavors.

1580
01:47:20,678 --> 01:47:21,316
Yes.

1581
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:23,319
Usually you have to buy the mixed one

1582
01:47:23,344 --> 01:47:24,347
to get a lot of radishes.

1583
01:47:24,372 --> 01:47:26,151
It's fine. Let's dig in.

1584
01:47:26,176 --> 01:47:27,362
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1585
01:47:36,409 --> 01:47:38,260
Who brought this flavor?

1586
01:47:38,526 --> 01:47:39,799
Me.

1587
01:47:41,253 --> 01:47:43,745
I love hot barbecue Brother.

1588
01:47:43,858 --> 01:47:46,244
- Excellent.
- But I can't handle spicy food.

1589
01:47:46,401 --> 01:47:47,401
Oh really?

1590
01:47:48,132 --> 01:47:49,351
You can try this.

1591
01:47:49,549 --> 01:47:51,095
It's garlic sauce. It's not spicy.

1592
01:47:51,487 --> 01:47:52,487
Thanks.

1593
01:47:56,237 --> 01:47:58,401
- Jiyu, don't hold back, okay?
- Yes.

1594
01:48:03,166 --> 01:48:04,370
I have something to say.

1595
01:48:05,542 --> 01:48:06,877
Wan and I are going out.

1596
01:48:08,502 --> 01:48:09,735
Yeah I know.

1597
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,174
- I know.
- What?

1598
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:13,849
Did you think we wouldn't know?

1599
01:48:13,874 --> 01:48:15,006
It was so obvious.

1600
01:48:15,222 --> 01:48:16,291
Was it obvious?

1601
01:48:17,901 --> 01:48:19,580
So annoying.

1602
01:48:20,691 --> 01:48:23,010
Sorry but everyone just leave please.

1603
01:48:23,081 --> 01:48:25,955
I will eat all the chicken by myself.

1604
01:48:28,893 --> 01:48:30,385
What a loser.

1605
01:48:30,448 --> 01:48:31,448
What?

1606
01:48:31,487 --> 01:48:33,416
Let's have a second round to celebrate

1607
01:48:33,432 --> 01:48:34,531
them becoming a couple.

1608
01:48:34,555 --> 01:48:36,062
Then why don't we go celebrate

1609
01:48:36,071 --> 01:48:37,055
at the rooftop?

1610
01:48:37,079 --> 01:48:38,670
- Okay!
- Okay!

1611
01:48:39,281 --> 01:48:40,835
We don't have to go anywhere far.

1612
01:49:11,812 --> 01:49:12,812
What?

1613
01:49:14,615 --> 01:49:15,615
It's just...

1614
01:49:15,789 --> 01:49:17,866
Yeah? Just what?

1615
01:49:18,781 --> 01:49:20,038
It's just...

1616
01:49:29,065 --> 01:49:30,065
What's with him?

1617
01:49:32,221 --> 01:49:33,221
What?

1618
01:49:34,956 --> 01:49:35,956
It's just...

1619
01:49:37,346 --> 01:49:38,947
Yeah? Just what?

1620
01:49:40,253 --> 01:49:41,572
Are you copying me?

1621
01:49:41,971 --> 01:49:42,971
Hmm?

1622
01:49:59,073 --> 01:50:00,283
Do you like me?

1623
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:10,287
I like you.

1624
01:50:14,382 --> 01:50:15,864
I like you too.

1625
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:35,379
Cheers to everyone who became a couple!

1626
01:50:35,652 --> 01:50:37,081
Cheers!

1627
01:50:37,114 --> 01:50:38,644
What? Mr. Jiyu, you too.

1628
01:50:39,778 --> 01:50:41,012
Forget it.

1629
01:50:41,037 --> 01:50:43,652
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1630
01:50:44,332 --> 01:50:45,371
Leaving me all alone,

1631
01:50:45,387 --> 01:50:46,700
you guys are going overboard.

1632
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:47,933
Cheers to you too.

1633
01:50:48,246 --> 01:50:49,308
Cheers.

1634
01:50:49,786 --> 01:50:52,113
Cheers.

1635
01:50:55,336 --> 01:50:56,404
Wow it's delicious.

1636
01:50:56,429 --> 01:50:57,936
- Very delicious.
- What wine is it?

1637
01:50:57,991 --> 01:50:59,253
Italian wine.

1638
01:51:01,044 --> 01:51:02,229
You're not making this up, right?

1639
01:51:02,254 --> 01:51:04,425
Don't tease him.

1640
01:51:06,386 --> 01:51:07,887
You really know how to pick.

1641
01:51:08,081 --> 01:51:09,081
Not at all.

1642
01:51:12,596 --> 01:51:14,206
- I like this type of bread.
- Try this.

1643
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,268
Try it.

1644
01:51:19,409 --> 01:51:21,643
- Care for one?
- I'm on a diet.

1645
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:24,432
Why? You're already so beautiful.

1646
01:51:27,253 --> 01:51:28,487
I'm going home.

1647
01:51:29,087 --> 01:51:30,087
Why?

1648
01:51:30,112 --> 01:51:31,431
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

1649
01:51:31,917 --> 01:51:33,706
I'm going to find love.

1650
01:51:33,746 --> 01:51:34,924
Don't try to stop me.

1651
01:51:35,286 --> 01:51:36,940
- Okay.
- Okay?

1652
01:51:37,026 --> 01:51:38,026
Hello.

1653
01:51:38,362 --> 01:51:39,885
- This is our part-timer.
- Hello.

1654
01:51:40,183 --> 01:51:42,565
- He'll join us too. Hope you don't mind.
- Of course.

1655
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:45,495
- Hello.
- Hello.

1656
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,660
I brought a bottle of wine

1657
01:51:46,668 --> 01:51:47,895
when I got the invitation.

1658
01:51:50,932 --> 01:51:51,932
What?

1659
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:57,159
Well, weren't you leaving?

1660
01:51:57,776 --> 01:52:00,948
Do you like collecting wine?

1661
01:52:02,089 --> 01:52:03,893
Unbelievable!

1662
01:52:04,542 --> 01:52:06,744
I'm surrounded by

1663
01:52:07,354 --> 01:52:08,487
people who can talk

1664
01:52:08,512 --> 01:52:10,192
and laugh about anything.

1665
01:52:11,682 --> 01:52:13,827
Even the toughest moments

1666
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:15,057
turn into small problems and,

1667
01:52:15,073 --> 01:52:16,104
as time goes by,

1668
01:52:16,839 --> 01:52:18,214
the person who helped me

1669
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:19,918
through the tough times

1670
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:22,970
is now laughing right beside me.

1671
01:52:24,213 --> 01:52:25,424
Happiness...

1672
01:52:25,449 --> 01:52:26,534
is right here.
