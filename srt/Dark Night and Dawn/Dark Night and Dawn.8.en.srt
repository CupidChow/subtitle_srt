All the materials are here.

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,860
Let's start with him.

5
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,350
Sir, Lin Shaobai from Office 2, reporting for duty.

6
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,690
Late on your first day?

7
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,870
Absolutely not.

8
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,590
I actually arrived quite early.

[Case of Liu Mingjian]

10
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,470
It just occurred to me that we came to work so early this morning

11
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,910
that surely no one's had breakfast yet.

12
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,630
So, I ran through several streets

13
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,070
to get some snacks for everyone.

14
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,910
Here, try some.

15
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,620
These crab shell pies are amazing.

16
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,790
They're delicious.

17
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,310
And these, sesame rice balls.

18
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,340
Pork chop with rice cakes.

19
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,990
These are all top-notch snacks.

20
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,139
They're definitely as good as those from the Shanghai Family Restaurant.

21
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,509
You'll know once you try them.

22
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,470
You're so particular.

23
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,350
Shaobai, the pork chop with rice cakes is from Xian De Lai.

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,980
Xu, you're indeed from Shanghai. You know the good stuff.

25
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,660
Director Lu.

26
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,990
We're in the middle of a meeting. Is food really that important?

27
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,770
You, write me a self-criticism later.

28
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,000
Come on, I was just a little late, Director Lu.

29
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,260

I've already had breakfast.

35

This isn't breakfast, and it's not for you to eat either.

[Case of Liu Mingjian]

37
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,390
It's for the jasmine plant in your room.

38
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,630
You've just been watering that jasmine.

39
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,340

41
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,740
This is a special fertilizer made of

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,310
plant ash, soybean cake, and river mud, mixed together.

43
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,590
My Auntie made it,

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,820
and we've always used it at home. It works wonders.

45
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,970
It's just that we have too much at home. We can't use it all.

46
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,960
Director Lu, please help me use some of it.

47

Just leave it there.

48
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,140
Okay.

49
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,130
But you still have to write that self-criticism.

Late on your first day at work?

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,070
Sorry, miss,

55
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,140
what's your name again?

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,720
Cen Xiaoman. "Xiaoman" means the "Grain Full" season. 
I was born on that day, easy to remember.

57
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,820
Why are you late?

I'm sorry.

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,520
Last night, I was so excited about becoming a police officer

60

However, I was too excited

64
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,180
and ended up reporting to the Fuzhou Road Public Security Bureau instead.

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,350
Only when I got there did I realize that the Social Affairs Office 
wasn't at that bureau.

66
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,990
That was when I rushed over here.

67
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,740
This definitely calls for written self-criticism, right?

68
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,710
And it needs to be deep, with at least a thousand words long,

69
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,510
right?

70
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,020
Mr. Lin Shaobai is absolutely right.

71
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,210
The self-criticism must be thorough.

72
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,990
So, we'll go by

Miss Cen Xiaoman, you don't need to write one.

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,410
That's not how a person should react.

185
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,370
Think it through.

186
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,750
Yan!

187
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,720
Dad!

188
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,410
They said you were on the boat.

189
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,070
How are you feeling?

190
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,230
I just saw a guest off.

191
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,710
I felt a bit unwell.

192
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,190
I'm fine now after resting for a bit.

193
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,960
Zhou and the others were just making a fuss,

194
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,350
insisting on calling you.

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,830
Your hands are still cold.

196
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,700
You should go to the hospital for a check-up.

197
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,660
Even if I do, they'll just tell me to rest more and exercise.

198
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,410
Go. I'll go tomorrow.

199
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,990
No, we're going now.

200
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,710
Let's go.

201
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,330
You've been working so hard lately. You're too tired.

202
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,270
How about we take a break from work

203
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,260
and rest for a bit?

204
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,560
If only I could, that would be great.

205
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,920
But I can't.

206
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,500
Yan,

207
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,300
quit your job at the hospital.

208
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,520
I was actually going to talk to you about that.

209
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,030
I'm now working as a medical examiner at the Public Security Bureau.

210
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,620
You already knew that, didn't you?

211
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,380
He even called me at the office.

212
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,640
I also heard it from someone else.

213
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,480
I knew you weren't planning on telling me,

214
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,860
right?

215
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,670
A girl working as a medical examiner,

217
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,570
Dad, it's the new society now.

218
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,790
Your mindset has to change too.

219
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,830
Besides, forensic work is about skill,

220
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,960
not gender.

221
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,270
I don't care. Whether you agree or not,

222
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,320
I'll continue to be a medical examiner.

223
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,250
You're my only daughter.

224
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,190
Yan, you must learn how to protect yourself.

225
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,630
As long as you agree,

226
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,750
I will protect myself.

227
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,140
Does it look good?

228
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,570
Yes.

229
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,310
This is something I've always wanted to give you.

230
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,690
Give it to me?

231
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,170
Shanghai has been liberated.

232
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,010
You do work at the Public Security Bureau,

233
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,630
but there are still regulations on firearms.

234
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,550
This gun is for you to protect yourself.

235
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,800
Alright, I can't argue with you.

236
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,950
Thank you, Dad.

237
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,440
Yan, I'm tired.

238
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm going to rest for a bit.

239
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,080
Okay.

240
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,870
Zhou, drive slowly.

241
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,540
Okay.

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,340
Hello?

244
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,390
I'm Bulbul. I'm willing to cooperate,

245
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,500
but I have one condition.

246
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,050
I want the position of Chairman 
of the Labor, Military, and Commerce Association.

247
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,030
I have a very strong competitor,

248
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,430
Liu Xisheng.

249
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,600
[Case of Liu Mingjian]

250
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,440
There are too many case files.

251
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,160
Going through them one by one like this

252
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,470
is a slow method.

253
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,460
We've been looking through them for so long,

254
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,830
yet we haven't found a single clue.

255
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,910
It's useless.

256
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,300
Slow methods are often the most effective.

257
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,490
Rushing will only slow you down.

258
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,390
We're working overtime tonight. All of these files need to be reviewed.

259
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,270
Yes.

260
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,260
Okay, Director.

261
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,840
No sleep tonight then.

262
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,900
Xiaoman,

263
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,570
you must be tired, right?

264
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,760
You don't look too good.

265
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,540
I'm not tired.

266
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,060
The energy of youth.

267
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,990
How much have you gone through?

268
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,470
You're flipping so fast.

269
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,910
Can you be more thorough?

270
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,000
As a senior,

271
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,980
I have to teach you something.

272
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,610
This isn't how you go through files.

273
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,110
Don't just pretend to be busy

274
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,790
by rummaging through papers...

275
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,590
Hold on.

276
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,530
Director, I think I've found something.

277
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,430
[Case of Liu Mingjian]

278
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,730
There are two cases that share overlapping characteristics 
with the suspect.

279
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,370
The first case is from 1940, during the Japanese occupation.

280
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,590
The Provisional Government of Shanghai issued a warrant.

281
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,310
This saboteur is named Takanashi Ken,

282
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,110
who was likely a Chinese pretending to be Japanese.

283
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,910
He used a butterfly knife and escaped capture by the Japanese.

284
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,590
The second case, here.

285
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,430
In 1946,

286
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,310
a gang fight occurred at the Laoximen Casino on Zhonghua Road.

287
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,390
This criminal named Chen Yingwu

288
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,270
injured someone with a butterfly knife.

289
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,590
The surname "Takanashi"

290
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,510
is rare in Japan.

291
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,190
The Chinese translation of its pronunciation

292
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,170
is "Yingwu."

293
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,630
And considering the use of the butterfly knife,

294
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,290
we can deduce

295
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,270
that this suspect operated

296
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,710
under a Japanese alias during the Japanese occupation.

297
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
After the victory in the Counter-Japanese War,

298
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,280
he used his old ID to apply for a fake household registration

299
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,750
but kept the name "Yingwu."

300
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,030
Frequent identity changes

301
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,590
also match the behavior of an agent.

302
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:21,990
Good for you.

303
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,220
Wait, you've gone through all those files?

304
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,520
Yes.

305
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
And you've even memorized all of them?

306
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
I know speed reading and shorthand.

307
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,790
I can finish reading a book

308
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,010
ten times faster than the average person.

309
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,970
What are speed reading and shorthand?

310
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,790
Your analysis just now was excellent.

311
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,040
Anything else?

312
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,800
The key is in this second case.

313
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,290
After Chen Yingwu was arrested,

314
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
he was bailed out by a businessman named Li Qian.

315
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,910
His registered address was

316
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,780
Xincheng Mechanical and Electrical Trading Company

317
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,590
at 63 Route Pere Robert at that time.

318
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,910
Li Qian is the general manager of this company.

[Li Qian]

320
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,110
Find Li Qian immediately

321
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,510
and arrest him if you resist.

322
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,430
Yes.

323
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,800
This is Jin Maochang.

324
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,030
Liu Xisheng's reputation is already ruined.

325
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,180
He's no longer in a position to compete with you.

326
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,530
Your efficiency

327
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,350
is truly impressive.

328
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,070
From now on,

329
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,800
we can officially begin our cooperation, right?

330
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,580
The police have already gotten to the bottom

331
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,750
of Liu Mingjian's case.

332
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,620
It's very likely connected to some agents.

333
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,290
If it were in the past, every one of us

334
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,030
might have been rounded up and tortured.

335
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,450
But this is the new government now.

336
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,050
They don't do collective punishment.

337
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,740
However, we should regard this as a warning.

338
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,690
You must conduct thorough

339
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,150
internal checks at your factories and docks.

340
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,300
If anyone is found to have something to do with agents,

341
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,220
there will be no leniency.

342
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,030
Mr. Jin is right.

343
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,960
We can't let any "bad apples"

344
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,290
into our factories.

345
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,420
Yuquan,

346
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,260
there's an old workshop in your sugar factory

347
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,960
that has been left unused.

348
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,710
I'm planning to fix it up

349
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,109
to set up a sugar research institute there.

350
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,940
Mr. Jin, why go through the trouble

351
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,230
of setting up a research institute?

352
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,900
You need to look further ahead.

353
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,880
Although Shanghai has been liberated,

354
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,500
the South is still at war.

355
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,570
Sugar is a crucial strategic resource.

356
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,810
Building a sugar research institute

357
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,480
is about increasing both the quantity and quality of sugar production.

358
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,300
You're busy with your work,

359
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,090
so I'll personally oversee this.

360

Just focus on getting your current workshops in order.

361
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,330
No need to divide your attention on this matter.

362
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,990

368
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,170
If you wanna say something, just say it.

369
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,310
Putting up a sign and setting off fireworks.

370
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,140
Isn't that a bit too much?

371
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,500
Not at all.

372
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,930
If we acted too discreetly and concealed everything,

373
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,560
it would actually draw more attention.

374
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,220
Now, by being open about it,

375
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,620
no one pays any mind about it.

376
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,550
Shrike said that this is called "hiding in plain sight."

377
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,770
Got it.

378
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,870
Also,

379
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,010
make sure to tell your sugar factory workers

380
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,540
to stop wandering around this place for no reason.

381
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,450
This area involves trade secrets,

382
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,030
so for the researchers...

383
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,420
Give them some peace.

384
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,140
Already taken care of it.

385
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,190
I've still got matters to attend to at my factory,

386
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,420
so I'll take my leave now.

387
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,860
[Flammable]

388
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,990
Be gentle, gentle.

389
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,640
Ogura?

390
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,100
Mr. Wang.

391
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,320
You've worked hard.

392
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,110
We've got the venue

393
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,890
and the equipment for you.

394
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,510
Yes.

395
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,900
I hope you can speed up your research as much as possible.

396
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,900
Mr. Zheng

397
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,240
is usually very kind,

398
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,870
but if he gets impatient...

399
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,910
it may be hard for you to handle.

400
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,310
Please tell Mr. Zheng

401
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,130
that I won't make him wait too long.

402
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,010
If you encounter any difficulties during the research, just let us know.

403
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,390
Mr. Wang.

404
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,540
Mr. Wang.

405
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,600
You can't smoke

406
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,210
here.

407
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,510
Look...

408
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,110
Look at me. My mind is slipping.

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,420
Hurry up the progress.

410
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,050
Mr. Jin.

411
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,490
Agent Chen is here.

412
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,460
I've heard so much about you.

413
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,910
Mr. Jin.

414
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,740
Agent Chen.

415
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,900
Who is this?

416
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,860
Jiang Yang.

417
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,210
He is the best

418
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,520
among the assassins I represent.

419
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,130
He also has the nickname

420
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,220
"The Lone Wolf of the Rong Club."

421
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,160
It's been tough for everyone

422
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,630
since Golden Rong of the former Zhongxin Club

423
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,110
stepped down.

424
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,100
Yeah.

425
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,790
Out of loyalty to the underworld, I've been keeping him fed.

426
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,280
There are seven or eight others like him.

427
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,070
Rest assured, with me here,

428
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,900
everything will be kept strictly confidential.

429
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,820
What other qualities does he have?

430
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,040
He cares about money.

431
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,870
How far does that go?

432
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,540
Only cares about money.

433
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,720
One thousand dollars.

434
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,450
Could you take care of him?

435
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,520
Mr. Jin.

436
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,010
Mr. Jiang,

437
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,240
it seems you're exactly the person I've been looking for.

438
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,940
Boss,

439
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,510
what else would you like me to do?

440
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,510
Your gang has many people.

441
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,110
Activate them all

442
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,160
and find this person.

443
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,550
Xu.

444
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,630
It's already time.

445
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,590
Why isn't he here yet?

446
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,500
Don't worry.

447
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,050
He definitely comes to this Western restaurant every day.

448
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,310
Just keep a close watch.

449
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,660
Director.

450
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,230
He isn't here yet.

451
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,040
Keep a close watch.

452
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,720
Everyone, gather around.

453
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,080
Let me repeat it again.

454
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,560
The goal of this mission

455
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,830
is not to kill the suspect.

456
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,110
We need to capture him alive.

457
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,880
[Charlie's Restaurant]

458
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,780
Director, Li Qian is here.

459
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,670
[Charlie's Restaurant]

460
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,190
Xiang,

461
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,970
take someone to guard the back door of the restaurant.

462
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,560
Okay.

463
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,430
Follow me.

464
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,670
Yes. Let's go.

465
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,630
Xu, you

466
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,030
keep an eye on the front door.

467
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,430
Okay.

468
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,180
Huzi, you go to the restaurant with me.

469
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,870
Wait.

470
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,140
Huzi can't go. Let me go with you instead.

471
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,070
Why?

472
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,520
Clothing. You'll be suspected for sure

473
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,950
if you go in dressed like that.

474
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,260
We're both in casual short jackets.

475
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,450
How are you better than me?

476
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,590
It's not just a little better.

477
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm wearing an American M41 jacket,

478
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,940
worth ten silver dollars.

479
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,360
Besides, have you ever used a knife and fork?

480
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,360
Have you ever tried Western food before?

481
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,930
We Shanghai people have keen eyes.

482
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,870
We'd spot you in a heartbeat.

483
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,920
It's so dangerous; do you think I want to go?

484
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:35,620
Director.

485
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,470
Listen to him.

486
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,210
You come with me.

487
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
It's for your own good.

488
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,820
Young man, would you like a piece of pork chop?

489
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,850
Give me a piece.

490
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,960
Make it a little more tender.

491
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,580
Okay, got it.

492
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,970
Western food won't fill you up. We should eat something beforehand.

493
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,340
Want to try some?

494
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,580
It's so delicious.

495
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,390
Sir, here's your steak.

496
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,190
Please enjoy.

497
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
May I have a napkin, please?

498
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,190
Gentlemen, hello.

499
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,830
Please place your order.

500
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,690
Let me order.

501
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,680
Two Wellington steaks.

502
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
How well done would you like your steak?

503
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,610
One stake is enough.

504
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,180
You must try the steak here.

505
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,310
Get him a medium-well done one.

506
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,750
For mine, medium is fine.

507
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,200
Also a shrimp and salmon salad.

508
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,780
Two servings of chocolate cake.

509
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,380
Hennessy... Two glasses of it with ice.

510
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,110
And...

511
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,570
That's all.

512
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,590
We don't need wine.

513
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
No. No.

514
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,110
W-W-We have to have the wine.

515
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,010
Got it?

516
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,140
Yes, sir.

517
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,590
That will be three silver dollars in total.

518
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,930
Sorry, sir.

519
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,660
We don't accept RMB here.

520
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,500
The new government has implemented regulations.

521
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,120
All commercial establishments

522
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,560
must use RMB.

523
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,320
Sir, please bear with us.

524
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,120
The exchange rate between RMB and silver dollars

525
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,110
fluctuates frequently.

526
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,770
Right now, 1,000 RMB can be exchanged for one silver dollar,

527
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,100
but by tomorrow morning,

528
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,560
it might need 1,200 RMB.

529
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,680
Three silver dollars, right?

530
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,320
Here.

531
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,400
Thank you.

532
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,420
Please wait a moment. The food is coming right up.

533
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,190
Remove this.

534
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,520
You must try the steak here.

535
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,470
You'll remember the taste of this restaurant

536
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,170
once you try it.

537
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,770
With the prices they charge,

538
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,230
I don't need to eat to remember this place.

539
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,970
But, let me say this in front.

540
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,690
You can't take me to this restaurant

541
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,490
while I have to pay.

542
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,870
You have to reimburse me.

543
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,950
There are standards for reimbursement.

544
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
This little money

545
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,140
doesn't even meet the reimbursement threshold.

546
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,260
Well.

547
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,010
I'm auxiliary personnel,

548
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,800
and my salary is even halved.

549
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,140
Can you bear to let me spend the money?

550
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,670
Why did you have to order that much?

551
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,740
And the wine?

552
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,820
The wine is a must.

553
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,050
You'll know later.

554
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,090
Sir, your wine.

555
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,790
Thank you.

556
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,590
You're welcome.

557
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,390
Enjoy.

558
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,390
Li Qian and his bodyguard have guns.

559
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,180
The chauffeur doesn't.

560
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,470
Be careful.

561
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,070
Come on, Mr. Lu.

562
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,350
Let's celebrate.

563
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,590
Sure.

564
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,690
Hurry up!

565
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,430
Hurry!

566
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,610
Boss.

567
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,350
How's the dock recently?

568
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,240
Nothing much going on.

569
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,700
We are all on high alert.

570
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,460
We won't let the River Gang take advantage of us.

571
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,620
Keep a close watch here.

572
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,770
Please.

573
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm going to the restroom.

574
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:51,980
Okay.

575
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,830
He's heading to the restroom.

576
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,720
Mr. Lu.

577
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,250
A toast to you.

578
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,510
I... I have to down this drink.

579
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,350
Too fast. Drink slowly.

580
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,740
You've had too much. Look at you.

581
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,950
Let me help you there.

582
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,600
Go. Let's go.

583
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,230
Steady.

584
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,770
You drank so much.

585
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,450
Please move aside. My friend is drunk.

586
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:18,950
I'm so sorry.

587
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,230
The restroom is temporarily unavailable.

588
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,460
What do you want?

589
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,750
Watch out.

590
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,790
Retreat!

591
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:12,850
Hurry up!

592
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,070

You're pretty fast.

Sir,

605
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,640
I splashed the oil just in time, right?

606
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,780
I'm with the Public Security Bureau.

I'm here on a mission.

I'd like to ask for your help.

610
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,400
Are you here to catch bad guys?

611
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,240
How can I help you?

612
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,670
Awesome, boss.

613
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,290
Thank you.

614
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,250
Thank you.

615
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,150
If you need anything, come to me.

616
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,000

Let go of him!

634
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,840
You can fight, huh?

635
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,290
But you look unfamiliar.

636
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,570
What's your story?

637
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,950
I used to be a soldier.

638
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,860
I fought against the Communists in Xuzhou.

639
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,110
Now that the Communists have taken over the place,

640
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,070
I have nowhere else to go.

641
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,890
I can only scrape by working at the docks.

642
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,780
Boss,

643
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,360
I'm really at the end of my rope.

644
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,670
I want to join the Hook Sword Gang.

645
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,210
With someone backing me, I can have a meal.

646
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,250
What's your name?

647
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,330
Wei Shan.

648
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,710
How about this?

649
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,020
We've got a score to settle with the River Gang in a couple of days.

650
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,910
You follow me.

651
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,530
If you kill one,

652
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,820
you're one of us.

653
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,210
If you kill ten, we are brothers.

654
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,830
Thank you, boss.

655
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,460
Mr. Wei.

656
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,710
What? You still want to fight me?

657
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,780
No. No.

658
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,270
Since the Boss values you so much,

659
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,810
we are brothers from now on.

660
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,230
Earlier, I offended you.

661
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,190
Me and the brothers want to buy you drinks.

662
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,510
I'll treat.

663
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,480
Conflict breeds friendship, right?

664
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,750
We can let you pay.

665
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,230
I just joined the gang.

666
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,570
You guys tell me the rules of the gang.

667
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,890
Wouldn't that be great?

668
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,680
Actually, there aren't many rules.

669
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,420
You just need to hand over 20% of your earnings.

670
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,980
If something goes wrong, the Boss has your back.

671
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,960
To put it bluntly,

672
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,310
that 20 percent is protection money.

673
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,820
That guy with the beard is our Boss, right?

674
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,450
The Boss has a Boss above him too.

675
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,350
Our Chief is very mysterious.

676
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,630
I've been working at the docks for years,

677
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,880
but I've never seen him even once.

678
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,020
But I've heard

679
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,680
that our Chief really loves dancing.

680
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,330
He likes dancing?

681
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,120
He has a private box at the Xianlemen Ballroom year-round.

682
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,890
Wei,

683
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,780
you're so good at fighting.

684
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,500
If you make it up the ranks,

685
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,930
please look out for us.

686
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,960
We're all brothers. You don't need to say that.

687
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,960
Come on. Let's go for a drink.

688
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,990
Let's go!

689
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,210
Let's go for a drink!

690
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,550
Li Qian,

691
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,810
you're quite agile for a fat guy.

692
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,210
You flatter me.

693
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,250
We hope you'll cooperate fully

694
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,500
to receive lenient treatment.

695
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,100
Absolutely, absolutely.

696
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,300
In 1946,

697
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,410
you bailed out Chen Yingwu, didn't you?

698
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,750
So, that's what it is about.

699
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,190
You even found out about such a trivial matter.

700
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,320
I'm impressed.

701
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,240
You caught me here to find him, right?

702
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,680
Take a look at these sketches.

703
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,540
Would this count as a contribution?

704
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,450
Yes.

705
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,540
No, not this one.

706
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,140
Yeah, this one, this one.

707
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,850
Are you sure?

708
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,670
I'm sure.

709
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,970
Tell us about him.

710
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,540
His real name is Wang Liqun.

711
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,080
He was the captain of the Sixth Action Squad of NBIS in Shanghai.

712
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,530
During the Japanese occupation, both of us were undercover in Shanghai.

713
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,980
We collaborated on some operations,

714
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,179
but we didn't know each other well.

715
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,639
In 1946, I left NBIS

716
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,000
and started my own business.

717
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,219
Shortly after opening my business,

718
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,170
I got a request to bail him out.

719
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,960
He was not the type of person I could afford to offend,

720
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,150
so I bailed him out.

721
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,449
But after he was released, he saw me,

722
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,060
he didn't say a word and, just left.

723
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,690
Did you see him again later?

724
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,750
No.

725
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,560
No, I've almost forgotten about him.

726
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,090
I met him once,

727
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,230
around the end of the Battle of Hsupeng...

728
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,400
No.

729
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,530
Your Party calls it the "Huaihai Campaign."

730
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,090
One day, he invited me out for a drink.

731
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,469
Actually, he was just testing the waters,

732
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,140
seeing if I'd be willing to go undercover

733
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,490
for NBIS in Shanghai.

734
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,070
I politely declined.

735
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,410
Since then, I really haven't been in contact with him.

736
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,990
Do you know where he was staying at that time?

737
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,790
No.

738
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,650
He was always very meticulous.

739
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,360
He always picked the restaurant.

740
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,640
After dinner that day,

741
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,420
he even said he'd take me to a Turkish bath.

742
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,580
I turned him down politely.

743
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,560
I've told you everything I know.

744
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,820
That should count as cooperation, right?

745
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,670
He was likely living around the Putuo area.

746
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,340
Putuo?

747
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,630
Why there?

748
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,110
After a Turkish bath, you may be exhausted.

749
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,170
It wouldn't make sense for him to go to a bathhouse 
far away from his home.

750
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,410
So, he was probably living near the bathhouse.

751
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,060
There weren't many Turkish bathhouses open back then.

752
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,040
Only a few were on Fuxing Road in Putuo.

753
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,660
It's called Xinma Road now.

754
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,270
Within a five-kilometer radius of that area,

755
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,600
it's quite likely that he lived there.

756
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,460
This is the room.

757
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,640
Do you know what time it is?

758
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,870
Why are you here?

759
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,750
About that Hook Sword Gang...

760
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,470
Come inside and talk.

761
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,490
What did you find out?

762
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,790
I've found some information about the Hook Sword Gang.

763
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,500
The real boss's surname is Dai,

764
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,450
and he's got a private box at the Xianlemen dance hall.

765
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,490
Xianlemen is a nice place.

766
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,750
Don't you know you're dirty?

767
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,620
It's okay.

768
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,660
She is a foreign chick. She doesn't understand Chinese.

769
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,480
Go ahead.

770
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,860
The Hook Sword Gang and the River Gang have a longstanding conflict.

771
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,190
They're going to fight in a few days.

772
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,250
We can use this opportunity to pull the Hook Sword Gang in

773
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,320
to reach cooperation.

774
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,540
Who said that we want to collaborate with them?

775
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,250
They've got a lot of men and control the docks.

776
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,070
If we work together...

777
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,740
You're meddling in so many things.

778
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,570
How dare you give your opinions about higher-up's business?

779
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,990
Just stick to your job and carry the bag.

780
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,390
Why are you still standing here?

781
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,850
How about I go and you stay here?

782
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,200
Wang Liqun sure was quite the lecher.

783
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,670
Why?

784
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,550
This is adult talk; children shouldn't interrupt.

785
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,110
He should have had a very strict superior.

786
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,840
Getting arrested for gambling and fighting

787
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
is a minor offense.

788
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,900
There's no need for him to go through so much trouble to find Li Qian.

789
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,600
With his rank,

790
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,760
he could have easily had any agent

791
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,980
bail him out.

792
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,460
He did it this way,

793
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,860
probably because he wanted to keep it from his superior.

794
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,660
I think so too.

795
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,370
Director, I have another question.

796
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,540
Go ahead.

797
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,580
Why would someone be exhausted

798
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,510
after a Turkish bath?

799
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,670
Mr. Shaobai,

800
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,330
tell me about it, please?

801
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,860
I...

802
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,850
Well...

803
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,790
I...

804
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,000
Lu!

805
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
Where are you going?

806
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,580
Here is the thing.

807
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,370
Our Director Lu

808
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,890
has a lot of life experience.

809
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,140
Lu,

810
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,610
explain it to our Xiaoman.

811
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,790
Yes, Director, please tell me about it.

812
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,790
It's because...

813
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,710
M-M-Maybe.

814
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,920
I suppose...

815
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,460
I-I-I suppose...

816
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,410
Well...

817
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,200
It's cold water and then hot water...

818
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,180
Well, there are many temperature changes

819
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,150
like this.

820
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,740
So, it makes people... tired easily.

821
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,640
Lin Shaobai, why are you laughing?

822
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,510
No,

823
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,270
I just thought of something really funny.

824
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,020
Anyway, it's getting late.

825
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,070
We should go home now.

826
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,190
We still have inspections tomorrow.

827
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,150
Don't be late tomorrow, understood?

828
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,870
Got it.

829
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,620
Yes.

830
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,900
By the way,

831
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,340
you take the office car and send Xiaoman home.

832
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,330
It's not safe for a young girl this late at night.

833
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,620
Well...

834
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,470
Don't be late for work tomorrow!

835
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,900
W-W-Why don't you send her?

836
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,090
Wait, where are you going?

837
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,080
Are you heading to a bathhouse...

838
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,670
Didn't you hear the Director?

839
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,290
I still have questions to ask you.

840
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,710
Let's go.

841
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,700
Are you suggesting letting Shaobai pull the strings?

842
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,210
That won't work; it'll only reflect poorly on him.

843
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,400
But even if we go early in the morning,

844
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,350
it's hard to get tickets for "The White-Haired Girl."

845
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,170
They say it's really good.

846
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,730
It's a new society now.

847
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,930
We are the family of a police officer.

848
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,890
We need to maintain the public image for them.

849
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,460
You're right.

850
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,770
Forget it. Let's not go.

851
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,380
We don't want people gossiping,

852
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,520
and we definitely don't want to make Shaobai look bad.

853
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,580
I'm back.

854
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,670
Shaobai, you're back.

855
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,470
Everyone, pause what you're doing for a moment.

856
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,790
The group assignment sheet

857
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,610
for the investigation areas is out.

858
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,640
Take a look, everyone.

859
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,870
This is yours.

860
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,850
Okay.

861
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,070
Cen Xiaoman.

862
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,350
Lin Shaobai.

863
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,080
You two are a team.

864
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,830
This sheet lists the areas

865
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,460
you're responsible for.

866
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,910
Xu,

867
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,560
hand them out.

868
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,320
Okay.

869
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,960
Here.

870
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,410
We have to check every household one by one?

871
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,600
Well...

872
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,890
I've got no problem with that.

873
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,100
But Xiaoman is a girl...

874
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,880
I'm okay with that.

875
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,390
Don't use me as an excuse.

876
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,150
This is your salary for last month.

877
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,220
If you don't want to do it,

878
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,460
I'll take it back.

879
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,070
It's payday.

880
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,260
Lu, wait.

881
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,180
It's just a few bills,

882
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,470
and they're all in RMB.

883
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,490
Lu,

884
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,110
this is half of

885
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,340
what you told me.

886
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,100
I know;

887
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,410
times are tough right now.

888
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,310
But I stayed up late and worked overtime, too.

889
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,110
The supplemental pay guidelines

890
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,170
are still being finalized.

891
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,460
Make sure you've got your assigned areas.

892
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,290
Yes, Director.

893
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,300
Mr. Zheng?

894
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,120
Did we get paid today?

895
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,800
Yes. Yes.

896
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,830
And in full.

897
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,930
It's a good thing that the new government won't deduct our salaries.

898
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,800
Yes. Yes.

899
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,110
Do they pay us in silver dollars?

900
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,820
No. No.

901
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,000
The People's Government pays in RMB, of course.

902
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,110
[Director's Office]

903
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,040
I firmly believe

904
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,990
that the RMB will never end up

905
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,390
like the gold yuan notes.

906
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,080
If you've got something to say, just say it.

907
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,000
Here's the thing, Director Lu.

908
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,360
About the halved salary,

909
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,590
I totally understand.

910
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,500
I have no complaints at all.

911
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,180
But I'm just wondering...

912
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,630
Well...

913
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,620
Can you compensate me?

914
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,110
Okay.

915
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,960
No. No.

916
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,060
I don't want money.

917
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,340
The word "compensate" is a bit too much.

918
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,450
I was wondering

919
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,130
if you could do me a favor.

920
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,290
Well,

921
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,600
could you help me get two tickets for "The White-Haired Girl"?

922
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,040
Just two tickets.

923
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,990
I know.

924
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,620
With your connections,

925
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,870
a quick call could do the trick.

926
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,130
It's just that my mom and Auntie

927
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,580

but they haven't been able to get tickets.
