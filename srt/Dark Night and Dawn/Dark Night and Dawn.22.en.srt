00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,280
You ordered four batches of photo paper from Dezhen Trading Company.

4
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,270
Even after counting these, you've only used up a little more than one box.

5
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,550
Where did the rest go?

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,750
About that...

We mainly serve the neighbors and regular customers,

so we don't have many customers.

You're here.

Mr. Qi, we were all very satisfied with the photos

you took of my mother last time.

39
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,630

We've also

55

checked with Dezhen Trading Company

56
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,040
and found that you bought two more boxes earlier this month.

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,370
Can you use up that much?

58

My business is good, so I naturally use more quickly.

Well, I'm getting old, and my memory's not what it used to be.

Why didn't you report it at the time?

147
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,000
Was it to avoid leaving any traces?

148
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,420
Or maybe

149
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,710
there was no thief at all,

150
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,040
and you used the photo paper

151
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,130
for something else?

152
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,370
What are you trying to imply?

153
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,070
From the start,

154
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,180
you've been deliberately hiding something.

155
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,700
What do you think of Mr. Qi

156
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,780
as a person?

157
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,910
He's diligent in running the studio's business,

158
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
but he's too proud

159
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,030
and has a strange temper.

160
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,310
He doesn't get along well

161
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,280
with the neighboring shops.

162
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,550
Now that he's old,

163
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,270
his memory's failing, and his hands are shaky.

164
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,970
Lately, he's been ruining customers' photos.

165
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,160
I was thinking of asking him to step down,

166
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,730
but he insisted on continuing.

167
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,840
Look what happened, now he's in trouble.

168
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,670
I heard he's even been implicated with agents.

169
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,410
The Young Master already thinks I'm too old

170
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,010
and wants to replace me with someone younger.

171
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,070
If the Young Master finds out

172
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,870
about the stolen photo paper,

173
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,290
he'll definitely fire me.

174
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,550
If I can't take photos,

175
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,950
what else can I do?

176
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,180
I don't know anything else.

177
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,590
Other apprentices

178
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,290
are usually scolded or beaten,

179
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,880
but my master never treated me that way.

180
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,050
He's always sincerely taught me photography,

181
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,930
even introduced customers to me.

182
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,690
He's the best master in the world.

183
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,240
You're at the shop every day, how could something get stolen without you knowing?

184
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,990
The windows of the shop

185
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,040
are all barred with iron.

186
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,360
And you were there the whole time.

187
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,300
How could the photo paper disappear?

188
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,850
The photo paper went missing on a rainy day.

189
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,910
I remember it very clearly.

190
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,300
That morning, I developed a few photos.

191
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,110
By evening, the rain got heavier and heavier,

192
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,760
and there were no customers.

193
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,190
So I sent Xing home.

194
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,230
[Welcome]

195
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,520
The rain is getting heavier.

196
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,660
Go back now.

197
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,390
OK.

198
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,670
I'm leaving, Master.

199
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,870
Be careful on the way.

200
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,500
You should also head home early too!

201
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,900
[Welcome]

202
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,540
Then I hung up the "Closed" sign.

203
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,860
[Closed]

204
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,990
Sir.

205
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,060
I'm here to take pictures.

206
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,110
He had me take

207
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,630
several photos of him,

208
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,690
changing clothes and backdrops.

209
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,380
Close-ups, half-body shots, full-body shots,

210
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,630
I took lots of them.

211
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,150
Look at my hand, right here.

212
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,010
Hold that pose.

213
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,200
Sir, you look very distinguished.

214
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,690
Once the photos are developed,

215
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,530
you'll see how good they turned out.

216
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,600
Can I change my outfit and take another one?

217
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,410
Sure.

218
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Okay.

219
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,740
Come on.

220
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,230
Okay, look here.

221
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,440
Smile a little.

222
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,830
Hold it, hold it.

223
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,230
Smile, smile.

224
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Look here.

225
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,220
Good, hand in position.

226
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,230
Alright.

227
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,030
Good.

228
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,590
This one is good too.

229
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,630
Can I take my hat off for the next one?

230
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,550
No problem.

231
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,760
Let's continue.

232
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,850
Sir, you can look toward the door.

233
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,510
Was it that customer who stole it?

234
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,710
No, no, it wasn't him.

235
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,640
He was with me the whole time

236
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,390
and never left alone.

237
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,570
You said you took many photos of him.

238
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,420
Do you still have the negatives?

239
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,060
Yes.

240
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,770
Look at these photos.

241
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,250
Is there the customer you mentioned?

242
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,030
It's him.

243
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,410
I can recognize him no matter what.

244
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,840
He probably delayed you on purpose,

245
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,450
giving his accomplice a chance

246
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,050
to steal the photo paper.

247
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,710
Young Master, Young Master.

248
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,720
The Public Security Bureau said this has nothing to do with you.

249
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,510
This involves agents, and you still say it's unrelated?

250
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,100
Pack your things and go home to retire.

251
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,980
Young Master.

252
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,470
The Young Master is being unreasonable.

253
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,070
Bro,

254
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,790
the photo paper

255
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,530
did leave from Mr. Qi's studio,

256
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,480
but who would've thought it was an agent who stole it?

257
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Now our lead is cut off again.

258
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,500
There's still something suspicious here.

259
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,630
What's suspicious?

260
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,290
There are many ways for agents

261
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
to get photo paper.

262
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,900
They could use a fake identity

263
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,270
or have someone buy it for them directly.

264
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,970
Why go through the trouble of stealing it?

265
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,230
To save money?

266
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,950
Director!

267
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
It's bad!

268
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,750
The families of those businessmen are gathered

269
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,420
outside the Public Security Bureau demanding their release,

270
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
and there are lots of reporters too.

271
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,630
Let's go and take a look.

272
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,550
Public Security Officers, I beg you,

273
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,020
[Shanghai People's Government Public Security Bureau]

274
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,830
please release our Mr. Qian.

275
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,190
Please release our Mr. Zhang.

276
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,950
Mrs. Qian, I already told you

277
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,350
when I visited your home.

278
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,590
The people who took your husband were agents.

279
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,020
We're doing everything we can to investigate.

280
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,270
But the newspapers already said

281
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,350
it was you who arrested them.

282
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,950
The newspapers don't lie!

283
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes, it was you who took them!

284
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,470
Please, let them go.

285
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,070
Then kneel! Kneeling will help!

286
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,110
We support you.

287
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,140
I'm begging you. My child and I are kneeling down to you.

288
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,920
Get up.

289
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,080
Begging won't help.

290
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,630
We're not getting any straight answers from them.

291
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,890
There's no point in wasting our efforts.

292
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,550
Get up.

293
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,280
I beg you. Please let them go...

294
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,230
Auntie,

295
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,570
my father's name is Jin Maochang.

296
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,260
He was also kidnapped

297
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,850
and is still missing.

298
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,900
I am also a family member of a victim.

299
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,450
Please, listen to me this one time.

300
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,830
Don't easily believe

301
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,120
those irresponsible newspapers.

302
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,560
Delaying the Public Security's investigation

303
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,340
will only reduce the chances of our loved ones

304
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,400
being found alive.

305
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Please, stand up.

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,380
I beg you.

307
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,470
Get up!

308
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,940
Dr. Jin is right.

309
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,000
We will do our best

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,650
to find your family members as soon as possible.

311
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,530
Please trust the People's Police.

312
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,250
Alright?

313
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,470
Get up.

314
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,150
OK. Hurry up. Get up.

315
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,630
Then we'll trust you one more time.

316
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,240
Please, I beg you!

317
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,610
You must save Mr. Qian!

318
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,240
As if he could be saved!

319
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,430
I'm begging you, please!

320
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,350
Alright?

321
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,190
He's the backbone of our family!

322
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,100
Who's that person?

323
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,010
A family member.

324
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,550
Here to cause trouble.

325
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,880
A family member? More like just here to watch the commotion.

326
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,110
What's his name? Which family is he from?

327
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,470
I think his surname is Gao. He's Gao Huaipu's son.

328
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,130
Gao Huaipu's son?

329
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,670
Go home.

330
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Head home for now.

331
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,600
The Police Pigeon Squad

332
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,030
is on the rooftop, right?

333
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,160
Yes, why?

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,470
Didn't Lin Shaobai keep insisting

335
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,070
on investigating this case?

336
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,450
Who knows what trouble he'll stir up?

337
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,870
Let's go and see.

338
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,070
I'm not going. Bro.

339
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,460
He calls me "Doggy” every day.

340
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,690
He spits whenever he sees me.

341
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,630
I can't hit him,

342
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,190
and I can't spit back as well as he does.

343
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,530
I'm not good with words. I'm not going.

344
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,990
There's two of us, and we can't out-spit him?

345
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,150
A zombie breaks out of the coffin.

346
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,590
It smashes two large drums beside it.

347
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,610
Do you know what falls out of those drums?

348
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,680
A purple sword case.

349
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,870
Suddenly, from inside the purple sword case,

350
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,630
a 30 feet long purple dragon flies out.

351
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,810
The purple dragon swipes,

352
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,110
and the zombies fall down instantly.

353
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,580
Just as Li Yingqiong was about to be happy,

354
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,800
the purple dragon suddenly

355
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,790
charged toward her.

356
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,270
She was startled

357
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,390
and immediately started running.

358
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,750
She runs, and the purple dragon chases.

359
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,030
The dragon chases and chases,

360
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,750
but suddenly it gets stuck

361
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,920
between some branches.

362
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,430
Seeing this, Li Yingqiong

363
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,570
quickly pulls out her sword.

364
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,710
The two begin to fight fiercely.

365
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,330
At that moment, a white eagle

366
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,170
suddenly descends from the sky.

367
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,240
This white eagle was formidable.

368
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,099
In just a few moves, it turned the purple dragon into ashes.

369
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,060
At that moment,

370
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,839
Li Yingqiong collapses and faints.

371
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,099
The next day, when she wakes up,

372
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,220
there's a purple sword lying beside her,

373
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,109
with two characters carved on it,

374
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,980
"Violet Spirit".

375
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
This is what they call,

376
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,850
“A blessing in disguise.”

377
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,060
The moral of this story is

378
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,300
that life is like that, whether you're a person or a pigeon.

379
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,230
You understand?

380
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,270
You are my white eagles.

381
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,030
You protect me,

382
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,390
and I will protect you.

383
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,710
Alright?

384
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,820
White eagles, come!

385
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,030
Trying to keep an eye on me, huh?

386
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,110
Mr. Huang.

387
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,360
Mrs. Lin.

388
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,230
Are the rice cakes sold out?

389
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,570
Even if I could make them,

390
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,870
I'm afraid people couldn't afford them.

391
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,730
The market price of it is outrageous.

392
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,780
Then please pack me six pan-fried buns.

393
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,870
Huang,

394
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,950
you're familiar with the people who sell rice and flour.

395
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,150
Can you ask someone to help me get two bags of rice?

396
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,730
I can't seem to get any.

397
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,090
My family's running out of rice.

398
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,350
I'll give you the money now.

399
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,230
Please, you must help me.

400
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,680
Huang, we're all neighbors.

401
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,710
Don't favor one over the other.

402
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,070
Help me get two bags as well.

403
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,440
Mrs. Li, take the money back.

404
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,210
Everyone, put your money away.

405
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,780
It's not that I don't want to help,

406
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,830
but my breakfast shop

407
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,280
is also struggling.

408
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,380
Look, once I burn through this coal,

409
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,460
I'll have to close the shop.

410
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,700
Huang. Even you can't get it?

411
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,630
There's no stock in the market.

412
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,830
Even if you have money, you can't buy it.

413
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,800
What are we going to do then?

414
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,120
I thought things would get better,

415
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,810
but now even getting food

416
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,330
has become a problem, right?

417
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,320
Yeah, it's really tough.

418
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,750
How are we supposed to live like this? It's truly hard.

419
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,500
Shaobai, what's going on?

420
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,350
This laundry has already been washed,

421
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,350
but it still smells bad.

422
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,960
Haven't you been transferred to that bureau for work?

423
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
Why is this still happening?

424
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,120
There's some special mission going on.

425
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,140
Wait, I know.

426
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,490
Is it that case

427
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,720
where those big bosses were kidnapped?

428
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,530
Yeah.

429
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,900
Nothing escapes your sharp eyes.

430
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,190
Okay.

431
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,790
I read in the papers.

432
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,220
Isn't your Uncle Jin also one of the ones kidnapped?

433
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,020
How's the investigation going?

434
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,430
Mom. We have rules.

435
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,710
I can't talk about it.

436
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,970
But you can relax.

437
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,030
Right now, Uncle Jin and the other businessmen

438
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,270
are still giving orders

439
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,590
about their shipping goods overseas.

440
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,510
That means

441
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,040
they're still safe for now.

442
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,530
Then during this time,

443
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,830
you should spend more time with Jin Yan.

444
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,720
I know.

445
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,050
Do you want to eat something?

446
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,710
Where did my mother go?

447
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,790
Your mom?

448
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,670
During the day, she's running around the neighborhood,

449
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,430
and at night, she's out playing mahjong. She hasn't come back yet.

450
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,670
Playing mahjong?

451
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,750
You're both here?

452
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,020
We were just talking about you.

453
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm exhausted. My back is killing me.

454
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,910
Come, let me pour you some water.

455
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,230
Sis. I'll do it myself.

456
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,310
Playing mahjong is so tiring?

457
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,110
These days, when I play mahjong,

458
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,960
it's not for fun.

459
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,390
I play to strengthen the bond

460
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,270
between the Taiping Lane community

461
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,690
and the Xingfu Lane community.

462
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,960
Let me tell you something.

463
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,340
Today at the table,

464
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,840
Gao from the Xingfu Lane said his father

465
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,610
was kidnapped,

466
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,150
and they don't know when he'll be released.

467
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,440
Really?

468
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,050
In Xingfu Lane, they also have

469
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,910
someone important enough to be kidnapped by agents?

470
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,770
You see? You didn't know, did you?

471
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,710
Do you know who Gao's father is?

472
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,130
The Flour King,

473
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,780
Gao Huaipu.

474
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,230
But they've cut ties as father and son.

475
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,710
Gao ended up in this mess.

476
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,960
He deserves it.

477
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,530
He brought this on himself.

478
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,160
His father has been kidnapped,

479
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,420
and he still has the mood to play mahjong?

480
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
You're right.

481
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,990
Mom,

482
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,390
can you help me set up another mahjong game with him?

483
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,690
I'll cover the losses.

484
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,580
What are you talking about?

485
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,060
We don't play for money anymore.

486
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,760
We're just using playing cards.

487
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,830
It's mainly to keep up relationships.

488
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,630
I know,

489
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,850
but I need you to arrange a game with him.

490
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,560
It's to help me investigate.

491
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,510
Think about it.

492
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,260
His father has been kidnapped,

493
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,850
and he still has the mood to play mahjong.

494
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,530
Isn't that suspicious?

495
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,860
You're right.

496
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,690
But

497
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,590
if there's something suspicious,

498
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,920
why not just bring him in for questioning?

499
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,550
No, the case is too big.

500
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,310
We can't alert him too soon.

501
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,390
For now, just set up the mahjong game

502
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,550
and see if we can get any information from him.

503
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,810
If this case gets solved,

504
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,370
you'll be credited for it.

505
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,510
That's great!

506
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,350
I'll get credit for it?

507
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,190
Of course.

508
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,290
Alright, I'll help you arrange it tomorrow.

509
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,840
[Closed]

510
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,800
Master.

511
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,190
Master!

512
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,100
Master, why did you do this?

513
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,290
Someone help!

514
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,600
Help!

515
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,510
This is terrible.

516
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,110
Come, help me!

517
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,490
Mr. Qi!

518
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,960
Mr. Qi!

519
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,140
Mr. Qi!

520
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,320
Mr. Qi!

521
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,000
Everyone,

522
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,070
move aside.

523
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,400
Make way over here.

524
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,030
There's nothing to see here.

525
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,470
Make some space, please.

526
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,000
I came to work this morning,

527
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,100
and as soon as I opened the door, I found my master hanging.

528
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,250
When I left yesterday, everything was fine.

529
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,130
Who would've thought he'd take such a drastic step?

530
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,700
Did you see anyone suspicious?

531
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,190
No.

532
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,110
My master treated me so well.

533
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,790
He taught me photography sincerely.

534
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,430
Dr. Jin,

535
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,900
was it murder or suicide?

536
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,830
There are four signs of death by hanging,

537
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,060
closed eyes, open mouth, clenched hands, and exposed teeth.

538
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,080
The tongue is usually protruding.

539
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,620
If someone is killed and then made to look like a hanging,

540
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,230
the mouth and eyes will be open, the hands loose, and the tongue not protruding.

541
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,650
And from the two marks on his neck,

542
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,820
one of them lacks signs of bleeding.

543
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,740
We can conclude that this mark

544
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,220
was made after death when the body was hung.

545
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,290
From these indicators,

546
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,810
it's clearly murder.

547
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,750
Oh, and I also found sand on the body

548
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,870
similar to the last case.

549
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,730
I'll take it back for testing

550
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,870
and get it to you as soon as possible.

551
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,150
And look here,

552
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,230
there are drag marks.

553
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,490
This wasn't the primary crime scene.

554
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,520
Who is it?

555
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,990
Mr. Qi, I'm here to pick up some photos.

556
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,330
Wait a moment.

557
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,000
Who let you in?

558
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,860
I'm developing photos right now.

559
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,390
It's you?

560
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,120
You're an agent.

561
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,590
You've taken photos of others for decades,

562
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,830
but never one of yourself, right?

563
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,700
Let me take one for you.

564
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,470
Your photo will appear

565
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,240
in all the newspapers in Shanghai.

566
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,750
You've worked quietly your whole life.

567
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,210
It's time to get some fame.

568
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,180
Here are two news articles, send them

569
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,890
along with the photos.

570
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,470
Should we get a few sharp-tongued people

571
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,020
to stir things up at the scene?

572
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,690
No need.

573
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,240
Good news doesn't travel far,

574
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,820
but bad news spreads like wildfire.

575
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,980
It's human nature.

576
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,620
We just go along with it.

577
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,470
Do you think Mr. Qi would've died

578
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,740
if the police hadn't come?

579
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,270
Exactly.

580
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,950
It was that guy who took Mr. Qi away.

581
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,310
I saw it with my own eyes.

582
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,270
He was fine, and now he's dead.

583
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,790
Isn't this disregarding human life?

584
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,270
Yeah.

585

-Yeah.

00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,140
You can't twist the facts.

589
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,550
We brought Mr. Qi in just for questioning.

590
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,750
Just for questioning. Would that drive him to hang himself?

591
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,870
-Right.
-Yeah.

592
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,900
He was just questioned, and now he's gone?

593
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,810
Mr. Qi was murdered,

594
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,850
not hanged.

595
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,550

596
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,180
Yes.

597

It's burning my hands.

619

Where are you going?

620

It's no use if you go.

The director isn't here.

626
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,260
Where did he go?

627
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,310
To the bureau.

628
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,110
He said he needed to report to Deputy Commissioner Yang.

629
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,020
Is he coming to the bureau to request punishment again?

630
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,780
I don't know.

631
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,000
Nobody dares to bring this up to the director.

632
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,860
What's the point in avoiding the topic?

633
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,020
When did he leave?

634
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,790
It's been a while.

635
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,230
He should almost be there by now.

636
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,390
Alright, I'm at the bureau.

637
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,250

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,990
Aren't you supposed to be at the pigeon station?

640
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,960
Why are you leaving your post?

641
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,740
You've got the nerve to worry about me?

642
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,540
You're...

643
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,980
You're already neck-deep in trouble.

every time something goes wrong?

651
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,820
Deputy Commissioner Yang hasn't even said anything,

652
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,440
and you're already punishing yourself.

653
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,770
Are you out of your mind?

What are you doing?

655
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,390
That Mr. Qi case is definitely a murder.

656
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,190
If Deputy Commissioner Yang blames you,

657
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,250
just tell him that.

658
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,580
Whether there's evidence or not,

659

you have to say that.

I know you're all about following the rules

and looking at evidence.

664
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,640
Isn't Jin Yan in charge of the autopsy?

665
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,900
Did she find anything?

666
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,700
According to the rules, you have no right to know

667
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,650
what happens with the Social Affairs Office and me.

668
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,050
I'm looking out for you, and you're talking to me about rules?

669
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,520
Go ahead and ask for punishment if you want!

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,990

They're short-staffed at the pigeon station.

[Forensic Report of the Forensics Department of Shanghai People's Government Public Security Bureau]

676
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,010
Not long ago,

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,210
they pretended to be the PLA and kidnapped the capitalists,

678
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,310
just to put our Shanghai Public Security

679
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,450
under intense public pressure.

680
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,260
Now they've directly targeted you.

are often more destructive

683
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,960
than bombs made of gunpowder.

684
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,270
There were indeed shortcomings

685
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,790
in my handling of the case.

Back at Mr. Qi's,

687
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,100
I had my doubts.

688
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,050
The agents could have easily bought photo paper themselves,

689
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,180
so why steal it?

690
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,020
Now I see.

691
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,760
They had already investigated

693
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,800
and background,

694
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,190
and set a trap.

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,430
They waited for me to investigate the photo paper,

696
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,360

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,310
This is ridiculous! My luck is terrible today.

743
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,810
Here you go.

744
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,520
Mr. Gao, are you out of money?

745
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,110
Mrs. Lin,

746
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,920
could you lend me a bit more?

747
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,580
Look, it's not even 10 o'clock yet.

748
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,080
Let me tell you, the three of us are having great luck today.

749
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,760
Even if I lend you money, you'll still lose.

750
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,900
I think we should call it a night. Alright?

751
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,310
Okay.

752
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,150
Let's stop here.

753
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,310
Yeah, you're not going to get out of this hole tonight.

754
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,470
Alright, let's go, let's go.

755
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,370
I just owe you a little bit of money.

756
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,770
I'll pay you back tenfold this month, okay?

757
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,180
You mean it?

758
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,960
Of course.

759
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,070
Mr. Gao, tenfold?

760
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,620
Are you talking about making money by your suit shop?

761
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,270
Let's not bring that up anymore, okay?

762
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,500
Today, I'm going to be a good person.

763
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,160
Let's just pretend we played for free, alright?

764
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,420
We'll give you back everything we won,

765
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,890
let's say it was all for fun, like a neighborhood social event.

766
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,910
Here, take it back.

767
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,400
Alright?

768
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,590
We'll play another day.

769
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,830
Let's go.

770
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,690
Take your money back, and let's play one more round.

771
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,960
Come on.

772
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,720
Then just one more round, alright?

773
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,070
Ladies, don't look down on me.

774
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,210
My father's money and factory

775
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,280
will soon be mine.

776
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,880
By then, I won't be short of your little money.

777
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,060
You were kicked out of the family by your father.

778
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,810
The money and the factory

779
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,420
are all going to your sister.

780
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,290
She's already made it clear

781
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,800
that you're not getting anything.

782
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,570
Exactly!

783
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,000
He was kidnapped before he even made a will.

784
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,590
My sister's busy opening a branch factory in the northeast.

785
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,900
She won't be coming back.

786
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,450
If he doesn't leave it to me, who will he leave it to?

787
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,600
Mr. Gao,

788
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,990
no wonder you've been so cheerful lately.

789
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,260
But I have a feeling your father is the kind of person

790
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,760
blessed by fate.

791
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,470
Who knows, maybe the Public Security will save him,

792
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,820
and you still won't get a penny.

793
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,970
That seems unlikely.

794
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,840
My father's asthma has worsened this year.

795
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,350
He needs to carry medicine with him at all times,

796
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,380
and it's got to be this special American drug.

797
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,280
I reckon he's going to run out of it soon.

798
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,430
When his medicine runs out and he can't catch his breath,

799
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,460
all this money will be mine.

800
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,140
Do you think I'd be short of your little change?

801
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,310
Come on, let's play.

802
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,760
Mr. Gao,

803
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,820
you've got a ruthless heart.

804
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,900
Indeed.

805
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,920
What kind of father doesn't leave his family business to his sons

806
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,160
but his daughter?

807
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,920
He's the truly heartless one.

808
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,180
Tell me.

809
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,360
What kind of special medicine?

810
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,180
Come in.

811
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,560
Go out.

812
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,940
I knew you were still working overtime.

813
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,860
I brought you the best pan-fried buns.

814
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,970
Thank you.

815
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,070
No need to thank me.

816
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,630
I need to ask you something.

817
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,350
Go ahead.

818
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,060
[The virus is a type of microorganism with a very simple structure.]

819
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,239
I understand.

820
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,610
You have rules.

821
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,409
Where can I buy

822
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,900
Isoproterenol Lozenges?

823
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,810
This medication was just developed in the U.S. a couple of years ago.

824
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,110
If it's available in Shanghai, it must be very rare.

825
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,120
Why do you need it?

826
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,139
I'm helping someone else inquire.

827
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,909
That Hu from the Police Pigeon Squad

828
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,790
has asthma.

829
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,980
Then could you help me find out

830
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,659
which pharmacy in Shanghai

831
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,860
sells this medication?

832
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,460
Got it.

833
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,280
As for this report,

834
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,820
you need to submit it to Lu as soon as possible.

835
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,550
Otherwise, I might crack the case before he does.

836
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,360
Have you discovered any important clues?

837
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,850
That's confidential for now.

838
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,360
Is it appropriate for you to sit here?

839
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,720
Make sure you help me inquire, alright?

840
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,640
Eat it while it's hot, remember.

841
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,390
Mr. Yang,

842
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,650
[Yang's Cloth]

843
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,640
the sign you ordered from Lanting Studio

844
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,000
has been delivered to you.

845
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,300
Where's your boss?

846
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,390
He's busy today.

847
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,410
He asked me to install it for you.

848
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,140
Shall we check the goods first?

849
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,260
If everything's fine,

850
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,050
you can settle the balance.

851
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,720
Here's the invoice.

852
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,700
Come in and talk.

853
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,460
Alright.

854
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,050
Let's settle the bill once the exterior wall's advertising painting is done.

855
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,850
Have your boss come by tomorrow.

856
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,020
We'll settle it after it's painted.

857
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,990
Mr. Yang.

858
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,150
I'm really sorry,

859
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,350
But our boss has something on tomorrow and can't make it.

860
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,550
The day after tomorrow works too.

861
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,440
The day after tomorrow won't do either.

862
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,790
He's going far away,

863
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,880
leaving tomorrow.

864
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,120
When will he be back?

865
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,350
How can I ask too much

866
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,710
about the boss's affairs?

867
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,550
But don't worry.

868
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,510
As to how to paint this,

869
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,570
he has already designed it.

870
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,400
I brought the paint too.

871
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,950
I'll make sure to get it right for you.

872
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,590
I sought out your studio

873
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,270
because I valued Mr. Zheng's skills,

874
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,960
and he had previously promised

875
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,490
to come and paint himself.

876
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,890
You go back and tell your boss

877
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,910
to make time in the next few days

878
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,370
to come and paint it for me.

879
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,050
Mr. Yang, I'm just an employee.

880
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,540
What I say doesn't matter.

881
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
You can leave now.

882
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,450
When your boss comes back,

883
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,070
I'll personally talk to him.

884
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,450
Business must be conducted with integrity,

885
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,930
and he had promised before,

886
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,340
how can he go back on his word?

887
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,020
Besides,

888
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,640
can what you paint be valued

889
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,130
the same as what he paints?

890
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,650
Please calm down.

891
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,880
I will definitely convey your message.

892
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,380
Then I'll take my leave.

893
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,030
Alright.

894
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,580
That old guy is quite crafty.

895
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,220
If he had come today, I would definitely have killed him.

896
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,400
If Zheng doesn't come,

897
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,860
killing just one employee won't do any good.

898
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,020
Bro,

899
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,850
do you think he's not coming

900
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,450
because we've been exposed?

901
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,970
It's uncertain.

902
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,130
He promised well before,

903
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,210
but a last-minute change could indicate suspicion.

904
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,150
Here's the thing.

905
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,350
Instead of waiting for them to take action,

906
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,030
it's better for us to act first.

907
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,780
Alright, when?

908
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,880
You don't need to worry about that. I'll go alone this time.

909
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,960
That won't do.

910
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,690
They're all agents.

911
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,900
They're not easy to deal with.

912
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,560
I can't let you go by yourself.

913
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,720
Listen to me.

914
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,010
You stay behind.

915
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,700
If something goes wrong,

916
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,030
Dabao and Xiaobao will be in your care.

917
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,360
Although Jin Maochang promised me

918
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,290
he'd help take care of the two kids,

919
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,510
I don't trust him.

920
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,820
If something really happens to me,

921
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,070
then I won't have any value for him anymore.

922
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,500
How long can he manage?

923
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,750
I have no expectations of him at all.

924
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,200
The only person I can trust is you.

925
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,560
If I don't come back,

926
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,850
take the money and the kids and leave Shanghai quickly.

927
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,000
Don't ever come back.

928
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,010
Bro, what are you talking about?

929
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,770
Just listen to me.

930
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,840
Why should I listen to you?

931
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,710
How about we go together,

932
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,110
or it'll just be me going?

933
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,950
Okay, let's go together.

934
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,200
Really?

935
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,720
Really.

936
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,060
Alright then.

937
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,600
Dabao and Xiaobao went to the tutor's in the morning.

938
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,990
They'll be done with school soon.

939
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,590
Can you go pick them up for me?

940
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,500
After they go to class in the afternoon,

941
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,560
we'll plan well in the house.

942
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,860
Sure, we can discuss it when I get back.

943
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,440
I'm leaving now, Bro.

944
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:27,910
Okay.

945
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,720
Be careful on the way.

946
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,440
Sure thing.

947
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,010
Jiang, you're looking sharp today.

948
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,290
Why is he ignoring you when you greet him?

949
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,810
[My money is all under the fifth floorboard on the left.]

950
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,810
[If I can't come back, take them with you.]

951
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,410
Mr. Zheng.

952
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,500
Mr. Yang, you're here.

953
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,900
Is Mr. Zheng around? I'm looking for him.

954
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,930
He's upstairs handling something.

955
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,500
Why don't you take a seat for now

956
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,190
and wait a moment?

957
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,050
He promised to come and paint for me,

958
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,260
but he hasn't shown up.

959
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,450
Other people's matters are important,

960
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,670
but mine aren't, right?

961
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,020
I'm going to find him and sort this out.

962
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,710
Sorry, Mr. Yang.

963
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,430
Mr. Yang!

964
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,420
There are guests upstairs; it's really inconvenient right now.

965
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,270
Here's the deal. Once he's free,

966
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,720
I'll have him come down right away.

967
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,980
Would that be alright?

968
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,910
Okay.

969
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,160
I'll give you some face

970
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,800
and wait for him to finish.

971
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,780
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

972
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,440
Come on, sit in the inner room.

973
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,930
Please take a seat.

974
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,460
You sit. I'll go brew you a cup of tea.

975
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,190
Li Xu,

976
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,930
bring over the promotional brochure.

977
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,600
Okay.

978
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,310
Mr. Yang.

979
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,020
Are you upset

980
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,680
about the promotional mural on your store's exterior?

981
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,160
I heard from the staff.

982
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,890
Zheng knows about it too.

983
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,770
In a while,

984
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,340
he'll definitely give you a satisfactory response.

985
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,620
Don't worry.

986
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,490
Take a look at our promotional brochure.

987
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,860
When Zheng comes down,

988
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,410
you can discuss it with him.

989
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,040
It's so hot outside.

990
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,060
It easily makes people feel uneasy.

991
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,940
I'll brew you some green tea.

992
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,150
Here, have a cup to cool off.

993
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,630
Mr. Yang, I can see that you're still not feeling well.

994
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,820
How about this?

995
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,800
Let me apologize to you

996
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,390
with tea instead of wine.

997
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,810
This should work, right?

998
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,280
Mr. Yang, please calm down.

999
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,430
If you're like this,

1000
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,110
how can I dare to ask Zheng to come down?
