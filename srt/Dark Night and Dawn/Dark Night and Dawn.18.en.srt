[Episode 18]

3
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,860
The copperplate is like a hen that lays eggs.

4
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,350
Will Shrike give it to us easily?

5
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,580
Accept it if he gives it to us.

6
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,950
If he won't,

7
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,550
we'll snatch it.

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,620
Boss,

9
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,190
agents are ruthless.

10
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,750
Don't you think it's too risky to snatch it?

11
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,330
You don't understand.

12
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,640
Shanghai is now controlled by the Communist Party.

13
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,350
I heard Master Qin is also trying to befriend the new government.

14
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,590
I'm afraid it'll be

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,450
hard for our gang to survive in the future.

16
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,790
After we get the copperplate, let's make a fortune.

17
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,270
It's the final way out

18
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,140
for our gang and our brothers.

19
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,320
So the risk

20
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,310
is worth taking.

21
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,250
Boss, you always think for us.

22
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,750
We'll listen to you.

23
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,630
Wealth is obtained from taking risks.

24
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,710
Go to the dock

25
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,320
and pick a dozen men.

26
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,190
I want strong men

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,150
who dare to risk their lives.

28
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,470
Give each of them ten silver dollars.

29
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,650
And take care of their family members.

30
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,100
We should be prepared

31
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,020
for a fierce battle.

[Counterfeit banknotes' case]

33
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,820
According to Mr. Qin,

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,120
this woman named Dai Yueqing

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,490
is the current boss of the Hook Sword Gang.

36
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,390
The Hook Sword Gang

37
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,190
is a small gang among the over 30,000 dock workers

38
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,310
in Shanghai.

39
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,150
It was established in the 16th year of the Republic of China.

40
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,320
The boss at that time

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,870
was Dai Yueqing's husband.

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
Later, he died in a fight.

43
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,550
Dai Yueqing joined forces with gang members

44
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,420
to kill the three elders of the gang

45
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,579
and throw them into the Huangpu River.

46
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,070
Then she became the boss.

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,540
Although this woman

48
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,079
looks weak,

49
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,190
in fact, she's ruthless.

50
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,200
After Dai Yueqing became the boss,

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
in addition to continuing to control the dock workers,

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,710
she leveraged the convenience of water and land transportation

53
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,910
to engage in various kinds of business.

54
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,930
So engaging in the counterfeit banknote business is consistent

55
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,800
with Dai Yueqing's style of prioritizing benefits above all else.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,840
They continually circulate counterfeit banknotes

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,730
by controlling the company behind the scenes.

58
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,390
It's hard for us to find traces.

59
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,800
If the business is not very profitable,

60
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,340
a gang like this

61
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,890
doesn't need to collaborate with agents.

62
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,150
It's too risky.

63
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,750
They'll be put in jail and sentenced to death if they get caught.

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,030
Her spies are all over the dock.

65
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,250
It'll be hard to catch her if we go rashly.

66
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,130
We don't need to fight with her.

67
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,630
How about this?

68
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,850
Let's ask Mr. Qin to ask her out

69
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,180
to have tea.

70
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,440
I asked you to rent three warehouses.

71
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,670
It's already the end of the month.

72
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,270
How come you only rented one?

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,300
I've talked to everyone willing to negotiate,

74
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,430
but they still wouldn't rent a warehouse to us.

75
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,310
Now those capable entrepreneurs

76
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,230
are busy with storing up supplies.

77
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,510
Do you think we should use some tricks?

78
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,530
You just can't forget the gang's way of doing things, right?

79
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,190
How many times have I told you?

80
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,060
This is a different era.

81
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,840
On the surface, we should learn to do business.

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,720
Raise the price if they don't want to rent it.

83
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,540
Understand?

84
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,640
Yes, I'll do my best.

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,320
You have to get it done.

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,060
Boss,

87
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,410
Master Qin sent someone here to deliver an invitation.

88
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,590
Invite him in.

Master Qin wants to invite you to his place to talk about business.

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,850
Why does Master Qin think of me now?

93
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,200
I thought Master Qin had forgotten me.

[Ms. Dai Yueqing, I invite you to Qin's Mansion to talk about business]

other gangs have disbanded.

97

Only your gang has prospered.

98
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,050
I heard you don't have enough warehouses to store your supplies.

99
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,350
Master Qin is well-informed.

100
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,680
I wonder what business Master Qin wants to talk about.

101
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,250
Of course it's profitable business.

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,980
You'll know when you get there.

103
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,820
Okay.

No hurry. Just wait a little longer.

117
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,630

We can negotiate properly if it's two million dollars.

185

Looks like you don't want to negotiate.

Since ancient times, officials and bandits have been on the same side.

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,860
I make money for you and you protect me.

188
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,140
Is there any better business than this?

189
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,170
Boss Dai,

190
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,400
don't play your old tricks in front of us.

191
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,120
Tell us about the counterfeit banknotes

192
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,070
and give us information on agents.

193
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,850
This is your only way out.

194
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,640
Boss Dai,

195
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,520
you're aware of today's situation.

196
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,740
Even if you don't think for yourself,

197
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,700
you should think for your men.

198
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,510
Do you want them

199
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,760
to get shot or live well?

200
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,990
It's up to you.

201
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,590
You are also a boss.

202
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,700
Just tell us your choice.

203
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,120
Looks like you don't want to talk here.

204
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,370
Then we can only talk in the Public Security Bureau.

205
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,660
Forget it.

206
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,190
I give in.

207
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,560
I can cooperate with you.

208
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,400
But you have to keep me

209
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,510
and my men alive.

210
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,530
Otherwise, I'll bite off my tongue.

211
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,050
And I promise you won't be able to find out anything.

212
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,930
We'll consider

213
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,090
your condition.

214
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,510
But you have to go back to the bureau

215
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,110
with us to tell us everything

216
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,810
before we give you a reply.

217
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,580
Please.

218
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,180
You want to catch Shrike?

219
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,950
Shrike?

220
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,100
What are you talking about?

221
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,710
You should know what I'm talking about.

222
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,250
You asked Master Qin to ask me out

223
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,110
and asked me to cooperate with you

224
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,990
just to find him, right?

225
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,610
It's good that you know.

226
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,810
How do you usually meet?

227
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,680
It's very hard to meet him.

228
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,810
You know the rules of making contact.

229
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,300
He always came to me.

230
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,960
But we agreed to meet

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,460
in the next couple of days.

232
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,050
When? Where?

233
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,860
We'll meet here at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

234
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,780
Okay, see you tomorrow.

235
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
See you tomorrow.

236
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,810
The day after tomorrow.

237
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,240
In St. Joseph's Church.

238
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,680
But I think I should still remind you.

239
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,990
It's very likely that

240
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,490
he planted a spy around me.

241
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,670
If you take me to the Public Security Bureau,

242
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,110
once the news gets out,

243
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,610
it'll be hard

244
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,330
to catch him.

245
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,360
What do you want?

246
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,390
Go home as usual.

247
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,660
Pretend nothing has happened.

248
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,710
You can pretend to be Master Qin's men.

249
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,040
You can go home with me and keep an eye on me.

250
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,740
As long as I stay safe today and tomorrow,

251
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,770
you can catch him.

252
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,890
Huzi!

253
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,550
Yes!

254
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,320
Director.

255
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,710
Keep an eye on her.

256
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,340
Yes.

257
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,970
Shrike really is still alive?

258
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,320
No wonder you always suspected

259
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,050
if Yang Hui was the real Shrike.

260
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,010
There's another possibility.

261
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,340
Someone else used the code name of Shrike.

262
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,470
Anyway, we'll focus on Dai Yueqing and continue to investigate.

263
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,340
We'll find out who on earth he is.

264
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,420
But Dai Yueqing's reaction was a little abnormal just now.

265
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,550
She changed her attitude too suddenly.

266
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,750
It's not that simple.

267
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,990
There must be something wrong.

268
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,190
Then let her go back.

269
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,680
We have so many men. She can't escape.

270
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,780
Yang,

271
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,600
Mr. Jin is really generous.

272
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,960
He gave this car to us?

273
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,970
You think too much.

274
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,470
It's for our use.

275
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,520
I'll be his assistant from now on.

276
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,390
Yang,

277
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,190
I don't think we can

278
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,330
make much money by doing this.

279
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,430
We should think about doing some kind of business in the future.

280
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,490
Doing business is more difficult than killing people.

281
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,350
That's true.

282
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,990
Dan Dan Noodles! Wontons! Authentic Dan Dan Noodles!

283
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,880
Are you hungry?

284
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,170
A little.

285
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,090
During the Counter-Japanese War,

286
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,600
we hid in Sichuan.

287
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,840
We developed a liking for that.

288
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,660
Yes.

289
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,160
Go buy two bowls.

290
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,400
Buy two bowls? Let's go.

291
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,590
Dan Dan Noodles! Wontons! Authentic Dan Dan Noodles!

292
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,840
Dan Dan Noodles!

293
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,100
I want two bowls of noodles.

294
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,300
Okay, wait a moment.

295
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,370
Okay. Please

296
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,750
add more chili sauce.

297
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,450
Okay.

298
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,660
Have a seat.

299
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,360
It's okay.

300
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,740
Walk faster. Director Lu.

301
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,210
Boss Dai, you've earned a lot.

302
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,050
Boss Dai,

303
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,290
it's been a long day.

304
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,020
Can you make some tea for us?

305
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,130
I only make tea for my friends.

306
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,040
Okay. Where is your tea and tea pot?

307
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,660
Take me there. I'll make tea.

308
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,710
Come with me.

309
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,710
Huzi.

310
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,350
Search carefully.

311
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,990
Zhengyang.

312
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,930
Look at this.

313
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,650
Have some tea, Boss Dai.

314
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,010
We've checked this place. The gate is the only exit.

315
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,710
You guys go on.

316
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I'm going upstairs to take a shower.

317
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,970
Thank you.

318
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,790
Boss Dai, thank you for your tea.

319
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,700
There is a secret passage in her bedroom upstairs.

320
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,360
She doesn't want to collaborate with us. She wants to escape.

321
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,370
No wonder she agreed to cooperate so soon.

322
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,710
She really is up to no good.

323
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,330
She wants to escape.

324
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,610
Then let her escape.

325
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,690
Huzi.

326
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,950
Tell everyone to leave first.

327
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,440
Loose on the outside but stringent on the inside.

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,950
Yes.

329
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,230
You go back to the bureau and ask Zhang to wait for my call.

330
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,190
Got it.

331
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,850
Boss, hurry up.

332
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,650
Okay.

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,650
[Lanting Studio]

334
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,960
I put the money here.

335
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,720
Boss, a bowl of noodles.

336
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,580
Wait a minute.

337
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,600
Less chili sauce.

338
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,250
Okay. Here.

339
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,480
I'll return the bowls later.

340
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,470
Okay. Goodbye.

[Lanting Studio]

342
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,270
Use this.

343
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,120
Okay.

344
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,150
Sit down and wait.

345
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,910
It's okay.

346
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,500
Dan Dan Noodles!

347
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,880
There are two men. Could it be they're the police?

348
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,310
I don't think the police would

349
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,840
expose themselves just for a bowl of noodles.

350
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,490
Who could they be?

351
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,920
Officer, with you here today,

352
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,570
I can sleep well.

353
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,700
Would you like a drink upstairs?

354
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,140
No, Boss Dai.

355
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,190
Are you worried the wine is poisonous?

356
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,120
I don't drink when I'm on a mission.

357
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,450
You're not romantic. Good night.

358
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,070
They are here.

359
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
To prevent Dai Yueqing and her men from taking advantage of the chaos,

360
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
we have cleared the church.

361
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,100
Dai Yueqing is lucky

362
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,180
that she can die in front of God.

363
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,440
Boss.

364
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,760
Have you arranged everything?

365
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,820
Don't worry, Boss.

366
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,930
According to your order, I've arranged for the men you want.

367
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,280
I've been targeted by the police.

368
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,680
I finally got rid of them.

369
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,220
Director.

What's the situation?

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,230
Dai Yueqing must have someone very important to meet.

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,490
It's probably Shrike.

374
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,160
Shrike?

375
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,310
Ask some men to wait at the back door.

376
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,410
We'll leave as soon as we get the copperplate.

377
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,050
Okay.

378
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,150
Huzi.

379
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,770
Yes.

380
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,220
Take some men to block all the exits.

381
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,830
Yes.

382
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,460
Shaobai, take some men to the back door.

383
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,430
Shrike, you are just here

384
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,270
to trade a small copperplate.

385
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,150
Is it necessary to bring so many men?

386
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,870
Boss Dai, you also brought a lot of men.

387
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,210
Falcon.

388
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,210
Where is Shrike?

389
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,040
Shrike has other things to do.

390
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,210
He sent me to negotiate with you.

391
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,290
You're not qualified to negotiate with me.

392
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,350
Aren't you worried I'll get even with you in the future?

393
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,280
You are a woman of your word.

394
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,850
Since you promised Shrike not to kill me,

395
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,530
you won't break your promise.

396
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,700
I won't kill you for the sake of the copperplate.

397
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,950
Where is the copperplate?

398
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,270
There were many checkpoints on the way. The inspection was very strict.

399
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,210
I could only put it somewhere else.

400
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,340
Where?

401
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,330
Come closer.

402
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,110
I can only tell you.

403
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,510
Go!

404
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,530
Go to hell!

405
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,730
Drop your guns! Don't move!

406
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,800
Don't move!

407
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,580
Drop your guns!

408
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Drop your guns!

409
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,910
Don't move!

410
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,590
Drop your guns!

411
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,250
Don't move!

412
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,270
Our men have surrounded this place!

413
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,690
Dai Yueqing,

414
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,960
if you resist desperately, you'll only end up dead.

415
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,250
Tell your men to drop their guns!

416
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,780
What are you talking about?

417
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,470
I can drop my gun,

418
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,830
but you have to keep my men alive.

419
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,030
They all have humble backgrounds.

420
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:22,960
Otherwise,

421
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,810
no one can get out alive.

422
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,150
This is the new government's policy.

423
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,630
Anyone making contributions can be treated with leniency.

424
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,970
I believe you.

425
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,520
-Boss!
-Boss!

426
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,070
Boss!

427
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,560
Drop your guns!

428
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,690
Brothers,

429
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,580
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,460
Go!

431
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,400
Move!

432
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,790
Boss.

433
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,680
Boss.

434
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,910
Go now!

435
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,570
Boss!

436
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,390
Go! Go!

437
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,960
After him!

438
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,630
Keep an eye on her!

439
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,110
Yes.

440
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,760
He escaped.

441
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,280
Go back with me.

442
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,710
Go!

443
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,830
Don't shoot!

444
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,220
Don't...

445
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,790
Drop your gun!

446
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,010
Put the gun down!

447
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,810
Stop!

448
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,270
[Name: Wei Shan]

449
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,730
It was Xu Wei.

450
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,560
He escaped.

451
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,850
I'll leave the rest to you.

452
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,770
Okay, don't worry.

453
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,250
Okay.

454
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,420
Isn't that Mr. Zheng?

455
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,990
Why is he here?

456
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,540
Mr. Zheng.

457
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,030
It's really you. What a coincidence.

458
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,240
Hello, Director Lu.

459
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,560
You... came here for work?

460
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,500
No, here's the thing.

461
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,770
Today is Sunday. I came to visit my student.

462
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,650
Which student?

463
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,140
You like the child so much.

464
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,930
A student named Cong Li.

465
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,960
Cong Li? I remember her.

466
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,190
She... lives nearby?

467
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,960
Yes. No. 23 in Xinping Li.

468
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,370
Are you two... still suspecting me?

469
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,710
We've clarified everything about what happened last time.

470
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,710
Don't misunderstand us, Mr. Zheng. We just happened to meet here.

471
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,510
Lu.

472
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,080
Don't you want to tell Mr. Zheng about the bureau's plan?

473
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,230
Mr. Zheng, here's the thing.

474
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,480
Our bureau wants to promote slogans

475
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,850
of eliminating agents and maintaining stability on the streets.

476
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,380
We want to ask for your help.

477
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,190
About what happened last time,

478
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,130
we feel very guilty towards you.

479
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,250
So we want to introduce a deal to you.

480
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,640
But this deal's success depends on

481
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,430
your negotiation with our publicity officer.

482
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,070
Okay, I thank you first.

483
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,800
There's another student waiting for me.

484
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,800
Why don't we...

485
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,390
It won't take long.

486
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,710
Our car is nearby.

487
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,540
We'll send you back after you finish the negotiation.

488
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,180
Yes.

489
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,900
That's good too.

490
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,050
I hope it won't take too long.

491
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,220
It won't.

492
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,920
This way.

493
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,070
Mr. Zheng, please.

494
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,510
Okay.

495
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,890
Mr. Zheng.

496
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,610
Okay.

497
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,050
Mr. Zheng.

498
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,280
This is Mr. Liu from the Publicity Department.

499
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,400
Hello, Mr. Liu.

500
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,140
Hello.

501
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,110
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

502
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,010
You know what?

503
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,990
Our bureau attaches

504
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,940
great importance to the publicity of fighting against agents.

505
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,440
I hope you can come up with a few solutions.

506
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,350
No problem.

507
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,460
I have something to do. You guys talk.

508
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,610
Go ahead, Director Lu.

509
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,240
Okay.

510
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,610
Have a seat.

511
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:22,930
[Printing Room of the Social Affairs Office]

512
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,450
He showed up at the crime scene.

513
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,380
Was it a coincidence or did he do it intentionally?

514
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,310
Shaobai, go to Cong Li's house to verify what he said as soon as possible.

515
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,020
Xiang,

516
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,930
tell Xu

517
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,900
to interrogate Dai Yueqing.

518
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,510
Yes.

519
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,280
Mr. Zheng is very responsible.

520
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,610
He visited us often.

521
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,230
Why did Mr. Zheng

522
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,380
visit you this time?

523
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,440
We think

524
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,700
it's useless

525
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,680
for girls to learn drawing.

526
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,240
And drawing boards and paintbrushes

527
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,150
would cost a lot of money.

528
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,730
So we didn't buy them for our kid.

529
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,770
But when Mr. Zheng came here this time,

530
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,950
he brought much stationery.

531
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,240
He said our kid can use them free of charge.

532
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,260
We feel bad about it.

533
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,880
When did he come?

534
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,320
Around 9 a.m.

535
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,500
I think it was almost 10 a.m.

536
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,330
How long did he stay here?

537
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,330
When did he leave?

538
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,730
He stayed here...

539
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,110
for about half an hour.

540
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,780
He had been here teaching Cong Li to draw.

541
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,630
When did Mr. Zheng visit you last time?

542
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,520
Dai Yueqing,

543
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,700
tell us about the Counterfeit Money Factory.

544
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,770
This might be your only chance to appeal for leniency.

545
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,240
Leniency?

546
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,770
How?

547
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,420
I deserve a few death sentences considering the crimes I committed.

548
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,230
Do whatever you want.

549
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,390
As for other things,

550
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,430
I don't know.

551
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,700
Dai Yueqing,

552
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,280
tell us everything!

553
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,590
Are you in a hurry?

554
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,830
I'm not.

555
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,190
I have plenty of time.

556
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,679
How did it go?

557
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,670
I went to the student's house to verify it.

558
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,130
Zheng Lanting didn't lie.

559
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,610
But we can clearly see the church

560
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,500

surface reason for every action

563
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,060
is a fundamental requirement of being an agent.

564
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,510
But if there really is something wrong with him,

565
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,800
he will definitely find a way

566
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,980
to ask the agents to transfer

567
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,590

568
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,960
I've asked Mr. Liu

569
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,739
to do his best to stall him.

570
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,010
Now we need to make Dai Yueqing confess as soon as possible

571
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,520
to get the information on the Counterfeit Money Factory's location.

572

We don't have time to waste on her.

573

In Dai Yueqing's house,

574
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,150
I found a photo of a boy.

575
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,160
I think we can start with it.

576
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,870
You mean Dai Yueqing lied?

577
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
They are so alike.

578
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,890
Who does he look like?

579
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,090
His father.

580
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,860
Dai Yueqing has hidden it well.

581
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,840
This kid was born

582
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,470
when the River Gang

583
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,400
and the Hook Sword Gang had a fight.

584
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,040
His father died in the fight that year.

585
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,750
Dai Yueqing was worried the River Gang would kill the kid,

586
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,080
so she secretly hid him.

587
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,650
She was so thoughtful.

588
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:35,970
Master Qin,

589
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,810
can you help us find this child?

590
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,120
It's not hard for the Green Gang to find someone.

591
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,600
But Shaobai,

592
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,760
descendants shouldn't be implicated.

593
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,400
You already arrested Dai Yueqing.

And he said he still needs to visit a student.
