00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,110
I think I have to confess.

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,340
I'm indeed guilty.

5
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,170
Ye Shiwu

6
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,289
forced me to shoot your comrades.

7
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,710
Although I didn't shoot in the end,

8
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,460
I did hesitate a little.

9
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,160
Also, back at the power plant,

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,320
although I saved your life in the end,

11
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,730
I did want to run away.

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,230
I sincerely confess my faults

13

to you now.

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,590
In that case,

15
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,669
should we give you an award instead?

16
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,950
No need.

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,060
is being an old cop.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,660

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,120

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,990
you must have mistaken me for someone else.

I didn't look like this four years ago.

47
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,120

I reported the case.

192
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,700
You should be solving my problem,

193
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,100
not the other way around.

195
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,530
Don’t worry, Mrs. Lins.

196
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,740
As long as Lin Shaobai cooperates with the new government

197
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,800
to investigate this important case,

198
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,350
he can come back after that.

199
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,180
We leave Shaobai in your hands.

200
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
Please have this.

201
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,049
No need.

202
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Take it.

203
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,580
We appreciate the thought,

204
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,240
but things are different now.

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,890
Shaobai is just cooperating with us for a few days.

206

Don't worry.

207
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,400
Okay.

They are close.

219
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,110
With Lin Shaobai's fearless attitude,

220
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,250
he must think

221
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,430
he is alone in Shanghai now.

should have arrived in Hong Kong.

224
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,910
That means

225
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,540
after Lin Shaobai and Xu Wei parted at the pier,

226

I would have come to confirm it myself.

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,420
It'll take more than speculations

230
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,950
to get Lin Shaobai to talk.

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,640

325
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,430
Did Chongqing send you here

326
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,910
or did the Japanese send you here?

didn't you see the Japanese chasing me?

329
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,990
How could I be sent by the Japanese?

330
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,600
Tell me honestly.

I'm just a police officer in Shanghai.

332
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,070

333
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,420

345
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,760
sealed off the scene after that.

346
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,950
They even set up an investigation team.

347
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,560
That was the 34th year of the Republic of China.

348
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,120
Japan's defeat was imminent.

349
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,550
In order to hide their shame,

350
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,950
they decided to write the explosion off

351
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,750
as a self-burning suicide case.

352
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,750
Comrades,

353
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,710
I've told you

354
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,170
everything I know.

355
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,240
Good.

356
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,050
You mentioned the investigation team just now.

357
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,330
According to the information,

358
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,780
everyone in the investigation team

359
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,840
was assassinated one after another.

360
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,310
Then why did you,

361
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,150
Ye Shiwu,

362
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,540
and Xu Wei survive?

363
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,780
The investigation team was formed by the Japanese.

364
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,470
They won't kill their own people.

365
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,800
Our discipline doesn't

366
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,790
allow assassination either.

367
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,700
Therefore, it could only be the work of the NBIS

368
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,670
Ye Shiwu was working for Mao Sen.

369
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,160
It made sense that the NBIS spared him.

370
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,570
But why were you and Xu Wei

371
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,020
spared as well?

372
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,660
Is it possible that

373
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,370
we were useless?

374
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,200
We were just two police officers.

375
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,280
We didn't handle important information.

376
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,320
For them,

377
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,430
it didn't matter if we

378
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,790
lived or died.

379
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,610

That's the stray cat I adopted.

950
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,020
We must find him immediately.

951
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,350
Any other clues?

952
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,970
Other clues?

953
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,270
Luo San...

954
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,450
I remember.

955
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,330
Luo San has a habit.

956
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,990
He loves to have

957
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,670
Mr. Huang's Breakfast Delight.

958
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,230
He'd never quit this.

959
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,570
What Breakfast Delight?

960
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,310
I'll take you there.

961
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,030
Wait.

962
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,000
The US dollars in his drawer

963
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,230
may be stolen money.

964
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,480
I've to confiscate it.

965
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,190
[Huang's Breakfast]

966
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,750
Here you are.

967
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,220
Thank you.

968
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,270
Just put it here.

969
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,440
Luo San sure knows his food.

970
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,560
Let me tell you.

971
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,450
Fried dough sticks, soy milk, flatbread, and glutinous rice rolls;

972
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,360
this is the Breakfast Delight.

973
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,760
Their rice rolls are sold out.

974
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,790
Eat it like me.

975
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,540
A bite of fried dough sticks with a sip of soy milk.

976
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,330
You like spicy food?

977
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,630
Come on.

978
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,630
Eat.

979
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,350
You don't have to be so attentive.

980
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,350
I know.

981
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,290
How can a rat please a cat, right?

982
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,570
Are you unable to quit this

983
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,310
or Luo San?

984
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,860
Of course it's Luo San.

985
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,180
We're working together now.

986
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,400
Have some trust.

987
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,190
Pay attention.

988
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,760
The table on the left

989
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,410
with the one wearing a hat...

990
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,390
seems like Luo San's accomplice, Beanpole.

991
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,860
Are you sure?

992
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,050
He's wearing a hat to get breakfast.

993
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,240
He must be afraid of being recognized.

994
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,660
He chose a position where

995
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,220
he can see the situation outside.

996
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,930
He can run away anytime.

997
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,480
That's not it.

998
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,200
How so?

999
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,490
He's sitting upright

1000
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,590
and not wearing ordinary shoes under his long pants legs.

1001
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,430
They're Kuomintang Army's round toe shoes.

1002
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,430
He's not a thief.

1003
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,270
He's from the routed troops.

1004
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,560
Kuomintang Army's round toe shoes

1005
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,430
are sold all over Shiliupu's black market.

1006
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,560
It's everywhere.

1007
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,580
I can buy you one if you like.

1008
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,750
See?

1009
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,670
He's taken action.

1010
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,350
Boss.

1011
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,600
Bill, please.

1012
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,390
What is it?

1013
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:50,870
Police.

1014
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,580
She dropped something,

1015
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,930
so I picked it up for her.

1016
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,370
Beanpole, right?

1017
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,730
Where is Luo San?

1018
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,000
What Luo San?

1019
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,130
Who is Beanpole?
