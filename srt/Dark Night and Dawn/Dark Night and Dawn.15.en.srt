[Dark Night and Dawn]

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,729
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,910
Secretary Liu,

4
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,630
do you know what position

5
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,100
I held in the NBIS

6
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,759
in 1947?

7
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,940
Vice Director of the Inspection Office.

8
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,890
That’s right.

9
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,530
I really miss those days.

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,350
Back then,

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,889
I could sit in the office,

12
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,770
no fieldwork needed,

13
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,740
just watching what everyone

14
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,940
was doing

15
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,040
and thinking.

16
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,190
Which words were true,

17
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,030
and which were lies.

18
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,829
If anyone

19
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,020
betrayed the organization,

20
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,990
we had our own punishment.

21
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,690
The Inspection Office had

22
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,810
quite the reputation.

23
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,160
These watches of yours are pretty nice.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,420
This one looks good.

25
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,110
Good pick.

26
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,700
It's imported.

27
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,730
Try it on.

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,320
It's...

29
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,260
expensive.

30
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,970
Now I officially announce

31
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,020
he

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,520
is the new Falcon.

33
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,730
Chief.

34
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,190
Shrike,

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,350
Falcon is your special codename for the Shanghai

36
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,030
Special Station Action Team.

37
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,600
Why give him?

38
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,410
What is he capable of?

39
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,140
How is he qualified for this position?

40
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,200
I don’t care about qualification, only ability.

41
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,900
Do you think he’s a problem?

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,329
No problem.

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,560
I fully trust your judgment, Chief.

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,270
Falcon,

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,850
what time is it?

46
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,490
Almost 12 p.m.

47
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,060
A new day is about to start.

48
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,180
It's getting late.

49
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,050
I won't bother you.

50
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,290
Okay.

51
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,550
Secretary Liu,

52
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,370
there are quite a few gears

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,480
in this watch?

54
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,420
Yes.

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,880
I think they should be working together

56
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,410
to make this watch accurate.

57
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,670
Exactly.

58
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,930
If even one gear speeds up,

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,760
slows down,

60
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,940
or shifts out of place,

61
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,750
the watch

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,470
would need fixing.

63
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,310
How do you usually fix it?

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,710
Simple,

65
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,840
just replace the faulty gear.

66
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,960
I think so too.

67
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,250
Good night.

68
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,150
Take care.

69
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,400
Master.

70
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,580
Master.

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,200
Have you heard about

72
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,700
the incident at the Qiujang Dock?

73
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,170
The police have killed Shrike.

74
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,850
The target is dead.

75
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,400
Our deal should be over.

76
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,030
I heard.

77
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,740
But they deserved it.

78
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,550
Don't rush to end the deal.

79
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,390
I have something to tell you.

80
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,620
Wait for my news.

81
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,770
Morning.

82
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,480
Morning.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Lin Shaobai.

84
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,460
I’m not late.

85
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,380
You came in right on time.

86
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,090
Down to the minute.

87
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,960
[Bayi]

88
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,810
I didn't lose mine.

89
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,670
Congratulations.

90
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,630
You did a great job

91
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,490
capturing Yang Hui.

92
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,490
The organization has decided to officially hire you.

93
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,580
Really, Lu?

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm hired?

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,540
Scout.

96
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,000
Still in the probation period.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,490
Follow the rules closely.

98
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,290
Don’t embarrass the Office 2.

99
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,750
Yes, sir!

100
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,890
Director,

101
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,150
does that mean my salary

102
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,170
will double now?

103
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,760
No such thing.

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,050
You can still regret it.

105
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,670
Regret what?

106
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,960
The job’s more important than the salary.

107
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,030
Lin Shaobai,

108
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,010
this is your official uniform. Please keep it.

109
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you.

110
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,450
How is it?

111
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,830
Is it spicy?

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,250
Yes.

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
Am I right?

114
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,080
To welcome

115
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,620
Lin Shaobai as an official member

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,690
of the People's Police.

117
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,190
Okay.

118
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,710
Welcome.

119
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,340
Okay.

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
And to celebrate

121
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,120
our victory in cracking the Shanghai Special Station case.

122
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,290
I propose a toast.

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,230
Okay. Cheers.

124
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,990
Cheers!

125
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,270
Cheers.

126
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,910
Cheers.

127
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,159
Here.

128
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,450
Make yourself at home.

129
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,350
It’s thanks to you that

130
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,790
Chief made it back this time.

131
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,720
It was my duty.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,010
You and I are like brothers now.

133
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,950
This time

134
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,470
we really dodged a bullet.

135
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,150
Next, we should

136
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,440
make a detailed plan

137
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,230
according to the current situation.

138
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,510
At the dock,

139
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,790
Dai Yueqing’s Hook Sword Gang

140
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,670
is being squeezed by the River Gang.

141
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,270
She can't hold on any longer.

142
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,140
This is our chance to act.

143
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,030
What exactly

144
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,070
is your job at the dock?

145
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,670
The Hook Sword Gang has set up a new transport team at the Xinyue Dock.

146
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,910
I’ve joined the team.

147
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,970
It’ll make our operations easier.

148
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,590
Our main task

149
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,840
now is to

150
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,760
keep a close eye on Jin Maochang,

151
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,270
and make good use of Dai Yueqing.

152
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,110
You’re the key player in all of this.

153
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,690
Got it.

154
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,400
Xu Wei.

155
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,830
Here.

156
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,700
Let me know if you need anything.

157
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,250
Thank you, Chief.

158
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,200
Have some soup.

159
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,190
Enough.

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,180
No. Fill it up.

161
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,690
I can't drink.

162
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,270
I'll be honest with you.

163
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
I've always had an issue with you.

164
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,910
Xu.

165
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,570
You'd been worked

166
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,870
at the Underground Police Committee before Liberation.

167
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,910
How could you

168
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,590
not recruit me sooner?

169
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,230
Everyone, want to hear

170
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,750
what Lin Shaobai was like before Liberation?

171
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,710
Yes.

172
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,310
Yes.

173
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,910
Tell us.

174
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,590
Go ahead.

175
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,430
Let me tell you.

176
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,150
Hurry up.

177
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,990
Before Liberation, Lin Shaobai

178
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,260
was always hanging out with hooligans.

179
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,790
If I had recruited him, who knows

180
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,300
when he might have betrayed me?

181
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,020
What if you have the chance now?

182
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,310
Would you recruit me?

183
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,080
No.

184
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,070
No.

185
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,950
What? Don’t talk nonsense.

186
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,150
Xu, tell me,

187
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,740
would you recruit me?

188
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,370
I definitely would.

189
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,110
See?

190
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,670
See?

191
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,990
Xu, but he'd start as a temporary hire.

192
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,820
Yes.

193
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,500
Right.

194
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,590
I'm fine

195
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,770
with temporary or official.

196
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,370
As long as I can join the People's Police,

197
