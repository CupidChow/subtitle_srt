00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,910
I grew up on a boat on Taihu Lake.

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,410
We lived off the boat.

5
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,430
Later I followed the flood to Shanghai.

6
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,720
I still made a living on the boat year after year.

Are you trying to say that my family background is better than yours?

00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,840
But background is not everything.

What's more important is your choices.

You also still have a choice.

What I wanted to say is that

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,200
I've been on a boat for too long, and I hate it the most when it rocks.

00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,760
What does it mean that the agents went to kidnap the child today?

377
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,260
It means Dai Yueqing is not on their side.

378
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,020
I believe Dai Yueqing will come back.

379

Turn right.

391
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,270
Laosan, I think they found out about us.

392

393
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,750
Okay.

What's up, Laosan?

395
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,220
Boss, it's not safe around here.

396
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,470
So I thought I'd escort you for a while.

397
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,860
It's very nice of you.

398
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,030
You may stop here.

401
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,870
May I ask who that master is?

402
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,030
Can he really guarantee our safety?

403
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,030

No, that's not true.

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,890
As long as I want to know

409
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,590

410

no one can hide it from me.

411

and the government can keep you safe.

Boss, what's it with that police officer?

432

Do you trust me?

433
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,580
Yes.

434
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,180
You just need to remember that

435
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,810
everything I do

436
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,970
is for our men.

437
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,160
Why should I trust you?

438
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,040
You turned to Falcon

439
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,990
just to

440
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,950
find a way out for yourself, didn't you?

441
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,200
But as you can see,

442
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,850
if you keep working for the agents,

443
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,000
even if you don't die here today,

444
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,460
you'll die somewhere else tomorrow.

445
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,300
Don't you understand?

446
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,960
Let me ask you.

447
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,660
How long have you been working at the dock?

448
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,710
Over a decade.

449
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,680
Over the decade,

450
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,670
Hook Sword Gang has been nearly destroyed several times.

451
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,190
Even such a gang couldn't gain a firm foothold.

452
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,790
Why would you think a few agents

453
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,670
are able to do that?

454
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,350
As you can see,

455
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,430
Kuomintang can't discipline the gangs and the business community,

456
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,960
but the new government can.

457
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,260
And why is that?

458
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,350
It's because we are selfless underneath.

459
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,700
We don't do things for one person

460
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,100
or one party of power,

461
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,880
but all the people.

462

Wu Laosan.

463
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,340
If you really want to repent,

464
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,600
the government will be lenient with you.

465
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,810
Maybe you can have a new life.

466
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,190
But if you insist on working for the agents,

467
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,470
since New China is about to be established,

468
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,700
all those agents will be like grasshoppers in late autumn,

469
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,420
and you'll only be buried with them.

470
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,020

471
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,420
I'll tell you.

472
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,600
Falcon suddenly came to me last night.

473
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,420
He said

474
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,880
Boss had escaped from the police,

475
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,430
and she might contact the gang.

476
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,910
He... He asked me

477
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,350
to find a way to kill Boss,

478
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,910
and he'd give me a lot of money afterwards.

479
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,110

Considering that the entrepreneurs are in the hands of these agents,

562
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,930
if we attack them forcibly,

563
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,210
these agents will definitely use the entrepreneurs

564
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,720
as shields to protect themselves or run for their lives.

Once they find they can't escape,

566
