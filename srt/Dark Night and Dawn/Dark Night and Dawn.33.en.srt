193
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,670
Yes.

194
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,900
You go wait for the telegram.

195
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,800
Okay.

196
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,740
Feihang.

197
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,440
Are you up?

198
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,650
Your grandmas have made breakfast for you.

199
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,450
Open the door.

200
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,250
Feihang.

201
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,220
Feihang.

202
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,430
Feihang.

203
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,410
She's got a fever.

204
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,470
Take her to the hospital now.

205
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,560
Hurry up.

206
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,070
Her heart is fine.

207
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,560
If a child is with congenital heart disease,

208
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,630
you should try your best not to get her to catch a cold or a fever.

209
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,800
Otherwise, her heart will suffer

210
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,870
which may cause other symptoms.

211
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,850
As her parent, you should know it.

212
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,320
I was careless.

213
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,180
She got shocked yesterday.

214
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,820
She probably didn't rest well.

215
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,470
Her condition is special.

216
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,780
Let her be hospitalized for two days for observation.

217
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,580
Don't irritate the child again.

218
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,620
Okay, thank you, doctor.

219
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,610
Don't be too worried.

220
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,330
My two moms

221
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,150
will take good care of her.

222
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,390
Please say thank you to them for me.

223
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,710
Don't mention it.

224
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,270
The police

225
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,660
are searching for Shrike in the city.

226
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,650
He's already a homeless loser now.

227
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,210
It's not the time to be complacent about it.

228
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,770
If the police catch him,

229
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,950
we'll be doomed.

230
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,480
We have to find a way to kill him.

231
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,430
But even the police can't find him.

232
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,210
It's difficult for us to find him.

233
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,450
Trust me.

234
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,630
He will come to us.

235
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,900
How is that possible?

236
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,300
There are only two choices

237
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,820
for Shrike now.

238
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,650
One is that he leaves Shanghai.

239
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,190
But now,

240
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,470
the police have sent officers to all the stations and docks.

241
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,900
Without my help,

242
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,660
he won't be able to leave.

243
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,720
The other choice is that he stays in Shanghai.

244
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,690
Without my financial support,

245
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,510
he will also have a hard time.

246
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,330
Whether he's leaving or not,

247
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,090
he'll have to come to us.

248
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,660
I'll get people to prepare for it.

249
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,850
But Mr. Jin.

250
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,270
The country has been liberated.

251
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,020
Many of our bros have quit working for us.

252
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,400
Those who will

253
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,960
charge

254
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,580
very high.

255
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,200
After all,

256
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,120
if they lose, they'll die.

257
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,690
Even if they succeed, they'll be outcasts.

258
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,750
Then pay them more.

259
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,060
As long as the pay is high enough, there'll be men working for us.

260
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,350
I've sent someone to prepare 8 million for you.

261
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,930
I'll give you more if it's not enough.

262
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,460
We should spend as much money as it needs now.

263
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
Remember, Kui.

264
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,310
This time, we're not risking our fortune,

265
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,130
but our lives.

266
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,150
Look at the chicken soup Elder Grandma made for you.

267
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,190
It smells so good.

268
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,420
Smell it.

269
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,520
I don't want to have it.

270
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,360
Just have some chicken soup, okay?

271
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,030
Only when you have energy,

272
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,940
can your immune system

273
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,950
defeat all the viruses and bacteria.

274
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,150
Let me feed you, okay?

275
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,200
Here.

276
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,300
What's wrong?

277
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,890
It's not too hot.

278
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,890
You only told me that my parents had sacrificed their lives.

279
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,040
How did they sacrifice their lives?

280
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,130
When you get better,

281
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,210
I'll tell you about it, okay?

282
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,340
Why can't you tell me now?

283
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,420
Because you're sick.

284
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,430
I'm fine.

285
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,310
I just want to know it.

286
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,150
When my parents died on that mission,

287
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,680
you were also there, right?

288
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,450
Mr. Zheng told you this?

289
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,110
He said my parents could have survived.

290
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,620
Listen to me.

291
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,630
Let's not talk about this now.

292
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,160
Focus on your health first.

293
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,270
I'll always be with you, okay?

294
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,220
He also said

295
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,250
my parents had sacrificed their lives because of you.

296
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,440
Zheng said that on purpose.

297
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,500
Why didn't you explain to her?

298
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,990
When she's older,

299
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,750
I'll let her face those things.

300
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,540
But she is now facing them.

301
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,270
Although Feihang is just a kid,

302
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,040
she has her own thoughts

303
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,460
and feelings.

304
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,820
Lu.

305
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,400
I think

306
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,020
you should tell her the truth.

307
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,100
That's for her own good.

308
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,610
She's too young.

309
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,290
And she's not very well

310
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,840
and was just taken hostage.

311
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,870
I'm afraid she won't be able to accept it.

312
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,200
Feihang is not as vulnerable as you think.

313
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,780
Actually, she is mentally strong.

314
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,350
But she is still a child.

315
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,790
Anyway,

316
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,750
let's not talk about it until she recovers.

317
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,580
Let's go.

318
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,130
We have issued a warrant for Zheng Lanting's arrest.

319
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,380
But so far,

320
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,670
no clue has been found.

321
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,860
The bankbook found in Lanting Studio

322
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,120
may be a vital clue with which we may have a breakthrough.

323
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,390
The owner of this account is Wang Liqun.

324
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,270
And there is a large sum of money transferred to the account at times.

325
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,590
So I think

326
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,080
this money is probably

327
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,590
the operation funds of Shanghai Special Operation Station.

328
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,700
Without money,

329
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,490
no agent

330
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,140
would be willing to work for Zheng Lanting.

[Broker]

332
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,960
The person behind Zheng Lanting

333
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,650
is very likely to be a big shot.

334
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,120
To avoid being arrested,

335
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
Zheng Lanting may go to him for help.

336
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,270
If we can find the person behind him

337
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,850
through the financial transactions

338
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,190
between them,

339
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,340
we may find Zheng Lanting.

340
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,670
The bank of the bankbook is HSBC.

341
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,720
Don't worry. I'll look into it.

342
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,530
There is also a third party

343
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,410
who is looking for Zheng Lanting.

344
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,630
Shrike has become one hated by everyone.

345
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,310
They may take action again.

346
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,680

[Source] [Broker]

350
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,110
We only have the two Dumdum bullets.

351
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,690
The Dumdum bullet

352
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,150
has always been in circulation

353
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,470
on the black market.

354
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,430
After Wang Liqun died,

355
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,600
I sent people to search for them on the black market.

356
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,830
But since the Liberation,

357
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,590
selling arms has been banned.

358
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
There are fewer and fewer people doing this business.

359
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,700
So I haven't found any more information.

360
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,860
After Li Yuquan died recently,

361
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,510
I asked Master Qin's men to help me investigate them.

362
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,440
I believe

363
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,640
we'll find some clues soon.

00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,150
Okay. You continue to

365
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,900
find more clues about this.

366
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,030
We'll find more clues to their whereabouts with the two kinds of clues we have now.

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,520
You have to work overtime day and night.

379
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,540
You must be tired.

380
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,320
Right.

381
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,300
I just want to have a chat with Feihang

382
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,100
tonight.

383
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,810
You can go back now.

384
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,050
Okay, we'll go back first.

385
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,960
Okay.

386
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,790
Feihang, we'll come to you tomorrow.

387
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,430
We'll bring you some nice food.

388
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,350
Drink more water.

389
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,990
Okay.

390
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,920
Bye.

391
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,090
Wait a minute.

392
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,260
Look who's here.

393
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,710
Here.

394
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
Look who's here.

395
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,140
It's Liuyi!

396
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,180
You know what?

397
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,260
We're not allowed to bring pets in the hospital.

398
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,020
In order to bring Liuyi here,

399
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,420
I tried many ways.

400
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,780
Liuyi is so cute.

401
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,640
Feihang.

402
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,230
I've been curious

403
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,740
what Mr. Zheng told you that day.

404
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,520
He said my parents had sacrificed their lives because of my Uncle Lu.

405
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,250
He was wrong.

406
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,510
Actually, I was there too that day.

407
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,310
Let me tell you what I saw.

408
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,850
That day

409
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,690
they were in a foreign-style house on Fuzhou Road.

410
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,640
The agents set a trap for us.

411
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,650
So your Uncle

412
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,160
still can't get over it.

413
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,720
[Crime and Punishment]

414
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,840
Mr. Jin.

415
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,140
This is Crime and Punishment.

416
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,070
What crime was committed? How should he be punished?

417
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,830
Falcon, you're here.

418
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,900
Now I'm relieved.

419
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,300
It means Shrike

420
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,430
is safe for now.

421
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,420
What do you want this time?

422
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,220
Tell me. I'll give you anything.

423
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,740
Mr. Jin, you're being quite generous this time.

424
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,040
Shrike said

425
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,850
the most important thing now

426
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,350
is for us to be united.

427
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,950
We need a lorry load of provisions and a sum of money.

428
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,390
We also need you to provide us with some addresses where we can hide.

429
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,560
That's what we need.

430
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,550
I can give you all of these.

431
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,660
And I can give you more.

432
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,520
Are you interested?

433
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,810
What can you give me?

434
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,680
Tell Shrike

435
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,120
that I can arrange a ship

436
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,250
that can take him to Hong Kong safely.

437
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,730
Compared with these supplies,

438
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,330
I think Shrike

439
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,830
is more interested in that ship.

440
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,200
You're setting a backup plan for Shrike.

441
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,230
I won't call him Shrike today.

442
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,410
And I won't call you Falcon.

443
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,430
Let me call you Xu Wei, your real name.

444
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,350
You and Shaobai used to be police officers.

445
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,340
Then you two took different paths by accident.

446
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,450
Xu Wei.

447
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,750
If I can give you a chance

448
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,130
to be the original Xu Wei,

449
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,110
will you take the chance?

450
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,690
I'm doing well now.

451
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,870
Shrike has failed so many times.

452
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,880
He's already a homeless loser.

453
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,460
The best ending for him now

454
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,980
is to go abroad

455
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,170
and become an exile.

456
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,520
You're underestimating us.

457
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,220
As long as we are still on the gambling table,

458
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,920
we have the chance to turn the tables.

459
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,480
The Communist Party has liberated the country for half a year.

460
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,430
The gamble is gone.

461
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,850
Xu Wei,

462
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,930
don't you want to take your wife away with you?

463
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,060
I can arrange it.

464
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,670
What do you mean?

465
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,820
If you dare to hurt Zhao Lan, I will kill you now.

466
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,620
Don't be so impulsive.

467
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,910
Stop this.

468
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,270
I've found the exact location of your family

469
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,690
in Zhejiang.

470
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,890
Don't worry. I won't hurt them.

471
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,250
I just want to tell you

472
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,640
I'm able

473
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,020
to get you and your family to be reunited.

474
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,650
Why do you want to

475
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,420
send Shrike away?

476
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,250
I want the truth.

477
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,090
You know better than I do.

478
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,960
Shrike is using your family to control you.

479
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,510
We are all the same.

480
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,720
Xu Wei.

481
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,230
As long as you have money,

482
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,440
you can also go abroad.

483
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,270
I'll arrange a ship for you.

484
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,300
Then what do you want from me?

485
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,170
In two days,

486
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,170
there'll be a ship of mine going to Hong Kong.

487
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,200
You go tell Zheng Lanting about it.

488
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,390
You're going to kill Shrike?

489
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,320
Aren't you afraid I'll tell him about this?

490
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,180
Did I say I'm going to kill him?

491
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,670
I only said I wanted to send him away.

492
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,360
If he leaves Shanghai,

493
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,970
you and I will be free.

494
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,900
Then you can be Xu Wei again.

495
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,710
Then you and your family

496
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,490
will lead a happy life.

497
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,190
If I remember correctly,

498
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,200
your wife has given birth, right?

499
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,740
As a father,

500
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,750
you haven't even seen your child.

501
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,330
They can't live like us anymore.

502
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,080
Xu Wei.

503
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,690
You can accept my offer or not.

504
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,600
It's up to you.

505
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,670
Any news from Master Qin's men?

506
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,890
Not yet.

507
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,230
But he said we would have the information soon.

508
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,380
Lin Shaobai, a call for you.

509
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,990
Who is it?

510
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,150
It's from your home.

511
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,730
Didn't I tell you not to call the department?

512
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,970
Calm down.

513
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,140
Speak slowly.

514
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,370
Alright, got it.

515
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,030
What's wrong?

516
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,270
Feihang is missing.

517
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,800
The nurses in the hospital said

518
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,430
they had seen her walk out of the hospital alone.

519
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,490
She walked out of the hospital alone?

520
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,210
What did you tell her recently?

521
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,470
I told her the truth about what had happened five years ago.

522
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,840
Don't worry about that.

523
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,490
Let's find her first.

524
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,600
It's so well drawn.

525
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,159
Uncle.

526
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,030
Do the ears I drew look like yours?

527
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,830
Yes.

528
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,449
Look.

529
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,679
You drew your parents very well.

530
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,810
Why are you here?

531
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,770
Uncle Lin told me everything.

532
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,580
You've been here a lot since you came to Shanghai.

533
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,110
That's why I want to have a look at this place.

534
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,680
This is

535
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,900
where your parents sacrificed their lives.

536
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,350
Do you miss them?

537
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,810
I had dreams about them.

538
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,180
In my dreams, they were with me.

539
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,570
Mom's hug was so light.

540
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,640
When I wanted to hold her tight,

541
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,820
I woke up all of a sudden.

542
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,720
I'm sorry.

543
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,840
I could have

544
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,040
protected them.

545
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,810
No, Uncle.

546
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,590
Uncle Lin said

547
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,700
they were trying to protect more people.

548
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,460
You are like my parents.

549
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,020
Don't you blame me?

550
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,840
No.

551
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,410
Mr. Zheng said it was because of you that they lost their lives.

552
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,970
But I don't believe it.

553
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,440
I asked you, but you didn't tell me.

554
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,750
Uncle.

555
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,190
Don't think you're not good.

556
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,470
I've grown up. I know it.

557
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,580
My parents died for their belief.

558
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,080
They and I won't blame you.

559
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,070
I...

560
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,740
I just don't know how to tell you about it.

561
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,430
Mr. Zheng said you were nice to me because you felt guilty.

562
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,950
That's not true.

563
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,110
Though you're not good with words,

564
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,700
I know you always love me

565
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,940
and take good care of me.

566
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,990
Do you really think so?

567
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,620
Uncle, don't blame yourself anymore.

568
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,730
My parents are gone.

569
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,300
I'll see you as my real dad from now on.

570
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,740
Did he really say that?

571
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,410
Yes, he promised

572
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,360
he could safely get us to Hong Kong.

573
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,470
Judging from the current situation,

574
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,710
going to Hong Kong is a good idea.

575
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,330
What else did he say?

576
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,210
Nothing.

577
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,700
I need to call him.

578
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,730
Yes.

579
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,230
Hello, Mr. Jin.

580
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,080
Yes, it’s me.

581
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,620
Falcon has told me

582
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,060
your message.

583
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:22,520
I really admire you, Shrike.

584
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,050
A real man should know what to do in different times.

585
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
As long as you make up your mind,

586
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,260
I'll arrange everything.

587
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,450
Great. Thank you.

588
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,340
But...

589
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,010
If something goes wrong

590
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,740
in the waterway,

591
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,990
do you think we will all be brutally killed?

592
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,760
You think too much.

593
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,280
How about this?

594
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,230
I'll get on the ship with you.

595
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,540
I'll escort you to Hong Kong in person.

596
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,920
When we arrive and you're safe,

597
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,800
I'll come back.

598
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,840
How can we avoid

599
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,740
the inspection of the Communist Party at the dock?

600
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,830
I've thought about it.

601
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,120
Here's my way.

602
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,820
We can go to the No.3 warehouse

603
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,510
on the Changjiang Road first.

604
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,800
You know that place too.

605
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,920
That's where I load my lorries.

606
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,840
Every lorry has a pass.

607
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,700
By then,

608
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,790
we'll get into a lorry together

609
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,280
and then we go to a ship secretly.

610
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,210
As long as we get on the ship,

611
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,130
Shrike,

612
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,140
you'll be like a fish in the sea or a bird in the sky.

613
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,900
You'll be free.

614
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,170
Very thoughtful arrangements.

615
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,480
It's settled then.

616
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,130
Okay.

617
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,080
I'll get ready.

618
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,040
I think

619
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,920
Jin

620
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,440
is quite sincere.

621
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,630
Go pack up.

622
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,250
I'll let you know the exact departure time.

623
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:04,860
Yes.

624
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,810
Mr. Zheng, do you really trust Jin Maochang?

625
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,230
He's a businessman.

626
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,070
It's normal that he must want something from us.

627
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,450
Then why are we still going?

628
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,250
Of course

629
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,920
we must go.

630
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,750
I just think that Xu Wei...

631
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,650
When a normal person

632
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,760
knows that he's going to Hong Kong,

633
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,620
what he'll worry about most

634
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,480
should be his child and wife.

635
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,010
But...

636
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,790
At 4 p.m. tomorrow,

637
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,620
go to Changjiang Warehouse 3.

638
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,050
Get ready.

639
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,190
Okay.

640
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,300
The person is inside.

641
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,430
Before the Liberation,

642
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,900
he sold arms illegally.

643
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,540
He was the only one who had Dumdum bullets.

644
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,680
After the Liberation,

645
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,340
he was missing for a long time.

646
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,160
He got noticed again recently.

647
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,250
I heard

648
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,280
he secretly stored guns and ammunition for others.

649
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,010
That's why people noticed him.

650
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,990
Who is it? I'm in sleep.

651
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,790
Police! Freeze!

652
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,450
Let go of me!

653
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,430
Let go of me!

654
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,690
Who are you?

655
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,010
Police.

656
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,680
Where are the guns and ammunition sold by you?

657
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,420
I don't know.

658
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,390
Brother, I'll tell you everything.

659
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,150
Don't move.

660
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,180
[Wang Liqun] [Li Yuquan] [Falcon]

661
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,640
Have you found the buyer of Dumdum bullets?

662
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,770
[Dumdum bullet]

663
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,780
We don’t know his name yet.

664
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,620
According to the arms dealer,

665
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,290
we drew this picture of the buyer.

666
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,220
He also said the buyer

667
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,900
[Killer recruited]

668
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,750
recruited more than ten killers through him.

669
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,940
Looks like the third party

670
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,390
is indeed ready to make their move.
