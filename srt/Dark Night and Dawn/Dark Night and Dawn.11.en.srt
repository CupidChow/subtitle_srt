Ma Jianqi

759
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,070
admired your brother's ability

760
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,140
and tried to persuade him to defect to Branch 76.

761
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,770
It's all in the records.

762
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,380
Wang Liheng resisted the arrest fiercely.

763
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,650
He confessed that he got captured

764
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,190
because Shrike,

765
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,490
your superior,

766
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,990
betrayed him,

767
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,390
as only Shrike knew

768
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,020
his exact hiding place.

769
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,500
But when asked about Shrike's real identity

770
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,110
and his hideout,

771
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,110
your brother hesitated.

772
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,850
He endured severe torture and didn't say anything.

773
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,540
Considered a diehard, he was executed by Branch 76.

774
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,590
Quite the story.

775
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,140
If my brother knew

776
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,610
Shrike betrayed him,

777
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,520
why didn't he confess?

778
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,990
Why protect him?

779
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,190
It doesn't add up.

780
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,790
You're wrong.

781
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,360
The person your brother was protecting wasn't Shrike,

782
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,230
but you.

783
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,740
At that time, you were already under Shrike.

784
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,220
If Shrike got caught,

785
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,270
you'd definitely be next.

786
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,500
Shrike

787
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,950
exploited this,

788
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,530
using you,

789
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,970
unknowingly, as his hostage.

790
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,390
So,

791
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,040
knowing Shrike betrayed him,

792
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,110
your brother chose death

793
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,680
to protect you.

794
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,970
I'm sorry.

795
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,780
For eight years,

796
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,520
you have revered your enemy

797
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,470
as your savior.

798
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,310
Lu Zhengyang,

799
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,910
I underestimated you.

800
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
You've improved.

801
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,340
Trying to turn me

802
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,550
against Shrike by inciting defection.

803
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,600
Ma Jianqi will soon be in Shanghai.

804
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,470
You can confront him face to face.

805
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,240
You once worked for NBIS,

806
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,740
well-acquainted with Branch 76.

807
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,210
You can judge for yourself

808
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
if what Ma says

809
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,260
is true or not.

810
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,950
We'll talk when he gets here.

811
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:48,820
Take a good look.

812
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,390
You might find this interesting.

813
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,440
Once the witness arrives, he'll surely confess.

814
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,540
Prepare for the transfer.

815
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,030
Yes.
