00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,860
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,350
I know nothing I say now will help.

4
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,000
You think just because you weren't driving, you're in the clear?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,660
Public or private,

6
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,509
right or wrong, friend or foe—

7
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,900
when will you learn to

8
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,030
distinguish these?

9
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,110
You knew Xu Wei's whereabouts.

10
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,550
Why didn't you report it

11
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,789
and acted without telling us?

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
Do you realize that

13
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,160
catching Xu Wei

14
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,910
could lead us straight to identifying the identity of Shrike

15
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,310
and completely eliminating these agents?

16
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,400
But he's still my brother.

17
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,640
We've been together for so many years.

18
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,340
He wasn't a bad person back then.

19
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,280
I always thought I could save him.

20
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,790
Now, to completely disregard our brotherhood—

21
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,670
honestly,

22
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,960
I can't do it.

23
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,820
I just can't get over this.

24
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,560
My heart is flesh.

25
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,150
Your heart is flesh.

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,610
Isn't mine flesh?

27
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,470
So many people have sacrificed.

28
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,590
They were under my leadership.

29
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,450
Their parents ask me for their sons,

30
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,450
and their wives for their husbands.

31
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,080
What should I tell them?

32
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,150
Tell me,

33
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,140
what should I tell them?

34
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,510
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,710
This is indeed my fault.

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,010
Yes,

37
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,480
you're unworthy of the title

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,250
"People's Police."

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,460
Do you think

40
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,150
an old cop like me

41
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,090
can never be a good police?

42
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,210
Whether you can be a good police,

43
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,010
you have to

44
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,070
ask yourself.

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,050
You're right.

46
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,860
Whether it's punishment or sentence, I accept it.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,630
Take him away

48
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,100
to await punishment.

49
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,630
The first time I came here,

50
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,820
I was in handcuffs.

51
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,590
Now, it's the same.

52
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,260
I know the way.

53
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,700
Let's go.

54
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,470
He's waiting for you.

55
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,230
You didn't follow Shrike's order and almost got caught.

56
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,490
You're on your own now.

57
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,730
Chief,

58
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,650
I have nothing to say.

59
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,630
I'm at your disposal.

60
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,270
If your subordinate made such a mistake,

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,330
how would you handle it?

62
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
Minor ones get punished,

63
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,890
and major ones

64
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,420
get shot.

65
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,300
Think about it.

66
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,440
You could shoot me, too.

67
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,970
Just like

68
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,480
you killed Wang Liqun.

69
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,430
Maybe killing me

70
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,150
will make you the Chief.

71
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,270
Take care of Zhao Lan for me.

72
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,160
You know the rules.

73
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,890
Very good.

74
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,400
The flowers Feihang drew are interesting.

75
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,220
Is this a car?

76
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,159
You made it yourself, huh?

77
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,210
Don't make fun of the new student.

78
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,540
Focus on your drawing.

79
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,930
Feihang,

80
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,290
do you prefer

81
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,660
cars more?

82
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,290
I like flowers too.

83
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,620
I just want to draw something more useful.

84
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,470
I'll build them in the future.

85
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,020
You think cars are more useful

86
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,980
and want to build them?

87
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,780
Great. I support your idea.

88
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,340
But

89
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,190
I think

90
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,660
you are learning how to draw,

91
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,430
right?

92
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,299
So you need to first grasp

93
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,659
the basics of drawing.

94
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,549
For example, the perspective and proportion.

95
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,230
When we look at things,

96
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,909
the closer things are bigger,

97
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,900
right?

98
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,880
Distant ones are smaller

99
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,910
and their

100
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,750
colors will be lighter.

101
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,960
The closer one's color will be heavier.

102
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,580
If you understand these concepts of

103
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,220
perspective, proportion, and shading,

104
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,770
whatever you draw will be right.

105
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,640
I don't understand.

106
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,840
It's okay. Let me show you, okay?

107
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,460
Come on.

108
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,290
Let me draw a leaf for you, okay?

109
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,360
This leaf is big.

110
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,190
Let's draw two flowers.

111
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,150
This one is bigger, okay?

112
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,790
Okay.

113
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,380
What do you think this is?

114
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,690
Does it look like a car?

115
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes.

116
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,510
So, I used flowers

117
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,760
to assemble a car for you.

118
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,730
My point is,

119
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,870
don't just draw something because it's useful.

120
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,630
Once you choose a subject to draw,

121
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,460
treat it seriously.

122
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,430
It should reflect your fundamental

123
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,960
understanding of drawing.

124
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,190
Now, you try.

125
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,470
The towel's gone.

126
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,630
Did you take the wrong one?

127
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,230
Forget it,

128
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,910
I'll find it for you.

129
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,870
Next time.

130
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,620
No, you're not cleaned up yet.

131
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,440
Don't move.

132
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,410
Thank you.

133
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,730
I remember when we first came to Shanghai,

134
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,840
so many soldiers

135
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,860
had never seen electric lights

136
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,370
or showerheads.

137
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,890
They fiddled with the switches

138
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,140
and made a lot of jokes.

139
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
Exactly.

140
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,350
I remember back then

141
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,540
everyone was watching us,

142
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,390
wondering how these country folks

143
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,100
would manage Shanghai.

144
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,860
Luckily, our local comrades

145
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,940
helped us a lot

146
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,530
and we got used it.

147
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,800
Look at our Office 2.

148
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,890
Looks like

149
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,040
you're beating around the bush

150
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,610
to speak well of Lin Shaobai, aren't you?

151
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,540
Nothing gets past you.

152
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,680
Lin Shaobai's been in solitary confinement

153
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,740
for days now.

154
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,410
I was planning to have him publicly

155
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,780
reflect at the department

156
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,140
to warn the others.

157
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,090
It's gentle.

158
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,640
Gentle? I'll hit you harder.

159
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
I mean the punishment is too gentle.

160
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,570
He's lack of discipline.

161
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,540
Someone as reckless as him will

162
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,770
definitely cause big trouble in the future.

163
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,450
Yes.

164
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,510
One bad apple

165
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,990
spoils the bunch.

166
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,210
Lin Shaobai

167
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,360
knows Shanghai well

168
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,090
and has solved many cases,

169
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,320
but that doesn't offset his faults.

170
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,840
Someone like him

171
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,620
should be expelled from the Public Security Bureau.

172
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,260
Too heavy.

173
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,870
Mr. Yang,

174
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,580
I also think the punishment is too heavy.

175
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,960
Your hands are heavy.

176
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,760
I'll be gentler then.

177
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,770
Lin Shaobai has made so many mistakes

178
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,380
and must be expelled.

179
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,190
Hu, what are you looking at?

180
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,310
The Director is discussing Lin Shaobai

181
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,550
with Deputy Commissioner Yang.

182
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,280
Keep it down.

183
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,860
Anyway, our Office 2

184
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,590
won't keep him any longer.

185
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,560
I hope that's what you really think.

186
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,280
Haven't you heard?

187
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,470
Hu from the Police Pigeon Squad told me,

188
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,290
Lin Shaobai always goes to him.

189
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,120
Look, someone from our office

190
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,390
neglects his duties.

191
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,420
Mr. Yang,

192
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,370
he can't do anything great.

193
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,940
Just right for keeping pigeons.

194
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,630
After all this talk,

195
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,490
this is what you're trying to say.

196
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,390
Alright.

197
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,130
Only expel Lin Shaobai

198
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,440
from your office then.

199
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,110
Aren't I the head of the Office 2?

200
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,350
Now you're meddling in the Police Pigeon Squad too.

201
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,860
You've already figured out a way out for Lin Shaobai.

202
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,970
I'm

203
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,550
mainly helping Hu.

204
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,510
The Police Pigeon Squad isn't under your control.

205
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,550
If anything goes wrong,

206
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,950
who will be responsible?

207
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,240
Me.

208
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,510
I'll take responsibility.

209
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,670
If there's any problem,

210
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,880
I'll face punishment with him,

211
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,790
even expulsion.

212
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,550
Nonsense!

213
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,010
You've already vouched for him once.

214
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,490
Well, Mr. Yang,

215
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,710
this is the last time.

216
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,750
I promise!

217
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,960
One more mistake and he's out.

218
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,520
Thank you so much!

219
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,160
Where's my towel?

220
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,620
Here.

221
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,560
Director,

222
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,460
you always have a way.

223
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,420
What way?

224
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,280
It's Deputy Commissioner Yang who values talent.

225
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,130
Lu,

226
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,180
I haven't heard Hu asking for him.

227
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,140
Let's get the leaders' approval first,

228
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,300
then I'll talk to Hu.

229
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,570
Once Hu agrees, let him go

230
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,460
clean pigeon droppings.

231
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,440
Where are we heading

232
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,570
after all this time?

233
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,070
The boss said,

234
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,350
you're in for the strictest punishment.

235
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,430
Just wait.

236
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,060
Lan.

237
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,240
Wei.

238
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,000
Wei, what took you so long?

239
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,820
Almost done.

240
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,560
Thank you.

241
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,120
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

242
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,890
While you were away,

243
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,300
Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang took good care of me.

244
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,270
They know I'm pregnant,

245
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,470
and won't let me do anything.

246
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,910
Look, I've become fat.

247
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,430
They handle big things, and we support at home.

248
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,800
We're all family here.

249
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,040
Mom, is everything okay here?

250
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,140
Yes, don't worry.

251
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,240
Work hard with your boss.

252
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay.

253
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Don't worry. We're here.

254
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,770
Now, people here

255
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,260
think we are a family.

256
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,510
You two can work hard outside,

257
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,610
and leave the home to me.

258
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,580
Rest assured.

259
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,490
Mr. Wang, a toast to you.

260
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,620
Cheers.

261
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,310
Oh,

262
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,840
there's soup.

263
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,960
I'll go get it.

264
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,350
Sit down, I'll get it.

265
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,280
I'll go with you.

266
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,560
The boss said,

267
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,450
this is to teach you a lesson

268
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,380
you'll never forget.

269
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,360
No more mistakes from now on.

270
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,370
This is the last chance.

271
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,560
Reward for punishment.

272
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,180
I will never forget it.

273
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,220
Cheers.

274
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,619
Wang.

275
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,230
Lan.

276
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,069
today is like a dream.

277
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,410
Once your job is done,

278
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,760
that dream will come true.

279
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,230
When the time comes,

280
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,110
we'll find a place like this

281
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,320
to settle down.

282
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,660
Okay?

283
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,360
I still want to go back to Shanghai.

284
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,530
Can you talk to your superior

285
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,750
to transfer you

286
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,880
to a different post?

287
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,980
I'd like to be back before the baby is born.

288
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,570
Just wait a bit longer.

289
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,990
Trust me,

290
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,420
I'll make sure you and the baby

291
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
live a happy life.

292
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,470
Trust me.

293
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,310
I trust you.

294
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,170
Come get me soon.

295
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,410
Okay.

296
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,540
Why are you here?

297
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,020
The punishment is out?

298
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,280
Whatever it is, I'll take it.

299
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,280
You're just

300
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,670
being stubborn.

301
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,730
Trying to play tricks

302
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,080
and say things at wtll.

303
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,550
You think this is some martial arts novel?

304
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,870
Is this all

305
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,130
you're capable of?

306
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,690
Xu.

307
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,110
Just say it.

308
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,310
Spit it out.

309
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,000
How many years?

310
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,200
If Lu hadn't pleaded for you,

311
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,510
you would've been sentenced to three to five years.

312
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,110
He actually pleaded for me?

313
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,380
I thought he'd be happy to see me dead.

314
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,250
How much do you know about Lu?

315
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,390
He put his own career

316
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,760
on the line to keep you here.

317
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,110
At least he's loyal.

318
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Stop talking about loyalty.

319
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,720
If you continue to act recklessly, he'll be implicated.

320
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,090
Don't worry, Xu.

321
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,980
He's never bet wrong on me.

322
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,740
I won't let him lose.

323
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,350
You can't stay in the Social Affairs Office anymore.

324
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,970
There's a spot in the Police Pigeon Squad.

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,930
Do you want to go?

326
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,060
Me, raising pigeons?

327
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,520
No, the pigeon poop stinks.

328
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,070
I'm a police officer.

329
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,580
I don't run a farm.

330
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,710
Why would I go there?

331
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
Lu asked me to tell you,

332
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,790
if you go,

333
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,110
you can still be a police officer.

334
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,270
If you don't, you can never come back.

335
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,950
Are you okay?

336
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,990
Feihang, are you okay?

337
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,910
Are you okay?

338
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,510
Feihang.

339
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,790
Feihang, get up.

340
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,250
Feihang.

341
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,050
Feihang!

342
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,740
Feihang.

343
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,430
Are you okay?

344
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,350
What happened?

345
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,350
Feihang.

346
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,980
Feihang.

347
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,090
Mr. Zheng, I really appreciate it.

348
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,020
Thank you.

349
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
You're welcome.

350
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,200
It's our duty as teachers.

351
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,650
Feihang has congenital heart disease.

352
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,300
You should know it.

353
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,390
I know.

354
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,450
The doctor just said

355
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,780
if she had arrived a little later,

356
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,170
it could've been life-threatening.

357
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,200
So, you need to inform

358
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,130
the school about such situations.

359
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,450
For example, you know me,

360
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,530
so you could've told me,

361
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,180
or if you don't trust me,

362
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,370
that's fine,

363
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,970
inform the principal

364
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,200
or another teacher.

365
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,540
If something like this happens again,

366
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,730
we can be prepared.

367
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,880
I was careless.

368
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,590
Director Lu, I have a suggestion for you.

369
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,530
Go ahead.

370
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
I understand

371
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
your work is busy,

372
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,560
but no matter how busy,

373
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,940
you can't neglect your child's health.

374
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,080
You're right.

375
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,320
I have classes at school.

376
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,670
I'll leave it to you.

377
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,840
Okay, Mr. Zheng, thank you.

378
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,830
Goodbye.

379
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,720
Sorry for taking up your time.

380
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,520
It's okay.

381
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,050
[Doctors Work Code II]

382
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,160

00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,230
they have to remove me too.

760
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,110
To be honest,

761
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,670
if it wasn't for the Kuomintang,

762
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,740
I could have gone to America.

763
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,210
I understand.

764
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,950
Director,

765
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,180
I shouldn't

766
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,670
tell you these.

767
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,400
I didn't come here

768
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,870
just to complain.

769
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,210
There's something important.

770
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,750
Go ahead.

771
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,590
I heard from Guiheng that

772
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,020
some merchants in Shanghai

773
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,160
are storing up supplies.

774
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,520
Yes, that's true.

775
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,120
It's typical behavior of the people.

776
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,690
They're mainly stockpiling rice, cotton,

777
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,310
coal, and other

778
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,160
daily necessities.

779
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,730
So, I was thinking,

780
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,200
could we do something right now?

781
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,460
Look.

782
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,580
people in the Communist-controlled areas

783
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,040
need supplies

784
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,020
to live,

785
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,670
and so do the people

786
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,510
on the island.

787
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,370
If you could use your influence

788
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,470
to get a few dozen boats'

789
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,960
worth of grain and cotton

790
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,110
to the island,

791
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,000
that would be a great achievement.

792
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,140
And it could also shut up

793
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,370
those who criticize you from behind.

794
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,430
Normally, I shouldn't

795
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,330
refuse to do this.

796
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,100
But there have been

797
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,180
some changes at the Shanghai Station recently,

798
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,560
and the Communists have suspected me.

799
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,730
So, my plan is

800
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,370
to lie low for a while

801
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,060
and see how things go.

802
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,240
If we act rashly now,

803
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:02,870
I'm afraid...

804
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,270
I'm afraid it's too late.

805
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,540
Lanting, look,

806
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,550
with the war situation being so tense,

807
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,160
we must stand united.

808
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,970
We must achieve a great victory

809
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,490
to prove our Shanghai Station's loyalty.

810
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,350
Yes, at times like this,

811
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,840
we need to prioritize things.

812
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,080
If we run out of food, some people might starve,

813
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,020
but if we lose the Shanghai Station,

814
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,510
it will be nearly impossible for the NBIS

815
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,860
to establish a counteroffensive stronghold

816
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,960
in Shanghai in the future.

817
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,550
Shrike,

818
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,910
the Director came here himself.

819
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,030
Is this your attitude?

820
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,710
What do you mean, Secretary Liu?

821
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,090
That's what I mean.

822
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,160
Let me tell you,

823
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,150
acting impulsively now

824
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,690
might land you, Liu Guiheng,

825
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,250
in the Communist jail.

826
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm not afraid of death.

827
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,650
Guiheng.

828
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,830
Stop arguing.

829
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,480
Lanting,

830
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,290
let me show you something.

831
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,910
A written instruction from the President?

832
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,720
Yes.

833
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,660
It could be seen as a commendation

834
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,890
for our Shanghai Station,

835
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,350
but also as encouragement

836
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,920
and expectation from the President.

837
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,540
Lanting,

838
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,260
I think the President wants a victory more than

839
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,600
anyone else right now.

840
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,090
Understood.

841
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,430
Dozens of ships' worth of grain is no small feat,

842
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,920
but I'll do my best to ensure it's done.

843
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,770
Okay.

844
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,990
The President

845
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,590
saw your effort, sir.

846
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,190
But

847
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,630
isn't it too risky

848
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,990
to take action now?

849
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,310
No venture, no gain.

850
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,130
We have to take the risk.

851
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,350
We can't let the President down.

852
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,510
Warm up some wine. Let's celebrate.

853
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,070
Okay.

854
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Falcon will be back soon.

855
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,480
Ask Jin Maochang to get a new identity for him.

856
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,100
Okay.

857
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,070
I'm leaving. Enjoy.

858
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,690
Shaobai, have some too.

859
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,760
I have.

860
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,690
Come here.

861
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,530
Why are you working in police uniform today?

862
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,860
You have discipline. Don't you remember?

863
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,280
The counterfeit case has been solved.

864
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,080
I made a merit and got transferred to the bureau.

865
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,170
Really?

866
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,570
So, does that mean

867
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,840
you're getting promoted?

868
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,040
You could say that.

869
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,640
Now that I'm in the new post,

870
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,450
I basically have the final say.

871
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,750
Good for you, Shaobai.

872
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,910
Will it be busier

873
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,970
than the Social Affairs Office?

874
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,810
No way.

875
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,460
It'll be much more relaxed there,

876
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,510
and safer too.

877
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,460
I can even come home early to spend time with you.

878
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,380
Really?

879
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,840
Then come home early tonight.

880
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,150
I'll cook something nice for you.

881
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,920
Okay,

882
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,210
I'm leaving now.

883
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,680
Come home early.

884
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,670
Got it.

885
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,370
You're in good health,

886
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,070
climbing these stairs every day.

887
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,470
I've gotten used to it over the years.

888
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,620
You look weaker than me.

889
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,640
It's alright, not too breathless.

890
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,050
So many pigeons.

891
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,620
Of course there are pigeons.

892
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,040
This smell...

893
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,790
Fine.

894
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,290
Stop studying the smell.

895
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,530
Come here.

896
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,330
Attention!
