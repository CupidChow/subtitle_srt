[Dark Night and Dawn]

2
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,720
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,830
Yes.

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,110
He did play well.

5
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,400
But he forgot who we are—

6
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,990
the ones who can flip the board at any time.

7
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,090
That's a good point.

8
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,270
Eat before you go.

9
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,830
Okay.

10
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,760
Sir,

11
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,270
as requested by Taiwan,

12
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,470
we've already sent the coordinates

13
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,600
for important facilities like power plants,

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,530
water plants, and mechanical equipment.

15
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,820
Not just coordinates,

16
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,770
and the weather,

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,330
wind direction,

18
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,960
factory safety, production, and prevention.

19
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,860
Li Xu needs to get a handle on

20
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,150
their rhythm and pattern.

21
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,840
The more precise, the better.

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,480
Okay.

23
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,050
The New Year is coming, right?

24
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,850
Let's set off some firecrackers

25
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,200
to ward off the evil spirits and bring luck.

26
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,890
Go grab a bottle of liquor.

27
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,150
Alright, let's have a drink.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,040
This time, a total of 67 bombs were

29
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,620
dropped over Shanghai.

30
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,790
The aim was to

31
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,380
cause large-scale blackouts and water cuts in Shanghai.

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,000
They took off from Zhoushan Airport,

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,380
attacking Shanghai in four waves.

34
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,300
Hurry!

35
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,100
Bring a stretcher, quick!

36
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,070
There's someone down there.

37
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,610
Coming.

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Quick, lift him onto the stretcher.

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,700
Be careful.

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,240
Careful, careful!

41
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,940
Hurry!

42
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,430
Dr. Wang.

43
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,890
Get the patient out first.

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,510
Over there!

45
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,470
Over there!

46
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,160
Hurry!

47
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,370
Stretcher.

48
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,110
Two people over here.

49
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,900
Wrap up.

50
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,530
Yaohong, here, here, here!

51
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,430
How are you?

52
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,079
Huzi.

53
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,260
Nurse!

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,990
Shaobai!

55
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,430
Don't move him! Shaobai!

56
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,890
Doctor! Doc-

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,160
Hurry up.

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,470
His neck.

59
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,190
Nurse!

60
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,650
Be careful. The bombs are coming any minute.

61
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,750
Dr. Jin, there are more severe cases over here!

62
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,630
Hang in there, dude!

63
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,090
-Help him!
-Hang in there.

64
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,160
Take care of him.

65
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,670
Over here.

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,870
Get a stretcher.

67
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,530
Stretcher.

68
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,320
Hang in there.

69
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,120
Hang in there.

70
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,350
Hurry. Here.

71
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,910
Hang in there.

72
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,700
Dude.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,750
Dude.

74
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,660
Dude.

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,750
Coming.

76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,040
The stretcher is here.

77
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,620
There, hurry up!

78
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,350
Stretcher, over here!

79
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,660
Do something! Hurry!

80
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,890
And...

81
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,709
Hold on!

82
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,170
You must hold on!

83
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,140
Shaobai.

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,600
Are you okay?

85
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,620
I'm fine.

86
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,730
I'm fine.

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,430
Let's get out of here!

88
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,780
Hang in there.

89
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,280
Dude.

90
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,150
Wang, Zhao, hurry to save people.

91
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,660
Hurry!

92
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,870
Hurry up!

93
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,480
One, two.

94
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,410
Shaobai!

95
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,120
Shaobai!

96
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,240
What?

97
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,920
Shaobai!

98
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,510
What are you doing?

99
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,290
Let me go!

100
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,350
What are you doing?

101
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,710
I'm going to shoot that bastard!

102
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,910
Put the gun down, now.

103
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,200
Put the gun down!

104
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,550
Put the gun down.

105
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,810
I want to kill him too,

106
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,160
but not now.

107
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,280
We still have to wait.

108
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,530
Lu,

109
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,409
this is Shanghai.

110
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,730
This is my home.

111
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm useless, Lu.

112
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,680
Listen,

113
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,480
listen,

114
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,340
I promise you,

115
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,860
I will let him

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,750
and the people behind him

117
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,770
pay for what they did today.

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Every single one of them.

119
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,500
I'm a man of my word.

120
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,330
Trust me.

121
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,240
Ten miles,

122
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,660
all plunged into darkness.

123
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,290
The last time Shanghai was

124
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,140
this quiet at night must've been

125
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,970
when it was still a small fishing village.

126
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,610
Boss,

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
the Yangshupu Power Plant was hit by over a dozen bombs.

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,850
There's a massive blackout across Shanghai.

129
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,230
Almost all factories in the city have shut down production.

130
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,590
Even the water plant's affected.

131
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,680
If this keeps up,

132
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,230
it won't be long before they cause trouble at the Communist

133
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,290
Military Control.

134
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,510
Mr. Mao is pleased.

135
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,400
He sent a telegram to commend us.

136
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,720
With this operation,

137
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,390
he's likely to join the Political Action Committee

138
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,720
under Mr. Chingkuo's direct leadership.

139
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,320
We'll get even more support in the future.

140
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,020
The reason

141
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,050
our party has fallen so far

142
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,530
is because

143
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,640
we haven't dealt with the people who need to be killed.

144
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,380
Send a reply to Mr. Mao.

145
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,840
Tell him

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,790
the next set of bombing coordinates

147
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,030
will be

148
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,150
provided soon.

149
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,820
Chief,

150
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,600
if this bombing continues,

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,070
Shanghai will be ruined.

152
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,270
Even if we reclaim it,

153
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,270
we'll only get a pile of rubble.

154
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,910
What's destroyed are just insignificant ants.

155
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,310
Shanghai will always be Shanghai.

156
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,340
No one can change that fact.

157
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,280
What we're doing now

158
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,010
is purifying Shanghai completely.

159
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,900
The city's water and power supply are still under repair.

160
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,520
Chiang's forces chose this time to bomb us.

161
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,110
What's their aim?

162
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,909
They want to turn Shanghai into

163
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,040
a city without water and electricity,

164
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,690
to paralyze the lives of ordinary people,

165
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,030
to ruin our New China's

166
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,150
first New Year.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,260
Their intentions are truly despicable.

168
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,950
They're taking advantage of us because we lack

169
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,410
air force and air control.

170
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,670
Mr. Yang,

171
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,200
I'll go get some water.

172
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,090
Put it there.

173
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,120
Come, sit down.

174
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,780
Okay.

175
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,010
They think they can bully us because we don't have

176
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,420
air force and air control.

177
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,490
But that's just their wishful thinking.

178
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,020
Can we just sit and wait?

179
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,980
Let me tell you,

180
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,070
after coordination by the central government,

181
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,440
the Soviets are sending an Air Force Corps.

182
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,700
They'll soon arrive secretly in Shanghai.

183
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,420
By then,

184
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,540
we'll set up

185
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,450
a joint Air Defense Command Post.

186
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,970
I was thinking of

187
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,920
assigning you to assist in

188
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,510
ensuring the security of the command center.

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,789
Rest assured,

190
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,480
I'll complete the task.

191
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,390
I actually think

192
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,510
this is

193
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,530
a great chance to eliminate Shrike.

194
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,540
You mean

195
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,460
it's time to take advantage of the mole?

196
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,500
Look,

197
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,240
you can't block the light.

198
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,710
How long has it been?

199
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,210
Not even 42 hours,

200
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,280
and Shanghai has already restored water and electricity.

201
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,290
Kuomintang's

202
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,080
bombings and schemes—

203
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,620
against us Communists and the people—

204
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,590
are nothing but an ant shaking a tree.

205
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,720
They won't succeed.

206
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,710
Mrs. Zhang,

207
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,390
the food's almost ready.

208
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,630
Go get the comrade from

209
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,910
the well-drilling team to eat.

210
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,860
Alright.

211
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,930
Madam,

212
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,750
add a dish,

213
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,170
luncheon meat.

214
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,110
I usually don't even eat this myself.

215
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,440
Mr. Wang,

216
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,730
how come you have so much luncheon meat?

217
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,890
Did you stock up during the Liberation?

218
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,820
What are you talking about?

219
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,590
This is fresh!

220
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,700
Look, look.

221
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,830
Doesn't seem like Mr. Wang's style at all.

222
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,860
He's usually so stingy.

223
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,070
Not anymore.

224
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,310
Who are you calling stingy?

225
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,550
Who's stingy?

226
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,150
Look,

227
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,230
the Kuomintang's planes bombed us,

228
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,760
leaving us without water or electricity.

229
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,350
The well-drilling team has been working

230
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,030
day and night to dig wells for us,

231
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,110
without asking for money.

232
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,030
What's the big deal of these?

233
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,220
Mr. Wang,

234
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
you're quite enlightened now.

235
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,650
United

236
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,060

237
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,750
right?

238
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,150
You've improved.

239
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,390
Of course.

240
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,430
All the men in Taiping Lane went to

241
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,430
help with the rescue.

242
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,110
The women

243
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,230
either sew sandbags

244
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,010
or cook meals.

245
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,090
I can't fall behind.

246
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,140
Indeed.

247
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,830
Grandma Lin,

248
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,230
where's Uncle Lin?

249
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,380
He's with the well-drilling team.

250
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,030
Why?

251
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,630
Aunt Jin Yan called for him,

252
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,510
said it's urgent.

253
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,370
I'll go get him.

254
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,660
-Slow down.
-Slow down.

255
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,870
Don't fall.

256
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,410
Asked me to provide Shanghai's

257
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,950
recovery and production plans?

258
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,070
As soon as possible.

259
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,790
These factories

260
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,350
will be our main targets in the next

261
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,230
round of bombing.

262
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,490
You're bombing again?

263
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,710
Falcon,

264
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,730
I'm already under watch by the police.

265
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,460
Everything I do will be in vain.

266
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,670
If something goes wrong,

267
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,030
we're all doomed.

268
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,800
You need to complete the task I've given you.

269
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,550
Don't make me repeat myself.

270
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,350
A few days ago, with Li Yuquan's issue,

271
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,440
I did save your life after all.

272
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,040
I also want to ask you—

273
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,830
were you trying to save me

274
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,750
or kill me?

275
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,880
I asked my people.

276
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,030
They said it was a warning shot.

277
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,960
A warning shot?

278
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Shooting into the air is a warning,

279
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,540
but shooting at me is not.

280
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,250
You have my weakness.

281
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,690
No matter what I say or do,

282
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,740
it's wrong.

283
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,640
You should

284
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,860
be less calculative

285
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,210
and cooperate with us.

286
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,580
We won't harm Jin Yan.

287
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,230
You know,

288
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,550
this is the deal you made with Shrike.

289
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,530
At your age,

290
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,310
I assume you have a wife and kids, right?

291
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,680
Why do you ask?

292
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,220
I can tell that.

293
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,610
You couldn't kill me,

294
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
so now you're going after my family?

295
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,890
It seems that this knot will never be untied.

296
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,070

297
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,880
you and Shaobai

298
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,810
were once partners,

299
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,370
and technically, you're my junior.

300
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,980
Shrike holds something over me,

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,530
making me work for him.

302
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,000
But I think you're different.

303
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,200
Forget it if you mind.

304
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,080
I really am different.

305
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,640
I chose this willingly.

306
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,280
Shrike treats me well.

307
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,680
Good, then.

308
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,890
That's good.

everything we do

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,820
calm down. Have some water first.

387
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,750
How long will Director Lu be back?

388
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,590
He went to the bureau for a meeting.

389
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,850
He should be back soon.

390
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,790
I'll ask him to come here when he comes back.

391
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,310
Okay.

392
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,570
I have something to do.

393
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,710
Come on.

394
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,750
Hide here.

395
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,170
This is Lu's office.

396
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,140
They won't come in without reason.

397
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,610
Uncle Jin just reported it.

398
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,220
If Lu knows about this,

399
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,840
we will be in trouble.

400
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,530
Director Lu.

401
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,240
Dr. Jin.

402
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,580
What are you doing here?

403
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,460
Come here.

404
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,710
What's wrong?

405
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,930
I'll make it short.

406
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,230
Uncle Jin might think

407
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,430
Yan was kidnapped by agents.

408
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,710
He's here to report it.

409
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,640
You're testing him?

410
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,760
Why didn't you inform me first?

411
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,700
You may not agree even if I ask in advance.

412
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,510
There's no time to explain.

413
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,540
Uncle Jin is downstairs now.

414
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,640
I'll deal with you later.

415
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,820
You can scold me all you want,

416
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
but Uncle Jin's already here.

417
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,840
Let's deal with him first.

418
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,690
Wait for me here.

419
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,900
It's okay.

420
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,650
Shaobai.

421
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,270
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Jin.

422
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,930
I just got back from a mission.

423
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,080
Uncle Jin.

424
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,380
Director Lu.

425
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,360
Yan is missing.

426
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,430
I suspect she was kidnapped.

427
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,110
Mr. Jin, calm down.

428
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,700
Take your time.

429
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,460
When I got home, I saw Yan's car,

430
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,850
but the window and door were left open.

431
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,830
Yan isn't a careless person.

432
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,310
I've searched the whole house

433
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,870
and the Forensics Department.

434
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,700
She's nowhere to be found.

435
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,760
Doesn't this look like a kidnapping?

436
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,650
So, you think

437
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,420
Dr. Jin was taken from right

438
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,420
outside your house?

439
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,850
It's possible.

440
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,710
Uncle Jin,

441
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,560
don't be too upset.

442
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,660
Of course I am!

443
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
Yan is my only daughter!

444
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,250
She might be kidnapped now!

445
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,360
If something really happens to her,

446
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,590
do you understand

447
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,110
my feelings of a father?

448
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,730
Mr. Jin,

449
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,840
try to stay calm.

450
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,430
We'll do everything we can to find Dr. Jin

451
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,090
and inform you immediately.

452
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,980
I'm sorry, Uncle Jin.

453
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,200
New Year is coming soon.

454
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,410
If anything happens to Yan,

455
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,160
how can I spend the New Year?

456
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,470
Mr. Jin.

457
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,540
Director Lu.

458
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,780
Your dad's really worried about you.

459
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,730
Shaobai,

460
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,190
did my dad say anything?

461
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,260
Not much,

462
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,620
just that he's worried.

463
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,880
No news is good news.

464
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,060
Don't stress too much, Yan.

465
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,800
Kidnapped?

466
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,620
I'll see how you wrap this up.

467
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,760
I'll find a way to explain to my dad.

468
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,350
Sorry to trouble you, Director Lu.

469
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,950
Shaobai,

470
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm leaving.

471
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,740
Mr. Jin,

472
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,230
how did you figure out

473
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,650
the Social Affairs Office was testing you?

474
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,150
I think it's probably

475
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,610
just Yan acting on her own.

476
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,320
Shrike has no reason

477
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,930
to kidnap Yan

478
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,360
over the recovery plan,

479
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,850
especially since I already agreed to help.

480
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,520
So where are we going now?

481
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,630
Home.

482
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,730
Let's wait for Yan at home.

483
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,340
Okay.

484
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,210
What do you think about

485
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,030
Jin Maochang's behavior today?

486
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,120
Are you suggesting he came

487
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,210
to the Social Affairs Office on purpose?

488
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,080
There are two possibilities.

489
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,780
One, he truly believed

490
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,640
Jin Yan was kidnapped by agents.

491
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,200
The other is that

492
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,580
he's aware we're testing him

493
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,330
because of the Li Yuquan case.

494
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,160
He came to report because he found something.

495
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,860
So it could be his strategy

496
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,140
coming here to report.

497
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,830
[Be modest, cautious, humble, and patient]

498
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,720
Lu,

499
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,660
I also felt something was off.

500
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,740
Since I went to his house to investigate white phosphorus,

501
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,670
Uncle Jin has been acting strange.

502
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,430
Plus what happened later,

503
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,710
I think he is hiding something from me.

504
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,240
We've been following Uncle Jin today.

505
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,790
Is it possible that we were discovered?

506
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,960
[Be modest, cautious, humble, and patient]

507
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,790
That's possible.

508
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,270
If so, his visit to the Social Affairs Office

509
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,590
was a test for us.

510
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,060
Tracking and counter tracking.

511
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,190
It's not as simple as you think.

512
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,610
Alright.

513
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,700
What do you think

514
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,630
we should do about Uncle Jin?

515
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,220
[Be modest, cautious, humble, and patient]

516
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,590
Do nothing.

517
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,600
You and Jin Yan

518
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,140
stop making any moves.

519
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,010
Let Jin Maochang believe

520
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,700
we no longer

521
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,840
suspect him.

522
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,550
I understand.

523
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,380
Dad.

524
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,160
You're still up?

525
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,690
You're finally back.

526
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,070
I was so worried.

527
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,870
I went to the hospital.

528
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,220
What happened?

529
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,400
It's nothing.

530
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,950
On the way home,

531
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,480
I saw an accident at the intersection,

532
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,960
so I helped take the injured to the hospital.

533
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,360
I've been busy until now.

534
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,040
Oh, that's what happened.

535
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,890
What's wrong, Dad?

536
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,190
Nothing.

537
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,560
I was just worried because it was so late

538
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,210
and you weren't home,

539
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,530
so I went to the Public Security Bureau to report it.

540
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,210
Tell Director Lu about it.

541
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,840
Since you are back,

542
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,130
ask him to cancel the report.

543
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,530
Okay, Dad.

544
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,970
I'm already an adult.

545
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,750
You don't have to worry so much.

546
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,610
No matter how grown-up you are,

547
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,250
you're still my daughter.

548
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,710
You must be tired.

549
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,870
Go upstairs and rest.

550
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,280
Mr. Jin,

551
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,750
how did you figure out

552
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,170
the Social Affairs Office was testing you?

553
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,590
I think it's probably

554
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,050
just Yan acting on her own.

555
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,060
I don't blame you.

556
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,100
As long as you're fine.

557
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,230
The higher-ups are very pleased

558
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,190
with the bombing operation.

559
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,090
They sent congratulations

560
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,380
and praised

561
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,350
everyone of us.

562
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,010
It's my duty.

563
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,340
The New Year is coming.

564
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,950
I think we should do something.

565
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,950
Use some funds to buy

566
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,730
New Year's goods for every household

567
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,620
to

568
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,600
express thanks to their families.

569
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,540
Li Xu, you handle it.

570
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,550
Okay.

571
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,930
Purchasing

572
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,070
and distributing.

573
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,310
Be careful.

574
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,860
Falcon,

575
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,450
as the action team's leader,

576
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,860
I think you should stay,

577
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,220
in case any operations come up.

578
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,110
Okay.

579
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
No objections.

580
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,850
But, Chief,

581
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,280
I think I'm the better

582
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,440
for this mission.

583
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,470
I'm wanted in Shanghai,

584
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,800
so I can't move around.

585
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,090
I could lay low for a few days in Zhejiang.

586
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,180
Besides,

587
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,370
I have a lot of experience in action.

588
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,610
I can handle any

589
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,040
unexpected situations.

590
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,540
I think there's another reason

591
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,020
that's more valid

592
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,450
than what you just said.

593
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,540
Is Zhao Lan going to give birth?

594
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,770
Yes.

595
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,870
You should go check on her.

596
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,470
Okay.

597
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,240
Then

598
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,630
you two swap duties.

599
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,590
If you don't mind,

600
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,820
I'd like to express my greetings

601
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,400
with these spring couplets.

602
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,670
Thank you, Chief.

603
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,210
Pack these up.

604
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,880
[Lanting Studio]

605
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,590
How is it going in Lanting Studio?

606
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,370
Everything is fine.

607
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,740
Xu Wei has bought a lot of goods recently,

608
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,000
like he's preparing to visit relatives.

609
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,090
Keep a close watch on him.

610
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,720
Now that we've removed Li Yuquan,

611
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,240
we can act more freely.

612
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,290
Do we have

613
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,310
enough manpower?

614
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,370
If we follow them separately,

615
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,860
it's a bit tight.

616
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,360
If you need anything,

617
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,790
just ask Zhou for help.

618
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,310
Whether it's money or a place,

619
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,220
he'll provide it.

620
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,870
Got it.

621
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,700
Recruit people as soon as possible.

622
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,430
What kind of people do you need?

623
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,140
Just three things:

624
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,100
good fighters,

625
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,000
tight-lipped,

626
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,460
and only care about money.

627
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,740
I wish they were all like your brother.

628
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,060
You're not bad either.

629
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,710
I'll do my best.

630
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,540
Mr. Jin, what's this for?

631
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,840
New Year's money for the two kids.

632
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,630
Take it.

633
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,670
It's for the kids.

634
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,670
Their father is gone.

635
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,490
Poor things.

636
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,770
Buy them some nice clothes and food

637
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,770
so they can have a good New Year.

638
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,210
Thank you,

639
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,490
Mr. Jin.

640
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,260
I'll head back now.

641
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,070
Elder Grandma,

642
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,790
why is the "Fu" character upside down?

643
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,150
Because it's the New Year,

644
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,950
so the good fortune has arrived.

645
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
Younger Grandma,

646
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,320
why are you sweeping so high?

647
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,390
That's called

648
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,930
"dusting the eaves."

649
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,420
It sweeps away bad luck—

650
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,580
the more we sweep, the more prosperous we'll be.

651
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,630
Got it?

652
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,120
Feihang,

653
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,190
go check if Uncle Lin

654
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,670
and the others have come back.

655
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,310
Okay.

656
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,660
Uncle, Uncle Lin.

657
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,900
Feihang.

658
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,510
They're back.

659
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,110
Let's go.

660
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,540
You're wearing new clothes, Feihang.

661
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,530
So beautiful.

662
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,490
Hello, Mr. Lu.

663
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Happy New Year.

664
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,070
There was some work at the office,

665
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,000
so I'm a bit late.

666
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,550
It's okay.

667
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,190
Happy New Year.

668
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,870
You brought gifts?

669
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,790
I told him not to, but he insisted.

670
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,830
Said you all like it.

671
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,020
He insisted to buy.

672
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,590
Now that everyone's here,

673
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,470
I'll start preparing the New Year's dinner.

674
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,150
Okay.

675
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,870
I'll go bring out the dishes.

676
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,430
Need help?

677
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,910
No, no.

678
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,170
Shaobai, come help me.

679
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,350
Let's go help.

680
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,430
Grandma, let me help you.

681
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,510
Come on. Good girl.

682
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,230
Feihang wants to help too.

683
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,150
Take a seat.

684
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,130
Dad.

685
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,170
I'm back.

686
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,140
Stand still.

687
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
Wash your hands. Time to eat.

688
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,920
Has Ms. Zhang gone home?

689
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,470
Yes,

690
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,290
I gave her the holiday off.

691
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:24,950
It's New Year.

692
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,610
Everyone should reunite with their families.

693
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,680
Go get changed.

694
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,450
No.

695
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,640
The hospital's short on staff.

696
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,370
I'll have dinner with you

697
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,700
and then go back to help.

698
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,130
Just the two of us here.

699
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,540
It's always so quiet

700
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,550
around the New Year.

701
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,190
You're just used to the hustle and bustle.

702
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,170
Whether it's at the factory or in business,

703
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,300
you're always surrounded by people.

704
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,730
So, it feels off when

705
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,100
it comes to the New Year.

706
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,540
Being with them is all for work.

707
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,790
Being with my daughter, that's real peace.

708
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,050
Having you with me,

709
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,210
I'm very content.

710
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,500
Here's a gift for you.

711
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,450
Thank you, Dad.

712
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,450
Dad.

713
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,040
I wish you

714
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,910
health and longevity.

715
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,040
Yan, I wish you

716
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,530
beauty and safety.

717
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,750
Thank you, Dad.

718
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,780
Come on, Feihang.

719
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,110
Serve your Auntie first.

720
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,960
Have an egg dumpling.

721
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,230
It brings wealth and prosperity, okay?

722
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,110
Come on.

723
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,170
Here, Feihang,

724
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,470
have a meatball.

725
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,060
Here.

726
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,450
May we all be united.

727
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,830
Now, thank Grandma.

728
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,830
Thank you, Grandma.

729
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,560
Come on,

730
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,100
have some chili,

731
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,550
for a life full of energy.

732
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,930
Good for you.

733
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,260
Well,

734
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,440
Director Lu,

735
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,600
can I call you Zhengyang from now on?

736
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,270
Have some shrimp.

737
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,970
It means "welcome"

738
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,970
in Shanghainese.

739
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,230
-Yes.
-Welcome.

740
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,150
Thank you.

741
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,520
Mr. Zhengyang,

742
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,950
are you used to Shanghai cuisine now?

743
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,010
I'm getting used to it.

744
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,590
The more I eat, the better it tastes.

745
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,580
Really?

746
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,110
Feihang and I

747
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,750
haven't celebrated the New Year like this for years.

748
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,710
We should thank you

749
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,469
and Shaobai.

750
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,239
Don't be so polite.

751
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,230
Since Feihang came,

752
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,870
my moms have been so much happier.

753
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,270
Right?

754
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,909
Yeah.

755
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,840
Since she came,

756
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,020
our house has been livelier.

757
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,550
Yes.

758
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,210
We should thank you.

759
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:28,960
Yeah.

760
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,620
Thank you, Feihang.

761
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,489
Would you like some soup?

762
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,750
The power's out again.

763
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,100
Power's out?

764
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,860
I'll go get candles.

765
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,659
I'll do it.

766
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,699
Fireworks!

767
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,330
Look, everyone!

768
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,230
Look at that.

769
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,630
With the lights out, the fireworks shine even brighter.

770
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,510
Yes.

771
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,340
Feihang,

772
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,510
look at the fireworks.

773
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,659
Does it look like a blooming flower?

774
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,650
Isn't it beautiful?

775
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,449
Yes.

776
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,250
Fireworks and firecrackers, just like always.

777
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,090
When have the people of Shanghai

778
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,390
ever been scared?

779
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,670
We'll make it through.

780
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,340
We will, for sure!

781
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,890
Dad.

782
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,300
I've washed the dishes.

783
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,850
Now I'll

784
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,580
go back to the hospital.

785
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,580
It's dark outside,

786
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,300
and the hospital's cold.

787
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,890
Take this blanket with you.

788
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,950
Thanks, Dad.

789
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,850
There's a little girl who keeps kicking off her covers.

790
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,690
She can use it.

791
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,850
Take care of yourself too.

792
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,660
I have you,

793
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,550
always taking the best care of me.

794
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,280
Hearing that

795
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,650
makes it all worth it.

796
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm leaving.

797
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,580
Dad,

798
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,510
happy New Year.

799
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,540
Happy New Year.

800
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,110
Here you go.

801
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,790
Here, take it.

802
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,500
Thank you.

803
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,950
This eight-treasure rice is delicious.

804
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,050
We made it ourselves.

805
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,660
Here.

806
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,940
Thank you.

807
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,470
You're so kind.

808
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,400
We're bombed every day.

809
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,730
We don't even have a place to cook,

810
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,260
let alone a New Year's meal.

811
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,550
You're welcome.

812
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,680
Let's all happily welcome

813
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,780
the New Year together.

814
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,030
Okay.

815
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,430
Okay?

816
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,030
Good people are blessed.

817
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,700
Take it.

818
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,950
Thank you.

819
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,830
We made the pastries too.

820
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,240
There's enough for every household.

821
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,260
Xiaohua,

822
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,430
you're like a little cat.

823
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,970
Go home and give her a bath.

824
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,870
Let's start

825
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,510
the New Year clean.

826
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,120
Okay?

827
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,540
Here.

828
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,040
Here you go.

829
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,630
Come on.

830
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,840
Help yourselves.

831
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,710
Don't forget the pastries.

832
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,110
Take it.

833
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,710
Pastries.

834
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,580
Help yourself.

835
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,340
It's New Year.

836
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,420
Let's have a drink.

837
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,410
Pour it up.

838
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,280
Thanks.

839
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,120
How about

840
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,340
I drink with you?

841
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,060
Sure.

842
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,190
Pour it up.

843
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,440
Sir,

844
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,800
happy New Year.

845
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,750
Happy New Year.

846
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,690
Take it easy.

847
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,010
Take it easy.

848
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,470
Here.

849
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,380
Have a bite

850
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,120
to go with it.

851
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,110
Sir.

852
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,150
What's wrong?

853
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,320
Let's have a baby.

854
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,350
You're drunk after one drink?

855
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,290
I'm not drunk.

856
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,930
It's time to let bygones be bygones.

857
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,630
Hello?

858
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,010
I've sent out the recovery plan.

859
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,140
Thank you.

860
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,730
The Year of the Ox is finally over.

861
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,760
Yeah.

862
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,930
The Year of the Tiger is coming.

863
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,860
Wish you

864
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,920
the strength of a roaring tiger.

865
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,990
And wish you

866
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,750
safety in the Year of the Tiger.

867
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,400
We should all stay safe.

868
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,320
Come here, come here.

869
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,920
Is it beautiful?

870
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,850
Yes.

871
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,260
Make a wish.

872
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,720
I wish

873
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,180
our child

874
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,760
can be born healthy

875
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,940
and grow up

876
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,210
happily.

877
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,290
I also wish for

878
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,030
your peace,

879
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,920
health,

880
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,260
and happiness.

881
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,110
And I hope

882
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,620
our family can

883
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,780
always stay together,

884
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,250
never apart.

885
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,760
Tracking is a key skill for

886
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,030
us investigators.

887
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,640
It's not as simple as you think.

888
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,860
Years of police experience

889
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,460
might work with ordinary suspects,

890
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,940
but dealing with agents

891
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,250
requires specialized training.

894
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,030
Thank you.

895
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,970
Give it to me.

896
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,710
Thank you.

897
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,810
I want one.

898
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,320
Shanghai People's Radio,

899
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,850
March 14th.

900
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,430
Tonight,

901
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,800
two B25 bombers of the Kuomintang

902
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,910
flew over the Jiangnan Shipyard,

903
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,880
getting hit head-on by our anti-aircraft fire.

904
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,770
A B25 bomber was shot down

905
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,940
while the other fled in panic.

906
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,120
This is the fourth enemy aircraft

907
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,340
shot down this month.

908
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,790
Mayor Chen Yi

909
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,030
stated after the 2.6 bombing

910
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,890
that we must protect

911
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,940
Shanghai's skies at all costs.

912
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,100
According to intelligence from Taiwan,

913
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,280
it wasn't anti-aircraft fire that

914
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,440
took down our planes—

915
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,720
but a new Soviet Warrior Migg15.

916
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,270
The Soviet Air Force Corps has stationed in Shanghai.

917
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,510
The Communists are trying to

918
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,190
take control of the skies.

919
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,130
We need to take out their

920
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,280
command center.

921
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,830
No matter how many planes they send,

922
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,690
we'll turn them into scrap metal.

923
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,020
The Communists will guard it fiercely.

924
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,990
It'll be hard to pinpoint

925
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,770
their command post.

926
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,770
Start with Lu Zhengyang.

927
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,830
He used to work

928
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,750
in political security,

929
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,800
so he's likely responsible for their safety.

930
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,560
Falcon,

931
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,000

932
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,070
