00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,280
Historically, nations in the northwest usually had

192
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,920
advantages when campaigning against the southeast,

193
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,000
while those in the southeast faced greater challenges when advancing toward the northwest.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,740
This...

195
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,950
Is that so?

196
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,370
I've never heard of it.

197
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,560
What I heard is

198
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,120
the south was known for talents and the north was known for generals.

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,400
The people in the north were a bit tough,

200
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,530
so they were aggressive and good at fighting.

201
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,340
The people in the south indulged in pleasure and comfort.

202
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,990
They paid attention to the four arts of the Chinese scholar,

203
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,070
so they lost their territories.

204
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,290
Not exactly.

205
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,770
Look at the current Kuomintang.

206
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,370
It occupies the southeast region.

207
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,920
It also claimed it would attack the mainland.

208
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,740
But the people represent the general trend.

209
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,430
Yes.

210
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,110
It's useless to resist desperately.

211
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,030
Yes.

212
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,050
War is indeed too horrible.

213
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,750
We ordinary people just want

214
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,830
to live a peaceful life.

215
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,510
Yes.

216
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,680
Mr. Zheng, what you want

217
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,640
is also what all the Chinese people want.

218
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,850
Have some water.

219
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,030
What are you doing here?

220
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,010
Abort the mission.

221
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,180
Shrike has his own plan.

222
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,470
This is Director's order.

223
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,370
Do you listen to Director or Shrike?

224
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,950
Liu Guiheng is using you!

225
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,410
Who do you think you are?

226
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,620
How dare you talk to Deputy Chief Yang like that!

227
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,510
I'm the new leader of the action team.

229

I'll verify it after the operation.

230

00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,820
we policemen have our own procedures in case handling.

247
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,850
You just need to cooperate.

248

No, no.

249
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,830
I don't understand this.

250
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,920
You told me we were going to Beijing.

Where is your leader?

255
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,210

257

please come here!

258
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,560
Mr. Zheng, don't shout.

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,450
What's going on?

260
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,340
I trusted you very much.

Calm down first.

I can't calm down.

267
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,260
You have to give me an explanation.

268

if you are still the police for the people.

to imprison a teacher like me

272
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,480
for so many days?

273
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,280
What exactly do you want?

274
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,460
Mr. Zheng, this trip

275
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,980
is also part of the political examination.

276
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,770
Please understand.

277
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,610
What kind of logic is that?

278
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,570
It's a waste of manpower and money.

279
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,390
All of you, sit down.

It's done.

284
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,410
Don't worry.

285
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,770
Continue to keep an eye on Yang Hui.

286
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,480
He's the key to Mr. Zheng's plan.

287
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,630
First, Mr. Zheng misled the police

288
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,610
and made them think Yang Hui is Shrike.

289
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,150
Then Mr. Zheng let the police find the code book in Yang Hui's house

290
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,720
and told Yang Hui

291
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,030
he can only help him out of trouble if he makes a big scene.

292
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,260
Lastly, he'll use you to deal with Liu Guiheng.

293
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,020
Now, I guess Yang Hui

294
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,740
must have contacted the Anti-Communist Salvation Army.

295
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,070
I guess the NBIS

296
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,260
will send a telegram soon

297
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,170
to approve Yang Hui's application

298
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,630
for the Anti-Communist Salvation Army's operation.

299
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,270
The Communist Party will

300
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,400
decipher this telegram

301
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,630
based on the code book

302
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,070
found in Yang Hui's house

303
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,870
to intercept them in advance.

304
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,940
So the Anti-Communist Salvation Army will definitely fail.

305
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,870
And they have clues on Yang Hui.

306
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,800
Your mission is

307
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,290
to ensure Yang Hui's death

308
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,740

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,090
When we transferred Zheng Lanting,

311
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,500
the agents didn't take action at all.

312
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:29,770
Lu,

313
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,930
can this prove

314
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,710
Zheng Lanting has nothing to do with the agents?

315

325

327
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,830
is under his control.

00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,890
There are two people in the photo.

567
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,630
The one in the front is Yang Hui.

568
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,440
The one behind him is Wang Liqun.

569
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,890
On the back of this photo,

570
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,150
there is also a very blurry date.

571
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,870
[Wang Liqun] [Hospital's picture poster]

572
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,460
It's probably December 1938.

573
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,950
That was the graduation time

574
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,880
of the first Linli Special Training Class of the NBIS.

575
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,600
Looks like Yang Hui

576
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,900
was the mentor Wang Liqun mentioned.

577
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,960
He was the perpetrator of the explosion four years ago.

578
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,620
He also had anthrax bacteria.

579
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,110
Those are the evidence.

580
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,380
The driver in the car accident back then

581
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,320
was also him.

582
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,370
Then everything is very clear.

583
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,310
All the evidence shows

584
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,990
Yang Hui was Shrike,

585
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,430
the chief of the Shanghai Special Station.

586
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,470
We are lucky.

587
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,040
We just joined them and already solved such a big case.

588
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,100
Who could the person firing the blank shot at the scene be?

589
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,300
Do you really think Yang Hui was Shrike?

590
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,230
All the evidence we have now

591
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,550
shows he was.

592
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,540
[Be modest, cautious, humble, and patient]

593
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,350
That's the problem.

594
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,250
Everything we found out about him

595
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,350
and even his death

596
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,430
happened at the perfect timing.

597
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,640
It's like

598
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,830
someone arranged everything in advance.

599
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,830
It's indeed possible.

600
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:50,250
[Be modest, cautious, humble, and patient]

601
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,030
After we thoroughly investigate the Shanghai Special Station

602
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,340
and find the most direct witness,

603
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,650
the truth will come out.

604
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,740
If Yang Hui was not Shrike,

605
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,030
the real Shrike

606
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,930
will be a very tricky opponent.

607
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,310
Mr. Zheng, you still are not feeling well?

608
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,610
It doesn't matter how I'm feeling.

609
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,940
Just tell me what I should do to cooperate with you.

610
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,760
You can leave now.

611
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,810
I can leave now?

612
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:39,699
Yes.

613
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,960
Director Lu,

614
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,469
do you know how I managed to get through

615
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,360
the past few days?

616
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,030
Each day felt like a year.

617
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,400
When I was lying here just now, I was thinking

618
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,390
back then,

619
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,390
even when the Japanese gave us a hard time,

620
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,470
I don't think it was that hard.

621
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,280
You're right.

622
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,620
Mr. Zheng, I'm sorry for having made you suffer.

623
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,420
Fine. Working people are not afraid of hardships.

624
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,370
We're just afraid of being wronged.

625
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,480
You're too serious, Mr. Zheng.

626
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,860
Your wife

627
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,520
is waiting for you at the gate to go home.

628
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,580
Let me walk you out.

629
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,400
No, no, no.

630
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,160
I can't just leave

631
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,350
like this.

632
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,820
If I leave here with nothing,

633
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,460
what will the teachers and students in the school think of me?

634
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,630
How should I explain to my neighbors

635
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,330
and my friends?

636
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
You have to clear my name.

637
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,080
At least you should give me a certificate.

638
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,550
The content

639
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,480
of the certificate has to be as follows:

640
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,910
the police's investigation over the past few days shows

641
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,640
Zheng Lanting is a good citizen.

642
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,950
He is not an agent.

643
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,510
Okay.

644
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,650
The students have been waiting for you, right?

645
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,880
How have you been? Is everything alright?

646
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,040
It's okay.

647
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,060
Let's...

648
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,630
go home.

649
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,080
Goodbye.

650
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,700
Lanting.

651
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,550
Get me some hot water.

652
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,530
Okay.

653
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
It's almost done.

654
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,100
Okay.

655
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,170
Right.

656
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,830
Take a photo

657
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,270
of the certificate and develop it.

658
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,270
I'll hang it in the studio tomorrow.

659
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,210
Lanting,

660
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,200
time to eat.

661
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,030
Where are the paintings

662
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,630
in the drawer in the room upstairs?

663
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,670
I put those paintings

664
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,960
in Yang Hui's house.

665
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,780
The police can be more convinced

666
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,700
that he was Shrike after finding them.

667
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,430
I just wanted to clear your name.

668
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,380
I'm going to say it again.

669
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,290
Please don't touch

670
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,030
anything in that room

671
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,790
without my permission.

672
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,090
Got it?

673
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,940
Yes.

674
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,810
Let's eat.

675
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,910
Today's dinner

676
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,340
is a hearty one.

677
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,370
Thank you.

678
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,770
Xu Wei,

679
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,590
you will die a horrible death.

680
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,320
Shrike.

681
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,880
Shrike.

682
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,790
You're back.

683
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,230
Great.

684
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,700
It must be because

685
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,400
Yang Hui followed my order

686
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,290
and saved you, right?

687
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,490
It was just a trivial matter. No need to bother Yang Hui.

688
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,670
The Public Security Bureau has found out the truth.

689
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,630
I'm innocent now.

690
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,830
That's good.

691
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,500
That's good.

692
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,060
Xu Wei told me

693
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,270
you made great efforts

694
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
to save me.

695
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,570
So I specially came here to thank you.

696
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,650
No! No!

697
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,300
Shrike,

698
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,160
what are you going to do?

699
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,470
We have the same rank

700
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,440
in the NBIS.

701
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,610
Without Boss's order,

702
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,030
don't you dare touch me.

703
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,460
Xu Wei!

704
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,390
Xu Wei!

705
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,780
Xu Wei, what are you going to do?

706
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,990
Don't say that.

707
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,690
We are comrades.

708
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,630
Why would I touch you?

709
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,260
It's just that young people

710
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,850
are ignorant.

711
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,400
Secretary Liu, please don't take it to heart.

712
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,110
Your whole body must be numb.

713
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,570
It's fine.

714
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,270
Not very numb.

715
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,710
Relax yourself.

716
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,640
The point is...

717
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,030
Shrike,

718
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,640
there shouldn't be

719
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,290
any misunderstanding between us.

720
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,110
Like you said just now,

721
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,200
we are comrades.

722
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,570
And we both are working in Shanghai.

723
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,050
We should...

724
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,250
take care of each other...

725
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,660
and help each other, right?

726
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,380
I

727
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,650
really wanted to save you.

728
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,390
It took me a lot of effort.

729
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,880
You really wanted to save him?

730
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,270
You mean it took you a lot of effort to stab him in the back.

731
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,870
Who do you think you are?

732
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,790
Who are you to speak here?

733
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,510
You're trying to drive a wedge between the higher-ups.

734
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,750
This crime alone

735
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,410
is enough for me to kill you according to our law!

736
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,420
You bastard!

737
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,580
Shrike,

738
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,380
don't listen to him.

739
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,660
You know clearly

740
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,600
what kind of person I am.

741
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,390
I'm not that kind of person.

742
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,250
What kind of person do you mean?
