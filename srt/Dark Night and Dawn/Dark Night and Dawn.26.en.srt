[Episode 26]

3
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,270
After thinking about it,

4
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,759
I've decided to add two more men to Office 2.

5
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,830
One is Chen.

6
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,870
I believe he is familiar to you.

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,470
He once worked in the special investigation team.

8
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,150
And this is Li Yaohong.

9
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,950
I specially poached him

10
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,200
from Jinan's Public Security Bureau.

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,020
My name is Li Yaohong.

12
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,630
Li as in Li Bai. Yao as in Zhao Yao.

13
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,700
Hong as in Hong Yan.

14
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,870
Please take care of me.

15
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,640
Yaohong is from Shandong.

16
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,270
He is quite experienced.

17
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,510
In 1948,

18
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,030
he started working in the intelligence section

19
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,070
of the Inspection Office of Jinan's Public Security Bureau.

20
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,440
He's also an expert in information analysis.

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,100
Welcome to Office 2, Yaohong.

22
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,910
Yaohong,

23
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,550
the case of the Lu Ji assassination group,

24
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,110
solved by Jinan's Public Security Bureau,

25
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,590
has been included in the training materials for young police officers.

26
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,560
Talk about it with us when there is a chance.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,420
I'm flattered.

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,150
Director Lu, you're also an experienced underground operative.

29
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,520
I should learn from you in the future.

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,829
Alright. You guys can learn from each other

31
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,829
and improve together in the future.

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,270
Yaohong,

33
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,040
your primary work is to focus on the bureau's internal matters.

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,829
Don't worry.

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,380
I've started since I received the materials from here

36
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,750
in Shandong.

37
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,420
Mr. Zhengyang will give you full support.

38
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,060
Okay.

39
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay. I'm leaving.

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,360
Come on, Bai.

41
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,350
Rice grains are good.

42
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,610
Try some.

43
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,950
They are specially for you.

44
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,190
Come on. Have some.

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,250
Can a pigeon understand what you say?

46
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,270
It can understand what I say.

47
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,490
But it definitely can't understand what you say.

48
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,230
I think

49
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,160
it's suitable for you to feed pigeons here.

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Why are you here?

51
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,750
I brought you something.

52
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,850
That's a lot of things.

53
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,040
Lu asked you to bring me something good?

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,770
They're all good stuff. Take a look.

55
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,100
Lu

56
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
was still pretending in front of me.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,690
Not bad.

58
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,680
Aren't these all from my office desk?

59
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,010
What's going on?

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,010
Office 2 has a new member.

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,800
It's inappropriate to put your stuff on his desk.

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,460
You need to make space for him.

63
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,130
Someone occupied my seat?

64
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,340
What happened?

65
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,690
Shaobai,

66
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,430
you also worked in Office 2 before.

67
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,360
There are rules. I can't tell an outsider about this.

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,080
Outsider?

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,510
How many cases have I solved?

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,230
You're calling me an outsider?

71
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,740
You were not, but now you are an outsider.

72
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,560
You can't blame others.

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,390
Director asked you to go back many times,

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,320
but you refused.

75
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,100
Not that many times, okay?

76
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,300
Isn't once enough?

77
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,870
I have to go.

78
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,550
I have a mission. I'm leaving.

79
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,310
What's the background of the new member?

80
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,590
Tell me about him.

81
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,310
I told you there are rules.

82
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,570
How can I tell you that?

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,840
Sorghum candies.

84
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,890
Two catties.

85
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,030
Two catties? Are you sure?

86
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,830
I can even buy you three catties.

87
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,600
Listen carefully.

88
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,390

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,550
Go on.

92
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,310
No way.

93
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,640
I can't break the rules.

94
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,120
Three catties of sorghum candies.

95
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,120
I...

96
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,270
I can't believe Doggy.

Li Yaohong.

98
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,880

I didn't expect that

101

I can eat such authentic steamed buns in Shanghai.

102
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,290

Hello, Shaobai.

112
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,040
Someone in Office 2 mentioned you just now.

113

I'm sorry.

I have something

119

to tell Director Lu.

120
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,320
Why don't you...

121
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,540
Yaohong is not an outsider.

122
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,640
You can say it in front of him.

123
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,870
The steamed bun is delicious.

124
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,110
I'm going to get another one.

125
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,870
Don't.

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,960
I have a pancake here. I can't finish it.

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,670
Well...

128
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,710
I happen to be hungry.

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,500
Yaohong, I heard you're from Shandong, right?

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,540
Yes, I love steamed buns.

131
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,360
I guess you don't know much about Shanghai.

132
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,900
Why don't you let me guide you?

133
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,350
I...

134
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,300
No need for that.

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,340
Yaohong

136
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,500
was an underground operative in Shanghai over ten years ago.

137
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,490
You were still in middle school at that time, right?

138
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,020
Solving cases

139
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,320
is about capability,

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
not seniority, right?

141
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,330
Without seniority,

142
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
how can you have the capability?

143
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,080
Penny wise and pound foolish.

144
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,820
You're flattering yourself.

145
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,030
Guys, enjoy your meal.

146
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,220
I'm full.

147
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,890
I'll leave that to you.

148
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,870
Well, do you want chili sauce?

149
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,670
No, it's good.

150
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,150
Listen,

151
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,290
that seat is mine.

152
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,780
Ask him to move away as soon as possible.

153
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,070
Didn't you tell me you wouldn't come back?

154
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,930
Besides, I really can't offer you

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,920
the position you want.

156
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,440
Are you playing dumb, Lu?

157
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,200
Stop eating.

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,010
Let's talk in your office.

160
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,570
Director, this...

161
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,980
Give it to the canteen later.

162
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,820
Lin Shaobai.

163
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Close the door.

164
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,070
Okay.

165
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,270
What's the background of Li Yaohong, the new member?

166
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,330
Is he reliable?

167
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,070
Let's talk about you first.

168
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,390
What exactly do you want?

169
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,250
Do you really not understand or are you pretending?

170
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,810
I've been staying in the Police Pigeon Squad

171
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,390
just to avoid the moles.

172
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,500
When did you start to suspect there are moles?

173
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,090
When you saved the entrepreneurs,

174
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,350
Deputy Commissioner Yang specially told us to keep

175
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,130
Dai Yueqing's involvement in the investigation confidential, right?

176
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,110
Then why did those agents

177
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,570
act so swiftly?

178
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,070
They went to Tong Susu, Dai Yueqing's son,

179
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,150
immediately.

180
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,679
Who could possibly know that?

181
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,960
Someone in the special investigation team.

182
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,350
Otherwise, they wouldn't have acted so swiftly.

183
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,929
Do you remember the conclusion we drew

184
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,110
after Bai Qingfang died?

185
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,110
He died,

186
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,190
but it can't prove

187
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,350
there are no other moles among us.

188
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,400
It's very likely that Shrike's spies

189
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,550
have infiltrated some key positions

190
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,280
in the Public Security Bureau.

191
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,260
Whether it's the Shanghai Special Station

192
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,730
or the moles in the bureau,

193
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,210
they'll only have their eyes on the Social Affairs Office

194
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,640
specializing in fighting against agents.

195
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,620
They won't have their eyes on the Police Pigeon Squad

196
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,090
or me.

197
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,280
I stand in the light.

198
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,960
They lurk in the dark.

199
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,240
Now you're hiding in the dark too.

200
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,770
Look, you know it clearly, right?

201
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,400
It's easy

202
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,670
to see through your little ruse.

203
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,600
Then why did you ask Huzi to bring me my stuff?

204
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,920
It was work.

205
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,940
I'm serious.

206
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,160
You let Li Yaohong take my seat.

207
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,370
There aren't many officially budgeted positions in the Social Affairs Office.

208
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,300
Can I still come back in the future?

209
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,750
That depends on your future performance.

210
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,220
Keep up the good work, Shaobai.

211
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,500
Listen,

212
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,990
my mom made chili sauce for you a few days ago.

213
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,880
But I won't give it to you.

214
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,120
You...

215
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,350
Feihang!

216
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,510
Uncle Lin, why are you here?

217
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,340
[People's Elementary]

218
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,630
Where is Uncle Lu?

219
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,710
He has something urgent to handle today,

220
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,670
so I came to pick you up.

221
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,270
Later,

222
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,910
I'll make you something delicious at my place, okay?

223
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,470
Okay.

224
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,320
Let's go.

225
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,890
Come on.

226
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,270
Don't move, Liuyi.

227
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,040
She's drawing a portrait of us.

228
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,170
Come on.

229
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,230
Feihang,

230
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,120
make me look handsome in the portrait.

231
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,560
Don't be too realistic.

232
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,310
Uncle Lin, I'm just practicing.

233
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't be too nervous.

234
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,840
I'm not nervous.

235
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,060
Just don't make me look like a disaster.

236
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,970
Here, Feihang, have some fruits.

237
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,630
Feihang, was the food just now delicious?

238
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,530
Yes, I'm stuffed.

239
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,390
Thank you, Grandma Lin.

240
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,380
Good girl.

241
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,940
Come on. Let me take a look.

242
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,320
Sis, look. They look quite alike.

243
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,610
Indeed.

244
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,960
Feihang is very good

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,280
at drawing.

246
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,250
She's talented.

247
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,130
Sit tight. Don't move.

248
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,520
Alright, have some fruits.

249
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,500
You can continue to draw later, okay?

250
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,410
Feihang, here.

251
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,970
Feihang, have some fruits.

252
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,660
Mr. Lu, you're here.

253
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,820
Director Lu, you're here.

254
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,690
Where is Feihang?

255
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,600
She fell asleep.

256
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,570
She fell asleep.

257
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,650
It's late today.

258
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,190
Let her sleep here.

259
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

260
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,810
I'm leaving then.

261
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,280
I'll come to pick her up tomorrow.

262
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,710
Mr. Lu, you haven't eaten, have you?

263
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,180
I'll go cook something for you, okay?

264
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,870
Cook something for you.

265
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,910
I've eaten.

266
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,330
Then sit for a while.

267
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,660
Have some fruits. Come.

268
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,620
Sit.

269
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,970
Sit first. We have something to tell you.

270
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Have a seat first.

271
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,630
Thank you.

272
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,520
Thank you.

273
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,430
What's wrong?

274
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,510
We have decided

275
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,830
to let Feihang live here for now.

276
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,870
Feihang told me on our way back.

277
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,780
She's busy with the publicity painting

278
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,350
for the National Day every day.

279
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,300
She also needs to do the parade rehearsal.

280
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,850
She'll be very busy every day.

281
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,830
My house happens to be near the school.

282
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,360
It'll be very convenient for her to live here.

283
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,030
It'll cause you inconvenience.

284
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,400
Not at all.

285
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,080
You've been so busy lately.

286
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,300
Do you have time to take care of Feihang?

287
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,580
Besides,

288
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,610
my two mothers are great cooks.

289
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,340
They can cook her delicious food every day.

290
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,530
Can you do that?

291
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,540
Director Lu,

292
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,830
we are bored at home anyway.

293
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,140
Let Feihang accompany us.

294
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,290
Rest assured.

295
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,240
Yes.

296
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,700
I need to ask Feihang if she agrees.

297
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,880
Of course she agrees.

298
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,440
We've asked her.

299
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,330
Look how soundly she is sleeping.

300
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,660
Really?

301
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,430
Okay.

302
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,420
I'll calculate her living expenses later.

303
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,870
Director Lu,

304
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,140
that sounds too distant.

305
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,880
You've helped a lot

306
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,990
with Shaobai's work.

307
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,380
Should we give you money for that?

308
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,340
That's right.

309
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,650
It's fine if he wants to give us money.

310
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,630
But you won't be able

311
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,290
to finish calculating until tomorrow morning.

312
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,960
By the way, Mr. Lu,

313
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,630
I have something to tell you.

314
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,230
Okay.

315
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,990
Shaobai made a contribution

316
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,780
by catching agents, right?

317
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,250
Can you

318
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,470
transfer him back to your team?

319
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,810
That's right.

320
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,360
Although... the Police Pigeon Squad is good,

321
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,610
Shaobai is still young.

322
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,050
He should do something important, right?

323
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,580
My good mothers,

324
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,400
I have my own ideas

325
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,810
about my work.

326
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,340
Don't worry about it, okay?

327
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,160
How can we not worry about it?

328
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,420
You want to retire at such a young age?

329
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,560
This is a new society. You must be positive.

330
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,430
Do you hear me?

331
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,130
Okay. Got it.

332
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,200
About Feihang, it's decided then.

333
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,040
Okay.

334
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,120
Listen up, everyone.

335
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,140
Based on the testimonies of these agents,

336
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,610
identify their backgrounds

337
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,640
and check the missions they carried out.

338
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,030
Then analyze and compare the information

339
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,580
to find the connections.

340
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,420
It may be related to the Shanghai Special Station's operation.

341
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,150
Get started.

342
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,140
-Yes.
-Yes.

343
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,630
Yes.

344
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,220
Okay, I'll handle these.

345
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,690
[Shanghai People's Government Public Security Bureau]

346
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,850
Since the announcement of the policies for handling agents in the newspaper,

347
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,880
over 200 agents have come to the bureau to turn themselves in,

348
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,140
and over 1,000 clues have been reported.

349
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,380
But most of them are already known to us

350
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,890
or have been uncovered.

351
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,810
Looks like you've found something.

352
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,770
Liang Yunda, a salesman of the chemical plant.

353
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
He had been inactive until he received a call

354
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,710
from his superior four days ago.

355
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,620
He was asked to help purchase white phosphorus.

356
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,130
He was worried he would get too deeply involved,

357
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,790
so he chose to turn himself in.

358
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:52,280
[Shanghai People's Government Public Security Bureau]

359
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,750
Look at this.

360
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,130
The task is to draw a distribution map of the dock warehouses.

361
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,290
These two agents

362
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,170
have never appeared before.

363
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,460
But they both received their tasks

364
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,570
four days ago.

365
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,870
So we can assume

366
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,790
they probably have

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,760
the same superior.

368
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,320
Besides,

369
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,700
there must be a connection

370
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,380
between their tasks.

371
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,600
How about this?

372
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,850
Ask Liang Yunda to tell his superior

373
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,570
that white phosphorus is ready

374
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,310
and the transaction can proceed.

Liang Yunda is just a nobody.

377
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,320
Just give him a codename like Pigeon or Sparrow.

378
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,090
This.

379
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,430
Lu.

380
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,090
Chen.

381
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,640
You're going out with so many men. Are you on a mission?

382
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,430
We'll talk after we come back.

383
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,160
Okay.

384
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,040
I'll stay here.

385
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,440
[Liang Yunda]

386
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,440
Thank you.

387
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,860
Peregrine Falcon is quite capable.

388
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,110
He got the goods within just a few days.

389
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,510
Mr. Mao will surely give you

390
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,790
a bigger reward than Shrike.

391
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,120
What Peregrine Falcon?

392
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,990
It's the codename I gave to Liang Yunda from the chemical plant.

393
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,600
Impressive, Si.

394
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,030
You're doing an increasingly better job.

395
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,990
You're quite mature.

396
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,480
Develop more operatives.

397
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,829
I'll promote you when the time is right.

398
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,760
Thank you, Boss.

399
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,849
Okay. Let's go.

400
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,760
What are you doing here?

401
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,060
Are you going to meet Liang Yunda?

402
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,460
Do I need to report to you?

403
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,940
Liang Yunda has joined the Communist Party.

404
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,440
I just received a message from Nyctibius.

405
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,310
Liang Yunda, who has joined the Communist Party, is cooperating with the police.

406
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,780
Go see if something went wrong

407
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,590
on Liu Guiheng's side.

408
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,260
Okay.

409
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,630
Something happened to him

410
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,700
right after the goods were ready.

411
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,100
That's too coincidental.

412
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,670
Si has done a perfect job.

413
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,320
You just don't want me to succeed, do you?

414
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,180
Secretary Liu,

415
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,760
ask Si to take a look, okay?

416
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,130
Put on your hat. Be careful.

417
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,670
Boss, how much is the canned food?

418
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,730
Five silver dollars per can.

419
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,660
Do you want some?

420
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,870
There are all kinds of flavors.

421
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,750
Let me see.

422
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,550
[Liang Yunda]

423
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,790
One cup of Americano, please enjoy.

424
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,900
I'll pass.

425
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,230
All right, you've delivered the message.

426
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,070
Go back first.

427
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,860
No hurry.

428
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,090
There are other things we need to talk about.

429
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,320
Chief asked me to ask you

430
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,710
why you bought so much white phosphorus

431
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,100
without permission.

432
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,240
Do I need his permission?

433
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,760
We need to burn so many supplies.

434
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,160
So I prepared more white phosphorus

435
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,250
as a precaution.

436
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,920
Does Shrike have a problem with that?

437
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,750
Chief asked me to tell you

438
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,640
from now on,

439
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,630
all your...

440
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,470
Don't point your finger at me.

441
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,370
The mission has to be terminated.

442
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,970
Your men have to retreat!

443
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,410
Go back and ask Shrike

444
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,110
what he said in front of the boss.

445
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,490
He and I are partners.

446
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,380
He's not my boss!

447
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,760
Secretary Liu,

448
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,600
if it weren't for Chief today,

449
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,210
you would have fallen into the trap of the police

450
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,210
and been close to getting arrested.

451
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,570
I still don't know if what you said is true.

452
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,050
Go back and tell him this.

453
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
If he wants me to quit,

454
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,320
no one should continue!

455
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,990
Ask him to close his studio as soon as possible.

456
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,660
What's the point of me repairing timepieces here?

457
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,450
Let's just go to Taiwan Island together

458
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,210
to grow sweet potatoes there!

459
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,830
Grow sweet potatoes. I'll tell Chief that!

460
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,720
Just tell him every word I said directly!

461
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,980
Look at you! Are you behaving in the way a higher-up should?

462
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,020
Xu Wei,

463
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,950
I've put up with you for a long time.

464
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,550
Is this how you talk to your higher-up?

465
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,790
If it weren't for the special situation now,

466
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,760
I would have killed you long ago!

467
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,340
Who do you think you are?

468
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,480
Boss, I saw it.

469
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,940
What did you see?

470
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,050
Liang Yunda.

471
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,530
What about Lu Zhengyang?

472
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,460
I didn't see him.

473
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,940
What did I tell you?

474
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,050
But... the waiters in the cafe have been replaced.

475
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,260
Secretary Liu,

476
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,950
Lu Zhengyang was in the newspaper before.

477
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,150
Why would they let him see him so easily?

478
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,760
Are there more customers than usual?

479
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,320
Calm down.

480
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,270
Let's sit down and talk.

481
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,430
Sit.

482
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,250
Secretary Liu.

483
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,950
Chief saved your life again, right?

484
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,410
From now on,

485
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,910
listen to us, okay?

486
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,660
I'm listening.

487
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,800
We'll purchase

488
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,460
and assemble the explosives,

489
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,800
select the warehouse for ignition,

490
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,370
and transport the explosives.

491
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,370
You'll just focus on the perimeter support, okay?

492
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,820
I think

493
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,970
it'd be better if we transport the explosives.

494
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,910
Why?

495
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,180
Because the police

496
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,450
have already seen

497
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,290
you and your men before.

498
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,670
But they have never seen

499
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,590
the men I'm using now.

500
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,310
It's relatively safer.

501
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,470
I need to report to Chief.

502
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,670
Okay.

503
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,280
-Okay.
-Okay.

504
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,290
I'm leaving then.

505
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,630
Bro,

506
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,370
as an agent, you must be careful.

507
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,540
Wear your hat. Goodbye.

508
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,670
Master,

509
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,000
I really got it done.

510
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,270
If it weren't for Falcon today,

511
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,740
you and I would have died.

512
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,590
Next time,

513
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,360
be more cautious!

514
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,150
Okay.

515
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:41,970
Coming.

516
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,820
Director Lu, why are you here?

517
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,450
Mrs. Lin.

518
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,440
I brought some clothes to Feihang.

519
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,700
Come in.

520
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,660
Feihang!

521
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,160
Come out. Look who's here.

522
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,340
Sorry for the trouble.

523
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,380
Not at all.

524
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,230
She's very considerate.

525
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,590
She even helped us wash the dishes.

526
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,110
Really?

527
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,470
Uncle.

528
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,160
Feihang.

529
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,560
Is the school rehearsal tiring?

530
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,880
No, Younger Grandma picked me up as soon as I finished the rehearsal.

531
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
Elder Grandma just finished reading fairy tales with me.

532
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,570
Director Lu, Shaobai will be back soon.

533
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,390
How about staying for dinner tonight?

534
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,250
Yes, let's have dinner together.

535
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Sure. What ingredients do you have at home? I'll cook.

536
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,890
We dare not eat even if you dare to cook.

537
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,550
You don't need to cook.

538
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,590
Just accompany Feihang.

539
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,950
Come, Feihang, come in.

540
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,800
Okay.

541
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,420
You know how to cook?

542
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,380
You didn't know that, did you?

543
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,520
My cooking...

544
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,710
At sunset hillside village still seems far.

545
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,680
Cold and deserted the thatched cottages are.

546
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,100
At wicket gate a dog is heard...

547
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,800
At wicket gate a dog is heard to woof.

548
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,520
Wait.

549
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,950
At wicket gate a dog is heard to what?

550
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,470
At wicket gate a dog is heard to woof.

551
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,050
Quan means dogs.

552
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,150
The Chinese character formed by Kou and Quan means "woof".

553
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,280
Woof.

554
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,600
Did Lu teach you that?

555
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,310
Uncle Shaobai, look.

556
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,870
The Chinese character formed by Kou and Miao means "miaow".

557
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,270
Miaow.

558
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,550
The Chinese character formed by Kou and Yang means "bleat".

559
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,750
Bleat.

560
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,390
So this Chinese character must mean "woof".

561
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,650
At wicket gate a dog is heard to woof.

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
Feihang, remember,

564
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,470
this Chinese character means "bark".

565
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,430
Why?

566
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,840
Why?

567
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,250
Why?

568
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,200
Don't care about the reason.

569
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,660
Just remember, it means "bark".

You don't need to see me off.

00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,230
Actually, I think

579
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,550
Feihang is very happy.

580
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,980

What happened today?

583
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,750
We waited the whole day today,

584
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,030
but no one showed up.

585
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,480

586
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,100
Did those agents cancelled their plan

587

I didn't show up at all.

590
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,710
Someone must have leaked the information beforehand.

591
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,340
You should stop investigating.

592
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,550
Everything you do will be useless

593
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,100
before we find out the moles.

594
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm not in the Social Affairs Office now.

595
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,500
I can investigate.

596
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,130
The moles won't notice me.

597
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,690
We alerted them again today.

598
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,680
But Yaohong and I found out

599
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,340
the agents purchased white phosphorus.

600
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,560
They even drew a map of the dock warehouses.

601
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,140
I'll go to the dock to investigate tomorrow.

612
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,940
It's equivalent to the price of one catty of rice?

613
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,780
It's worthwhile.

614
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,220
Yes.

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,040

Do you still have the photo?

698
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,460
Feihang, do you have it?

699
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,790

700
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,320
Indeed... it's totally blurry.

Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

709
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,450
Not at all. It's no big deal.

710
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,970
Wen Tian's chin was not that wide.

711
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,680
His cheekbones were not that high either.

712
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,480

713
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,520
He just said his cheekbones were not that high.

714
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,970
How tall... was Mr. Wen?

715
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,210
He was half a head taller than me.

716
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,390
That's right.

717
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,530
Because of

00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,380

00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,370

and I'm looking up to you.

722
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,680
So this part of you looks bigger

723
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,500
and wider.

724
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,460
If we are on the same eye level,

725
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,330
look, this will look different.

726
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,700
It's called perspective in drawing.

727
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,320
Different perspectives

728
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,620
lead to different understanding.

729
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,820
