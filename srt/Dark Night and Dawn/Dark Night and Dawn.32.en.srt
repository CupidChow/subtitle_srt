[Episode 32]

3
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,120
As long as the Communist Party is here,

4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,550
he won't come back.

5
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,610
I don't think so.

6
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,810
Just the other day, planes came and dropped bombs on us.

7
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,870
When he bombed us, we knew

8
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,229
he couldn't come back.

9
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:51,910
Why is that?

10
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,250
Look, he doesn't care about destroying other people's stuff.

11
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,350
He even dared to bomb Shanghai.

12
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,220
So, deep down, he knows himself

13
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,550
that he can't come back.

14
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,530
Doesn't that make sense?

15
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,650
Seems like, yeah, that reasoning holds up.

16
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,889
Just now, a name suddenly flashed in my mind:

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,010
Good Times.

18
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,440
Your wife should be from Shanghai, right?

19
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,150
I just thought of a name:

20
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,870
Good Times Breakfast Restaurant.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,630
Good Times Breakfast Restaurant.

22
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,310
That's great.

23
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,140
Really great, right?

if both of you think

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,380
the name is good,

28
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,910
I'll draw up a plan.

29
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,940

No need.

38
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,240
It's just a bowl of wontons.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,870
Okay.

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,829
Well, then,

41
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,390
I won't stand on ceremony.

42

After all, we have plenty of time ahead.

Okay.

the perfume called "Red Moscow."

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,320
How come Lu Zhengyang started wearing perfume?

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,410
I don't think he has that kind of hobby.

63
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,290
I think it's because he was in close contact for a long time

64
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,470
with someone who wears that perfume,

65
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,079

that only when you,

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,230
could you completely bury everything

163
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,030
All these years, I've had only one wish,

But Lu Zhengyang...

187
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,200
Failure is a failure.

188
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,310

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,390
for such an important task as transferring Ogura,

191
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,070
you didn't survey the route in advance, observe the traffic,

192
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,800
or prepare for contingencies.

193
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,980
Your failure was inevitable.

194
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,820
Also,

195
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,180
you've been overly cautious

196
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,670
in all of your office's operations later.

197
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,960
Now, I want to ask you,

198
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,490
with all your caution,

199
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,030
can you bring your old squad leader,

200
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,150
Wen Tian, and his wife back?

201
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,550
I'm particularly curious.

202
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,110
If Feihang...

203
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,150
knew that it was you

204
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,950
who caused her parents' deaths,

205
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,200
would she still call you "Uncle" so affectionately?

206
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,750
If she knew the truth,

207
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,310
she might kill you

208
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,990
to avenge her parents.

209
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,950
You don't deserve to mention Feihang!

210
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,470
You don't deserve to mention her.

211
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,470
You are a sinner,

212
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,910
a complete loser.

213
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,950
Also, I'm warning you,

214
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,270
if anything happens to me,

215
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,110
your Feihang will stick in a wheelchair forever.

216
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,390
Our people will turn her into a cripple!

217
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,310
Shut up!

218
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,870
Lu.

219
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,990
You sinner.

220
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
Go ahead and kill me!

221
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,090
Lu Zhengyang!

222
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,070
Stop the interrogation.

223
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,200
Let's call it a day for now.

224
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,710
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,630
I'm not suited to continue the interrogation.

226
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,870
How's your hand?

227
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,530
Mr. Yang, Lu hasn't recovered yet.

228
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,580
Du Lengquan deliberately provoked Lu,

229
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,630
targeting his sore spot and reopening his old wound

230
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,290
to resist the interrogation.

231
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,960
If Lu really backs down,

232
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,120
then Du Lengquan will have his way.

233
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,690
Interrogation is mainly a psychological game.

234
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,740
It's wise for Lu Zhengyang

235
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,710
to pause the interrogation now.

236
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,830
How about...

237
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,390
I go talk to him?

238
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,560
Give him some time.

239
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,360
He has to get through this sooner or later.

240
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,990
Yaohong, get ready to take over as the lead interrogator.

241
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,190
We must break Du Lengquan as soon as possible

242
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,150
and catch Shrike.

243
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,750

so I knew you were here.

277
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,480
I heard that this place is about to be demolished.

You still can't let it go, huh?

279

This matter...

280
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,840
was originally a trap orchestrated by Shrike

281
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,820
and that mole, Du Lengquan.

282
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,590
You didn't do anything wrong,

283
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,450
so there's no need to feel guilty.

284
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,000
Du Lengquan is right.

285
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,430
A failed mission is a failure.

286
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,410
The death of Wen Tian and the others is just that: death.

287
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,410
It's because I didn't do well enough.

288
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,390
What did you not do well?

289
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,190
You did everything you could.

290
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,670
You're not a god.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,660
You can't foresee the future.

292
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,869
You did your best.

293
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,440
I really didn't do well enough.

294
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,470

295

Sir,

315
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,670
today's weather

316
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,600
and wind conditions in Shanghai have been sent over.

317
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,110
What else do we need to do now?

318
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,550
What a wonderful day.

319
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,710
We've done all we can.

320
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,360
Now, let's just wait for good news.

321
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,830
According to our intelligence,

322
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,070
the Kuomintang's fighter jets have just taken off from Zhoushan.

323
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,270
Our Air Force Corps

324
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,800
is also ready for combat.

325
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,590
Looks like this false intelligence has successfully fooled Shrike.

326
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,150
But this also means

327
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,570
that once they are ambushed,

328
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,830
he will immediately realize

329
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,270
it's a trap we've set,

330
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,870
and he'll flee right away.

331
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,930
That will make it harder to catch him.

332
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,750
So in the next few hours,

333
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,410
we must find out who Shrike is.

334
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,310
Where's Zhengyang? He's still not back yet?

335

you don't look well.

347
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,360
You didn't sleep well, did you?

348
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,080
Had nightmares, right?

349
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,940
The spirits of the Wen Tian couple

350
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,990
came to you again, right?

351
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,190
Speak only when asked.

352
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,150
If not, keep your mouth shut.

353
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,850
Comrade Wen Tian was my old squad leader;

354
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,750
of course, I often dream of him.

355
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,790
But it's solely out of missing.

356
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,770
Du Lengquan.

357
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,670
I think you often dream of

358
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,470
Comrade Chen Rushan too, right?

359
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,160
But it's all out of guilt.

360
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,550
What a joke.

361
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,910
Why should I feel guilty?

362
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,110
We're from two different sides.

363
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,460
Besides, he has been dead for five years.

364
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,750
Yet you still haven't forgotten him.

365
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,970
You often visit his grave.

366
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,360
You must be holding something heavy in your heart,

367
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,490
so you need to find a place to vent.

368
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,970
Looks like your investigation work

369
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,190
is quite thorough.

370
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,470
Yes, I often visit his grave to talk,

371
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,910
as the dead can tell no souls.

372
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,710
But Lu Zhengyang,

373
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,510
you don't even have a place to vent.

374
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm curious.

375
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,910
What would you say

376
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,790
if you were standing at the Wen Tian couple's grave?

377
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,230
Would you say that Feihang became an orphan because of you?

378
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,430
That Ogura went missing

379
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,760
because you arrived late for the mission?

380
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,200
Or that hundreds of thousands in Shanghai

381
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,980
might have contracted the plague

382
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,580
because of your failure at that time?

383
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,270
Am I right?

384
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,180
You are a sinner.

385
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,210
You don't deserve to sit here and interrogate me!

386
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,560
What happened back then...

387
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,790
has indeed weighed heavily on me...

388
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,190
like a boulder resting on my heart.

389
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,550
But...

390
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,330
I still have a chance to make up for it.

391
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,430
The best way to comfort Comrade Wen Tian

392
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,500
is to find out the truth

393
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,840
and bring the real culprits to justice.

394
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,110
But you, Du Lengquan,

395
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,500
do you still have a chance to make up for Chen Rushan?

396
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,940
Why should I?

397
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,330
How did Chen Rushan break his leg?

398
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,950
He broke it himself.

399
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,790

left by the Japanese.

403
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,620
In September 1943,

404
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,390
the Japanese Plum Blossom Agency was capturing anti-Japanese people.

405
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,730
Comrade Chen Rushan fought valiantly

406
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,800
to cover your retreat

407
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,830
and was ultimately forced

408
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,090
to jump from the rooftop by the Japanese.

409
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,230
What did you do then

410
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,000
when you saw Chen Rushan break his leg?

411
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,870
I had no choice.

412
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,550
In life-or-death situations,

413
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,030
whoever can escape counts.

414
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,430
You were afraid of dying

415
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,940
and didn't have the guts.

416
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,430
Later, other comrades

417
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,870
rescued Chen Rushan.

418
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,750
Soon,

419
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,970
everyone began to blame you,

420
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,150
saying you had abandoned your comrade.

421
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,430
And at that moment,

422
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,030
it was Comrade Chen Rushan who stood up for you.

423
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,280
He was defending you.

424
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,260
He said that the situation was urgent

425
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,930
and that there was no need for everyone to make unnecessary sacrifices;

426
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,530
we must leave seeds of hope for the revolution.

427
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,640
And you

428
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,610
were the seed

429
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,420
he chose to protect with his life.

430
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,860
Unfortunately,

431
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,300
he misjudged me.

432
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,100
Later, you became partners.

433
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,160
After two years together,

434
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,390
you learned about Chen Rushan's attire, handwriting,

435
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,010
habits, and even how he conducted himself.

436
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,130
This was all preparation for you to replace him.

437
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,190
But you began to

438
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,830
unconsciously acknowledge

439
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,150
and admire him.

440
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,200
My goal was to stay undercover.

441
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,190
I got close to him

442
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,910
just to be able to kill him one day!

443
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,680
During those two years,

444
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,990
Chen Rushan cared for you and looked after you.

445
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,530
He even gave you the money

446
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,140
for your mother's medical treatment.

447
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,120
Chen Rushan treated you as one of us, as a comrade,

448
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,020
and even as a best friend.

449
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,910
This kind of camaraderie

450
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,750
is something you'll never experience

451
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,530
in the NBIS,

452
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,550
where your only way out is death,

453
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,140
especially under Shrike's command.

454
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,360
In the end, you still hardened your heart...

455
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,670
and killed your so-called enemy.

456
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,270
He died.

457
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,830
In this world,

458
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,360
there will never be anyone else like him who treats you that way.

459
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,150
No.

460
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,120
We were enemies.

461
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,350
I didn't.

462
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,960
We were enemies!

463
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,960
After all these years,

464
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,190
can you still tell

465
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,480
if you are Chen Rushan or Du Lengquan?

466
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,430
I'm Chen Rushan!

467
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,390
No, no, no.

468
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,910
I'm not Chen Rushan.

469
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,870
I'm Du Lengquan.

470
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,140
I have my belief.

471
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,800
I did it because of my belief.

472
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,880
I didn't do anything wrong!

473
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,240
I didn't do anything wrong.

474
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,950
Belief?

475
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,510
What belief allows you to go against your conscience

476
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,370
to kill a comrade who protected you with his life...

477
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,590
and even his innocent parents?

478
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,630
You completely abandoned your conscience.

479
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,180
Let me tell you what belief truly is.

480
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,590
Belief

481
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,580
is a truth for which you're willing

482
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,510
to sacrifice everything.

483
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,950
It is something that you would do anything for,

484
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,510
believing that it is right and worthwhile.

485
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,110
Even with a gun to your head

486
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,600
or a knife at your throat,

487
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,960
you would still steadfastly adhere to it.

488
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,810
This is a belief.

489
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,980
Because even if you die,

490
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,210
your heart remains bright, proud,

491
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,570
and guiltless to anyone.

492
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,870
Stop it.

493
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,350
Stop it.

494
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,790
Du Lengquan.

495
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,310
I remember.

496
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,080
Chen Rushan made dumplings

497
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,830
with this filling.

498
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,430
Chive and egg filling.

499
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
They were particularly delicious.

500
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,310
I still remember...

501
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,270
what he said to me before he died.

502
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,230
He said,

503
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,900
"We walk different paths,

504
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,070
but don't forget,

505
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,670
we must drive the Japanese out of China."

506
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,400
"We must make sure our people can live with dignity."

507
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
I visit his grave,

508
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,770
not because I killed him,

509
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,480
but because I realized

510
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,530
that I can never become like him.

511
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,140
He was a Communist,

512
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,510
and even in his final moments, all he thought about was the people.

513
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,300
He's buried underground,

514
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,600
yet it feels as if he's always living in the light.

515
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,350
While I...

516
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,830
am always a person who hides in the shadows

517
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
and a loser.

518
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,580
I was wrong.

519
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,160

00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,810
Feihang!

561
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,230
Kid.

562
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,110
I'm going to

563
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,540
talk to your Uncle Lu and Uncle Lin

564
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,150
about something.

565
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,270
You just need to listen quietly.

566
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,570
Feihang, don't be afraid.

567
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,960
Zheng Lanting,

568
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,840
the child is innocent.

569
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,380
Let Feihang go first.

570
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,380
Taking a child hostage.

571
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,590
Don't you think that's despicable?

572
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,280
That's not nice.

573
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,490
Despicable or not.

574
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,170
This is a fight.

575
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,610
A life-and-death fight.

576
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,870
You've set a trap using Nyctibius.

577
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,670
I've studied it repeatedly,

578
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,720
yet you still managed to fool me.

579
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,360
I admit defeat.

580
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,010
You've lost, and that's that.

581
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,850
Shrike, be straightforward.

582
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,760
Young man,

583
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,410
don't try to provoke me with  your words.

584
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,940
I'm not Xiang Yu.

585
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,500
If I can survive crossing the river, I will.

586
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,900
I've been mentally prepared

587
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
for something to go wrong

588
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,280
with Nyctibius.

589
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,350
Especially since today

590
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,650
was the bomb day.

591
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,230
So I brought Feihang to the studio.

592
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,650
As expected,

593
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,880
it's proven to be useful.

594
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,900
Zheng Lanting,

595
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,550
you've calculated

596
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,280
everything.

597
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,030
And you've planned

598
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,800
every operation carefully.

599
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,770
But why did you still lose?

600
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,190
I ponder that question every day too.

601
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,790
Why is that?

602
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,990
Because you've never thought

603
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,560
that your opponents aren't only the Social Affairs Office and the Public Security Bureau,

604
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,870
but also all the people in Shanghai

605
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,650
who long for peace and stability.

606
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,810
The people of Shanghai

607
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,550
are standing with us, the Public Security Bureau.

608
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,950
So you can't win.

609
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,110
You do have the right time, place, and people

610
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,670
on your side.

611
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,550
Especially the people.

612
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,200
That's the most important factor.

613
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,390
Let us be straightforward about it.

614
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,100
It's simple. Get me a car,

615
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,990
and I'll take these two

616
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,780
leave here.

617
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,710
I'll be your hostage and go with you.

618
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,760
Let the child go first.

619
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,030
If I let her go, how will I leave?

620
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,310
Don't try to fool me.

621
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,100
What if I refuse?

622
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,380
If you refuse,

623
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,810
then are you going to repeat the tragedy of the death of

624
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,980
Wen Tian and his wife—Feihang's parents?

625
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,160
You've already been exposed.

626
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,030
It's useless to resist.

627
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
You can't escape.

628
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,230
Even if it's the end,

629
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,680
I want one last chance to put up a fight.

630
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,980
If I just surrender like this,

631
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,860
I won't be able to live with myself.

632
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,610
This is the detonator for the time bomb,

633
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,910
connected to

634
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,110
over 100 kilograms of DNT underground

635
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,070
and the explosives buried along the street.

636
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,410
At twelve o'clock,

637
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,370
it will detonate,

638
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,430
flattening everything

639
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,600

641
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,270
Evacuate all people here immediately.

642
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,950
Yes.

643
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,190
You won't make it.

644
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,990
Only five minutes left.

Feihang, don't be afraid.

647
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,650
I won't let them hurt you.

[Lanting Studio]

656
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,320
I really like this child.

657
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,270
I've never intended to harm her.

658
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,800
But that depends on your decision.

Director Lu.

660
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,030
You've experienced once before

661
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,270
the profound pain of deep regret.

662
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,100
I imagine

663
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,010
you don't want to go through that again, right?

Do as he says.

Mr. Yang.

667

The safety of Feihang and the people on this street

668
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,910
are the top priorities.

Thank you.

You're the leader. You're sensible and humane.

674
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,830
I've agreed to your terms,

675
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,470
but as her teacher,

676
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,670
you have to promise me

677
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,610
to ensure her absolute safety.

678
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,100
Rest assured.

00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,430

Please don't destroy all my works here.
