[Episode 17]

3
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,289
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

4
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,190
Mr. Jin.

5
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
If there's nothing else,

6
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,509
I'll be on my way.

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,200
Okay.

8
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,550
Sir, have you seen this man?

9
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,590
No.

10
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,720
This is Mr. Lin.

11
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,910
Stop!

12
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,070
It hurts.

13
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,010
It hurts.

14
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,150
Have you seen this person?

15
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,070
I haven't.

16
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,000
Look carefully.

17
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,500
I really haven't seen him.

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,590
I don't believe it.

19
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,050
Come on, show me the cards.

20
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,530
Show me.

21
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,960
All pairs, three of a kind.

22
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,330
I lose even with a dragon hand.

23
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,140
No debts in this round, alright?

24
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,540
I'm not playing anymore.

25
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,110
Keep going, keep going.

26
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,550
Why so loud?

27
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,370
Afraid the police won't show up?

28
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,990
Big brother, we've been hiding here for days.

29
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,190
We can't go anywhere.

30
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,670
Sitting here with a ton of money,

31
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,210
it's driving us crazy.

32
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,710
It's not just this dock that's shut down,

33
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,030
the others are too.

34
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,270
We'll enjoy life again once this storm blows over.

35
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,990
Understand?

36
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,579
Yes.

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,329
What's going on?

38
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,950
Is he one of your guys?

39
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,120
We only communicate on separate lines.

40
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,980
Whether he's my guy, I'm not sure.

41
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,950
You've at least heard of Bingweimo, right?

42
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,430
I don't know him.

43
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,170
He's the one you used

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,140
to distribute another batch of counterfeit bills.

45
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,630
He's already confessed.

46
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,620
You say you don't know him, and that's it?

47
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,120
He says he knows me, so I know him?

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,270
Then I might as well be Dai Yueqing.

49
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,870
Move! What did you tell them?

50
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,380
Get up.

51
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,950
Speak!

52
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,140
Who's your boss?

53
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,940
Destroying evidence, huh?

54
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,820
Beat me to death if you want.

55
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,150
Say it again.

56
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,630
Come on.

57
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,690
That's enough. Stop beating him.

58
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,850
Want to cause a death?

59
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,580
Drag him out.

60
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,040
When we do business, trust is key.

61
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,530
You broke the rules first.

62
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,820
Our boss has already ordered all docks

63
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,060
to stop distributing counterfeit bills.

64
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,350
What do you want?

65
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,290
Our boss wants to arrange another meeting.

66
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,520
Go send the message.

67
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,120
Go!

68
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,760
Wei!

69
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,360
Let's go.

70
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,549
Come on!

71
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,870
Come on!

72
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,140
Don't move!

73
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,400
I said don't move!

74
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,770
Not bad.

75
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,850
Your shooting's improved.

76
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,330
You're not bad either.

77
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,710
Bingweimo, Zhu Hong.

78
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,420
How did you even come up with that?

79
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,170
Good thing I've read that book,

80
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,730
or I might've fallen for it.

81
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,360
Aren't you afraid they've read it too?

82
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,700
They're a bunch of illiterates.

83
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,920
How many words can they even recognize?

84
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,590
The parts aren't broken, right?

85
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,480
Let me check.

86
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,230
Catch.

[Trauma Medicine]

88
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,110
Wei,

89
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,430
if you turn back now,

90
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,010
maybe there's still time.

91
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,530
There's no going back.

92
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,580
You know I've got too much blood on my hands.

93
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,430
You saved me today.

94
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,130
It means you're still the same you,

95
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,450
You haven't changed.

96
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,590
Wei,

97
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,070
trust me,

98
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,950
there's a way.

99
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,700
Are you going to shoot me?

100
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,590
Come on.

101
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,820
Shoot me.

102
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,190
Go ahead.

103
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,110
Shoot.

104
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,540
Get lost!

105
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,670
We've already searched everywhere,

106
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,150
even his house.

107
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,250
We can't rule out the possibility that he may have contacted his family.

108
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,660
If I hadn't run at that moment,

109
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,510
maybe...

110
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,250
You would've been caught too.

111
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,350
Brother,

112
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,910
I didn't abandon anyone back then.

113
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,330
You've been through battles with me.

114
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,890
This isn't called abandoning a comrade.

115
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,040
I believe Lin Shaobai will be fine.

116
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,230
Understand?

117
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,950
Director Lu.

118
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,840
Is it really you?

119
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,810
I saw you from afar and thought it looked like you.

120
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,840
Mrs. Lin.

121
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,360
You're back from shopping?

122
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,170
Yes,

123
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,630
Shaobai

124
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,150
hasn't come home for two days.

125
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,270
I think he should be back today,

126
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,670
so I bought some eels

127
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,740
to make his favorite dish, fried eel strips in oil.

128
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,030
Why don't you two join us?

129
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,220
No need, Mrs. Lin.

130
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,390
We're on a mission

131
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,430
and just passing by.

132
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,430
We're still busy.

133
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,830
You young men don't understand.

134
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,470
The busier you are, the more you need this eel dish.

135
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,840
It's very nourishing.

136
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,650
Director Lu.

137
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,910
Is Shaobai also

138
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,870
on a mission?

139
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,550
Will he be home tonight?

140
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,620
Auntie,

141
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,660
Comrade Shaobai...

142
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,230
He...

143
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:09,910
He is

144
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,730
on a mission in Minhang.

145
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,920
He probably won't be home tonight.

146
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,500
He won't?

147
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,830
Mrs. Lin, we have to go.

148
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,870
See you.

149
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,100
Director Lu.

150
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,910
What about tomorrow?

151
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,310
Will he be back tomorrow?

152
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,310
Tomorrow?

153
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
He probably won't be back tomorrow either.

154
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,010
That's okay, that's okay.

155
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,060
Shaobai has been naughty since he was a kid.

156
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,670
He caused you a lot of trouble, right?

157
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,730
Not at all, Auntie.

158
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,070
Shaobai performs

159
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,390
very well with us.

160
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,390
He's always winning commendations. I admire him a lot.

161
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,240
Really?

162
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,760
How could he win anything

163
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,670
without the help of his leaders?

164
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,740
But since the liberation,

165
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,390
Shaobai's spirit

166
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,550
has improved a lot.

167
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,530
He used to sigh all the time when he came home,

168
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,590
but now, no matter how busy he is during the day,

169
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,230
he stays up late thinking about cases.

170
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,270
Sis.

171
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,390
Sis.

172
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,850
Director Lu, you're here.

173
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,860
Hello, hello.

174
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,590
Mrs. Lin,

175
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,560
Shaobai called.

176
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,550
He said he won't be home for the next few days,

177
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,240
so no need to buy groceries tomorrow.

178
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,480
Shaobai called?

179
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,270
Okay.

180
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,230
Young man,

181
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,590
try to get into fewer fights,

182
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,070
so your family doesn't have to worry so much.

183
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,230
Take it slow, Uncle Qi.

184
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,320
No, I wasn't fighting.

185
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,390
I got beaten up.

186
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,010
Did you call the police?

187
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,930
The police are really good now.

188
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,100
They handle everything.

189
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,260
You see the streets full of PLA soldiers arresting thugs.

190
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,320
Calling the police

191
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,480
is effective.

192
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,670
I already did.

Cover for me.

194
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,450
Don't let anyone see this injury.

195
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,000
Otherwise, changing into these new clothes will have been pointless.

196
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,720
Alright.

You were out on duty, but you...

199
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,380
What's up, Lu?

200
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,610
After you escaped,

201
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,200
why didn't you call the department first?

202
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,530
Why did you call your mom to tell her to buy less food?

203
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,790
I can't go home with this face right now.

204
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,840
What if she buys too much food and no one eats it?

205
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,370
What happened to your face?

206
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,050
Got scratched, look.

207
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,710
Look.

208
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,910
Be gentle.

209
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,320
That's a big wound.

210
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,810
You call this a wound?

211
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,830
Well.

212
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,170
If my mom sees this,

213
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
she'll scold me to death.

214
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,670
Get up, quickly!

215
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:35,990
Get up!

216
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,290
What's wrong?

217
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,180
Anywhere else you're feeling uncomfortable?

218
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,590
I just sat too long. My legs went numb.

219
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
If your legs are numb, come walk with me.

220
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,750
What's wrong, Huzi?

221
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,790
Why are you looking at me like that?

222
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,790
I knew you'd manage to escape.

223
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,000
Since you're here,

224
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,930
help me settle the bill.

225
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,200
Well done, capturing him.

226
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,960
Such a big operation.

227
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,540
Lu,

228
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,030
this whole thing was to save me, right?

229
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,560
I just made the suggestion,

230
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,510
it was the Military Control Commission's decision.

231
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,320
The main purpose was to crack down on bandits,

232
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
and while at it, they looked for you.

233
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,820
But Deputy Commissioner Yang

234
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,750
really gave you some special attention.

235
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,960
Alright, I get the kindness.

236
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,480
If I had known,

237
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
I wouldn't have broken out on my own.

238
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,410
But honestly, we gained a lot this time.

239
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,390
Now we can confirm that this group of agents

240
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,200
is collaborating with a gang

241
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,650
to circulate counterfeit money.

242
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,260
Once we find this gang,

243
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,750
we can trace it back to the counterfeit mint.

244
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,600
How do we find this gang?

245
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,230
Shrimp dumplings.

This river crucian carp is a big one.

253
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,720
I'll come over and crash your meal later.

254

Alright, alright.

It was Uncle Jin. He hired a tutor for us.

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,780
All this was arranged by Mr. Jin?

278

Yes.

279

Mr. Jin knows what matters most to you,

Pass along my thanks to Mr. Jin.

In this line of work, there's no one who doesn't respect him as their godfather.

287

we're here today to ask for your help

300
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,360
in tracking down a small gang.

301
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,320
Not difficult.

302
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,680
But there are hundreds of thousands of gang members in Shanghai.

303
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,070
Besides the big ones like the Green and Red gangs,

304
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,590
there are over 600 other smaller

305
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,470
sects and gangs.

306

I'm talking about the established ones.

307
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,080
The people we're looking for

308
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,070
should have come from the old Red Gang.

309
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,670
I've heard their codewords.

310
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,620
They call gold "ground mole"

311
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,800
and silver "ground dragon."

312
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,370
"Execution" is referred to as "ascending to court."

313
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,710
These are the old codewords of the Red Gang.

314
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,230
But there's one phrase I hadn't heard before,

315
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,920
"Sending shrimp dumplings to the River God",

316
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,190
or maybe "River God sending shrimp dumplings".

317
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,680
Right after they said that,

318
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,410
someone came up and stabbed me.

I knew you'd manage to escape.

326
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,950
They would cut open your belly,

fill it with rocks,

328
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,820
and throw you into the river.

The grand master of the Green Gang

397
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,030
actually bowed to me.

398

Some people's backs have been bent for so long

399
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,350
that when they try to stand straight again,

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,010

408

for taking care of the kids during this time.

409
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,190
It's just a small thing.

410
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,250
You left Anhui and came to Shanghai to make a living,

411
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,500

413
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,730
It's a problem even if the kids register for school.

414

That's no small matter.

415
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,690
I originally planned

416
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,270
to wait until I had earned enough money

417
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,460
to hire a private tutor for the kids.

418
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,560
Education is important.

419
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,600
Learning is like forging iron.

420
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,110
If you miss a single strike,

421
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,240
you'll fall behind with every strike after that,

422
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,300
and it could ruin the child's future.

423
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,680
How about this?

424
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,120
I'm still short of an assistant by my side.

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,150
I promise I'll help you root out the agents behind this,

Don't you need to get that stomach wound checked again?

It's fine. I'm almost fully healed.

How did you get away?

441
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,440
I tricked them by saying I worked for Shrike.

442
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,590
They didn't verify it?

443
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,170
They did verify it. Of course, they did.

Luckily,

445
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,760
they got a newbie to check,

446
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,510

560
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,389
Will they let you go?

561
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,630
Why has business at the docks stopped?

562
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,750
The communists are cracking down on counterfeit money.

563
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,770
Doing anything now would be jumping into the fire.

564
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,030
Are you saying

565
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,070
if the communists don't stop their raids,

566
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,550
your men

567
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,980
won't have food or drink?

568
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,560
I have two conditions.

569
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,920
If you agree to them,

570
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,890
I can restart business

571
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,350
at the docks right away.

572
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,970
Speak.

573
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,890
First,

574
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,760
my Hook Sword Gang must be the only channel

575
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,320
for the counterfeit money.

576
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,340
I'm not the only one

577
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,200
doing this business.

578
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,820
The veteran NBIS members are all doing it.

579
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,290
But

580
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,170
ever since the beginning,

581
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,410
you've been my only channel.

582
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,360
I'm no longer 18 or 19.

583
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,820
A man's word

584
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,710
can't be trusted entirely.

585
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,710
You can station your people

586
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,510
at my factory

587
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,070
to supervise.

588
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,490
That's not enough.

589
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,760
The amount of counterfeit money

590
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,350
you send over each day is huge.

591
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,350
There must be more than one machine.

592
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,940
In other words,

593
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,060
there has to be more than one set

594
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,450
of printing plates.

595
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,320
I want you to share one with me.

596
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
You print,

597
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,500
and I'll print a little too.

598
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,140
Boss Dai,

599
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,470
people can't be too greedy.

600
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,330
When greed goes too far,

601
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,190
it never ends well.

602
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,910
Don't move.

603
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,950
Don't move.

604
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,980
Your Hook Sword Gang is where it is today because of me.

605
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,550
Since I can give you benefits,

606
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,210
I can also take them back anytime.

607
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,050
Wouldn't you agree?

608
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,460
I believe you,

609
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,720
but you won't do that.

610
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,480
If we fight to the bitter end,

611
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,430
no one benefits.

612
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,380
The second condition...

613
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,560
Come in.

614
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,130
Your Falcon betrayed us.

615
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,810
He killed my men

616
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,310
and rescued someone I had captured,

617
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,780
someone else involved in the counterfeit money business.

618
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,540
If that person's still around,

619
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,670
it proves you didn't give the counterfeit money

620
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,230
to someone else.

621
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,330
Falcon thinks he did a clean job,

622
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,560
but my men saw him.

623
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,140
I want his life,

624
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,940
as a warning to others.

625
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,310
Is this true?

626
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,780
It's true.

627
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,830
But the person I saved wasn't a fellow counterfeiter.

628
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,890
It was Lin Shaobai, a police officer.

629
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,990
The police have infiltrated us now?

630
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,270
You let a cop go without permission

631
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,740
and killed my man.

632
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,510
That deserves a life in return.

633
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,630
Think over my two conditions.

634
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Why are you silent?

635
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,080
Does that mean you agree?

636
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,830
Fine, then do it.

637
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,020
Wait.

638
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,040
Falcon is my man.

639
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,910
If he really made a mistake,

640
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,380
I'll deal with him myself.

641
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,760
Boss Dai, after going through

642
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,000
such a long roundabout conversation,

643
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,590
I finally understand now.

644
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,030
What you really want is a set of printing plates,

645
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,900
right?

646
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,070
I'll give them to you.

647
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,690
Are you serious?

648
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,630
Tomorrow morning at 8,

649
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,830
right here.

650
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,360
Alright.

651
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,010
I'll be here.

652
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,330
See you tomorrow.

653
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,940
See you tomorrow.

654
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,120
Shrike.

655
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,950
Chief, I...

656
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,280
Come.

657
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,140
Tell me what's going on with Lin Shaobai.

658
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,410
I remember you telling me yourself

659
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,830
that you two were no longer on the same side.

660
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,440
Sit.

661
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:31,780
Okay.

662
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,170
What happened?

663
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,030
Back at the police station,

664
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,800
Lin Shaobai helped me out quite a bit.

665
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,740
This time, I was just returning a personal favor.

666
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,650
From now on, our brotherhood is over.

667
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,610
It won't affect anything else.

668
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,680
I know

669
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,770
you won't be affected,

670
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,610
but he might.

671
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,420
And that's exactly

672
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,170
where we can use him.

673
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,260
I will.

674
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,450
Falcon.

675
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,010
Don't have any burdens on your mind.

676
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,180
For our victory,

677
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,460
all moral standards can be abandoned.

678
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,560
In the current situation,

679
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,540
loyalty and brotherhood

680
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,290
are too dangerous.

681
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,420
Understood.

682
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,430
So are we really going to give the printing plates

683
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,710
to Dai Yueqing?

684
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,110
Do you know how some snakes die?

685
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,390
They swallow prey that's too large,

686
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,080
their bellies burst,

687
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,980
and they die from overstuffing.

688
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,560
Dai Yueqing is that snake.

689
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,660
Tomorrow, I'll bring more people

690
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,410
and take them all out directly.

691
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,930
How's the situation with the Hook Sword Gang?

692
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,340
I've got a good handle on

693
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,720
their operations, their businesses,

694
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,040
and who they deal with.

695
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,590
The key is still the people.

696
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,660
Dai Yueqing's most trusted right-hand man

697
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,780
is the Bearded One.

698
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,310
As long as we take her and the Bearded One out,

699
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,620
I'm confident we can take control of the Hook Sword Gang

700
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,170
and reestablish them at the docks

701
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,170
to work for you.

702
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,990
Do it tomorrow.

703
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,470
Be quick and clean.

704
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,440
Understood.

705
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,060
Boss.

706
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,850
Did you get the cash printer?

707
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,990
Yes, I did.

708
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,910
It's an old one left behind by the Japanese,

709
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,050
a bit damaged.

710
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,460
But we've secretly had the old master repair it.

711
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,670
Now all we need are the printing plates,

712
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,830
and we can start printing immediately.

713
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,930
But, Boss,

714
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,340
the printing plates are like the hen that lays the golden eggs.

715
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,980
Will Shrike really just give them to us?
