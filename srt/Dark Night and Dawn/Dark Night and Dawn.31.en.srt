[Episode 31]

3
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,110
The Air Defense Command Post

4
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,710
is responsible for protecting Shanghai's airspace,

5
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,770
and it's also the command center of the Air Force Corps.

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,789
Recently,

7
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,030
Taiwan's air strikes

8
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,030
have all failed.

9
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,590
Therefore,

10
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,220
Shrike and his gang will definitely try everything

11
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,570
to find the location and coordinates of our command post

12
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,700
and make it their main bombing target.

13
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,070
Zhengyang.

14
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,200
You're participating in the security work of the command post.

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,930
What are your thoughts on this?

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,640
Mr. Yang.

17
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,060
I'm thinking,

18
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,050
to ensure the safety of the command post,

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,800
we might as well

20
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,470
put on a fake act with Shrike.

21
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,870
You mean...

22
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,620
I mean,

23
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,190
we can build

24
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,270
a fake command post

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,810
and confuse them with details

26
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,960
to make them believe

27
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,220
the fake command post

28
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,170
is the real one.

29
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,350
Meanwhile,

30
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,900
we'll arrange air defense artillery in advance

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,630
so that they won't make it back.

32
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,120
It's just Shrike

33
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,150
is suspicious

34
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,410
and cunning by nature.

35
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,350
He will not be so easily fooled.

36
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,410
I believe in making things happen.

37
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,150
Besides,

38
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,820
we have Chen.

39
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,550
You're right.

40
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,530
We've been hiding it for quite a while. It's time for him to enter the picture.

41
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,390
How about this?

42
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,240
Zhengyang.

43
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,670
You will perform personally

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,060
in this fake play.

45
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,740
Yes.

46
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,710
Sir.

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,700
Have my shoes been repaired?

48
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,430
Yes.

49
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,260
Okay.

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,110
Look.

51
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,600
What happened to the repairman from before?

52
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,360
My uncle is old.

53
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,690
He caught a cold,

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,990
and he's been resting at home these days.

55
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,020
Shrike thinks

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,030
the police are still suspicious of you.

57
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,350
Just in case,

58
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,450
I'll be your contact from now on.

59
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,750
The older he gets,

60
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,360
the more timid he becomes.

61
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,950
In our business,

62
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,910
only those who are timid

63
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,470
can last long.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,450
New mission.

65
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,210
Find out the exact location of

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,500
the Shanghai Air Defense Command Post as soon as possible.

67
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,690
How soon do you need it?

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,410
As soon as possible.

69
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,660
Shrike wants to remind you that

70
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,920
the mission is urgent.

71
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,580
He had no choice but to let you take the risk.

72
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,340
If you find anything abnormal,

73
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,280
stop the action immediately.

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,570
Got it.

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,459
You're good.

76
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,029
Okay.

77
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,410
Thank you.

78
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,310
Here you are.

79
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,980
Okay.

80
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,990
See you.

81
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,630
Okay.

82
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,750
Chen.

83
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,810
Please sign for me.

84
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,920
Okay.

85
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,830
Where is Lu?

86
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,360
I haven't seen him for days.

87
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,790
He must be on a mission.

88
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,500
Who knows?

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,310
What mission?

90
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,310
So myster...

91
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,220
Hey. Huzi.

92
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,950
What are you and Shaobai

93
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,480
doing

94
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,520
in this room?

95
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,790
Since Lu is not here,

96
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,190
[Shanghai Air Defense Hecheng Command Post Transfer Order]

97
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,790
we came to help him clean up the room.

98
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,500
This is the file Director Lu asked for yesterday.

99
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,330
I brought it here.

100
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:55,909
Okay.

101
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:56,970
I'll give it to him.

102
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,100
Okay.

103
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,050
Good for you.

104
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,590
Go on. Go on.

105
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,360
Nyctibius has received the mission.

106
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,490
After the mission is completed,

107
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,510
send him to Hong Kong

108
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,040
to reunite with his family.

109
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,810
He can finally reunite with his family.

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Chief.

111
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Ogura is in here.

112
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,160
Dr. Ogura.

113
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,390
Yes.

114
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,410
Mr. Zheng.

115
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,240
You're here.

116
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,350
I'm here to see you.

117
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,590
How are you adapting to the new environment?

118
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,420
Pretty well.

119
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,480
Everything is progressing normally.

120
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,920
What are the pathogenic bacteria currently available?

121
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,410
Anthrax,

122
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,510
and typhoid fever.

123
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,720
What would happen

124
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,540
if we put these bacteria

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
in Shanghai's water supply system?

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,300
Mr. Zheng, you know that

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,420
this...

128
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,000
This won't work.

129
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,970
Why?

130
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,020
You know that Shanghai has set up an epidemic prevention committee.

131
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,630
Common bacterial infections

132
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,490
can be treated with antibiotics.

133
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,830
Only when we successfully develop super anthrax

134
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,830
can we give them

135
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,780
a fatal blow.

136
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,230
But if we use them on you,

137
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,940
they'd take effect pretty quick, right?

138
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,040
What do you want to do?

139
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,210
Kuomintang has abandoned me.

140
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,640
Only by destroying Shanghai

141
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,190
can I prove my value.

142
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,540
Tell me, what do you think I want to do?

143
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,280
I gave you five years,

144
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,510
but you didn't give me anything in return.

145
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,680
If you keep being like this,

146
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
I'll go crazy.

147
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,150
Even I don't know

148
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,390
what I would do

149
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,710
if I went crazy.

150
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,530
I'll give you two more months.

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,380
Got it?

152
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,100
Yes.

153
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,450
You have to deliver the research results.

154
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,880
Good luck.

155
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,510
Goodbye, sir.

156
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,560
Have a nice day.

157
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,030
Dr. Ogura.

158
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,030
The result of our last experiment

159
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,940
was already very ideal,

160
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,800
but you still chose to start over.

161
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,010
When super anthrax is successfully developed,

162
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,100
the value of our lives will be gone.

163
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,260
Don't forget

164
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,570
they are agents.

165
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,920
So what should we do now?

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,530
There's an old Chinese saying,

167
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,900
"If you're not at the table,

168
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,890
you'll probably be on the menu."

169
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,880
There's no turning back.

170
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,740
We can only do as they say

171
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,130
and speed up the research.

172
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,860
Yes.

173
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,919
I'm speechless.

174
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,010
Lu called

175
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,110
and asked me to visit Li Yuquan's relatives and friends

176
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,840
to check his social relations.

177
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,900
Yaohong.

178
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,010
When I'm not here,

179
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,800
please take care of things for me.

180
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,690
No problem.

181
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,760
Shaobai.

182
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,550
What kind of mission is Director Lu on exactly?

183
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,550
I haven't seen him for quite a while.

184
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,380
Is this your first day at work?

185
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,850
Don't you know the rules?

186
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,840
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

187
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,550
This.

188
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,070
See you.

189
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,430
Drink more.

190
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,170
I'll come pick you up

191
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,610
in a few days.

192
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,880
Is it enough?

193
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,530
Have another half.

194
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,330

00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,820
You'll shoulder a heavy responsibility alone

385
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,170
after you go there.

386
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,990
So

387
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,030
he's here to...

388
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,670
Right.

389
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,560
To replace you.

390
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,000
This...

391
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,390
It's pretty good news,

392
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,230
but

393
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,230
I don't know if I can handle it there.

394
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,100
You're not the Liu Rui you used to be.

395
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,480
You can work completely independently now.

396
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,920
You'll have to write forensic reports independently from now on.

397
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,130
This pen is for you.

398
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,400
Remember,

399
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,500
every word you write

400
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,320
is to speak for the deceased.

401
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,900
So you must be very careful.

402
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,380
Good luck.

403
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,680
Unfortunately,

404
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,720
our story ends here.

405
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,610
It seems I won't be your master.

406
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,540
But since Dr. Jin will train you herself,

407
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,190
I'll be your senior.

408
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,930
So I'm your junior.

409
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,850
That's right.

410
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,160
Let's each work hard

411
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,270
and meet at the top.

412
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,790
In the Forensics Department,

413
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,310
you should pay attention to...

414
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,910
Master!

415
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,770
Remember to...

416
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,110
Master!

417
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,460
Lu.

418
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,400
As soon as I received your call

419
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,380
and confirmed that Chen had passed the message,

420
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,440
Yaohong and I came here to keep watch.

421
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,910
We've confirmed that

422
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,010
Chen is alone

423
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,950
in his house.

424
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,520
The one who came to meet Chen

425
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,400
wasn't Shrike,

426
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,860
but Xu Wei.

427
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,230
I followed him for a while,

428
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,550
but I stopped

429
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,350
because I was worried he'd find out.

430
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,190
It's better to lose him than to expose yourself.

431
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,500
The key is to let Xu Wei

432
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,580
pass the false information to Shrike.

433
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,430
We can't alert him

434
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,360
before that.

435
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,130
Now we've used Chen

436
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,030
for everything he could.

437
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,770
To prevent any changes,

438
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,230
according to Deputy Commissioner Yang's order,

439
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,960
let's arrest him immediately.

440
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,260
Who is it?

441
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,260
Chen.

442
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,140
Come with us.

443
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,440
Can I have some dumplings?

444
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,140
They were just cooked.

445
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,510
Take him away.

446
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,800
So the Air Defense Command Post is fake.

447
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,150
Lu Zhengyang.

448
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,010
You guys are really good at

449
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,250
turning your fake play into reality.

450
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,860
If we hadn't made it look real,

451
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,990
how would you have passed the message?

452
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,910
Bring him in.

453
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,910
Go.

454
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,200
Xiaoman.

455
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,690
Make sure to keep it confidential

456
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,960
that we gave Chen a sudden trial.

457
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,560
Got it.

458
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,430
We've been working in the same office

459
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,350
for so long.

460
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,260
I didn't expect he's actually an agent.

461
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,030
It's because he's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

462
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,360
He's good at disguise.

463
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,900
He may have even more tricks

464
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,470
in store.

465
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,840
Let's check him out first.

466
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,570
Let's begin.

467
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,300
Open the door.

468
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,590
Chen.

469
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,970
I never thought we'd meet this way.

470
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,430
Yeah.

471
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,230
We were sitting in the same room and talking about work during the day .

472
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,230
But now,

473
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,390
we're sitting across each other,

474
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,910
and we've become adversaries.

475
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,360
No.

476
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,100
I should say we've become enemies.

477
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,780
We've always treated you as a comrade.

478
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,160
It's you

479
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,000
who's been lying to us.

480
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,620
Same to you.

481
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,550
Didn't you set up such a big trap

482
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,590
to deceive me too?

483
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
You wanted to use me

484
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,590
to deliver fake information on the Air Defense Command Post

485
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,270
to Shrike.

486
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,850
We know more

487
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,260
than you think.

488
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,420
However,

489
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,610
we still hope you can tell us yourself.

490
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,800
Consider it as a chance we give you.

491
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,920
Lu.

492
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,310
You all

493
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,420
have always been nice to me.

494
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,330
I don't want to make things difficult for you either.

495
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,790
Whatever you want to know,

496
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,820
I'll tell you.

497
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,550
My name is Chen Rushan.

498
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,510
48 years old.

499
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm from Hunan Province.

500
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,020
My ancestral home is Shangrao, Jiangxi.

501
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,510
I'm currently Chief of the Archives Department of the Public Security Bureau.

502
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,910
Alright.

503
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,880
I have a disability in my left leg.

504
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,640
Enough.

505
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,610
All these things you said

506
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,020
are already in the file.

507
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,460
Let's talk about

508
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,000
what your codename in NBIS is.

509
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,020
Nyctibius.

510
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,620
The kind of bird which is best at disguise.

511
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,110
It suits your identity quite well.

512
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,060
I'm very curious about

513
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,940
how I exposed myself.

514
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,960
Everyone around you

515
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,680
who can prove that you're Chen Rushan

516
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,320
is dead.

517
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,910
But this is not enough for you to arrest me.

518
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,630
But it's enough to make us have doubts.

519
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,890
So you arranged a physical examination.

520
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,020
I did the X-ray.

521
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,430
There was no problem.

522
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,790
Yes.

523
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,680
There was no problem at all.

524
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,800
Unfortunately,

525
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,460
you became the victim of your own cleverness.

526
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,560
In order to verify whether we suspected you,

527
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,390
you rejected the physical examination on purpose.

528
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,130
But that only deepened

529
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,430
our suspicion of you.

530
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,170
Because your acting that day

531
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,680
was a bit too much.

532
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,980
By the way,

533
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,310
As for Li Yuquan

534
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,380
being found at Jian'an Apartment,

535
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,940
it was also arranged by you on purpose, right?

536
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,470
As we expected, you couldn't sit tight

537
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,240
and called Falcon immediately.

538
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,950
Alright.

539
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,270
I'll cut to the chase.

540
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,010
We just want to know

541
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,660
what Shrike's true identity is.

542
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,220
I hope you can tell us the truth.

543
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,490
I don't know.

544
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,110
I've never met him.

545
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,620
We've confirmed that

546
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,760
Shrike is your direct superior.

547
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,130
Since you are so good,

548
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,050
why don't you investigate it yourselves?

549
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,740
I'll only confess what I did.

550
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,090
Chen.

551
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,180
We just want to give you a chance.

552
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,380
A chance?

553
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,420
Lin.

554
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,900
Don't try to

555
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,130
play this trick on me.

556
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,530
I'll die anyway.

557
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,400
You caught me.

558
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,380
Once Shrike can't contact me,

559
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,680
he will be convinced that

560
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,000
I've been exposed,

561
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,040
and he'll transfer immediately.

562
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,430
He won't find out about this so quickly.

563
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,230
To the public,

564
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,890
you're on a business trip in Shijiazhuang now.

565
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,850
He won't buy that easily, either.

566
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,790
Didn't you use me

567
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,440
to spread false information

568
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,030
on the Air Defense Command Post

569
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,780
just because you want to shoot down our aircrafts

570
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,070
when they fly over?

571
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,940
You underestimated us too.

572
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,110
Given how cautious he is,

573
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,060
he will definitely cross-verify

574
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,760
the authenticity of the information.

575
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,600
Once he finds out there's something wrong about it,

576
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,890
he will transfer immediately.

577
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,270
Let me put it this way.

578
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,180
Even if

579
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,560
he sends out the false information,

580
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,610
and even if you shoot down our aircrafts,

581
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,160
he will still transfer

582
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,310
and disappear

583
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,160
immediately afterwards.

584
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,470
You did catch me,

585
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,590
but you haven't won.

586
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,110
As long as I remain silent,

587
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,420
you won't be able to catch Shrike.

588
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,850
Am I right or not?

589
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,850
I'm tired.

590
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,020
After listening to the whole interrogation,

591
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,440
I feel that Chen

592
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,110
suits his codename really well.

593
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,110
He's just like Nyctibius, the bird,

594
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,780
which is very good at disguise

595
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
and very cunning.

596
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,790
Besides, he has

597
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,350
a lot of experience

598
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,890
in resisting interrogations.

599
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,490
I'm afraid it's not that easy

600
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,520
to make him confess.

601
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,490
Everyone has their own weaknesses.

602
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,020
If we want to find Chen's weakness,

603
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,260
we must get to know him thoroughly

604
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,580
and get to the bottom of his background.

605
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,500
But he

606
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,990
has already destroyed

607
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,640
all the materials related to himself long ago.

608
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,920
The blank tombstone.

609
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,230
The blank tombstone

610
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,280
Chen visited in the cemetery

611
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,270
must have some special connection

612
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,550
with him.

613
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,040
This

614
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,140
may be a breakthrough for us.

615
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,570
Leave him hanging for a few days.

616
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,770
Let's start our investigation with the blank tombstone.

617
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,020
The owner of this blank tombstone

618
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,140
is registered as Du Lengquan.

619
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,020
Du Lengquan?

620
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,880
Please confirm for me,

621
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,410
have you seen this person before?

622
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,220
Yes.

623
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,790
I've seen him.

624
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,720
No one else has come to visit this cemetery

625
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,180
except for him.

626
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,860
Others always come on Tomb-Sweeping Festival

627
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,910
or the anniversary of the death of the deceased.

628
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,300
But the time he comes to visit

629
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,510
is not fixed.

630
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,110
And he's been here quite a lot of times.

631
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,150
Okay.

632
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,230
Thank you.

633
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,180
Please go on with your work.

634
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Okay. You too.

635
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,140
Okay, thank you.

636
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,950
The blank tombstone.

637
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
What's Du Lengquan's relationship

638
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,070
with Chen?

639
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,160
The old photos are all here.

640
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,280
Okay.

641
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,620
When was this photo taken?

642
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
Let me take it out for you.

643
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,870
[Group photo of the excellent workers of Wusong Steelmaking Plant]

644
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,429
[Du Lengquan]

645
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,840
Chief.

646
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,060
I've checked.

647
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,590
There were PLA soldiers guarding the gate.

648
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,900
There were hidden guards on many roofs nearby.

649
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,090
I specially checked their daily waste

650
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,240
and found that all the papers were shredded.

651
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,950
Soviets love drinking and eating bread so much,

652
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,790
but there were no bottles

653
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,500
or bread crumbs in the dump.

654
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,390
In other words,

655
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,770
all traces of Russians

656
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,670
have been erased completely.

657
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,780
This proves that it was exactly Lu Zhengyang who did that,

658
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,770
because he didn't miss any detail.

659
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,800
And it also proves the authenticity of Nyctibius's information.

660
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,540
This is just you two's speculation.

661
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,390
According to the transfer order,

662
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,110
Lu Zhengyang should indeed be

663
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,100
in charge of security work in the Air Defense Command Post.

664
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
But has either of you seen him

665
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,630
come in or out of No. 1899, Zhongbai Road?

666
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,910
No.

667
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,110
Therefore,

668
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,240
we need to do another cross-validation.

669
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,920
I'll go in person.

670
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,890
You stay close to No. 1899

671
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,680
and keep an eye on Lu Zhengyang.

672
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,730
See if he really comes in and out of this place.

673
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,220
Understood.

674
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,530
Hold on. Hold on.

675
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,600
Where are you from?

676
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,990
Who... Who are you looking for here?

677
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,710
Are you talking to me?

678
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,640
Yes, you don't look familiar.

679
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,420
And you kept looking around.

680
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,150
You aren't an agent, are you?

681
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,680
Do I look like an agent to you?

682
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,030
I'm a teacher at People's Elementary.

683
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,900
I'm here to see Officer Lin for a home visit.

684
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,910
You are here to see Shaobai?

685
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,110
There shouldn't be any problem then.

686
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,470
You see.

687
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,160
Keep walking straight,

688
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,600
and the last house down the alley is Shaobai's home.

689
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,220
Okay, thank you.

690
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,740
You are so vigilant.

691
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,640
To prevent and resist agents.

692
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,310
Why did you talk so much?

693
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,990
This is the task assigned by the Welfare Committee.

694
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,280
Be careful when meeting strangers.

695
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
Mind your own business. Get to work.

696
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,830
All right.

697
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,640
Coming.

698
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,950
Mr. Zheng.

699
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:41,870
Hello, Officer Lin.

700
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,030
Please, come on in.

701
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,910
Here's the thing.

702
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,970
The school's going to organize students to go to West Lake for sketching,

703
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,140
and the deadline is drawing near.

704
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,150
Regarding the health condition of Feihang,

705
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,730
we would like to seek her parents' opinions.

706
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,890
Thank you for coming all the way here in person.

707
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,070
Don't mention it.

708
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,670
Come in and have a seat.

709
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,110
Okay.

710
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,750
Feihang.

711
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,220
Look who's here.

712
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,630
Mr. Zheng.

713
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,260
Hello, Feihang,

714
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,620
So you are Mr. Zheng.

715
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,950
No wonder Feihang likes you so much.

716
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,470
You are indeed a charming gentleman.

717
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,520
You must be a cultured person.

718
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,110
Please have a seat.

719
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,430
Okay, thank you.

720
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,290
I'll go get you some fruits.

721
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,070
Don't bother.

722
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,510
Make yourself at home, Mr. Zheng.

723
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,700
My two moms are kind of enthusiastic.

724
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,430
So they are your two moms?

725
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,990
Feihang, how's your health recently?

726
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,990
Very well, Mr. Zheng.

727
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,640
All the students are going to West Lake for sketching.

728
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,570
I want to go too.

729
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,300
Okay.

730
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,230
As long as your Uncle Lu signs the informed consent form,

731
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,660
you can go.

732
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,100
He will definitely agree.

733
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,540
But Lu is not here today.

734
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,880
I'll sign it for him.

735
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,590
I'm afraid this won't do.

736
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,070
The school has rules.

737
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,030
The signature on the informed consent form

738
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,950
must be of the guardian himself.

739
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,120
The thing is, Lu is too busy lately.

740
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,160
How about this?

741
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,360
I'll give him a call

742
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,670
and see if he can make a run back.

743
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,480
Okay, thank you.

744
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,220
No problem.

745
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,960
Thank you.

746
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,550
Mr. Zheng, here.

747
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,030
Have some oranges.

748
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,260
Thank you so much.

749
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,840
You're welcome.

750
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,850
Lu.

751
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,990
Mr. Zheng is here for a home visit.

752
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,000
He needs to talk to you.

753
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,590
Can you make a run back?

754
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,890
Alright, got it.

755
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,550
Lu is on his way back.

756
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,550
Please sit for a while.

757
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,370
That's great.

758
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,390
I'll wait for him.

759
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,020
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

760
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,660
No, of course not.

761
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,990
Mr. Zheng.

762
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,540
When are you leaving?

763
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,800
Next week.

764
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,870
Before you go,

765
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,860
I want to take Feihang for a checkup.

766
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,270
That's reasonable.

767
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,200
I'll sign it then.

768
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,510
Great. I can go to West Lake for sketching.

769
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,260
I'm sorry

770
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,690
for making you come back during your busy schedule.

771
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,510
No, I should thank you.

772
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,350
Not at all.

773
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,940
Okay, I'll leave now.

774
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,430
Okay.

775
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,190
See you.

776
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,980
Mr. Zheng, are you leaving?

777
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,110
Stay a while longer and have dinner with us.

778
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,220
It'll be ready soon.

779
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,910
No, no.

780
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,190
My wife has already cooked.

781
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,670
If I don't go home for dinner, she will be angry.

782
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,680
I'll see you off.

783
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,470
Please stay.

784
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,070
Come on, Feihang.

785
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,530
Come on, see Mr. Zheng off.

786
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,530
Be careful.

787
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,460
You're welcome.

788
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:40,950
Okay.

789
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,840
Please stay.

790
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,320
Take care, Mr. Zheng.

791
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,420
See you, Mr. Zheng.

792
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,990
Feihang, come on.

793
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,750
I'll take you to eat a piece of braised pork before dinner.

794
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,430
Okay.

795
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,830
Zheng Lanting chose now of all times for a home visit.

796
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,760
It seems to me he wants to probe something.

797
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,070
No matter what he wants to probe,

798
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,410
we've done everything we can.

799
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,390
Should we ask someone to keep an eye on him?

800
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,000
He only came here for a home visit.

801
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
What reason do you have to watch him?

802
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,600
The most important thing now

803
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,350
is to make a breakthrough with Chen.

804
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,650
As long as he confesses,

805
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,380
all the truth will be revealed.

806
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,660
Boss.

807
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,120
A bowl of wonton, please.

808
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,980
A bowl of wonton for this gentleman.

809
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,350
Okay.

810
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,390
I'm not eating here.

811
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,470
I'll take it to go.

812
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,890
You've finished your home visit?

813
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,980
Yes.

814
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,320
Please have a seat.

815
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,070
Thank you.

816
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,460
If I didn't guess it wrong, your surname should be... Huang?

817
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,410
Yes.

818
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,220
And you're in your early 60s?

819
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm 65.

820
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,520
What about you?

821
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,640
I'm 57.

822
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,340
I've become an old man

823
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,320
in a blink of an eye.

824
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,080
Guess

825
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,940
what I would do if I were 40 years younger.

826
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,410
What would you do?

827
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,010
I'd work as a police officer

828
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
and catch agents just like Shaobai.

829
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,340
It's fun even just thinking about it.

830
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,670
Yes. Right.

831
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,860
Since you live in the same alley as the police now,

832
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,540
you must feel safe.

833
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,150
I feel relieved.

834
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,750
It seems your signboard

835
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,690
is a bit worn out.

836
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,590
Haven't you thought about changing it?

837
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,840
I can help you.

838
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,700
I don't have spare money for that.

839
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,210
I've donated all my spare money

840
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,960
to the Bombing Refugee Relief Association.

841
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,310
Yes, we've donated it all.

842
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,550
We don't have much money.

843
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,020
I'll only charge some material fees.

844
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:31,740
Really?

845
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,500
Yes.

846
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,470
It's the new society now.

847
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,070
Yes.

848
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,290
Haven't you two ever thought about changing your names?

849
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,340
I do want to change my name,

850
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,780
to Fried Jiang.

851
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,660
What?

852
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,200
There's a dish in the north called fried bean paste noodles.

853
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,560
Yes.

854
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,410
And we sell fried "Jiang" wontons and noodles here.

855
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,090
This...

856
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,220
How should I put it?

857
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,460
I mean if Jiang fights back,

858
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,500
won't you have to change your name again?

859
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,480
No.

860
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,680
As long as the Communist Party is here,

861
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,070
he won't be able to come back.
