We still don't know his name,

5
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,350
but this sketch is based on the description

6
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,550
from the arms dealer.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,720
He also revealed that this buyer

[Killer recruited]

9
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,610
recruited more than a dozen assassins through him.

10
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,630
It seems this third party

11
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,110
is definitely taking action.

and all their firearms and ammunition

15
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,410
are the best American equipment.

16
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,380
According to them,

17
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,590
this buyer was very straightforward when paying,

[Wang Liqun] [Li Yuquan] [Falcon]

Based on everything that has happened before,

Uncle Jin's suspicion

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,000
is still quite high.

24
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,460
No evidence, no conclusion.

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,110
Investigate this person's true identity

26
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,770
and quickly determine the employer behind him.

27
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,430
I'm back.

28
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,070

32
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,490
regularly receives large sums of money.

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,910
And the remitter is quite fixed.

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,790
It's a company called Shanghai Gangtong Trading.

35
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,750
The owner of this Gangtong Trading company

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,300
is the one who has been providing

[Dumdum bullet]

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,160
operational funds to the agents.

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,230
It's not that simple.

40
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,110
This company specializes

41
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,829
in currency exchange and transfer services,

42
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,490
and its clients are the major banks in Hong Kong.

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,550
So it seems that Zheng Lanting's funding behind the scenes

44
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,750
comes from Hong Kong.

45
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,070
Which bank?

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,970
It's still HSBC, the Hong Kong HSBC headquarters.

47
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,420
We called them,

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,160
and they stated that they need to keep their clients' information confidential

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,360
and will not disclose any information.

50
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,350
That's normal.

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,620
It's their policy.

However, Yaohong and I

53
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,310
found another clue.

This Shanghai Gangtong Trading company

55
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,670

in addition to Yang Jun,

58
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,190
who is Wang Liqun's alias.

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,900
What is the name of the payee?

60
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,750

As for the questions regarding the Hong Kong HSBC headquarters,

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,790
I'll coordinate with Deputy Commissioner Yang.

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,980
Yaohong, Xiaoman,

66
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,490
you two go to the household registration office

67

to find out exactly who Han Jinkui is.

68
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,760
Understood.

69
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,720
On January 6th of this year,

Britain has already recognized the status of our new China,

71

and up to now, HSBC in Hong Kong

72
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,110
is still providing funding to the agents.

73
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,110
Isn't that aiding and abetting evil?

74
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,040
This doesn't make sense anywhere.

75
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,520
Deputy Commissioner Yang,

76
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,230
once Zheng Lanting realizes

77
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,550
we're tracking this lead,

78
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,270
he will make the Hong Kong side directly close the account and transfer funds.

79
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,950
So...

80
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,810
How about this?

81
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,630
I will personally go to find the South China Bureau.

82
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,650
Our Party's highest leadership organization in Hong Kong

83
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,180
is the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee,

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,040
which has Huaren, the Investment Promotion Bureau,

85
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,470
and the Nanyang Commercial Bank.

86
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,200
These are all red enterprises.

87
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,750
If the official route doesn't work,

88
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,490
I think private coordination

89
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,740
should be possible.

90
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,180

Let me take you to the station.

96

101
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,250
This is what Yan said herself.

Alright, alright.

112
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,460
A telegram from Hong Kong has arrived.

113
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,270
So soon? Do we have any clues?

114

Our comrades in Hong Kong

115

127
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,790
He would never follow Zheng Lanting's orders.

128
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,430
Uncle Jin's most important concern is Yan.

129
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,690
Zheng Lanting

130
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,830

and also his registration photo.

134
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,760

He is cooperating with Shrike,

147

but has always wanted to break free from Shrike's control.

148
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,930
Killing Wang Liqun was to prevent him from confessing

149

and exposing himself.

onto Li Yuquan.

He wants to eliminate Shrike.

158
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,810
It turns out Yan's trip to Nanjing was arranged by him,

to ensure he had no worries

At such a critical time,

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,730
I need to be by your side.

Mr. Jin,

181
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,100
I never think about the "what ifs."

182
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,640
If we don't leave ourselves an escape route,

183
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,370
then the gun's muzzle will always point forward.

184
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,840
Well said! No escape route left for ourselves.

185
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,410
So we can only win.

186
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,590
We agreed on four o'clock.

Why haven't they arrived yet?

188
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,910
Director,

189
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,990
I've asked.

190
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,070
Nobody in the factory knows

191
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,730
Jin Maochang's whereabouts.

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Hello?

193
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Lu, he's not home.

194
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,320
Quickly investigate all of Jin Maochang's social connections.

195
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
Expand the search range.

196
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,040
See you at the office in a bit.

197
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,770
Understood.

198
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,200
Pengfei,

199
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,230
I'll leave this to you.

200
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,590
Yes.

201
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,310
Huzi, come with me.

202
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,710
Yes.

203
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,540
He's coming.

204
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,420
Are you nervous?

205
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,340
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

206
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,000
Why am I feeling a bit nervous?

207
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,380
Am I overthinking it?

208
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

209
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,110
I rode all the way here.

210
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,940
It's better to be cautious.

211
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,050
Your wanted notices are all over the newspapers.

212
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,760
The public security bureau is also looking for you everywhere.

213
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,350
I was worried you might not come.

214
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,320
Is the boat here?

215
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,980
Almost.

216
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,670
This place is too conspicuous.

217
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,990
Let's go in and wait.

218
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,190
I want you to board the ship with the cotton yarn.

219
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,350
By the way, I'm going with you.

220
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll accompany you.

221
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,600
Thoughtful.

222
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,100
Just the two of you?

223
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,640
Isn't Mrs. Zheng coming along?

224
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,300
What time is it?

225
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,100
I can just mind my own business.

226
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,970
That's true.

227
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,410
One's own life is the most important.

228
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,510
Mr. Jin.

229
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,800
What play is this?

230
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,790
Aren't you sincerely sending me off?

231
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,800
It's sincerely sending you off,

232
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,440
but it has to be done cleanly and swiftly.

233
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,700
Otherwise, if you fall into the hands of the police,

234
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,620
what will I do?

235
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,050
If you fall,

236
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,180
you'll still be in my hands.

237
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,340
No need to wait anymore.

238
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,180
So Mr. Jin is really sending us on our way.

239
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,920
Are you sure

240
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,640
you want to to this?

241
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,470
From the first day you found me,

242
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,540
threatening me with my daughter's life,

243
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,810
I have been looking for this opportunity.

244
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,420
King Goujian of Yue,

245
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,400
lying low and enduring hardship?

246
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,790
Send us on board.

247
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,440
I can overlook all of this.

248
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
This is your last chance.

249
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,790
You're giving me a chance?

250
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,990
Did I hear that right?

251
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,350
Do you know, Zheng Lanting,

252
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,990
that I'm not the only one here who wants you dead?

253
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,260
Do you still remember Jiang Yang?

254
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,530
He's my brother.

255
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,350
The debt you owe him

256
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,120
needs to be repaid today.

257
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,470
You're Jiang Yang's biological brother?

258
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,380
I deeply regret this.

259
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,140
Too late.

260
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,440
You must be very curious

261
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,190
about who your brother died at the hands of.

262
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,810
Besides you, who else...

263
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,490
Him.

264
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,350
Your Boss Mr. Jin.

265
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,520
With a shovel,

266
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,090
he buried your brother alive, one shovelful at a time.

267
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,840
What nonsense are you talking about...

268
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,280
Mr. Jin, how did you do it?

269
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,650
After burying someone's biological brother alive,

270
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,650
you can still make his brother work for you.

271
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,630
Teach me,

272
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,170
how did you do it?

273
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,590
Mr. Jin,

274
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,500
is what he said true?

275
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,480
Is it true?

276
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,260
Kui.

277
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,140
Shut up!

278
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,270
I did it.

279
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,670
If I hadn't acted back then, I would've died too,

280
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,680
and my daughter would've died too.

281
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,370
The key is, your brother couldn't survive.

282
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,360
Before your brother died,

283
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,770
he never sold me out.

284
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,330
Falcon.

285
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,910
You were also there at the time, right?

286
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,740
You tell me, was there a lie

287
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,860
in what I just said?

288
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,610
Kui, Falcon,

289
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,940
if you kill Zheng Lanting now,

290
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,670
you can also kill me.

291
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,870
Whether to act is up to you.

292
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,250
Mr. Jin, don't talk nonsense.

293
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,940
This has nothing to do with me.

294
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,620
Brother!

295
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,340
I'm giving you an explanation today.

296
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,090
Zheng Lanting!

297
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,100
Any news?

298
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,050
Not yet.

299
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,480
Don't think too much.

300
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,990
If I could find evidence earlier,

301
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,170
if I could arrest Uncle Jin earlier,

302
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,600
wouldn't all of this have been avoided?

303
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,960
Life is unpredictable.

304
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,640
Since things have happened,

305
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,540
just handle them well.

306
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,750
Director, the Public Security Bureau just received a report.

307
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,060
There's been a lot of gunfire at Changjiang No. 3 warehouse.

308
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,870
There seems to have been a shootout.

309
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,300
Immediately notify everyone

310
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,450
to head to Changjiang No. 3 warehouse.

311
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,070
Yes.

312
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,160
Falcon.

313
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,530
It was you who tipped me off.

314
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,350
Mr. Jin,

315
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,130
even at your last moment, you're still stirring discord.

316
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,210
Injured pretty badly.

317
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,480
Not much time left.

318
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,839
Mr Jin,

319
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,230
my people

320
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,329
have already infiltrated last night.

321
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,470
To be honest,

322
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,130
since the day you killed

323
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,810
Li Yuquan,

324
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,050
I've started to see you in a new light.

325
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,150
I'm also someone you've been dreaming of killing.

326
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,160
How could you possibly

327
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,670
sincerely want to send me away?

328
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,290
That logic doesn't hold up.

329
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,240
I've lost.

330
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,970
I won't pose a threat to you anymore.

331
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,880
I'm just asking you,

332
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,460
given that I've helped you with so many things,

333
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,140
to spare my daughter.

334
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,280
But based on what I know about you,

335
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,450
you should be more attached to

336
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,780
your vast fortune.

337
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,090
Do you have children?

338
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,240
Have you ever been a father?

339
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,560
If you've ever been a father, you should understand

340
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,030
a father's heart

341
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
for his child.

342
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm begging you.

343
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,000
Spare my daughter.

344
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,750
Don't worry.

345
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,310
I've never .

346
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,900
truly wanted to harm her.

347
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,780
Goodbye,

348
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,980
Mr. Jin.

349
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,520
It's very likely we won't meet again.

350
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,500
Let's go back.

351
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,430
Yes.

352
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,170
[Number 3]

353
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,180
Uncle Jin.

354
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,170
Uncle Jin!

355
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,060
Zheng Lanting has escaped.

356
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,470
He took a boat to Hong Kong.

357
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,540
Shaobai,

358
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll leave Mr. Jin to you.

359
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,860
The others,

360
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
come with me to chase.

361
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,240
Uncle Jin, please hold on.

362
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,930
I'll take you to the hospital.

363
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,610
Don't move.

364
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,550
Don't move.

365
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,370
I can't hold on anymore.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,130
I'm returning light before death.

367
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,660
I have been sharp all my life,

368
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,410
but didn't expect to end up

369
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,350
falling into the hands of agents.

370
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,030
Uncle Jin,

371
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,230
I believe you were forced by the agents.

372
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,310
I know you did it all for Yan.

373
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,030
Shaobai,

374
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,910

you've brought to the Party.

518
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,240
If you recognize the situation,

519
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,600
you should go to Taiwan to confess and seek forgiveness

520

what I just said to you

00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,719
was not my intention.

537
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,510
It was the directive from Director Mao Renfeng.

538
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,429

539
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,980

Don't take it personally.

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,120
So you have already been promoted to Chief?

00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,040
Is there a report I need to give?

559
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,780
What report?

in the past,

562
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,350
we had some unpleasantness.

563
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,870
Did we?

564
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,770
Let's just pretend it never happened.

565
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,770
Don't take it to heart in the future.

566
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,610
I came back this time

567
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,150
out of necessity.

568
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,170
I came back with a lot of reluctance.

569
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,900
I believe you were forced by the spies.

570
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,740
that only you

571
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,480
are the true Chief.

572
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,990
You can't say that.

573
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,310
No, no, it really is like that.

574
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,480
Right now, within the structure of the NBIS,

575
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,640
you should be

576
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,230
the true Chief.

577
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,420
You know, it's just a nominal title.

578
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,210
Mr. Mao sent you

579
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,930
to Shanghai at this time,

580
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,370
so he must have high hopes for you.

581
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,240
From what I know of you,

582
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,380
you should have a plan

583
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,880
on how to handle

584
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,390
this mess, right?

585
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,500
Don't mock me here.

586
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,790
You know my capabilities, don't you?

587
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,280
All the affairs of our Shanghai Special Station

588
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,990
depend on you, Shrike.

589
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,520
There's something I want to ask you.

590
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,930
How is that trump card,

591
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,990
Ogura,

592
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,550
you have?

593
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,450
Indeed,

594
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,930
Chief Liu

595
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,410
has a plan.

596
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,650
Don't worry.

597
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,580
I'm not asking for Ogura.

598
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,680
I just want to understand the situation

599
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,120
so I can report it to the higher-ups.

600
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,040
Otherwise, it'll be difficult

601
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,840
to apply for funds

602
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,620
for our Shanghai Special Station's activities.

603
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,530
I can tell you this.

604
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,110
It's time for us to

605
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,670
use Ogura now.

606
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,560
As for

607
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,380
the research on super anthrax,

608
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,530
it has now

609
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,710
entered the live test phase.

610
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,110
In other words,

611
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,750
our Sea Subversion Plan

612
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,970
will be implemented soon.

613
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,790
So,

614
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,610
is it confirmed we're doing this?

615
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,340
Of course.

616
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,620
This is a major matter.

617
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,440
You decide.

618
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,790
You'll be the one who decide.

619
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,720
By the way,

620
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,380
that Si who often follows me,

621
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,340
have you heard anything about him?

622
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,580
He's dead.

623
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,800
He died in your watch shop,

624
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,120
killed by the police.

625
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,590
This tea is good.

626
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,560
Not bad, right?

627
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,880
Who gave it to you?

628
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
Take a packet when you leave.

629
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:52,460
[Xiya Timepiece Store]

630
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,670
Hold on.

631
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,980
Make sure to keep the door secure.

632
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,740
Okay.

633
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,190
Hey, buddy.

634
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,340
Come here.

635
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,950
Can you do me a favor?

636
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,630
Lift it out.

637
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,290
Alright.

638
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,430
That's it.

639
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,790
Get out.

640
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,740
What are you doing? Who let you in?

641
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,380
Well.

642
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,470
I heard you call me.

643
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,670
You startled me.

644
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,630
It's over.

645
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,020
It's lost. It's over.

646
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,800
What's gone?

647
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,550
The gold bars.

648
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,660
Dollars.

649
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,300
Do what?

650
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,670
Do what? Dollars!

651
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,750
US Dollars.

652
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,800
All gone.

653
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,380
Did Si take them?

654
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,560
He wouldn't dare.

655
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,910
I'd kill him.

656
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,190
He's already dead.

657
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,910
What happened?

658
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,430
Where did the money go?

659
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,750
The Party sent us back,

660
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,060
but they don't care about our lives at all.

661
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,500
If it weren't for this money,

662
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,490
why would I come back?

663
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,900
Now it's all gone.

664
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,800
I've got my life on the line

665
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,480
and earned this retirement money.

666
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,400
It can't just disappear like this.

667
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,060
Look for it.

668
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,180
Keep looking.

669
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,450
Look for it!

670
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,190
Okay.

671
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh my God.

672
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,960
Go up and look for it.

673
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,600
Okay.

674
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,380
It's all over now.

675
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,370
It's all over now.

676
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,050
Where did...

677
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,840
Where did all my gold bars go?

678
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,670
It's over. It's over.

679
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,900
It's over.

680
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,000
Mom.

681
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,500
Yan.

682
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:57,990
Yan.

683
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,190
Come in.

684
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,910
Hurry in!

685
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,210
Feihang has grown taller.

686
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,380
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

687
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,510
What's the point of saying it earlier?

688
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,200
I prepared some of my best dishes for you.

689
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,910
I just learned them from my mom.

690
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,440
Hurry and take them to play.

691
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,350
Go, go, go.

692
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,410
Fish soup.

693
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,390
I made this dish myself.

694
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,610
Make sure to taste it.

695
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,850
I'll serve it.

696
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,820
Good girl.

697
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,190
Stealing my job, Little Feihang.

698
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,620
Be careful, don't burn yourself.

699
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,480
Here, Aunt Jin Yan, have some soup.

700
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,870
Thank you, Feihang.

701
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,430
Quick, try it.

702
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:30,910
Let me serve you.

703
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,670
Is it good?

704
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,470
Here.

705
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,650
Thank you, Grandma.

706
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,170
It's delicious, fresh.

707
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,080
It's my specialty, I told you.

708
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,550
Today, it's mainly because I didn't have enough time.

709
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,610
If I had more time,

710
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,600
I could have prepared a whole table of dishes for you.

711
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,730
Uncle Lin always talks big.

712
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,370
He was supposed to make braised carp,

713
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,630
but he couldn't even handle killing the fish.

714
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,690
That's why it was Younger Grandma teaching him to make crucian carp soup.

715
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,270
I'm kind, Feihang.

716
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,320
I can't bear to kill fish, you know?

717
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,050
Don't talk nonsense,

718
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,250
or I'll tell your Uncle!
