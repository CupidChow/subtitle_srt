00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,870
Come.

196
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,150
Unload it.

197
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,020
Hurry.

198
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,450
-Move.
-Hurry up.

199
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,220
If we don't take it, they'd benefit.

200
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,160
Guys!

201
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,420
It's payday!

202
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,520
In the forecourt.

203
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,110
Go earlier or you'd miss it!

204
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,240
It's payday!

205
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,910
Payday!

206
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,790
Payday!

207
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,070
Zhao.

208
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,990
It's payday. After half a year's delay.

209
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,480
Go now.

210
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,010
Okay.

211
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,440
Zhang.

212
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,470
It's payday.

213
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,330
Get in line now.

214
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,150
I'll go later. It's so crowded.

215
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,140
It'll be gone if you're late.

216
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,990
Soon.

217
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,230
Shaobai.

218
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,810
Why are you dawdling here?

219
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,440
Chief Ye ordered me to

220
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,870
come here to inform them.

221
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,310
Chief Ye said it's silver dollars today.

222
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,240
Silver dollars?

223
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,050
Go, go, go.

224
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,150
-Silver dollars.
-Silver dollars.

225
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,280
Let's go have a look.

226
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
Hurry up.

227
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,530
Lock the door.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,210
I'll wait here.

229
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,150
Come on.

230
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,200
Are you done?

231
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,460
Take the shoes.

232
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,000
They wouldn't give them to us,

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
so we'll take them ourselves.

234
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,550
We can't spoil them.

235
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,210
Come on.

236
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,710
Your wife's pregnant.

237
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,910
She needs nutrition.

238
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,340
Don't forget.

239
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,910
After the kid's born,

240
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,140
I'm the godfather.

241
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,530
My kid's lucky.

242
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,030
Okay.

243
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,510
Enough.

244
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,270
Let's go.

245
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Where's my hat?

246
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,780
Over there.

247
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,980
Huang Bo, Zhang Yan,

248
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,580
come get your salaries.

249
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,550
What should we do?

250
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,510
We have so many things.

251
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,170
How can we get pass the forecourt full of people?

252
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,400
Wang Xiang, Zheng Dalong,

253
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,090
come get your salaries.

254
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,110
Let's work overtime tonight.

255
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,130
I'll take it out. No one will notice.

256
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,790
Okay.

257
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,350
Let's go.

258
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,970
Let me tell you.

259
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,990
This bag of things

260
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,430
is worth two years' salary

261
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,780
at the black market.

262
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,970
Is it worth that much?

263
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,730
Of course.

264
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,340
If you hadn't stopped me,

265
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,390
I'd have taken more.

266
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,950
Enough.

267
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,510
Let's go.

268
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,240
Go.

269
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,800
Hurry up!

270
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,270
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

271
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,280
Hurry up!

272
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,550
Why is Ye Shiwu here?

273
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,720
Stand in a row.

274
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,370
Those should be communists.

275
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,450
Ye Shiwu is here to carry out a secret execution.

276
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,160
What should we do?

277
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,140
It's fine.

278
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,520
When they're doing it,

279
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,020
we'll find a chance to sneak out.

280
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,660
Get ready!

281
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,610
Director, this is the last batch.

282
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,820
Their identities have been verified.

283
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,810
Execute them on the spot!

284
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes!

285
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,430
Have you drafted the secret agents list?

286
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,270
All done.

287
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,770
NBIS has ordered for

288
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,540
the post office,

289
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,320
telegraph office,

290
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,990
train station,

291
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,150
and Jiangbei Power Plant

292
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,110
to be blown up.

293
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,750
Got it.

294
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,910
Director.

295
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,750
But Jiangbei Power Plant is too far away.

296
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,090
We can't send men there in time.

297
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,340
The Communist army will reach Jiangbei Power Plant soon.

298
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,770
It's too dangerous to go there now.

299
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,310
Ask Ye Shiwu to bring men there.

300
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,750
Yes.

301
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,670
[Vow to live and die with Shanghai]

302
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,280
Release those criminals

303
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,930
with the most heinous crimes,

304
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,380
especially those ruffians.

305
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,720
Leave them to the Communist Party.

306
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,380
Got it.

307
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,470
This Mao Sen...

308
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,100
So chilling.

309
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,720
It's none of our business.

310
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,630
Let's go quickly.

311
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,740
Don’t get caught.

312
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,480
[Li Guihe, Zhou Zhaoxiang] [Li Liang, Wang Xiaoman]

313
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,470
[Liu Guiheng, Zhou Renhuai]

314
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,540
Director.

315
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,990
These secret agents

316
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,510
are the backbone of Kuomintang.

317
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,640
They're definitely

318
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,710
loyal.

319
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,420
Why isn't Shrike's name on here?

320
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,750
I've contacted

321
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,240
him many times.

322
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,320
He was always acting weird

323
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,380
and noncommittal.

324
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,780
Did he promise you or not?

325
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,840
He didn't say yes

326
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,060
or no.

327
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,550
Director.

328
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,980
Shrike is problematic!

329
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,450
Guiheng.

330
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,110
Shrike is very important.

331
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,140
Tell me how I can

332
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,120
make Shrike stay.

333
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,670
One by one.

334
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,440
Let them know

335
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,650
the consequences of becoming a communist.

336
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,670
Raise your guns!

337
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,380
Director.

338
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,370
Soldiers

339
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,050
have to obey orders.

340
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,430
You are his superior.

341
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,310
Your words are the order.

342
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,880
Would Shrike dare disobey orders?

343
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,030
That makes sense.

344
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,450
♫Who created the mortal world?♫

345
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,870

348

Execute!

349
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,670
Do you want to hear the whole song?

350
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,020
Chief.

351
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,760
What should we do with these communists' corpses?

352
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,420
Is this your first day at work?

353
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,910
As usual.

354
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,860
Burn them.

355
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
What should we do?

356
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,180
We should leave before

357
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,970
they notice us.

358
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,610
Okay.

359
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,710
Who is that?

360
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,310
Don't move!

361
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,140
Everyone is here.

362
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,150
Is that Shaobai?

363
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,350
Chief Ye.

364
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,640
These are all from the warehouse.

365
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,450
Not bad.

366
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,340
You actually sneaked into the police station.

367
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,470
Chief.

368
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,360
We're working overtime

369
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,400
to prepare supplies for the final resistance.

370
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,580
Lin Shaobai is right.

371
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,830
We must be devoted to our duties for Kuomintang!

372
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,710
Devoted to your duties?

373
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,800
Nonsense.

374
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,840
Since you want to devote to your duties,

375
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,510
I'll give you a chance.

376
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,520
Dong.

377
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,070
Yes!

378
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,580
Leave the rest of the communists to them.

379
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,970
If they dare disobey,

380
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,050
kill them with the communists.

381
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,940
Take them away.

382
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,510
Take them away!

383
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,950
Go!

384
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,750
It's enough that I call you Chief!

385
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,630
You slimebag!

386
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,270
You have no right to shoot us!

387
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,550
You're taking personal revenge!

388
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:39,950
Go!

389
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,340
Perfect.

390
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,820
One for each.

391
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,620
Lin Shaobai.

392
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,150
You can go first.

393
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,770
I'll count down from three.

394
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,570
To live

395
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,810
or die;

396
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,010
it's up to you.

397
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,270
Three.

398
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,830
Two.

399
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,550
Shaobai.

400
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,920
One!

401
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,700
I have important intel about our enemy!

402
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,440
Director!

403
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,460
Director!

404
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,710
I have important intel about our enemy!

405
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,310
Call him up.

406
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,310
Director.

407
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,360
This is Ye Shiwu's subordinate,

408
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,090
Lin Shaobai.

409
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,580
Say it.

410
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,100
Director.

411
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,290
According to the current situation,

412
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,420
I suppose you're already setting up an undercover plan.

413
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,410
I know.

414
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,210
Anyone you choose

415
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,000
must be absolutely loyal to Kuomintang.

416
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,300
But there is one problem.

417
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,290
As long as they have communists' blood on their hands,

418
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,680
they'll leave flaws and traces.

419
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,070
According to the Communist Party's investigation method,

420
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,310
they'll be exposed...

421
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,430
Is this your important intel?

422
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,830
T-The point is the two of us...

423
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,500
My buddy and I aren't afraid of investigation.

424
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,270
We've never

425
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,870
caught communists

426
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,430
or killed them.

427
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,390
We have nothing to do with the NBIS.

428
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,660
And we aren't even

429
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,600
members of Kuomintang.

430
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,780
Really.

431
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,640
Xu Wei.

432
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,990
I heard

433
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,830
you are Lin Shaobai's best friend.

434
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,930
Do you want to be like him

435
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,880
and die here tonight?

436
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,440
I also heard that

437
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,870
your wife

438
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,430
is pregnant.

439
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,000
Is it true?

440
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,510
Chief Ye.

441
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,430
Tell me,

442
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,610
how can Lin Shaobai and I get out alive?

443
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,610
Didn’t I tell you?

444
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,490
Director...

445
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,260

446
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
the most.

448
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,630
As long a-as

449
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,710
my buddy and I don't shoot today,

450
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,680
we can definitely stand any investigation

451
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,010
by the Communist Party.

452
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,350
Director.

453
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,490
We can be your most hidden pawn

454
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,230
for your stay in Shanghai.

455
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,030
Get lost.

456
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,440
You're just a cop.

457
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,850
You're useless to us!

458
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,390
T-The idle chess piece

459
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,320
is often the biggest trump card.

460
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,790
Although I'm just a cop now,

461
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,320
I may not be in the future.

462
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,160
As long as I get a position,

463
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,460
I'll be much more

464
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,230
useful to the director than killing

465
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,160
two communists.

466
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,420
P-Plus...

467
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,880
Plus, I was born and raised in Shanghai.

468
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,180
I'm very familiar with the area.

469
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,990
It'd be more convenient for me

470
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,510
to handle things here.

471
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,880
What you said

472
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,980
made sense.

473
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,820
Actually, it doesn't matter to me

474
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,580
if you shoot or not.

475
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
What I want is you, this pawn.

476
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,090
At the critical moment,

477
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,250
you've to be loyal to Kuomintang and play a big role.

478
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,130
Can you do it?

479
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,400
Yes, Director!

480
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:20,850
Okay.

481
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,990
You don't have to shoot today.

482
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,700
And I can guarantee you

483
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,400
a promising future.

484
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,220
Thank you, Director.

485
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,880
Can I leave now?

486
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,630
Yes.

487

493

Let’s go.

494
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,470
Director.

495
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,420
Don't you want a written statement?

496
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,370
Oral promises aren't valid after all.

497
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,820
No one dares negotiate with me.

498
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,810
Since he could,

499
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,510
I'll use my conditions

500
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,650

We're buddies.

We've been working together for years.

506
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,870
How much do we owe each other?

507
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,090
Can it be calculated?

508
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,320
I'll bear tonight's matter with you.

509
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,470

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,570
Mao Sen is so chilling.

511
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,090
How can nobodies like us

512
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,900
negotiate with him?

513
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,350
If I didn't shoot today,

514
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,330
we wouldn't have gotten out.

515
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,060

00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,240
it's hard to wash my hands stained with blood.

519
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,180
Let's leave Shanghai.

520
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,090

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,970
Mao Sen and Ye won't let me off either.

523
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,450
Let's escape to Hong Kong.

524

00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,700
two more stations in Shanghai?

579
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,320
The first station's Wang Fangnan and the second's Wang Zhongqing.

580
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,390
But during the Counter-Japanese War,

581
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,750
didn't they work under you?

582
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,030
Then go with Lu Jingshi,

583
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,250
Du Yuesheng's favorite disciple.

584
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,540
He's well-connected in Shanghai

585
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,100
and has a deep foundation.

586
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,620
He is too obnoxious

587
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,560
and half a public figure in Shanghai.

588
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,460
He's not suitable.

589
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,580
Hmm... Xu Fuguan then.

590
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,440
The Youth Revolution National Salvation Alliance's

591
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,520
secretary.

592
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,320
His theoretical understanding is very high.

593
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,350
He's now in favor with Mr. Chingkuo.

594
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,520
He's good at writing but bad with guns.

595

596
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,570
You.

597
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,680
The bureau didn't hide you for so long

598
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,950
to snub you

599
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,700
but to consider the big picture

600
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,320
at a critical moment.

601
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,180
It’s time to come out of hiding.

602
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,650
Director, you flatter me.

603
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,470
Now I sell paintings

604
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,510
and cook food I like,

605
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,750
like an idle crane.

606
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,550
How are you an idle crane?

607
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,820
You're a raptor shrike.

608
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,850
Lanting.

609
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,860
Tell me what you want.

610
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,770
Okay, I'll be straightforward.

611
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,790
Get me the wooden spoon.

612
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,720
Here, have some tea.

613
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,990
The drawer isn't closed.

614
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,430
Thank you.

615

Lanting.

616

If you won't say anything,

617
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,380
I'll speak for you.

618
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,730
I'll recommend you to the superiors

619
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,240
for the position of the head of NBIS' Shanghai Special Station.

620
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,470
Promoted to major general by three ranks.

621
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,160
You know me well.

622
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,600
I don’t like being an official,

623
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,440
and I don't like fame.

624
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,550
Lanting, how about this?

625
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,429
Add some sugar.

626
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,540
I'll add one more title.

627
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,909
Chief of the Second Division

628
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,650
of the Garrison Command.

629
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,570
Is that enough?

630
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,800
It's a bit fishy.

631
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,750
I need some cooking wine.

633
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,659
Is my list of secret agents in Shanghai

634
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,080
what you want?

635
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,730
You should know

636
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,469
handling affairs is like handling fish.

637
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,570
You need someone handling it.

638
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,230
Lanting.

639
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,050
You know the rules in the bureau.

640
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,650
I need to ask my superior for permission.

641
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,670
I understand. I do.

642
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,000
It's done.

643
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,889
It looks good.

644
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,170
This fish was cooked well.

645
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,550
Here.

646
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,860
Director.

If you'd do me the favor of staying,

we can taste it together.

We can also have a drink.

This fish has

651
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,240
too many bones.

652
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,620

you intercepted a trump card, right?

657

You've been grasping onto this trump card

658
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,610
because you want to use it some day.

659
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,010

665

Take care, Director.

666

Is the deal done?

667
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,680
When eating fish...

668
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,590

to teach him a lesson?

674
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,790

If I remember correctly,

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,990
you were the Operations leader

683
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,590
in NBIS' Hangzhou Station.

684
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,830
Now you were transferred to Shanghai

Boss.

Great.

I have plenty of ticket buyers.

768
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,760
Get lost if you're broke.

769
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,250
Don't hinder my business.

770
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,970
Give it to me!

771
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,510
Shaobai!

772
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,030
I'll go to Wei.

773
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,190
What's wrong?

774
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,240
With these tickets,

775
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,580
go with your moms

776
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,970
and my wife first.

777
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,120
I got the wrong ticket. Mine's for tomorrow.

778
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,080
What's going on?

779
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,100
What do you mean?

780
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,110
It's just a mistake. Tomorrow's.

781
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,790
Go on.

782
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,500
Don't act in front of me.

783
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,530
What happened?

784
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,470
Just tell me.

785
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,710
If you can't explain, no one's leaving.

786
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,140
Just four tickets.

787
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,260
How about this?

788
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,180
Take the tickets

789
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,960
and go with your wife and my moms first.

790
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,720
No, Shaobai.

791
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,510
Wei.

792
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,360
You've fired a gun.

793
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,270
The Communist Party will enter the city soon.

794
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,120
Mao Sen won't be able to kill me off so soon.

795
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,000
Shaobai, no...

796
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,430
Your wife is pregnant.

797
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,700
You have to take care of her.

798
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,280
I can rest assured to leave my moms to you.

799
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,320
What about you?

800
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,070
I'm the great Lin Shaobai.

801
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,070
I can easily swim across

802
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,920
from Shanghai to Hong Kong.

803
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,740
How about this?

804
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll buy another ticket tomorrow, okay?

805
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,010
Excuse me!

806
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,340
Excuse me!

807
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,660
Make way if you don't have a ticket!

808
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,900
We've no time.

809
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:54,950
Go on.

810
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,640
We got the tickets!

811
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,170
Let's go. Take our stuff and go.

812
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,520
Be careful. Follow me.

813
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,230
Hey! Hey!

814
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,720
Excuse me!

815
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Excuse me!

816
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,270
Excuse me.

817
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:03,940
Be careful.

818
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,390
Hey!

819
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,670
Excuse me!

820
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,990
Make way if you don't have a ticket!

821
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,550
Don't push!

822
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,710
Excuse me!

823
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,620
Go quickly!

824
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,590
Go, go!

825
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,270
Go ahead!

826
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,390
Go, go!

827
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,220
Wei.

828
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,670
Go, go!

829
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,480
Those without tickets, go back. Don't block the way.

830
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,680
[Ticket Check]

831
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:20,540
I have a ticket. Let me in.

832
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,480
Be careful, sis.

833
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,570
Let me in!

834
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,640
Hurry up.

835
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Where is Shaobai?

836
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,540
Shaobai's behind.

837
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,870
He's not!

838
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,710
He was behind just now.

839
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,510
Shaobai!

840
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,810
[Entrance]

841
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,980
Who are you?

842
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,190
Sir! Sir!

843
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,070
Don't shoot.

844
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,120
I was wrong, sir.

845
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,130
Which gang are you from?

846
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,910
I have no money.

847
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,470
I rented my clothes.

848
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,260
Lin Shaobai.

849
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,200
Are you going somewhere far?

850
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,660
Chief Ye, we're on the same side.

851
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,070
Chief Ye.

852
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,150
Yes, on the same side.

853
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,810
Thank you for remembering me.

854
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,880
Of course.

855
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,010
What's going on?

856
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
Here’s the thing.

857
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,520
After Director heard you were leaving,

858
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,930
he told me to rush here to make sure

859
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,420
we don't lose a talent like you.

860
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,460
Luckily we made it in time,

861
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,580
or we couldn't explain to the director.

862
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,220
This is a big misunderstanding, Chief Ye.

863
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,370
Misunderstanding?

864
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,670
Buddy, we're on the same side.

865
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,430
Let go of me.

866
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,690
We're on the same side.

867
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,460
Chief Ye, here's the thing.

868
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,540
Director has assigned me

869
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,980
a special mission today.

870
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,510
He asked me to come to the pier.

871
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,340
What mission?

872
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,530
A secret mission.

873
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,160
He told me not to tell anyone.

874
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,710
A special

875
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,450
secret mission?

876
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,300
Yes.

877
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,250
Do you really take me as a fool?

878
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:55,910
No.

879
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,740
Take him away.

880
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,700
Sis!

881
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,690
Look over there!

882
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,480
My hat...

883
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,090
Isn't that Shaobai?

884
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,350
Hurry. Let's go.

885
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,790
I'm not leaving.
