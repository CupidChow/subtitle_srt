00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,229
Director,

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,250
I went back to Hongda Trading Company again

5
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,310
and found these paintings on the walls and in the rooms.

6
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,630
I suspect that the artist of these paintings is Shrike.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,110
This gives us a new perspective.

8
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,950
I asked a professor at the school,

9
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,430
and he said these paintings

10
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,310
all belong to the same school.

11
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,220
Wang Liqun is a rough man,

12
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,790
and it's hard to imagine he would appreciate such things,

13
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,990
let alone put them in a trading company.

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,890
The professor also mentioned that

15
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,790
every artist

16
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,430
has their own unique brushwork,

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,949
just like our handwriting

18
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,030
is different.

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,430
I've studied them for several days

20
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,710
and even sent them to the school laboratory for analysis.

21
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,350
I found that the color ratios in these paintings

22
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,670
are almost identical.

23
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,190
This indicates that the painter

24
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,810
is someone very meticulous.

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,510
Director, you previously said

26
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,710
that Shrike is just that kind of person.

27
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,500
Yes.

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,390
Director, the cryptography expert has arrived.

29

Have all the traces from the propaganda posters been erased?

30
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,360
I was a step too late.

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,990
They've brought someone over to study them.

32

43
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,310
didn't you say

44
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,579
we shouldn't take photos

45
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,110
to avoid leaving evidence?

46
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,400
This is for identification purposes.

I haven't really achieved anything significant yet.

Even Commander Liu from the Anti-Communist Salvation Army

61
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,030
hasn't been very cooperative with me.

62
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,190
Not cooperating is because the money hasn't arrived.

She said it's time

569
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,910
to let the Anti-Communist Salvation Army move.

570
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,640

571

I told her

587
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,990
to wait for two days.

603
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,580

604
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,330

608

We'll get to the bottom of this.

611
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,270
He reported it quite resolutely.

612

He reported it without hesitation.

615
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,730
Is he not afraid it'll implicate his wife?

616
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,900
That's not a normal reaction.

If one plan doesn't work, we'll try another.

Thanks for your goodwill,

640

but Shrike doesn't need your rescue.

641
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,940
He has his own arrangements.

642
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,470
Don't underestimate the Communists.

643

Once Shrike leaves Shanghai,

he'll never be able to come back.

645

the Communists will conclude that the boss is Shrike.

Liu Guiheng will definitely take advantage of the situation.

665
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,960
At that time, you must control him

666
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,000
and not let him act recklessly.

The Director's intention

669

is to rescue Shrike at all costs.

The road to Beijing during his transfer

671
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,810
is the only

672
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,410
and best opportunity.

673
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,260
Shrike just asked me

674
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,680
to make a fuss outside.

675
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,610
He didn't ask me to save him.

676
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,310
If the rescue fails,

677
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,390
it will ruin Shrike's major plans.

678
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,940
Have you thought about it?

we who are hiding in Shanghai

681
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,820
might all be taken out.

00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,870
You don't understand Shrike.

683
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,570
Maybe you would defect,

684
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,700
but he won't.

685
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,120
He wouldn't even if it meant death.

686
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,450

everything meticulously before he was caught,

690
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,380
can he anticipate

691
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,340
being transferred to Beijing?

692
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,410

693
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,140
and our actions must also change accordingly.

694
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,310
Perhaps

695
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,800
the message he most wants to convey right now

696
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,350
is for you

697
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,600
to rescue him.

listen to my advice.

701
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,720
Right now, the only person Shrike can rely on is you.

702
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,340
I know Shrike has saved your life before.

703
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,360
You ignore him now.

704
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,860

706
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,050

00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,900
Aren't you the guy selling ballpoint pens?

754
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,300
Yeah, what a coincidence!

755
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,380
I didn't expect to run into you here.

756
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,840
It is quite a coincidence.

757
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,160
Where are you off to?

758
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,710
I...

759
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,790
I'm out of cigarettes,

760
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,950
I came to buy a pack.

761
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,190
Come to the shop for tea sometime.

762
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,690
More people mean more business.

763
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,310
Alright then.

764
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,020
I'm off.

765
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,160
Take care.

766
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
I'll definitely visit when I have time.

767
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,280
Sir, do you still want it?

768
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,420
[He's Restaurant]

769
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,110
Coming to see me like this

770
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,230
is too dangerous.

771
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,500
It's urgent.

772
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,120
Shrike has been arrested.

773
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,350
Liu Guiheng is inciting Yang Hui

774
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,570
to go save Shrike with him.

775
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,300
This will put Shrike in danger.

776
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,700
I need you to stop them at all costs.

777
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,230
A few days ago, Shrike came to me

778
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,080
and told me to follow your arrangements.

779
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,230
Was it because of this?

780
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,740
Right.

781
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,650
You'd better act immediately.

782
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,630
Once it's done,

783
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,030
I don't want to remain a nameless pawn.

784
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,950
What do you mean?

785
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,650
You should know,

786
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,350
in the organization,

787
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,270
the higher the rank, the more funding you get.

788
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,730
I need to save money for my wife and kids.

789
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,110
Of course,

790
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,910
higher rank

791
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,610
also means

792
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,430
having subordinates to command,

793
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,200
increasing your chances of survival.

794
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,060
What are you really trying to say?

795
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,800
I want to be the captain of the action team,

796
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,100
the new Falcon.

797
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,870
You know how to negotiate terms now.

798
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,350
Xu Wei,

799
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,110
since Shrike brought you back from Zhoushan,

800
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,170
he's been planning to cultivate you.

801
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,950
After seeing you last time,

802
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,920
he mentioned that

803
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,590
as long as you pass this test,

804
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,900
the action team captain position would be yours,

805
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,160
with the rank of Major.

806
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,720
If I reach the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.,

807
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,330
I hope the party will approve

808
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,240
to let my wife go to Taiwan first.

809
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,970
That's fine.

810
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,330
But

811
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,150
the food

812
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,460
is to be had one bite at a time,

813
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:00,910
and the road

814
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,970
is to be walked one step at a time.
