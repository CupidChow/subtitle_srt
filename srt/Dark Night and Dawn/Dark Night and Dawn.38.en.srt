I thought we were on the different paths

238
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,090
because you followed Lu Zhengyang

239
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,750

240
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,190

His name is Xu Keji.

247
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,180
I decided on his name because first, I hope he can be safe and healthy

248
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,510
and second, I don't want him to go too fast.
