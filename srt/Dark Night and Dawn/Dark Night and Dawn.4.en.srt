00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,650
Beanpole, right?

4
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,020
Where is Luo San?

5
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,270
What Luo San?

6
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,670
Who is Beanpole?

7
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,690
You're so silly.

8
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,080
You wanted to catch me?

9
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,740
I'm called Mr. Shanghai Know-all.

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,180
Auntie.

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,900
Mom.

12
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,660
Shaobai.

13
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,750
You are finally back.

14
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,900
Let me take a good look at you.

15
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,930
Are you hurt?

16
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,030
Are you okay?

17
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,200
I'm fine.

18
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,550
Shouldn't you be on the boat?

19
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,510
Why are you back?

20
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,350
If you don't go with us, we won't go anywhere.

21
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,030
Alright.

22
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,070
It's good that Shaobai is back.

23
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,180
Pack your things.

24
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,550
I've booked boat tickets from ticket scalpers.

25
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,410
Let's hurry...

26
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,340
Why are you here?

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,180
I'm waiting for you at your home.

28
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,130
Any problem?

29
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,870
Mr. Lu.

30
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,740
Shaobai always talks like this.

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,520
Hope you don't mind it.

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Of course not.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,230
Shaobai.

34
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,310
Have a seat.

35
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,640
Mr. Lu

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,079
is an official of the new government.

37
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,550
He came last time

38
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,880
to tell us you were safe.

39
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,310
You had a long trip.

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,900
Here.

41
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,900
Have some tea and relax.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,640
Why do you come to my house every day?

43
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,420
This is my house.

44
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,740
You have no right to pour me a cup of tea.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,810
Sit down.

46
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,510
He came with goodwill.

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,940
He's here to tell us

48
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,080
you're carrying out a mission for the new government.

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,550
When you finish and the investigation is over,

50
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,950
everything will be fine.

51
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,030
If Mr. Lu hadn't come,

52
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,090
your auntie and I would have gone mad.

53
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,590
The person I met just now

54
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,920
is not called Beanpole.

55
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,560
Drink the tea.

56
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,880
Let's continue to look for Luo San.

57
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,750
There's no hurry. He can't have gone far.

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,620
I want to know

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,329
when you will send Liuyi back.

60
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,380
Liuyi is not missing?

61
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,700
Big. Big.

62
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,190
The Haolaiwu Club

63
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,770
used to be quite popular.

64
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,570
Luo San is a heavy gambler.

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,320
He used to come here very often.

66
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,870
If he really took part

67
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,110
in the vault robbery,

68
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,500
he would definitely

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,780
come and gamble with the money he robbed.

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,710
Okay.

71
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,070
Sir, wish you good luck.

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,630
Okay.

73
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,430
Open.

74
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,220
Mr. Lin, you are here.

75
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,740
Oh, you two are on the shift today.

76
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,740
I need to talk to Mr. Gu.

77
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,360
Okay.

78
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,490
Mr. Gu.

79
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,610
Mr. Lin.

80
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,440
Are you still working for the police station?

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
Well.

82
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,860
It's now called the Public Security Bureau.

83
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,640
The People's Public Security Bureau. Have you ever heard of it?

84
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,350
Yes.

85
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,710
They insisted on me being their director.

86
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,270
So you got a nice promotion.

87
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,120
What promotion?

88
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,300
I'll be their director for the time being.

89
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,430
He is?

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
He is my new sidekick.

91
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,310
He's called Lu.

92
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,940
Say hello to Mr. Gu.

93
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,440
Hello, Mr. Gu.

94
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,710
Hello.

95
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,380
Come on.

96
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,190
Have a seat.

97
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,770
Mr. Lin.

98
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,030
I'm counting on you

99
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,590
to help me in the future.

100
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,580
Let's help each other.

101
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,630
I can see that your business is doing very well.

102
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,980
Mr. Gu, you're making a fortune.

103
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,710
What fortune?

104
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,950
Shanghai is now controlled by the Communist Party.

105
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,510
My old connections

106
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,050
are almost gone.

107
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,790
As long as I can earn money for food,

108
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,110
I'd be very grateful.

109
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,590
To be honest,

110
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,870
I'm refraining from taking any action.

111
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,950
My subordinates

112
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,060
want to go to the Military Control Commission

113
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,380
and blow it up.

114
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,590
Blow up the Military Control Commission?

115
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,360
Really?

116
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,310
Of course.

117
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,470
I quit smoking long ago.

118
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,890
Mr. Gu, you’re awesome.

119
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:41,990
But before you let them blow it up,

120
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,420
let me know when you'll do it first.

121
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,130
Don't get me killed.

122
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,330
That's for sure.

123
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,530
Lu.

124
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,040
Light the cigarette for Mr. Gu.

125
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,470
Okay.

126
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,520
That's good.

127
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,990
On an occasion like this, you should learn to be considerate.

128
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,920
Yes.

129
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,120
You work for Mr. Lin.

130
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,000
You need to learn to be observant.

131
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,220
He's not smart enough.

132
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,580
I'll have to teach him slowly.

133
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,930
How come Luo San wasn't down there just now?

134
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,960
Has he quit gambling?

135
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,620
Luo San quit gambling?

136
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,080
That's impossible.

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,970
He came yesterday.

138
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,550
And he was drunk at that time.

139
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,240
To my surprise,

140
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,560
he had two gold bars on him.

141
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,909
He must have robbed another household.

142
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,090
He's so stupid.

143
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,350
No matter how much money he stole,

144
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,030
in the end, he would lose everything

145
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,320
to your casino.

146
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,670
Mr. Lin, you're right.

147
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,110
When the casino was about to close yesterday,

148
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,700
he still owed me a lot.

149
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
He wrote me an IOU,

150
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,930
saying he would pay me back in two days.

151
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,270
It's useless. Can you believe him?

152
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,230
If he runs away,

153
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,470
you don't even know where to find him.

154
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,130
Don't worry. I've let someone keep an eye on him.

155
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,270
It's strange that he didn't go home last night.

156
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,230
Instead, he stayed in a hotel.

157
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,260
Which hotel?

158
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,790
Who do you think you are?

159
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,680
Which hotel? Mr. Gu.

160
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,770
Go.

161
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,310
Ask the receptionist to call the police.

162
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,710
Okay.

163
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,890
It's him.

164
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,310
He is Luo San.

165
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,720
[Ear Prints Collected from the Jinsheng Bank Case]

166
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,840
The ear prints match.

167
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,400
He opened the vault.

168
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,340
I told you it was him.

169
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,610
That was just your guess.

170
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,040
The evidence is what matters.

171
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,230
Now Luo San is dead.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,100
We've lost a clue.

173
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,870
Then we'll find more clues.

174
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,580
How about this?

175
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,230
I'll take you to a friend of mine tomorrow.

176
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,030
She used to work as a part-time forensic expert

177
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,290
in the police station.

178
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,580
With her help,

179
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,080
we can find more information from the dead body.

180
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,880
I know who you're talking about.

181
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,929
Last time, you said there was a person who wanted to see me.

182
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,130
It was her, right?

183
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,320
Alright.

184
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Let's get out.

185
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,230
Did you say bad things about me to her?

186
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,300
Director Lu.

187
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,860
He came so fast.

188
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,270
With his ability,

189
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,920
he will find the place soon.

190
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,880
Let Falcon prepare a gift

what actions we would take.

Have you washed your hands?

461
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,900
Since there are signs of smelting the gold bars at the iron factory,

462
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,610
it means

463
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,730
they are in a hurry to sell the gold bars.

464
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,030
The most possible explanation

465
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,080
is that they need funds for their agent activities.

466
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,140
But to ensure the circulation of the gold bars,

467
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,830
they have to exchange the gold bars for silver dollars.

468
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,140
All banks have been taken over by the government.

469
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,840
If they want to exchange them in the bank,

470
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,180
they will be caught.

471
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,790
Lin Shaobai.

472
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,720
Are there any other places

473
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,830
where a large number of silver dollars are in circulation

474
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,690
and

475
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,700
can be used to trade with agents?

476
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,390
When Kuomintang issued the gold yuan notes,

477
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
they confiscated

478
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,010
all the gold and silver owned by normal people.

479
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,650
Now one can only

480
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,070
exchange gold bars

481
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,600
for a large amount of silver

482
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,230
in those old-style banks.

483
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,890
Before the Liberation,

484
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,860

485
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,080
Those old-style banks are nothing but abandoned houses.

486
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,610
There're also underground old-style banks.

487
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,800

489
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,730
which seems to be a casino,

490
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,400
but is actually the biggest underground old-style bank.

491
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,990
You met Mr. Gu.

492
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,640
He only cares about money, not people.

493
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640

We'll make him confess.

497
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,330
We can't do that.

498
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,580
Without the evidence,

499
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,110
we might alert the enemies.

500
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,420
Let's go.

501
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,880

502
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,320
Well.

503
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,670
Don't you prefer to make me confined?

504
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,450
The investigation about me isn't over yet.

505
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,360
It's inappropriate for me to be involved.

506
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,160
You're right.

508
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,070

But

512
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,400
he already took me as the director last time.

513
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,560
If we go there again,

514
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,620
you'll have to pretend to be my sidekick again.

515
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,260
When did you become the director?

516
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,330
Stop bragging.

517
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,770

Can we win their money?

534
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,130
We were

535
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,220
nice enough to them last time.

536

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,690
Then they'll get lost.

540
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,690
You lost everything.

541
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,270
Borrow some from the casino staff.

542
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,530
I'll win my money back.

543
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,680
Big.

544
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,750
Take off your shoes.

545
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,890
Come on.

546
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,620
Are you out of your mind, Lu?

547
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,430
I'm helping you handle a case.

548
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,910
Are you going to give my shoes to someone who you'll borrow money from?

549
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,810
Listen.

550
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,510
My shoes are custom-made.

551
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,110
I only wear them twice a year.

552
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,010
You can't pawn them.

553
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,550
Take them off now.

554
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Then we'll have money for more bets.

555
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,900
I won't take them off.

556
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,430
They're custom-made Lantang shoes.

557
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,390
They're worth at least ten silver dollars on the market.

558
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,850
I'll exchange them for five silver dollars.

559
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,220
Okay.

560
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,390
Thank you.

561
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,860
Let me try this time.

562
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,840
Excuse me.

563
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,790
-Is pai gow okay?
-Yes.

564
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,790
Are you kidding me?

565
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,660
I've changed my shoes.

566
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,520
I'll go home barefoot if you lose.

567
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,620
Deal.

568
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,290
Everyone.

569
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,860
Show your cards.

570
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,070
Tian Nine.

571
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,870
Let's go. Let's go.

572
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,500
Congratulations, sir.

573
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,660
Open! Open! Open!

574
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,530
Open! Open! Open!

575
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,140
Open! Open! Open!

576
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,720
Open! Open! Open!

577
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,830
We won.

578
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,990
Pay up!

579
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,350
Mr. Lin, may I have a word with you?

580
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,920
What?

581
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,820
I'm busy.

582
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,710
Mr. Lin.

583
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,770
What are you doing?

584
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,470
Lu, you continue to play.

585
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,150
Lu, don't stop.

586
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,700
Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin.

587
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:00,750
Well.

588
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,990
What's wrong?

589
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,590
Mr. Li.

590
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,890
Mr. Lin, let’s call it a day.

591
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,950
You've already won over 6,000 silver dollars.

592
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,450
We cannot afford any more losses.

593
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,050
What? Are you asking us to leave now?

594
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,740
Come on.

595
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,530
This is a big casino.

596
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,990
You only allow us to lose money to you and don't want us to win?

597
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,600
Mr. Lin, I'm begging you.

598
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,340
I don't care.

599
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,030
I only support the right side. I'm never biased.

600
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,240
Attention, everyone.

601
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,940
Then Haolaiwu Club only wants us to lose money.

602
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,340
They don't want us to win.

603
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,390
This is so unacceptable.

604
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,350
Then who dares to play here?

605
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,310
Right.

606
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,500
Don’t worry. We have money.

607
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,020
If you have money, then pay me up.

608
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,780
Only 6,000 silver dollars.

609
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,090
Don't make a scene here.

610
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,270
Now,

611
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,050
the money is here.

612
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,850
Please enjoy yourselves.

613
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,160
You made such a big scene.

614
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,930
I knew it was you, Mr. Lin.

615
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,560
Mr. Gu.

616
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,240
Teach your men well.

617
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,910
I'm sorry.

618
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,980
Now the money is in place.

619
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,480
Have fun.

620
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,330
Thank you.

621
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,370
Are these two boxes of money enough?

622
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,770
How could you say that?

623
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,060
Are you suggesting Mr. Gu gave us counterfeit notes?

624
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,190
That's impossible.

625
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,920
You're right.

626
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,670
These are fake.

627
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,930
Nonsense!

628
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,170
Let everybody take a look.

629
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,550
Tell them not to take them away.

630
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,070
Stop!

631
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,670
Stop!

632
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,510
Stop!

633
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,340
Stop him!

634
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,400
Stop him!

635
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,360
Stop!

636
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,360
Stop him!

637
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,280
Pick them up!

638
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,690
Pick them up!

639
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,510
Stop him!

640
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,600
Stop him! Stop him!

641
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,520
He's over there!

642
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,670
Catch him!

643
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,640
Don't let them escape.

644
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,840
Don't move! Stay still!

645
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,550
You're here to make trouble, aren't you?

646
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,050
I don't care who you are.

647
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,960
You government officials should be reasonable.

648
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,160
Where is Lin Shaobai?

649
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,610
He must give me a reasonable explanation today.

650
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,450
Mr. Gu, you want to see me?

651
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,370
Let's have a good chat.

652
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:13,910
You...

653
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,090
[Kill and Win]

654
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,230
[Kill and Win]

655
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,880
Mr. Lin, why did you do that?

656
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,360
Don’t be nervous, Mr. Gu.

657
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,910
We come to ask questions regularly.

658
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,220
[Kill and Win]

659
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,780
This is how you ask questions?

660
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,080
There are no stamps on these gold bars.

661
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,790
And they were roughly made.

662
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,010
Obviously,

663
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,820
they were smelted illegally.

664
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,590
The gamblers lost them to the house.

665
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,310
Only gamblers know their origins.

666
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,020
Then please refer to your ledger

667
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,120
and see which gambler left them here, what their background is,

668
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
how come they gambled with gold bars

669
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,260
how many times they came to gamble here,

670
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,390
and how much he lost.

671
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,790
What information

672
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,890
are you trying to get today?

673
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,370
Mr. Gu.

674
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,440
The vault of Jinsheng Bank got robbed.

675
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,690
We found out that the agents did it.

676
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,650
And they have melted

677
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,120
all the gold bars.

678
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,770
Mr. Gu.

679
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,510
Are you helping the agents

680
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,679
exchange the gold bars?

681
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,949
You suspect me?

682
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,610
Where is the evidence?

683
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,650
[Kill and Win]

684
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,080
If you can’t tell

685
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,840
the origins of these gold bars,

686
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:30,020
we'll have to take you back for investigation.

687
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,880
Believe it or not, you can’t even get out of this room

688
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:35,670
if I just make a sound here.

689
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,300
Mr. Gu, just do it.

690
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,260
If you do,

691
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,409
we'll have a good reason to arrest you.

692
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,690
Lu.

693
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,969
There’s no need for you to talk like this.

694
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,429
Mr. Gu.

695
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,590
Let’s go inside.

696
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,910
Come on.

697
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,360
Let’s go.

698
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,170
Mr. Gu.

699
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,710
He used to fight on the front.

700
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,490
He survived the dangers on the battlefield.

701
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,450
If I hadn't stopped him,

702
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,940
he would have found an excuse

703
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,990
to confiscate your casino.

704
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,240
Mr. Lin.

705
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,820
You should

706
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,950
have told me everything about him

707
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,070
earlier.

708
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,130
Judging from his tone,

709
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,480
he's the director

710
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,710
and you're his sidekick, right?

711
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,910
I can only tell you

712
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,150
you did a right thing not to attack him.

713
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,150
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have died.

714
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,340
Mr. Gu, you’re the biggest suspect.

715
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,360
They’re being polite to you now.

716
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,270
Understand?

717
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,420
If you don't admit it,

718
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,700
they have many ways to force you to admit it.

719
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,290
They will?

720
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,290
They can say you have something

721
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,950
to do with the case.

722
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,930
They can also say

723
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,640
you don't.

724
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,260
Mr. Gu, you’re smart.

725
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,900
You should know what to do.

726
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,730
If you confess now,

727
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,680
you're earning yourself a reward.

728
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,270
If you can help them

729
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,930
catch those agents,

730
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,690
I'll intercede for you.

731
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,940
Then you'll be fine.

732
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,670
Here.

733
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,410
Mr. Lu.

734
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,430
Mr. Lu.

735
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,630
I'm sorry.

736
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,930
[Kill and Win]

737
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,530
I was out of my mind just now.

738
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,840
I didn't understand what you meant.

739
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,000
I promise you.

740
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,370
From now on,

741
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,950
I'll fully cooperate.

742
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,500
What did you just say to him?

743
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,360
How come Mr. Gu confessed so soon?

744
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,500
I made a deal with him.

745
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,830
Lu, you must have come here a lot.

746
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,760
If you teach me how to play pai gow so well,

747
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,020
I will...

748
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,770
You won't be able to learn it well even if I teach you.

749
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,230
You haven't taught me yet. How do you know I can't learn it well?

750
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,100
You won't teach me?

751
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,270
I wonder

752
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:15,000
what your leader will think of you if they know what you did tonight.

753
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,100
Before the Liberation, I was in Shanghai

754
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,560
performing secret tasks.

755
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,600
There was a period

756
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,220
when I worked as a casino clerk.

757
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,250
You were everywhere.

758
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,660
Fine, good for you.

759
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,320
Apart from pai gow,

760
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,320
do you also play mahjong?

761
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,190
I bet you're also good

762
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,490
at playing the dice.

763
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,130
I know

764
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,200
you have discipline to keep.

765
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,360
You need to have a good image.

766
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,950
But I don't.

767
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,780
Think about it.

768
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,120
If you teach me these, I'll win money.

769
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,870
We can share the money together.

770
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,470
Then we'll be rich together.

771
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,470
Come on.

772
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,580
Director Lu.

773
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,660
Don’t pull a long face all the time.

774
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,990
Didn’t Mr. Gu confess everything just now?

775
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,250
You just need to go arrest them tomorrow.

776
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,460
I've made a plan for you.

777
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,000
You go there early

778
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,260
to check the circumstances around Xianshi Mall

779
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,440
and lay an ambush there in advance.

780
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,860
Then you'll arrest them as soon as they arrive.

781
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,910
Good idea.

782
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,300
But you can't participate in the operation tomorrow.

783
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,470
What do you mean?

784
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,810
You said it yourself.

785
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,510
You're not one of us yet.

786
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,460
You're not suitable for it.

787
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,260
Well.

788
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,770
A few days ago,

789
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,830
a mysterious guy brought a man here.

790
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,180
He said he had a batch of gold bars and wanted to exchange them for silver dollars.

791
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,260
That man

792
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,130
told me

793
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,670
he had just brought the first batch.

794
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,340
They said they had more gold bars.

795
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,390
We agreed to meet at the cafe on the first floor

796
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,280
of the Xianshi Mall at 6 p.m. tomorrow.

797
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,490
How will you exchange the money?

798
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,060
We agreed

799
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,040
that both of us would drive a Buick there

800
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,640
in which the gold bars or the silver dollars would be put.

801
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,590
By then,

802
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,750
we'll switch our keys and drive the car back separately.

803
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,350
Bye.

804
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,230
Take care.

805
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,600
Mr. Gu.

806
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,250
Have you brought the silver dollars?

807
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,770
They're all ready.

808
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,270
The car key.

809
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,500
I need to check your goods.

810
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,830
This is not the first time we've done this.

811
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,770
Yes, I didn't check goods in the past.

812
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,330
But the amount is huge this time.

813
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,830
I'll always be here.

814
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,260
But if there's something wrong with your goods,

815
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,000
where can I find you?

816
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,530
All right.

817
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,720
Follow me.

818
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,430
You can

819
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,530
check my silver dollars.

820
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,610
Mr. Gu, if you dare to say a word about our deal,

821
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,290
I’ll kill your whole family.

822
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,030
[Closed]

823
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,380
You're under arrest.

824
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,000
Murder!

825
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,370
Murder!

826
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,780
[Xianshi Mall]

827
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,390
Run!

828
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,630
[Xianshi Mall]

829
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,370
[Xianshi Mall]

830
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,010
Murder! Run!

831
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,230
Fusheng died.

832
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,370
Their clues will be gone.

833
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,350
Don't worry. They won't know it's me.

834
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,810
But we didn't take back

835
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,130
the gold bars and silver dollars.

836
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,480
I didn’t expect them

837
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,960
to manage to make Mr. Gu confess so soon.

838
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,320
Lu Zhengyang

839
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,290
was hiding in the car.

840
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,800
I was careless.

841
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,240
Have you got in touch with the Anti-Communist Salvation Army?

842
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,980
We are already in contact

843
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,840
with the Anti-Communist Salvation Army.

844
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,700
They are Kuomintang soldiers left in the mainland.

845
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,260
They all killed people.

846
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,390
And they hate the Communist Party very much.

847
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,460
The Communist Party

848
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,270
has been searching for them.

849
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,730
So they've been hiding.

850
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,930
Their leader Captain Liu said

851
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,390
as long as we are willing to provide them with funding,

852
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,850
and help them get revenge,

853
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,160
they are willing to work with us.

854
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,710
Very well.

855
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,800
I'll leave that team to you.

856
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,140
Mobilize and train them as soon as possible.

857
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,160
Make good use of them.

858
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,840
Boss. You know me.

859
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,430
I will definitely do my best.
