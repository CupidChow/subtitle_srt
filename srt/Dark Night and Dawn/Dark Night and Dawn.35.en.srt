He was originally going to make braised carp,

That's why he asked Younger Grandma to teach him how to make carp soup instead.

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm just here to cooperate with Shrike's work.

376
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,020
I'll do whatever he says,

377
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,220
and I'll do it well.

378
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,910
But...

379
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,990
both of you also need to...

380
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,490
think for yourselves, right?

381
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,870
Li Xu.

382
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,920
Your mother must be getting on in years, right?

383
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,580
You have a wife and a child too.

384
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,350
We all used to work together at the police station.

385
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,510
We were colleagues.

386
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,310
And I was your superior.

387
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,780
I took good care of you, right?

388
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,590
Now, at this critical moment,

389
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,730
you two

390
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,790
need to leave yourselves a way out.

391
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,390
Alright, enough chit-chat.

392
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,300
I think Shrike

393
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,030
has really overestimated him.

394
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,190
Shrike.

395
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,240
Let me out! I beg you!

396
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,270
Spare me, please!

397
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,210
Spare me, please! Please!

398
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,160
Spare me, please!

399
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,630
Chief!

400
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,970
Chief!

401
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,670
Help me!

402
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,200
You know him well.

403
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,829
So, no need for such a big reaction.

404
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,180
Meng Heng...

405
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,990
What happened to him?

406
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,490
He's developed an interest in Ogura's research.

407
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,010
Since he is your man,

408
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,310
I have to satisfy his curiosity.

409
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,700
He’s currently cooperating with us in human trials.

410
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,590
Shrike,

411
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,640
I didn't know anything

412
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,530
about what he's done.

413
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,490
Please don't misunderstand me.

414
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,710
On the way here,

415
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,470
I've already explained everything

416
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,150
to Falcon.

417
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,190
I know you.

418
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,550
You're not that cunning.

419
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,350
It was Mr. Mao who sent him here to keep an eye on you,

420
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,710
monitor me,

421
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,510
and report back at the slightest slip-up.

422
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,750
Isn't that right?

423
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,910
Mao Sen.

424
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,670
I've worked for him for years.

425
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,220
I know him too well.

426
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,430
He's sly, deceitful, and always plays both sides.

427
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,200
He trusts no one.

428
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,390
This is just his way of doing things.

429
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,030
Just like when I was the Chief,

430
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,070
he sent you here

431
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,190
to keep an eye

432
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,350
on me.

433
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,240
You're spot on.

434
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,630
In the NBIS,

435
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,110
everyone monitors each other.

436
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,190
It's an old habit.

437
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,670
Shrike,

438
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,030
Meng Heng...

439
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,450
he deserves to die.

440
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,470
Tonight, I'll pretend that I didn't see him.

441
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,870
I know you're saving me.

442
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,910
I can tell you

443
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,310
that Dr. Ogura's research on the new anthrax strain

444
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,160
has been going on for years,

445
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,910
and now it's at the human trial stage.

446
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,940
Once inhaled,

447
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,430
it will take 12

448
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,070
to 48 hours

449
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,590
to manifest.

450
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,430
Without medical intervention,

451
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,630
the mortality rate is over 90%.

452
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,680
Isn't it wonderful?

453
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,890
Soon it'll go into mass production.

454
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,270
It requires funding.

455
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,070
As the Chief,

456
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,770
shouldn't you apply for support from the NBIS?

457
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes, absolutely.

458
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,470
You have to support it.

459
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,510
I promise

460
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,770
I'll cooperate fully.

461
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,750
It's meaningless for you

462
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,110
to cover your nose and mouth so hard.

[Factory Hiring; Excellent Benefits]

464
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,430
Hasn't Ogura already done tests

465
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,830
on Meng Heng?

466
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,390
Why do we still need more people?

467
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,230
That's nowhere near enough.

468
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,370
We need more,

469
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,320
and we can't let the police find out.

470
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,870
When recruiting,

471
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,820
we must ask about their family.

472
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,070
We need those without parents, a wife, or kids.

473
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,130
It's best if they're from out of town.

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,530
The Chief has already instructed us about it.

475
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,860
If these kinds of people die, no one will miss them.

476
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,270
What's the point of these people living anyway?

477
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,510
Sending them for experiments

478
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,510
is to release them. It's good karma.

479
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,980
I don't believe in all that good karma.

480
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,540
I think in our line of work,

481
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,670
we should just enjoy life while we can.

and a plate of pork intestines.

Okay.

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Today, it's on me.

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,830
Yeah.

Of course not.

and he suggested I go to Chinatown.

and Zheng Lanting.

751
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,620
Arrange for Lin Shaobai to return to the bureau

752
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,750
for interrogation.

753
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,100
Mr. Yang,

754
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,940
should we

755
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,150
reconsider it?

756
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,850
Since he is a police officer,

757
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,340
it's his duty to be scrutinized.

758
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,310
We've been working together for a long time.

759
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,640
I know Lin Shaobai well.

760
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,230
There's no way he could be an agent.

761
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,230
I don't believe it

762
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,390
if someone claims he is an agent.

763
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,070
Of course.

764
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,930
I don't believe it either.

765
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,760
I understand how you feel.

you've been part of the revolution for a long time,

768
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,350
and I've been in it even longer.

769
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,550
We both know very well

770
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,510
that the enemy has never stopped trying

771
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,790
to infiltrate us.

772
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,590
Just look at Du Lengquan.

773
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,990
He's a living example.

774
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,070
I know.

775
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,420
It's likely a ploy of the enemy.

776
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,870
But discipline

777
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,320
is more reliable

778
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,220
than personal feelings.

779
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,590
Discipline is indeed important.

780
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,020
But the enemy deliberately chose this moment to accuse him,

781
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,670
which means they must have an agenda.

782
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,680

904

is also a way for the organization to protect you.

906

00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,420
Go!

937
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,500
Sir, do you really have ten gold bars?

938
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,950
The vault is full of gold bars!

939
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,030
Now, get moving!

940
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,610
Go! Go!

941
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,520
Hurry!

942
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,670
Wei, what should we do?

943
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,870
Put it on.

944
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,300
Well...

945
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,520
Why so much nonsense?

946
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,990
You handle the support.

947
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,940
Hold your ground. Don't let them come in!

948
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,870
Don't move!

949
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,590
Don't shoot!

950
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,390
I'm one of us.

951
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,470
We've suffered heavy losses downstairs.

952
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,530
Go back them up now!

953
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,330
Who sent you here?

954
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,850
Zhengyang,

955
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,110
I'm sorry.

[Enhance Medication Safety]

957
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,850
Xu Wei did it.

958
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,440
It's all my fault.

959
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,380
Looks like the enemy agents

960
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,440
have come out in full force this time.

961
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,990
They deliberately pulled your people away first

962
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,530
so Xu Wei could sneak in and silence the man.

963
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,930
They have no bottom line and no humanity.

964
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,840
The person died under my watch.

965
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,640
I'll take full responsibility.

966
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Please punish me.

967
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,710
Let's talk about the punishment later.

968
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,220
Have the captured agents confessed yet?

969
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,900
Yes.

970
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
The man infected with anthrax

971
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,670
was named Meng Heng.

972
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,010
They are all Liu Guiheng's men.

973
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,040
But none of them know

974
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,810
exactly where Liu Guiheng is.

975
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,030
So, after all this talk,

976
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,230
where is Lin Shaobai?

977
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,430
Lin Shaobai

978
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,730
should be out looking for Liu Guiheng,

979
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,260
but he hasn't come back yet.

980
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,970
He's still outside?

981
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,150
No.

982
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,600
It's too dangerous.

983
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,090
Get someone to bring him back immediately.

984
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,230
And tell him

985
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,210
the accusation about him

986
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,910
will be cleared up eventually.

987
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,520
Yes.
