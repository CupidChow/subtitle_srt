[Episode 19]

3
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,280
His current name is Tong Susu.

4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,979
He studies at St. Fang Ji Junior High School.

5
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,229
He plays the piano very well.

6
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,390
His mother is a musician,

7
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,539
and his father is a university professor.

8
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,140
As his birth mother,

9
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,070
you went through a lot of trouble

10
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,700
to find him a good family.

11
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,550
A family that you could never provide him with.

12
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,259
To be honest,

13
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,720
we just met him.

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,850
When we arrived at St. Fang Ji Junior High School,

15
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,960
the teacher told us

16
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,310
Falcon had just been there.

17
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,680
He also got your child's address

18
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,550
as a police officer.

19
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,500
Liar.

20
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,110
If I really had such a child

21
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,000
and Falcon got to know about this,

22
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,670
Shrike could used this to threaten me.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,660
The Hook Sword Gang is still useful to him.

24
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,520
He doesn't have to kill me, right?

25
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,150
There is only one possibility then.

26
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,670
Falcon hid this information from Shrike.

27
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,390
Tell me.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,500
Why would he do that?

29
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,050
Falcon is a good friend of mine.

30
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,950
He may have felt compassion for a moment.

31
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,300
Because he's also going to be a father himself very soon.

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,140
His wife and child are both in Shrike's hands.

33
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,970
But there's another possibility.

34
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,520
Maybe he wanted to use this information

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,120
to negotiate with you or Shrike for some new conditions.

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,300
None of us can say for sure

37
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,020
whether and when he will

38
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,830
tell Shrike about this.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,220
If anyone dares to touch my child,

40
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,220
I won't let him go even if I go to hell.

41
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,750
We will only protect your child.

42
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,570
But only by catching Shrike

43
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,250
can you and your child be truly safe.

44
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,730
Dai Yueqing.

45
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,090
Where exactly is

46
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,850
the Counterfeit Money Factory located?

47
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,560
Dock 46,

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,570
Xingfu Li,

49
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,360
Putuo District.

50
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,910
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,890
Did my child already know

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,200
his mother is a villain?

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,410
We didn't disturb him

54
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,450
or tell him any information about you.

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,130
He knows he was adopted.

56
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,130
But in the story told by his adoptive parents,

57
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,300
his birth mother

58
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,870
is a perfect person,

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,490
a female battlefield surgeon

60
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,110
who died on the anti-Japanese front.

61
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,340
Dai Yueqing.

62
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,840
I hope you can really cooperate

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,659
and atone for your crimes.

64
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,380
Maybe you can meet Tong Susu

65
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,370
openly some day

66
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,190
and don't have to be on the run anymore.

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,490
Dai Yueqing really took it to heart.

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,440
It seems we should do something to goad her.

69
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,350
As soon as she heard that Xu Wei went to see Tong Susu,

70
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,010
she got anxious immediately.

71
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,350
Only you

72
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,900
could make up these to frighten her.

73
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,800
Just tell me whether it worked or not.

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,680
Don't show off your cleverness.

75
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,160
Xiang called.

76
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,090
After Zheng Lanting made that home visit, she went back to the studio.

77
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,990
Nothing unusual happened.

78
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,590
Tell Xiang to keep watching him.

79
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,140
Notify everyone to assemble urgently and get ready for action.

80
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,820
Yes.

81
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,540
If this goes well,

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,940
I'll make a fortune.

83
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,590
It's here, right?

84
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,640
Yes, No. 46.

85
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,590
It's here.

86
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,120
Open the door.

87
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,030
-Is anyone there?
-Open the door.

88
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,590
Is...

89
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980

One box of Penicillin.

93
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,160
This is the bill of lading.

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,410
Please come in.

95
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,710
Let's go.

96
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,120
We're about to make a fortune.

97
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,840
Where is the bill of lading?

98
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,170
The bill!

99
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,159
[Pickup address: Dock 46, Xingfu Li, Putuo District]

100
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,710
It's indeed a bill of lading of this warehouse.

101
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,360
You are from the Hook Sword Gang?

102
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,150
If there's no problem with the bill,

103
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,770
just give us the stuff.

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,230
Sir, please spare us.

105
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,230
Please spare my life.

106

I...

107
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,630
I don't want the goods anymore.

108
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,920
Please let me go, Boss.

109
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,230
It depends on whether you tell the truth or not.

110
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,640
We will. We will.

111
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,100
Where did you get this bill of lading?

112
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
What does the owner of it look like? Tell me.

113
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,880
I... I stole it.

114
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,030
The owner is a middle-aged man in his 50s.

115
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,650
He's thin and looks quite gentle.

116
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,980
Thank you for making a run here.

117
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,150
Boss.

118
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,550
Is there something

119
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,810
to this bill of lading?

120
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,990
Shrike usually prepares a few spare bills of lading

121
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,520
so that he has a proper reason

122
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,450
when he has to come to this warehouse.

123
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,760
This time, he didn't come by himself,

124
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,500
but he tried to pass it in through the hands of the thieves.

125
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,630
There must be some compelling reason.

126
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,880
He's warning us.

Let's go!

136
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,210
Check the injured first.

137
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,470
There's an ambush.

Where are they?

143
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,810
I've contacted all the docks.

144
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,130
Why are there only so few people?

145
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,860
After you and Boss Dai got attacked in the church,

146
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,730
the police went to the dock and arrested quite a few men of our gang.

147
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,130
It's lucky enough that the few people here managed to escape.

148
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,870
So many of our men got arrested.

149
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,040
How did you get away?

150
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,740

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you suspecting me?

152
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,760
I swear.

154

that he was in trouble.

155
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,270

He just said thank you to Director.

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,240
Ever since Shrike approached me

743
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,890
♫I miss you in the wind, wandering about♫

744
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,650
4 years ago,

745
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,830
my life is no longer my own.

746
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:45,450
♫The light of the dawn goes through the palm♫

747
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,180
Sorry, Shaobai.

748
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,900
♫It shines on me and you♫

749
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,940
Xu Wei!

750
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:55,020
♫Whose shadows are there?♫

751
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,220
♫Rip or Save♫

752
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,260
♫Go against or go together♫

753
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,030
♫A circular pursuit♫

754
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,010
♫Break a lamp on the roof♫

755
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,270
♫Travel through the darkness♫

756
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,140
♫I reach out and call you♫

757
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,040
I don't believe you'll shoot.

758
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,680
♫When I look back♫

759
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,550
♫The silhouette hid in my dream♫

760
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,610
♫How can I forget?♫

761
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,850
♫I can never forget♫

762
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:44,030
♫The time when we looked at each other♫

763
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,910
There are important clues on Xu Wei.

764
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,620
Capture him alive.

765
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,190
Yes.

766
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,400
Don't move!

Lin Shaobai!

769
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,540
Do you know what you are doing?

770
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,430
It wasn't me who drove this car!

771
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,260
Lin Shaobai.

772
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,960
You're hopeless.

773
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,060
Handcuff him and take him back!
