[Dark Night and Dawn]

2
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,650
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,610
Considering your attitude,

4
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,990
I wouldn't dare to ask Zheng to come downstairs.

5
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,520
If you two quarrel after he comes downstairs,

6
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,860
it'll be very awkward.

7
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,210
Right?

8
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,380
Here.

9
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,950
I think it's about time.

10
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,110
Mr. Yang, how about this?

11
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,720
I'll go upstairs to check on Zheng.

12
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,960
Please sit here.

13
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,550
Mr. Zheng.

14
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,390
You can go downstairs now.

15
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,329
How are you?

16
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,700
I'm fine.

17
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,020
I just feel...

18
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,250
a little dizzy.

19
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,360
Lie down and rest.

20
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,750
Mr. Yang, sorry to keep you waiting.

21
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,750
Mr. Zheng, looks like you deliberately refused to see me.

22
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,110
Goodbye, Mr. Yang.

23
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,870
Okay, see you.

24
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,590
Okay.

25
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,040
Mr. Zheng, is there a problem?

26
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,840
This person is very suspicious.

27
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,780
Few customers would require

28
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,060
to see me directly as soon as they come in.

29
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,310
And he specially said

30
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,079
I should draw the publicity painting myself.

31
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,940
So you used the color of the fabric to test him.

32
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,750
He said Xiang Leaf should be used.

33
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,090
I don't think there's a problem with that.

34
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,620
The problem is even bigger.

35
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,070
I told him you like dark colors.

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,230
So I gave him two color options:

37
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,480
Xiang Leaf and Fuligo e Herbis.

38
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,890
Fuligo e Herbis is much darker than Xiang Leaf.

39
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,310
But he said

40
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,480
Xiang Leaf suited you better.

41
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,690
Obviously, this man

42
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,310
doesn't do fabric business.

43
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,770
Ask Li Xu to investigate him carefully.

44
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,550
Okay.

45
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,930
Mr. Jin.

46
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,360
Take him away.

47
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,080
Yes.

48
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:06,900
Get up!

49
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:07,870
Move!

50
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,010
Move! Faster!

51
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,790
Mr. Jin.

52
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,920
This...

53
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
Falcon,

54
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,540
you only took me out.

55
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
They will suspect me.

56
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,140
Don't worry.

57
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,370
Maybe you don't need to go back today.

58
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,909
Falcon,

59
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,390
we had a deal, right?

60
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,830
You won't do anything...

61
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,550
Look.

62
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,650
It's you.

63
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,110
Impressive, Jin.

64
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,180
You let me catch you

65
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,350
so that you could be clear of suspicion.

66
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,280
You seized the chance to hire an assassin to kill him.

67
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,670
W-What assassin did I hire?

68
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,870
To kill whom?

69
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,140
You're too stubborn.

70
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,270
Tell me.

71
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,810
Who asked you to do that?

72
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,310
Master Guan sent me.

73
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,950
You colluded with Dai Yueqing

74
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,350
to destroy the River Gang.

75
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,870
You killed our boss.

76
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,600
I must

77
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,580
take revenge on you.

78
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,110
I'm indebted to my boss.

79
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,240
Even if I die,

80
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,280
I will never betray him.

81
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,120
You are even more stubborn.

82
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,490
Mr. Jin,

83
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,320
your man

84
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,100
is very loyal to you.

85
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,240
Mr. Zheng?

86
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,770
Mr. Zheng of Lanting Studio.

87
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
Why do you want to kill me?

88
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,530
I...

89
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,830
I have no grudge against you.

90
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,350
Why would I kill you?

91
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,010
You must be mistaken.

92
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,590
Falcon,

93
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,230
you are mistaken. This is a misunderstanding.

94
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,460
It doesn't matter now.

95
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,130
Mr. Jin,

96
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,890
let's make a rule. What do you think?

97
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,490
Why should I make a rule with you?

98
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm Shrike.

99
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,430
Jin, if you can

100
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,660
survive today,

101
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,910
I think we should make a rule.

102
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,990
From now on,

103
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,490
if anything happens to me,

104
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,690
you and your daughter

105
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,810
will be held accountable.

106
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm just a businessman.

107
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,530
I can't even protect myself.

108
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,260
This is not fair, right?

109
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,780
Anyone else can talk about fairness with me,

110
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,390
except you,

111
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,700
Jin.

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,780
You only have two options now.

113
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,570
Buried with your man.

114
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,940
I'll do it.

115
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,380
Or...

116
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,870
bury him.

117
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,180
You do it.

118
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,960
Mr. Shrike,

119
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,910
please let me go.

120
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,240
I may still be of some use to you.

121
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,000
It is up to me

122
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,120
whether you're useful to me.

123
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,620
Currently, you're no different

124
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,840
from your man.

125
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,510
I can get rid of you anytime.

126
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,660
Hurry up.

127
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,850
It's already late into the night.

128
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,640
But I can promise you one thing.

129
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,490
If I get caught,

130
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,960
even if I die,

131
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,270
I will never implicate you.

132
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,670
Even if I die,

133
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,330
I will never expose you.

134
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,450
That's also a rule.

135
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,910
Jin, I'm counting down.

136
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,160
Jin.

137
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,430
Thank you.

138
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,110
Not at all.

139
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,840
Not at all. Not...

140
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,350
Pleasure working with you.

141
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,510
P-Pleasure working with you.

142
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,460
Good night.

143
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,700
According to the Forensics Department,

144
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,550
the sand found at the crime scene

145
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,550
has a salinity level similar to that of the sea sand

146
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,080
and exhibits high acidity.

147
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,640
It should be due to long-term chemical contamination.

148
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,450
Therefore,

149
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,790
the place where these entrepreneurs are imprisoned

150
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,020
should have these characteristics.

151
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,910
[River] [Estuary] [Chemical factory]

152
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,830
It's near a river

153
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,010
and a polluted chemical factory.

154
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,600
The agents must have stayed there

155
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,450
for quite some time.

156
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,020
That's why they left some sand

157
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,680
from their stronghold during their operation.

158
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,380
Based on Dr. Jin's test results,

159
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,740
the place should be in the northeast,

160
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,790
near the estuary.

161
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,030
In other words, it's in Hongkou or Gaoqiao.

162
00:13:53,030 --> 00:14:00,230
[River] [Estuary] [Chemical factory]

163
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,940
This water area has a complex network,

164
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,190
with the potential for pollution along its entire shoreline.

165
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,760
To find out

166
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,190
where they are imprisoned,

167
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,280
we still have considerable work to do.

168
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Dr. Jin,

169
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,110
is there a method

170
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,750
to identify the chemical substance

171
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,660
contaminating the sand?

172
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,710
It can help us confirm

173
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,130
what type of factory it is.

174
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,350
The current technological methods

175
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,610
can't identify the chemical substance.

176
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,630
Director,

177
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,190
can we apply to the bureau for more men

178
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,270
to conduct a large-scale investigation?

179
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,470
Making too much noise

180
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,130
could easily alert them.

181
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,280
Then all our efforts would be in vain.

182
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,080
[River] [Estuary] [Chemical factory]

183
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,760
We will figure something out.

184
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,090
That's all for today.

185
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,350
I'm going to the bureau.

186
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,880
Okay.

187
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,720
Captain Zhang,

188
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,720
you could have just come up here

189
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,180
without offering to help.

190
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,820
It's dirty.

191
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,830
You confused me.

192
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,820
I thought

193
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,900
you would feed pigeons here forever.

194
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,180
What can I do?

195
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,670
The bureau assigned me here.

196
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,210
I talked to Deputy Commissioner Yang.

197
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,540
Your assignment hasn't been decided yet.

198
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,630
The Criminal Police Division has reserved a seat for you.

199
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,760
Are you interested?

200
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,780
Well...

201
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,480
no need for that.

202
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,330
I am... interested.

203
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,960
Lu, why are you here?

204
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,040
I heard that Captain Zhang was looking for the Police Pigeon Squad.

205
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,530
So I specially came here...

206
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,000
to show him the way.

207
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,230
I came here to check on Shaobai.

208
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,210
No, I'm learning from Captain Zhang.

209
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,840
As a leader, Captain Zhang

210
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,330
would never recite the Tightening Spell to his subordinates.

211
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,020
He cares about them and offers many benefits.

212
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,580
I should learn from him.

213
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,810
Shaobai, if you join the Criminal Police Division,

214
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,850
I promise you can work comfortably.

215
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,390
Zhang,

216
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,000
you've always had this idea.

217
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,750
Lu, everyone in the bureau knows

218
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,820
he is capable.

219
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
But now, he's here to feed pigeons.

220
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,030
It's a waste of his talent, right?

221
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,020
I'm not poaching him from you.

222
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,400
He's now a member of the Police Pigeon Squad.

223
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,420
He's not a member of your Social Affairs Office.

224
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,150
If you don't want him,

225
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,150
I'll take him in.

226
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,260
You both are leaders.

227
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,810
Why are you so different?

228
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,090
Shaobai is right.

229
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,780
Indeed,

230
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,460
I should reflect on myself and learn.

231
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,090
The Social Affairs Office, Police Pigeon Squad, and Criminal Police Division

232
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,590
are all branches of the bureau.

233
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,930
They all serve the people, right?

234
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,900
No matter where Shaobai wants to work, I'll agree.

235
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,470
Lu, you've really agreed?

236
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I was worried you wouldn't want him.

237
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,780
Stop pretending.

238
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,970
Zhang,

239
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,160
Lin Shaobai is talented.

240
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,960
Although he is always disobedient,

241
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,990
always acts on his own, and always creates chaos,

242
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,830
you should tolerate him, defend him,

243
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,450
and help him clear up the mess.

244
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,450
Most importantly, you should take the blame for him

245
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,859
in front of Deputy Commissioner Yang.

246
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,599
To be honest, I really can't stand

247
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,280
Deputy Commissioner Yang's temper anymore.

248
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,119
Only you, Zhang, can stand it.

249
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,630
No one else

250
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,579
can stand it.

251
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,550
He should change his temper, right?

252
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,069
After being trapped under the Five Fingers Mountain for so many years,

253
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,090
Sun Wukong was only slightly less reckless.

254
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,850
After he met Tang Sanzang,

255
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,520
Tang Sanzang had to recite the Tightening Spell to control him.

256
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,850
Are you Tang Sanzang? Can you recite the Tightening Spell?

257
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,860
I finally understand

258
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
your good intentions.

259
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,340
You want him to work on his temperament here.

260
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,040
Right?

261
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,930
What are you talking about? So mysterious.

262
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,480
Shaobai, just

263
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,980
stay here.

264
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,330
I'm going to eat something first.

265
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,530
You guys talk.

266
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,740
Well, Captain Zhang,

267
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,480
we were having a nice chat, right? You...

268
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
We'll talk later.

269
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,670
Lu, what do you want?

270
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,900
You're here to stir the pot deliberately, aren't you?

271
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,040
What did you tell Captain Zhang?

272
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,530
You really want to join the Criminal Police Division?

273
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,150
No matter where I want to work,

274
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,950
it's my freedom.

275
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,640
Then listen carefully.

276
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,530
As long as I'm here,

277
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,690
you can only stay here to feed pigeons.

278
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,490
You listen carefully.

279
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,900
People should have dignity.

280
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,320
I've never wanted to join the Criminal Police Division.

281
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,970
Lu, aren't you awesome?

282
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,790
One day,

283
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,050
I'll make you lead my horse and invite me back

284
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,950
with a grand sedan chair carried by eight people.

285
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,390
You're trying to get to Heaven by climbing a ladder.

286
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,710
What does it mean?

287
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,750
Don't even think about it!

288
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,000
You spent a few days here, but you haven't changed at all.

289
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,350
You haven't improved at all.

290
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,680
Just feed pigeons here!

291
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,660
Just you wait!

292
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,020
Now a sedan chair carried by eight people can't satisfy me!

293
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,230
You'll have to use a sedan chair carried by 16 people!

294
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,230
Officer, what medicine do you need?

295
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,270
The medicine is called...

296
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,160
Iso...

297
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,280
Isoproterenol Lozenges.

298
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,140
My friend told me it's available here.

299
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,320
Yes, I'll get it for you.

300
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,270
No hurry.

301
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,890
Boss,

302
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,060
usually,

303
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,830
who would buy this medicine?

304
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,040
Usually my regular customers.

305
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,950
This medicine is more expensive than Penicillin.

306
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,230
Only those rich bosses

307
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,760
can afford this medicine.

308
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,860
Only a few units were sold

309
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,190
during the past 15 days.

310
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,170
Did anyone buy it recently?

311
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Yes. Two customers recently bought it.

312
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,680
One was Mr. Feng. He often came to buy it for his son.

313
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,730
Speaking of his son, he is quite pitiful.

314
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,100
The other one was...

315
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,220
The other one was a new face to me.

316
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,500
I can't remember.

317
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,340
New face?

318
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,310
Think harder.

319
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,710
How old is that person? Is that person a man or a woman?

320
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,690
What does that person look like? When did that person come to buy it?

321
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,910
I think it was... in the afternoon of the day before yesterday.

322
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,470
Yes, in the afternoon of the day before yesterday.

323
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,470
I was sleepy.

324
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,060
A young man came in to buy medicine.

325
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,550
He's in his 20s.

326
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,700
In his 20s. Do you still remember

327
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,320
what he looks like?

328
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,450
I really didn't see him clearly.

329
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,710
He was wearing a pair of goggles.

330
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,550
His goggles fogged up after he came in.

331
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,910
But he still didn't take them off.

332
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,100
It was his first time buying this medicine. He didn't even ask how to use it.

333
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,430
He just paid and left.

334
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,970
I guess he bought it for someone else.

335
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,870
He was wearing goggles? Did he ride a motorbike here?

336
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,270
Yes. After he went out, he kicked the pedal a few times.

337
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,220
But the motorbike wouldn't start.

338
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,450
It started after he shook the fuel tank.

339
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,300
So it was running out of fuel.

340
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,150
Yes, around 3 p.m.

341
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,420
[Gasoline]

342
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,620
He refilled his motorbike with... 11 liters of fuel.

343
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,830
He has a local accent.

344
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,500
That motorbike looked very nice.

345
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,130
But the taillights were broken.

346
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,820
The driver was wearing a pair of goggles. I couldn't see his face clearly.

347
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,600
He headed southeast.

348
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,690
He headed southeast?

349
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,160
Do you remember his license plate number?

350
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,150
A motorbike like that is rare.

351
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,830
So I took a few more looks at it.

352
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,710
The license plate number ends with...

353
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,280
0229.

366
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,550
is it necessary to treat me like a thief?

Why did you come here?

368
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,590
I really have something urgent. I want to see Lu.

When will he come back?

371
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,260
I guess he's going to live there.

00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,120

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,790
Check if the tubes on the pigeons' legs are securely fastened.

379
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,510
Send them to the branches as soon as possible.

380
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,340
Okay.

381
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,570

It's okay.

Captain Guan.

388
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,860
We are quite familiar with the surrounding area's situation.

389
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,060
These are the only chemical factories.

390
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,620
Only those, right?

391
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,730
Where are the abandoned ones?

392
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,550
The factories with a red mark

393
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,010
are basically abandoned.

394
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,430
In that direction and that direction, right?

395
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,440
Yes.

396
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,420
We need to focus on investigating the surrounding area

What is it?

403
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,670

Lu Zhengyang, it's typical of you.

418
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,950
After hearing there is a clue,

419
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,620
you came back sooner than I expected.

420
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,670
Lin Shaobai,

421
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,530
do you know what you are doing?

422
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,520
You asked me to come back without permission.

423
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,640
I can fire you!

424
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,450
Calm down, okay?

425
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,230
This concerns my Uncle Jin's safety.

426
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,310
I wouldn't have asked you to come back if I don't have an important clue.

427
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,230
What clue?

428
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,390
I can tell you, but I have one condition.

429
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,320
You have to invite me back to the department in style.

430
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,400
Is this your first day working in the bureau?

431
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
Don't you know the procedure?

432
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,920
Then let me join your special investigation team.

433
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,520
Don't think I don't know.

434
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,350
Even those traffic policemen joined the team.

435
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,350
Why can't I?

436
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,500
You know clearly why you were assigned

437
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,030
to the Police Pigeon Squad.

438
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,150
Fine. I'll go to Captain Zhang.

439
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,070
I'll join the Criminal Police Division.

440
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,310
Then I can still join the special investigation team.

441
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,620
I'm the leader of the special investigation team.

442
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,740
If I don't agree,

443
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,840

Do you still want to find Xu Wei?

447
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,910
No, I just want to solve the case and save those people

448
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,940
as soon as possible! What's wrong with that?

449
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,160
I've said it clearly anyway.

450
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,290
Believe it or not.

451
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,010

00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,100
Stop!

453
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,240
Tell me in detail

454
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,140
what on earth the clue is.

455
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,510
Gao Huaipu has severe asthma.

456
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,650
He can't do without medicine.

457
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,910
Those agents must have an ulterior motive for capturing the entrepreneurs.

458
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,390
They won't let them die

459
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,670
before they achieve their goal.

460
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,070
So they definitely will buy medicine for Gao Huaipu.

461
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,900
According to the pharmacy,

462
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,670
I found out the agent who went to buy medicine

463
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,140
rode a motorbike there.

464
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,550
The license plate number is 0229.

465
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,610
But the license plate number is fake.

466
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,100
So?

467
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,660
Can I join the special investigation team?

468
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,380
Why should I believe what you said is true?

469
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,430
Go ask around.

470
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,770
Go ask Gao Shaochun, Gao Huaipu's son.

471
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,190
Or ask those pharmacies and gas stations.

472
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,510
See if I lied to you.

473
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,830
I'll go now.

474
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,690
Let me tell you.

475
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,030
The longer you delay,

476
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,120
the more likely those entrepreneurs

477
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,180
will die in the hands of those agents.

478
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,740
I meant I'll go apply

479
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,990
for the branches' assistance to investigate

480
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,760
the whereabouts of the motorbike that agent rode.

481
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,630
You just said you've investigated it.

482
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,630
The license plate number is fake, right?

483
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,210
Yes.

484
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,040
So... you've agreed?

485
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,590
Come with me.

486
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,650
Where are we going?

487
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,160
We're going back to the bureau for a meeting.

488
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,890
Wait.

489
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,070
Do you mean I'm a member of the special investigation team now?

490
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,290
Well, since it's a meeting...

491
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,040
since it's a meeting, you should introduce me

492
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,440
to them, right?

493
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,590
If I don't have a title

494
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,780
and you don't tell them anything,

495
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,240
it won't be proper, right?

496
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,550
Fine.

497
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,060

Come on.

A liaison from the Police Pigeon Squad?

500
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,120
It sounds like an errand boy.

501
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,820
It's not prominent at all. Think of another name.

502
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,820
Whatever.

503
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:50,800
How about this?

504
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,830
A special liaison.

00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,230
Well.

507
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,270

[Gao Huaipu]

515
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,850
a special liaison from the Police Pigeon Squad.

516
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,590
Next,

517
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,910
Lin Shaobai is going

518
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,040
to introduce the progress of the case.

519
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,330
According to the information from the branches,

520
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,820
the motorbike the agent rode

521
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,240
was last seen

522
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,090
at Lu's Grocery in Gaoqiao Town.

523
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,200
So Hongkou District is excluded.

524
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,300
The area Director Lu predicted based on the sand

525
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,390
is the coastal area in the northeast.

526
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
With the two clues combined,

527
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,180
it's very likely that

528
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,870
the entrepreneurs are imprisoned by the agents

529
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,840
in the area from Lu's Grocery

530
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,910
to the coast in the northeast.

531
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,340
I'm a traffic policeman.

532
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,680
I'm quite familiar with this area.

533
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,200
The agents could hide

534
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,670
anywhere in this area.

535
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,020
But the investigation area has narrowed.

536
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,630
Lu,

537
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,770
should we gather our men

538
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,160
to search this area?

539
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,730
We don't have enough time.

540
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,440
We don't have time to search the area now.

541
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,100
What do you think we should do?

542
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,670
-The Hook Sword Gang.
-The Hook Sword Gang.

543
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,690
The Hook Sword Gang.

544
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,420
The Hook Sword Gang?

545
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,280
The Hook Sword Gang's initial territory

546
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,540
significantly overlaps with this area.

547
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,530
Director is right.

548
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,950
According to the information Dai Yueqing told us,

549
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,070
in the beginning,

550
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,910
the Hook Sword Gang

551
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,590
consisted of the dockers in this area.

552
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,070
Yes, the Hook Sword Gang expanded from here,

553
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,260
taking control of the docks one after another.

554
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,930
This place is their lair.

555
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,920
If there's something fishy there,

556
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,370
no one else can know better than they do.

557
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,370
The problem is how we can mobilize the Hook Sword Gang.

558
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,630
Catch the leader first.

559
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,920
We caught their leader long ago.

560
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,230
That's right.

561
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,740
Their chief, Dai Yueqing,

562
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,270
is still in custody.

563
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,320
If she can help us,

564
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,760
it will be very helpful in solving the case.

565
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,430
Director Lu, I suggest

566
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,900
we should interrogate Dai Yueqing immediately.

567
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,090
Indeed,

568
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,340
the Hook Sword Gang was established in Gaoqiao.

569
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,290
Many gang members' old houses

570
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,280
are still there.

571
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,900
I will cooperate with your investigation.

572
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,390
Would this count as a contribution?

573
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,970
What other members of the Hook Sword Gang are still there?

574
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,630
Tell me their names

575
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,130
and addresses.

576
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,420
Even if I tell you,

577
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,780
I'm afraid you can't

578
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,960
find out anything if you go.

579
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,970
The new government's policies include both strict punishments

580
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,390
and lenient measures.

581
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,020
As long as they cooperate actively,

582
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,770
we won't give them a hard time.

583
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,610
They are not afraid of you.

584
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,370
They're afraid of agents.

585
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,010
They're afraid of agents' persecution and retaliation.

586
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,550
Dai Yueqing,

587
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,230
you can tell us directly

588
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,750
what you want.

589
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,920
I can be your informant.

590
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,730
I'll go myself.

591
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,160
They will only

592
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,460
listen and believe

593
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,250
if I go personally.

594
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,430
You want us to let you out?

595
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,030
I'll be frank with you.

596
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,830
I've been thinking

597
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,880
about a lot of things here lately.

598
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,340
Life,

599
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,980
as they say in plays,

600
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,760
is a splendid dream

601
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,890
that ultimately amounts to nothing.

602
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,300
I don't have much to look forward to in this life.

603
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,430
It's just like this.

604
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,150
But my only hope

605
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,810
is to make contributions to reduce my sentence,

606
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,510
so that maybe

607
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,680
I can still have a chance

608
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,000
to see him in this life.

609
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,070
All these years,

610
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,550
I have never talked to him.

611
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,910
If I escape,

612
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,310
I won't even have the last chance.

613
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm their chief.

614
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,860
I'm also a mother.

615
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,470
As a mother,

616
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,630
I owe my son too much.

617
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,350
I'm a woman of my word.

618
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,140
I'll keep my promise.

619
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,570
If you really are worried,

620
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,980
you can ask someone to follow me.

621
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,190
But it has to be a new face.

622
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,200
I think she can do it.

623
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,470
Me?

624
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,870
Dai Yueqing promised to collaborate with us last time.

625
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,790
But what happened in the end?

626
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,930
She escaped from the secret passage that night.

627
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,150
If we let her out this time,

628
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,080
maybe she'll cause other trouble.

629
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,100
It's different this time.

630
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,530
She treated us as her enemies last time.

631
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,370
But this time,

632
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,260
she wants to make contributions to reduce her sentence.

633
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,350
Maybe she's pretending in front of us.

634
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,280
If we let her out,

635
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,170
she'll become our future problem.

636
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,090
I trust her.

637
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,390
She's in a very different state this time.

638
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,310
Besides, Xu,

639
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,940
Dai Yueqing is a gang member.

640
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,580
The most important thing for gang members is integrity.

641
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,830
Otherwise, she couldn't have become the boss of the Hook Sword Gang.

642
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,330
And I think she knows clearly

643
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,070
what will happen to her men

644
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,610
if she lies again.

645
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,700
Has it ever occurred to you that she's in jail now?

646
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,770
She can't even ensure her own freedom.

647
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,389
How can she take care of others?

648
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,580
Think about it, Huzi.

649
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,320
To ensure the safety of her child,

650
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,969
namely Tong Susu,

651
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,420
Dai Yueqing chose not to reunite with him.

652
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,580
But she has protected him for nearly ten years.

653
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,710
Why would such a mother

654
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,150
leave her own child

655
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,219
behind?

656
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,560
Shaobai, have you thought about this?

657
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,630
Maybe Dai Yueqing compromised on purpose.

658
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,030
She wants to take advantage of your sympathy.

659
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,960
That's right.

660
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,590
No matter how reasonable your analysis is,

661
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,710
you're making a bet, right?

662
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,020
I'm not making a bet.

663
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,429
I'm analyzing based on my understanding of Dai Yueqing.

664
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,139
Even if your analysis...

665
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,949
Stop arguing.

666
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,210
Let's trust Dai Yueqing one more time.

667
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,370
Well, Director,

668
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,440
that's just his random idea, and you really agree to it?

669
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,780
Let's do as Shaobai said.

670
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,810
Lu, don't you think it's too risky?

671
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,989
It is.

672
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,060
But this is our only feasible solution

673
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,179
for the moment.

674
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,500
We can't delay the rescue of the entrepreneurs any longer.

675
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,260
Dai Yueqing is our only way.

676
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,480
I don't believe in Dai Yueqing's moral quality either.

677
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,360
But I believe

678
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,590
she will make the choice

679
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,670
that can maximize her own interests.

680
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,710
She escaped from the secret passage before

681
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,310
because once she succeeded,

682
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,110
she would still be their chief.

683
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,450
She could still trade

684
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,070
the copperplate with Shrike.

685
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,540
She could even leave Shanghai with her child.

686
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,000
Now we have almost destroyed the Hook Sword Gang.

687
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,140
We also know the existence of Tong Susu.

688
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,390
Even if she escapes,

689
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,140
what can she do?

690
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,030
So now, seeking leniency for an early release

691
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,060
is the choice that can maximize her own interests.

692
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,200
The only one I'm worried about is Xiaoman.

693
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,800
Report.

694
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,980
Director, don't worry about me.

695
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,470
I've been practicing marksmanship with Huzi.

696
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,060
I think I can handle her.

697
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,450
Right, Huzi?

698
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,590
Although you've been practicing marksmanship lately

699
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,300
and your marksmanship has improved,

700
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,390
think about what kind of person Dai Yueqing is.

701
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,300
You can't handle her no matter how good your marksmanship is.

702
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,260
But now that things have come to this,

703
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,550
you can only let me try.

704
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,540
Xiaoman is right.

705
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,080
How about this?

706
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,320
We'll follow them all the way.

707
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,690
First, we can protect Xiaoman.

708
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,110
Second, we can prevent Dai Yueqing

709
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,910
from getting out of our control.

710
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,040
It's decided then.

711
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,350
It's risky to ask Dai Yueqing to help with the case.

712
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,410
But it might also be a clever plan.

713
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,890
I'll report to Deputy Commissioner Yang.

714
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,930
If anything goes wrong,

715
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,100
I'll take responsibility.

716
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,550
Also, this must

717
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,230
be kept strictly confidential.

718
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,020
Now, both the Hook Sword Gang and Shrike

719
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,750
have their eyes on Dai Yueqing.

720
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,890
-Got it.
-Got it.

721
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,840
The fascination of fate lies in the fact

722
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,190
that those caught in it often find it difficult

723
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,590
to grasp the complete picture.

724
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,150
Yes.

725
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,940
It will be the same in Shanghai.

726
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,150
Hello?

727
00:36:59,330 --> 00:36:59,810
Hello,

728
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,690
is this Lanting Studio?

729
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,630
I want to order a painting.

730
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,760
Okay, wait a moment.

731
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,030
Mr. Zheng.

732
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,800
It's Secretary Liu.

733
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,430
I prepared a painting for Mr. Mao.

734
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,580
He will like it.

735
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,460
Director just sent a telegram.

736
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,930
He said you did a good job.

737
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,540
According to the information you provided,

738
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,890
three merchant ships involved in smuggling rice and cotton

739
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,030
from Shanghai's business industry have been intercepted

740
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,960
by our warships.

741
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,700
They are currently being rerouted to the island.

742
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,860
Our plan is far more than that.

743
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,320
Tell Mr. Mao

744
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,270
to wait for the good news.

745
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,220
Wait a minute.

746
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,170
You provided information on many routes.

747
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,340
How come there were only three ships out at sea?

748
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,750
You swore

749
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,950
in front of the boss

750
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,350
to provide supplies of 20 ships.

751
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,390
You're not even close now.

752
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,290
The boss asked me to ask you

753
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,490
when the remaining ships will set sail.

754
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,240
The generalissimo personally

755
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,190
wrote an instruction to you.

756
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,990
If you can't complete the mission,

757
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,110
do you think

758
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,860
you deserve the honor?

759
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,430
What's wrong?

760
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,160
Tell Falcon

761
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,140
to load all the ships and make them set sail

762
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,620
within a week.

763
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,000
If anyone refuses to cooperate again,

764
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,680
kill him.

765
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,550
Yes.

766
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,060
We just got the news.

767
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,310
Someone's ships still haven't set sail.

768
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,440
Who's playing tricks with me?

769
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,350
Do you need me to name you?

770
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,700
Jin, Qian.

771
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,830
Come out.

772
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,500
I arranged it long ago.

773
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,060
Maybe something happened to the ships at sea.

774
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,790
I'll continue to contact them.

775
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,550
No.

776
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,950
I've received the supplies from your ships.

777
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,720
You'll be rewarded with wine and meat for today's lunch.

778
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,580
Come, sit down.

779
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,660
You don't want to show me respect?

780
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,160
You don't like them?

781
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,310
That's more like it.

782
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,070
You deserve a reward for doing good deeds.

783
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,850
Those three bosses must be hungry.

784
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,120
Come on, invite them over.

785
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
We'll treat them to lunch too. Come.

786
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,730
Serve the dishes for them.

787
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,110
What are these?

788
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,270
They are moldy and have maggots.

789
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,110
Looks like they don't have a good appetite.

790
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,430
Come on. Feed them.

791
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,480
No! No!

792
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,830
Eat!

793
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,580
Mr. Gao! Mr. Gao!

794
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,610
Eat!

795
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,870
Sir,

796
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,150
they'll die if this continues.

797
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,510
It takes time to load the ships and arrange transportation.

798
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,250
If anything happens to them,

799
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,440
you'll gain nothing in the end.

800
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,920
Jin,

801
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,590
don't try to scare me with that.

802
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,590
We still have you even if they die.

803
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,870
If you die,

804
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,900
there are so many bosses in Shanghai, right?

805
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:17,950
Gao,

806
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,090
ask your men to set sail within five days.

807
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,030
If you can do it, nod.

808
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,580
Fine, I'll do you another favor.

809
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,030
After you die,

810
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,260
I'll make you and your family members

811
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,200
reunite as soon as possible, okay?

812
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,020
That's more like it.

813
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,850
Come on, let me feed you.

814
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,350
Girl.

815
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,770
Drive slowly.

816
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,920
I'm not a girl. I'm a police officer.

817
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,710
This is great.

818
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,010
You're pretty and smart.

819
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,480
And no one dares to bully you because of your job.

820
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,030
I grew up on a boat on Taihu Lake.

821
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,430
I lived off boats.

822
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,510
Later I followed the flood to Shanghai.

823
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,260
I still made a living on boats year after year.
