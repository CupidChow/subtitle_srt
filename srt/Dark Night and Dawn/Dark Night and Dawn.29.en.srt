00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,680
There's radiation here. It's dangerous.

[X-ray Department]

6
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,830
You really care about old comrades, our dear Director Lu.

7
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,110
You even drove him here yourself for the physical examination.

8
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,860
Stop being so weird.

9
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,419
This physical examination was specially arranged for Chen.

10
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,420
Hear me out first.

11
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,640
Deputy Commissioner Yang didn't just ask Li Yaohong to come here

12
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,870
to analyze the intelligence, right?

13
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,670
You only brought him with you last time

14
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,950
when you went to stop the incendiary bombs at the dock.

15
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,880
Did you do that to prevent the mole?

16
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,820
Shut your mouth first.

17
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,350
Aren't you going to get medicine for your mom?

18
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,740
Go. Go get your medicine.

19
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,640
You've been investigating the mole ever since.

20
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,400
Now you finally locked your target on Chen,

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,430
so you went through so much trouble

22
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,590
to arrange this physical examination

23
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,250
to make the mole show himself.

24
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,010
Listen.

25
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,380
Don't talk too much before the result comes out.

26
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,010
If he's really the mole,

27
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,760
don't you worry he'll run away?

28
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,860
Yaohong has arranged everything.

29
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,020
You have had a serious fracture in your left calf.

30
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,510
Judging from the shape of the wound,

31
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,790
it's an old wound from many years ago.

32
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,340
If it had been treated in time back then,

33
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,650
it could have been cured.

34
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,290
It's too late

35
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,970
to treat it now.

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,030
Okay.

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,460
See? I told you there's nothing wrong with my health.

38
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,100
Shall we go back?

39
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's go back.

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,380
Thanks a lot, doctor.

41
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,120
You're welcome.

42
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,990
Ask Yaohong to leave as well.

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,960
Could it be...

44
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,640
the direction of our investigation was wrong from the beginning,

45
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,180
and we wronged Chen?

46
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,260
The fact that Chen didn't fake his limp

47
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,720
doesn't necessarily mean he's not an agent.

48
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,910
In order to infiltrate us,

49
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,990
losing a leg

50
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,440
is nothing to the NBIS.

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,070
Shaobai.

52
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,980
If it were you,

53
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,730
would you have made such a big sacrifice?

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,910
Now you want to ask my opinion?

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Anyway, the greater the cost,

56
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,780
the more successful the disguise is.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,190
Chen could have

58
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,980
gone for the physical examination openly for his leg,

59
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,730
but he insisted on putting on such a show.

60
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,440
Why?

61
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,520
There's only one explanation.

62
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,200
He was deliberately arousing our suspicion.

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,079
This way,

64
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,990
he can prove our suspicion wrong

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,310
and leave us no reason to investigate him,

66
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,680
so we even have to choose to trust him.

67
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,430
Yes, that's right.

68
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,310
Chen may have noticed

69
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,159
our suspicion of him because of this physical examination,

70
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,690
so he won't take any action in the near future.

71
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,220
Now we need a chance

72
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,920
to force him to take action.

73
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,250
From today on,

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,900

Nyctibius.

77
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,630
Nyctibius is a kind of bird which is best at disguise.

78
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,680
I believe you can

79
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,510
share that characteristic with the bird.

80
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,350
Please rest assured, dear Kuomintang.

81
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,590
When I found out

82
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,430
Li Yaohong started checking my files,

83
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,870
I knew they had started to suspect me.

84
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,630
This physical examination was a test to me.

85
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,390
What went wrong?

86
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,530
It should be that time when Liang Yunda...

87
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,380

You're going out with so many men. Are you on a mission?

90
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,320
We'll talk after we come back.

91
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
Okay, I'll stay here.

92
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,200
There's no water in the thermos.

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,740
I'll go get some boiling water.

94
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,730
Let me do it, Chen.

95
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,010
I was too busy this morning. I forgot to fill it.

96
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,870
Thank you then.

97
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,500
I'll go now.

98
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,340

They have started to take action.

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,320
The only thing I know

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,470
is that they have a person in their hands

104
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,670
named Liang Yunda.

105
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,210
It was an emergency.

106
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,770
I had no choice.

107
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,640
But I didn't leave any evidence.

108

Don't worry.

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,570
The further they investigate,

110
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,680
the better it can prove my innocence.

111
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,750
They

112
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,040
can never imagine

113
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,970
what I have done

114
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,400
to be a secret agent.

115

You've suffered a lot these years.

116

From today on, don't take any further action,

117

so that all their investigations

118
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,000
will go awry.

So Ogura has been in his hands all along.

153

He also provided the white phosphorus used to make incendiary bombs.

154
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,240
But there's something weird.

155

Since he has written the confession,

156
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,310
why did he run away?

It's written right here.

158

His wife and family don't know about it.

159
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,460
He wants to keep his family out of this matter.

But as soon as I arrived at the dock, I was caught by Ye Shiwu.

170

It turns out he was the one who tipped him off.

Shaobai, did you find anything in his house?

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,400
I found some US banknotes, some gold bars,

175
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,930
and the bills of exchange the agents sent him,

176

and search every hotel.

189
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,780
Since he wants to hide,

190
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
he might go to his relatives

191
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,760
or friends.

192
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,020
So we have to find out his social relations

193
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,690
as soon as possible.

194
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,550
Good.

195
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,220
You got it all.

196
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,180
Let's do as Chen said.

197
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,660
These anthrax bacteria

198
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,250
are exactly the same

199
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,990
as the type that infected those previous patients.

200
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,310
That anthrax warhead

201
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,280
was deliberately put there by someone to mislead us.

202
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,420
The Sugar Research Institute is the real source of pollution.

203
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,510
Most of the anthrax bacteria

204
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,540
have died off due to the lack

205
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,030
of a suitable environment for cultivation.

206
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,960
The decline of bacteria follows a predictable cycle.

207
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,190
By tracking when they began to die off,

208
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,830
we can roughly estimate

209
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,190
when Ogura and his group withdrew.

210
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,230
Dr. Zhao, we'll be counting on you in the coming days.

211
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,200
No problem.

212
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,190
I've reported to the hospital.

213
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,600
I'll do my best to cooperate with you.

214
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,320
Thank you.

215
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
I can't believe Li.

216
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,140
Why did he choose to be an agent?

217
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,280
And he's my husband.

218
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,710
Well, this...

219
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,090
Don't be too sad, Mrs. Li.

220
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,280
Can you think of

221
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,840
anything unusual

222
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,470
about him lately?

223
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,100
Did he

224
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,510
do anything special

225
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,060
or say anything special?

226
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,620
To be honest,

227
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,510
as soon as he got home, he'd keep to himself.

228
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,600
He wouldn't say a word to me.

229
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,920
What did he usually do when he got home?

230
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,270
See that chessboard over there?

231
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,440
He loved to fiddle with his chess.

232
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,310
He could play by himself for an entire afternoon.

233
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,700
Mrs. Lin.

234
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,450
What...

235
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,550
What should I do in the future?

236
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,880
How can I

237
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,420
face the neighbors?

238
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,500
Mrs. Li, don't be like this.

239
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,250
You can go to my place

240
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,270
so that we can keep each other company.

241
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,930
I won't let you starve anyway.

242
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,350
Have you eaten tonight?

243
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,060
If not, go to my place now to have a bite.

244
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,590
Let's go, go home with me now.

245
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,120
Come on, go to my place to grab something to eat.

246
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,860
Don't be sad.

247
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,710
Thank you.

248
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,900
It's not your fault.

249
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,430
Right?

250
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,430
What he did has nothing to do with you.

251
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,070
Let's go.

252
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,070
Huzi.

253
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,010
Take some men to guard the passageways on both sides.

254
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,290
I'll go in with Lin Shaobai.

255
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:35,800
Yes.

256
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,260
Xiang.

257
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,750
Yes.

258
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,290
Someone killed him.

259
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,640
The wound is bigger in the back than in the front.

260
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,250
It's also a Dumdum bullet.

261
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,400
Director,

262
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,710
we found this at the scene

263
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,710
of the firefight.

264
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,340
The third party who tried

265
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,680
to kill Wang Liqun did it.

266
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,890
They showed up again.

267
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,900
If the third party did it,

268
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,830
maybe Shrike still doesn't know he's dead.

269
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,300
Why don't we take a bold move?

270
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,130
Pretend he is still alive.

271
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,290
You mean...

272
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,950
he

273
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,930
is the good opportunity we've been waiting for?

274
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,170
It's the best chance we have right now.

275
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,650
Everyone, listen up.

276
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,369
We've located Li Yuquan.

277
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,329
Based on his confession,

278
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,579
he's probably Shrike's direct subordinate.

279
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,359
As long as we catch him,

280
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,890
it'll only be a matter of time to catch Shrike.

281
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,310
Then we can destroy the Shanghai Special Station soon.

282
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,170
Great, Director.

283
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,530
He's hiding

284
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,230
in Room 403 of Jian'an Apartment.

285
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,060
We have to

286
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,829
catch him successfully this time.

287
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,520
Okay.

288
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,550
Xu.

289
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,130
You stay here.

290
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,860
Chen, you have a leg problem.

291
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,490
You stay too.

292
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,310
Director, I can do it.

293
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,990
Stay.

294
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,380
Xiaoman, you handle the calls.

295
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,220
Inform the bureau immediately if anything goes wrong.

296
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,940
Yes.

297
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,950
Let's go!

298
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,630
Yes.

299
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,200
Xu, Xiaoman,

300
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,380
do you have the files on the agents

301
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,360
in 1947?

302
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,970
Find them for me as soon as possible.

303
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,250
1947?

304
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,460
I don't have them.

305
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,170
I asked you for them last time.

306
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,900
You said they're in the bureau.

307
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,580
My memory must be slipping.

308
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,800
Alright, Xu, I'm going to the bureau to get them.

309
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,850
Chen, let me go get them for you.

310
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,910
What are you doing?

311
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,630
This is my job!

312
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,810
What is... What is wrong with Chen?

313
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,820
Comrade, can you hurry up?

314
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,500
I've got an urgent situation.

315
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,610
Falcon, this is Nyctibius.

316
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,140
Li Yuquan is hiding

317
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,900
in Room 403 of Jian'an Apartment.

318
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,070
Lu Zhengyang has sent someone there.

319
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,540
You have to get rid of him before the police!

320
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,750
Otherwise, we'll all be doomed!

321
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:37,830
Hello?

322
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,910
Director, I've confirmed that Chen is an agent.

323
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,100
Don't alert him.

324
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,450
Wait until we return.

325
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,050
Okay. Okay.

326
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,700
What happened?

327
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,350
Chen really is the mole.

328
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,510
He contacted Xu Wei.

329
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,780
Once Xu Wei gets close,

330
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,790
pull the curtains to close in on him.

331
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,990
Okay.

332
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,390
Come and have a look.

333
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,830
Everyone, come and have a look.

334
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,310
Sweet and crisp apples.

335
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,440
Come and have a look.

336
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,660
Cigarettes of Pirate.

337
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,590
Cigarettes!

338
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,250
Shoeshine!

339
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,110
Shoeshine!

340
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,510
Cigarettes for sale!

341
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,750
Come and have a look.

342
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,580
Fresh apples. Have a look.

343
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,790
Shoeshine!

344
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,350
Cigarettes for sale!

345
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,670
Come and have a look.

346
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,150
Fresh apples. Have a look.

347
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,550
Cigarettes for sale. Cigarettes.

348
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,220
Come and have a look.

349
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,310
Shoeshine!

350
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,260
Cigarettes for sale!

351
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,460
Cigarettes for sale!

352
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,360
Who fired the shot?

353
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,100
Let's get out of here!

354
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,690
Get off!

355
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,050
The man at the intersection is Xu Wei.

356
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,310
Send the signal to arrest him.

357
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,770
We can't catch up with him.

358
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,610
If Xu Wei knows

359
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,090
we are lying in ambush,

360
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,050
Shrike will definitely realize

361
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,970
this is a trap.

362
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,610
It'll ruin everything.

363
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,790
You mean...

364
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,950
Let's pretend this is our first trip here

365
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,750
and nothing happened just now.

366
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,720
Let's go.

367
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,230
Huzi.

368
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,410
He's dead.

369
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,330
Send the body to the Forensics Department for an autopsy.

370
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,010
Yes, sir.

371
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,570
Director Lu.

372
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,840
He escaped.

373
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,230
Captain Zhang asked me to report to you.

374
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,970
The shot came from a house that no one lives in

375
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,030
across the street.

376
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,360
Tell Captain Zhang.

377
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,020
Keep this operation a secret.

378
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,630
Yes, sir.

379
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,560
It's a Dumdum bullet again.

380
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,910
Looks like it was the third party again.

381
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,990
Were they trying to kill Xu Wei

382
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,350
or to warn him?

383
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,740
I asked you to keep an eye

384
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,430
on the police and Shrike.

385
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,750
Who asked you to shoot?

386
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,880
Your shot

387
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,590
has put me in the line of fire!

388
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,830
He works for Zheng Lanting.

389
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,430
He must have something to do with Yang's death.

390
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,960
I just couldn't help myself.

391
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,910
I've told you many times

392
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,150
this is not the time for revenge.

393
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,220
This is not the time for revenge!

394
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,690
What if the police find out about you?

395
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,010
What would happen to me?

396
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,910
The police didn't notice anything unusual.

397
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,970
They just took Li Yuquan's body away.

398
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,370
What about Shrike?

399
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,460
What should I do if Shrike finds out about you?

400
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,510
That shot

401
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,270
has forced me to declare war against Shrike!

402
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,710
Mr. Jin, don't worry.

403
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,400
I did that.

404
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,850
If anything goes wrong, I'll take care of it even at the cost of my life.

405
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,090
At the cost of your life?

406
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,960
How much is your life worth?

407
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,440
Use your head!

408
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,380
Leave.

409
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,400
Reflect on yourself.

410
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,310
I don't know who fired the shot.

411
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,020
But I can't think of anyone else apart from the police.

412
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,710
Chief,

413
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,300
I guess the police are hunting Li Yuquan.

414
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,110
Li Yuquan knows Jin Maochang

415
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,790
has been working for us.

416
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,760
If he turns Jin Maochang in,

417
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,060
Mr. Zheng, you'll be exposed too.

418
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,900
Our priority now is to evacuate.

419
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,270
His daughter is still in our hands.

420
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,560
What if you're exposed?

421
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,400
It's too risky.

422
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,680
The transmitter-receiver is in the studio,

423
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,070
and there are many files and telegrams that need to be transferred or destroyed.

424
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,540
Chief, there's still time for us to evacuate.

425
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,390
We must stay calm even in difficult situations!

426
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,790
Through which channel did Jin Maochang

427
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,090
purchase the white phosphorus?

428
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,330
Through the match factory.

429
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,640
The match factory.

430
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,870
Li Yuquan's factory is a sugar factory.

431
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,010
Logically speaking,

432
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,740
this has nothing to do with him.

433
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,930
How did the police

434
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,090
link him to the white phosphorus case?

435
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,530
There's another possibility.

436
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,970
Jin Maochang set a trap

437
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,270
to get rid of our spy.

438
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,470
Yes.

439
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,700
It's very likely.

440
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,470
In other words,

441
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,950
Li Yuquan didn't run away with his money.

442
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,950
Mr. Zheng, does it still matter?

443
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,550
Li Yuquan has been arrested.

444
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,950
It matters a lot.

445
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,720
If this theory is correct,

446
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,820
Jin Maochang definitely knows

447
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,930
Li Yuquan's whereabouts.

448
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,320
Because if Li Yuquan is caught,

449
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,050
the first person to suffer would be Jin Maochang.

450
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,760
Call Jin Maochang to verify it.

451
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,460
Okay.

452
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,580
No one is answering.

453
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,650
Keep calling.

454
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,090
Still no answer.

455
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,840
Try again.

456
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,790
Falcon, this is Nyctibius.

457
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,780
Li Yuquan is hiding

458
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,450
in Room 403 of Jian'an Apartment.

459
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,240
Lu Zhengyang has sent someone there.

460
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,840
You have to get rid of him before the police!

461
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,800
We finally identified the mole.

462
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,310
Just as we expected.

463
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,850
When should we arrest him?

464
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,510
He has already been exposed.

465
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,470
We can arrest him anytime.

466
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,350
If we keep him in place,

467
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,550
we can use him.

468
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,000
It's more helpful to us.

469
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,010
We can also find Shrike

470
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,140
through him.

471
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
Then we can't arouse his suspicion.

472
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,470
We need to keep playing along.

473
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,710
Still no answer.

474
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,390
Try again.

475
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,750
Mr. Zheng, it's too risky.

476
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,090
What if Li Yuquan really ran away with his money?

477
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,900
Considering what Lu Zhengyang and Lin Shaobai are capable of,

478
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,760
he might have already confessed.

479
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,430
Now I increasingly trust

480
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,990
my intuition and judgment.

481
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,880
Let's wait a little longer.

482
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,520
If Jin Maochang doesn't show up before dark,

483
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,940
you, go kill him.

484
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,720
Got it.

485
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,520
We've been running the studio for so long.

486
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,300
We can't expose it easily.

487
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,670
It's Jin Maochang's car.

488
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,930
Go bring him here.

489
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,790
Okay.

490
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,820
If you notice anything wrong with him,

491
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,910
kill him.

492
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,690
Got it.

493
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,380
Is Mr. Zheng here? I have an urgent matter.

494
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,910
Mr. Zheng is waiting for you upstairs.

495
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,450
Do you know Li Yuquan has been arrested?

496
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,620
Yes.

497
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,240
But the police only got his body.

498
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,750
Even Falcon couldn't do it.

499
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,370
How did you manage to do that?

500
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,190
Li Yuquan already died before the police arrived.

501
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,900
I must apologize to you for this personally.

502
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,770
I shouldn't have done it,

503
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,530
but the situation

504
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,290
was too urgent.

505
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,260
If I had waited even a minute longer, the police would have arrived.

506
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,930
So I had to do it without your permission.

507
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,610
Otherwise, we all would've been exposed.

508
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,880
Did your man shoot him?

509
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,250
Yes.

510
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,790
After Li Yuquan died,

511
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,020
I asked my man

512
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,580
to stay there

513
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,080
to keep an eye on the police.

514
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,480
But unexpectedly,

515
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,420
Falcon suddenly appeared.

516
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,730
And the police already arrived at that time.

517
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,550
He had no choice.

518
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,190
My man could only shoot to warn him.

519
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,120
Your man knows him?

520
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,360
Everyone knows Falcon,

521
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,020
since he is on the wanted poster

522
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,860
in the newspaper every day.

523
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,080
A warning shot aimed at my head?

524
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,900
If I hadn't been lucky, my brains would've been blown out.

525
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,450
I wasn't there.

526
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,340
So I don't know how the shot

527
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,300
was fired.

528
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,980
But what I know is

529
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,320
if he hadn't fired the shot,

530
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,980
you would have been arrested.

531
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,700
Mr. Shrike,

532
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,750
the most important thing now is unity.

533
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,030
Unity is always the most important.

534
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,280
You...

535
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,630
can go rest now.

536
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,590
Yes, sir.

537
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,910
Jin.

538
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,930
We talked about the white phosphorus at your place last time.

539
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,810
Did you think of putting the blame

540
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,740
on Li Yuquan soon after that?

541
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,270
Jin,

542
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,940
do you play Go?

543
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,870
No.

544
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Impressive.

545
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,390
You thought ten steps ahead.

546
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,060
Nothing can escape your eyes.

547
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,510
I was really scared at that time.

548
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,880
I was worried if the police dug deeper,

549
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,910
I wouldn't know what to say.

550
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,020
I just wanted to find a scapegoat.

551
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,780
Li Yuquan seemed honest

552
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,430
and easy to deal with.

553
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,160
So I pinned everything on him.

554
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,950
But I really didn't expect

555
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,460
that he was your man.

556
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,040
If I had known,

557
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,880
I never would've made that mistake.

558
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,210
Now that he's dead,

559
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,240
you can completely feel relieved.

560
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,970
The most important thing in printmaking is

561
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,180
making each cut with confidence and precision.

562
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,900
One wrong cut

563
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,530
will ruin

564
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,920
the whole piece.

565
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,040
When the knife is in your hand,

566
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,580
even a mistake

567
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,310
can be turned

568
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,800
into a masterpiece.

569
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,940
I'm here in person today.

570
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,420
If there's anything I've done wrong,

571
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,370
Mr. Shrike, please guide me.

572
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,740
No, no.

573
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,220
What you did

574
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,030
is impressive.

575
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,430
You killed four birds with one stone.

576
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,580
You killed Li Yuquan,

577
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,860
saved Falcon,

578
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,130
and protected Ogura.

579
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,600
And I'm here, calm and at ease.

580
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,840
You did a good job.

581
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,850
At my age,

582
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,440
I just want peace.

583
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,409
Don't let the appellation "Old Jin"

584
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
fool you.

585
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,239
You're still young.

586
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,280
To be exact,

587
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,199
you're tougher and more ambitious

588
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,429
as you grow old.

589
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,920
I'm not ambitious.

590
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,340
I'm just taking things one step at a time.

591
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,139
Keeping myself alive is enough for me.

00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,860
The best days are yet to come.

593

People like you

can live to 120 at least.

595
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,670
I-I think we've covered

596
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,630
everything that should be discussed, right?

597
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,310
Yes.

598
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,870
I won't ask you to stay then.

599
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,390
Goodbye.

600
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,360
See you.

[Changjiang Warehouse] [Incendiary bombs]

602
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,170
Li Yuquan

603
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,800
was in charge of the lab for researching anthrax

604
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,530
and other biological weapons.

605
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,050
He had a special identity.

606
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,640
Shrike knows

607
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,920
everything about him.

608
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
So it fits Shrike's style to kill him

609
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,060
before we could reach him.

610
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,580
I'm really frustrated.

611
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,050
We finally tracked down Li Yuquan,

612
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,660
but the agents got to him first.

[Map of Shanghai]

614
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,900
So,

615
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,880
before we took action,

616
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,700
the agents already knew Li Yuquan

[Changjiang Warehouse] [Incendiary bombs]

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,760
We've been dealing with Shrike

620
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,910
for a long time.

621
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,150
He is proud and arrogant.

Everyone, don't be discouraged.

623
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,050
We managed to track down Li Yuquan.

624
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,580
I believe we're not far from finding Shrike.

625
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,270
Yes.

626
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,610
Director Lu is right.

627
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:15,740
Comrades,

628
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,790
we've sabotaged agents' operations

629
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,190
countless times before.

630
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,520
It's fine even though we failed this time.

631
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,660
Even Li Yuquan, a high-ranking agent,

632
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,590
wrote a confession.

633
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,610
What does it show?

634
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,620
It shows the Shanghai Special Station is losing its influence.

635
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,630
Like grasshoppers in autumn,

636
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,110
they won't be able to jump around for much longer.

637
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,180
Catching Shrike

638
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,020
is only a matter of time.

639
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,110
So comrades,

640
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,170
we must pull ourselves together.

641
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,510
We must come out on top in the next mission.

642
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,180
As expected from an old comrade,

643
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,780
what you said is reasonable.

644
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,070
You mean...

645
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,790
Chen hasn't realized

646
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,650
he has been exposed.

647
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,980
Instead of arresting him now, we should

648
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,590
adopt a long-term plan to catch someone higher-ranking. Right?

649
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,260
Yes.

650
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,120
For an agent like Chen,

651
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,750
immediate capture and interrogation

652
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,480
might not be the best strategy.

653
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,510
If we leave him in place,

654
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,800
we might be able to use him to track down Shrike

655
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,200
and destroy the Shanghai Special Station.

656
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,150
That's a good idea.

657
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,130
But we have to keep everything under control.

658
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,990
This is very important,

659
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,500
so I need to discuss it with the higher-ups.

660
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,930
I'll let you know immediately

661
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,260
once a decision is made.

662
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,300
Got it.

663
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,320
I knew you'd be eating vegetarian food again.

664
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,050
Fortunately, I prepared this.

665
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,430
All these go perfectly with wine.

666
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,030
There's another good thing.

667
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,960
Chili sauce.

668
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,170
You're so generous.

669
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,890
Through Li Yuquan,

670
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,310
we uncovered a mole.

671
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,090
The bureau asked us to keep it under wraps for now,

672
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,590
but I think

673
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,890
the three of us can still celebrate

674
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,270
privately.

675
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,940
Come on, cheers.

676
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,160
Quietly.

677
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,570
Celebrate.

678
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,830
Here, try these pig ears.

679
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,400
I went a long way to buy them.

680
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,350
Right,

681
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,120
try this chili sauce.

682
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,000
Li Yaohong

683
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,300
has become a fan of chilies because of me.

684
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,330
Really? It's so spicy and you can still handle it?

685
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,150
Yes.

686
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,070
I'm from Shanghai, but I'm not used to this.

687
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,000
We're brothers in the same trench.

688
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,670
We couldn't have succeeded this time

689
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,940
if any one of us was absent.

690
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,950
So,

691
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,890
you've got to

692
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,610
try some chili sauce too.

693
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,540
It's too spicy.

694
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,390
You're so optimistic.

695
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,910
We still haven't tracked down

696
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,470
the third party that killed Wang Liqun

697
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,540
and Li Yuquan.

698
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,710
We've only solved

699
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,600
half the case.

700
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,320
Don't you know the investigation direction

701
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,570
of the other half?

702
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,360
What do you mean?

703
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,920
Now that Li Yuquan is dead,

704
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,500
Jin Maochang's suspicion in the whereabouts

705
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,700
of white phosphorus and the anthrax in the sugar factory

706
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,240
has been wiped clean.

707
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,790
He's the one who has benefited the most.

708
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,540
Right?

709
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,560
In terms of benefits,

710
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,710
the biggest winner should be Shrike, right?

711
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,180
With Li Yuquan dead,

712
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,630
Shrike is safe.

713
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,780
Not necessarily.

714
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,290
The third party killed Wang Liqun first.

715
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,180
Then they killed Li Yuquan.

716
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,120
Wang Liqun was the one

717
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,010
who killed Mr. Liu from the textile factory.

718
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,310
Li Yuquan was the mastermind behind the theft of white phosphorus in the sugar factory.

719
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,360
Both of them

720
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,080
had deep ties to Jin Maochang.

721
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,910
There's no way that was just a coincidence.

722
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,250
You're right.

723
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,000
Your suspicion is reasonable too.

724
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,180
But we have no evidence now.

725
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,970
Lu, you always emphasize the importance of evidence.

726
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:30,770
There will be.

727
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,430
It's just a matter of time.

728
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,410
Of course we will investigate the third party.

729
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,730
But now we should focus

730
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,680
on the mole,

731
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,720
Chen.

732
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,590
Come on.

733
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,160
Let's make another toast.

734
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:45,660
Come on.

735
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,590
Dad,

736
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,930
I haven't seen you drink for a long time.

737
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,110
Li Yuquan's case is closed.

738
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,940
I'm happy,

739
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,350
so I'm having a drink.

740
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,180
Luckily, we stopped him in time.

741
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,260
If the secretly developed anthrax was unleashed,

742
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,100
it would be a disaster for Shanghai.

743
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,820
He and the people behind him are truly crazy.

744
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,160
Luckily, the case is closed.

745
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,860
Otherwise, I could have been dragged into this mess,

746
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,590
and it would be hard to explain.

747
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,660
With all the noise they made,

748
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,560
you didn't notice anything at all?

749
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,490
I promise you

750
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,290
I didn't notice anything.

751
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,500
I've explained everything

752
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,870
to Director Lu

753
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,400
and Shaobai.

754
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,950
It's all in the past.

755
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,240
Stop being worried.

756
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,160
Let's eat then.

757
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,560
An admission letter from Professor Lin Ji!

758
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,710
[Forensic training program in Nanjing
Admission letter for Jin Yan]

759
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,760
Dad, you know what?

760
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,800
I've read all of his books.

761
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,230
Professor Lin Ji

762
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,550
will offer a forensic

763
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,990
training program in Nanjing.

764
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,450
I applied. I've been waiting for the result.

765
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,150
How did you get the admission letter?

766
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,030
I didn't pull strings.

767
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,260
I know you want to learn from him,

768
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,070
so I sent your files

769
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,520
and some of your papers

770
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,790
to Mr. Lin

771
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,050
through a professor.

772
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,050
I didn't expect such a quick reply.

773
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,690
Looks like Mr. Lin

774
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,250
is very impressed with you.

775
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,800
[Forensic training program in Nanjing
Admission letter for Jin Yan]

776
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,950
The program will start after Chinese New Year.

777
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,880
Thank you, Dad.

778
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,100
Seeing you so happy

779
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,570
makes everything worthwhile.

780
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,480
Dad,

781
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,680
a toast to you.

782
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,540
Cheers.

783
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,270
Before Jin Maochang left, he said

784
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,080
he could transfer Ogura

785
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,260
to a safer place.

786
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,520
What do you think?

787
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,240
He thought his plan worked.

788
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,120
He said that to get under our skin.

789
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,900
Get under whose skin?

790
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,000
Do you think he has the guts?

791
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,000
Jin Maochang made a careful plan.

792
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,270
He got the police to keep an eye on Li Yuquan.

793
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,750
By stirring things up on both sides,

794
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,690
he managed to eliminate the spy we planted

795
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,530
around him.

796
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,830
Ogura's research institute

797
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,090
was also kicked out of the sugar factory.

798
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,060
I have to admit

799
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,040
that was a smart move.

800
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,270
Kill with a borrowed sword.

801
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,100
Now we have no choice

802
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,000
but to suffer in silence.

803
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,060
Yes.

804
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,810
That was indeed a smart move.

805
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,050
But he has forgotten who we are.

806
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,550
We can flip the board anytime.

807
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,510
Exactly.

808
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,410
Eat before you leave.

809
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,000
Okay.
