195

197
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,920

199
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,030

200
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,560
It's the world of the Communist Party.

201
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,230

202
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,470

203
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,400

204
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,350
want me

205
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,900

206
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,090
Mr. Zheng, you're the one who saved me. You're the one who saved me. You're the one who saved me.

207
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,650
After all, me saving you

208
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,120
was my personal behavior.

209
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,430

214
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,280
you need to prove your value.

215
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,480
