Is your transfer happening so suddenly?

382
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,340
I didn't expect

383
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,470

Lanting,

401
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,350
I'd like to ask you first.

402
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,420
Given the current situation,

403
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,470
do you think we can fight our way back?

404
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,620
I'd say there's still a chance.

405
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,180
After all, we still have an army of a million.

406
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,350
And we control the entire Southwest and the two Guang provinces.

407
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,360
Besides, the President was still stationed in Guangzhou just a few days ago.

408
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
So, I believe this game isn't over yet,

409
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,370
and there's always a chance to turn the tide.

410
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,720
I'm not so optimistic.

411
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,830
I think being able to negotiate peace would already be good enough.

412
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,410
The overall situation depends on both international and domestic factors.

413
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,780
The contradictions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union

414
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,470
are growing day by day.

415
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,860
So, World War III could break out at any time.

416
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,170
And once it does,

417
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,710
the Americans will undoubtedly

418
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,590
support us with all their might.

419
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,170
At that point,

420
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,660
won't we have the opportunity to counterattack?

421
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,390
So, I think it's still uncertain who will win in the end.

422
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,770
But the Americans and the British

423
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,460
have always been supporting us.

424
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,670
We lost the country ourselves.

425
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,290
Then we'll fight to take it back!

426
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,970
The economic war may indeed have been lost,

427
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,630
But we still hold control

428
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,440
over the seas and the skies.

429
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,400
So I believe, as long as we persist,

430
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,180

431
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,810

00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:27,950
Lu.

561
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,870
-Director Lu.
-Director.

562
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,590
Come on.

563
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,550
Come closer, everyone.

564
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,310
Where's your injury?

565
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,540
Squat down properly.

566
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,080
My butt.

567
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,950
My butt.

568
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,230
One, two, three.

569
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,780
Come on.

570
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,360
Eat well from now on, alright?

571
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,290
And keep working hard.

572
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,610
Don't any of you slack off.

573
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,230
I'll come back to check whenever I have time.

574
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,970
Alright?

575
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,960
Can't bear to leave, huh?

576
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,110
It stinks in here.

577
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,020
I can't wait to leave.

578
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,270
When you just arrived,

579
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,910
you hadn't even unpacked before you went to talk to them, shovel dung, and feed them,

580
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,770
afraid of neglecting any of them.

581
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,530
How should I put it?

582
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,150
You are very focused, able to calm down.

583
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,390
You're not as restless as you used to be.

584
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,150
Yan is praising me.

585
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,630
During this time, it seemed like I was feeding them,

586
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,000
but in fact, I learned a lot from them too.

587
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,970
Just like in those martial arts novels,

588
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,520
where the protagonists get injured, falls off a cliff,

589
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,910
and think they're doomed,

590
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,520
but end up discovering martial arts secrets.

591
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,730
What secret manual?

592
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,870
I used to always say

593
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,250
I wanted to be the iron wall of this city.

594
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,400
Before, I wanted to do it,

595
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,460
but I always felt like

596
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,570
someone was holding me back,

597
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,050
stopping me from doing it.

598
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,460
But now, it's different.

599
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,950
Now, following Lu and the others,

600
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,340
I realize that not only is no one holding me back,

601
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,270
but there are people pushing me forward from behind.

602
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,060
Together,

603
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,320
we not only successfully saved Uncle Jin and the others,

604
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,980
but we also protected the supplies at the docks.

605
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,460
Do you know?

606
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,980
Not long ago, when the People's Republic of China was founded,

607
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,180
I was standing on the street, watching.

608
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,230
The parade formations.

609
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,860
The streets were packed, people everywhere,

610
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,490
everyone holding banners, shouting slogans.

611
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,600
I could see

612
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,690
that the people of Shanghai

613
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,220
were genuinely happy, from the bottom of their hearts.

614
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,890
At that moment,

615
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,470
I felt really proud.

616
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,670
Shaobai, you've changed.

617
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,190
I haven't changed.

618
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,140
It's this environment that's changed.

619
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,080
Take Office 2, for example.

620
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,880
Let's not talk about Lu.

621
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,890
But Xiaoman, Huzi, Xu,

622
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,240
and even Li Yaohong.

623
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,780
Each of them is like a flame.

624
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,280
Our Office 2 is like a furnace.

625
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,580
With us all together,

626
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,390
we influence each other one by one.

627
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,560
With them around,

628
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,720
I couldn't help but catch fire myself.

629
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,980
I've realized something.

630
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,180
One person can't be an iron wall,

631
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,660
but a group of people can.

632
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,900
Actually, what you said, Chairman Mao has said it too.

633
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,910
Really?

634
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,360
What did the Chairman say?

635
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,220
His secret manual has just three words,

636
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,490
"Serve the People."

637
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
"Serve the People."

638
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,110
"Serve the People."

639
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,230
I kind of get it, but also kind of don't.

640
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,290
I'll understand it in time.

641
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,460
Enough about me. How about you?

642
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,360
What's been going on with you lately?

643
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,910
I've been investigating anthrax bacteria recently,

644
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,640
and I've found some anomalies.

645
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,710
What happened?

646
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,310
I'm not sure yet.

647
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,930
I'll let you know when I have more information.

648
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,610
Alright.

649
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,200
It's getting late. Let's go.

650
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,040
Wait for me a moment.

651
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,470
Mr. Jin.

652
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,830
Mr. Jin. We know exactly how much money

653
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,260
is in your account.

654
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,000
What Wang Liqun told you,

655
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,920
you need to take it to heart.

656
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,900
We know how much money is in your account,

657
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,920
better than you do.

658
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,560
Mr. Jin,

659
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,650
we thoroughly checked your house,

660
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,850
your car, study,

661
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,020
and office, inside and out.

662
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:03,200
We didn't find any listening or eavesdropping devices.

663
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,600
You can rest easy.

664
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,670
Rest easy, Mr. Jin.

665
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,800
When I handle things, you can trust me.

666
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,630
Everything has been checked.

667
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,240
Good.

668
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,600
It's good that it's clean.

669
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,030
I've also been investigating these days.

670
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,320
If it's not a matter of listening devices or bugs,

671
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,510
then it must be a problem with someone.

672
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,780
Shrike knows my situation

673
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,320
inside out.

674
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,200
I suspect he's planted a mole

675
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,800
near me.

676
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,910
Planted a mole?

677
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,380
Who could it be?

678
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,900
When something unusual happens, there's always a reason.
