14
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,910
I suspect an agent is causing trouble.

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,260
Okay. Okay.

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,390
I'm fine.

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,710
Okay.

You can ask Jin Yan if you don't believe me.

If you suspect Jin Yan

86
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,630
might cover for me

87
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,270
and thus, her testimony is unreliable,

88
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,710
you can ask the Jin family's chauffeur.

89
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,150
If you still don't believe the chauffeur,

90
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,230
you can ask Wang's Chestnuts.

91
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,510
We bought three catties of chestnuts on the way.

92
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,310

93
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,170
Watch your mouth.

Let me check again.

95
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,870
You ate until nine o'clock,

96
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,710
and you went out to buy three catties of chestnuts to continue to eat, right?

97
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,670
Yes.

98
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,510
Is it against the law to eat chestnuts, officer?

99
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,590
Alright, we'll go

100
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,120
to confirm with the boss of Wang's Chestnuts.

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,650
Do you have anything else to say?

102
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,490
Not for now.

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,560
You can go back now.

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,730
You don't have any idea yet, right?

105
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,870
I don't mind helping.

106

No need.

107
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,130
I don't mean anything else.

I'm okay with offering some help.

111
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,170

Thank you for your cooperation.

113
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,210
You can go back now.

Huzi.

115
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,830
You're even a member of the auxiliary personnel.

116
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,760
You can't participate in the case.

117
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,100
Fine.

118
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,940
What's the big deal?

119
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,070
According to the victim's family and the workers in the factory,

120
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,260
Jin's Textile Factory

121
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,060
was originally Liu Mingjian's.

122
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,380
After we won the Counter-Japanese War in 1945,

123
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,170
you returned to Shanghai from Chongqing

124
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,560
and took over his factory.

125
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,530
His business was very poor.

126
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,260
If I didn't invest,

127
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,470
his factory would've gone bankrupt.

128
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,680
My investment in it was a favor for him.

129
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,430
But as far as we know,

130
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,440
he didn't think so.

131
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,350
He thought you

132
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,670
took his factory.

133
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,790
He had a lot of complaints in private.

134
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,700
Besides, you were the only one

135
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,780
who went into the factory last night.

136
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,920
Officers,

137
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,780
I confess.

138
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,700
During the Counter-Japanese War,

139
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,130
I once

140
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,440
provided funds for NBIS's

141
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,320

142
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,080
The transactions of their bases

144
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,960
disguised as

145
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,990
clinics,

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,280
grocery stores,

147
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,500
and restaurants

148
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,290
all go through my account.

149
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
A few days ago, Mr. Liu

150
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,890
came to me with those accounts

151
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,050
and threatened me

152
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,190
to transfer the factory to him for free.

153
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,200
If I refused,

154
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,790
he'd report me to you.

155
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,390
For a few moments,

156
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,110
I...

157
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,030
Indeed, I wanted him to die.

158
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,550
But after thinking about it,

159
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,970
killing people for such a trivial matter

160
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,510
is not my style.

161
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,400
Even if I wanted to get rid of him,

162
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,030
I wouldn't be so stupid

163
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,990
to do it in my office.

164
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,940
This might be a more sophisticated disguise.

165
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,510
Jin Maochang,

166
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,990
you have a motive for murder

167
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,430
but no alibi.

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
It's hard not to suspect you.

169
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,990
Officer, what do you mean?

170
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,680
You have to be responsible for what you say.

171
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,660
Just a routine inquiry.

172
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,250
Please understand.

173
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,980
Please don't go far these days.

174
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,210
I believe the government will clear my name.

175
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,580
I won't go anywhere during this period.

176
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,630
Liu

177
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,630
seldom offended people.

178
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,710
And he was kind.

179
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,520
Who on earth killed him?

180
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,430
You'd better stay home during this period

181
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,190
until the case is solved.

182
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,770
I did nothing wrong. What's there to be afraid of?

183
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,210
Mr. Liu's death is really strange.

184
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,460
I suspect

185
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,810
it's very likely their real target was not him,

186
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,040
but you.

187
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,880
Or, they want to use this to warn you.

188
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,130
Warn me?

189
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,630
About what?

190
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,860
I don't know yet.

191
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,910
But don't worry, Uncle Jin.

192
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,650
I'll keep investigating this case.

193
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,280
They want to hurt my friends and family?

194
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,740
Don't even think about it!

195
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,960
Shaobai, I'm satisfied with what you said.

196
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,430
I heard that

197
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,600
all the old police officers

198
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,510
were retained.

199
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,550
What do you think?

200
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,460
If you were an officer,

201
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,150
with something like this happening,

202
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,710
it'd be much easier for me.

203
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,790
Uncle Jin,

204
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,980
now, there's hardly any profit in the police station,

205
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,860
only a bunch of rigid rules.

206
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,140
If I were in the bureau, I'd be tied down and restricted.

207
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,600
But they are

208
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,420
good at one thing.

209
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,200
At least they won't trample on human life.

210
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,580
It's too early

211
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,070
to make such a conclusion.

212
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,230
At least that Lu

213
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,340
is too inflexible to do that.

214
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,840
The victim had a habit.

215
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,030
[Case of Liu Mingjian]

216
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,490
Before he left every day,

217
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,110
around nine o'clock,

218
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,880
he would put the accounts he had arranged

219
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,440
on Jin Maochang's desk.

220
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,990
That way,

221
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,070
Jin Maochang could see it first thing the next day.

222
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,010
[Case of Liu Mingjian]

223
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,790
So, we can infer that

224
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,910
the victim

225
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,790
was probably killed at this time.

226
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,620
Besides,

227
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,550
we didn't find any traces

228
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,860
of pulling at the scene.

229
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,310
So, we can conclude that

230
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,780
Jin Maochang's office

231
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,390
is the first crime scene.

232
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,030
The victim was quite popular

233
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,830
and rarely had conflicts with people.

234
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,530
For now,

235
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,240
only Jin Maochang has a strong motive to kill.

236
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,380
Judging from the victim's wound,

[Case of Liu Mingjian]

238
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,280
the murderer should be a professional killer.

239
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,740
It's hard for Jin Maochang to do it at his age.

240
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,870
Did the forensic report come out?

241
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,550
I just asked. Not yet.

242
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,300

243
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,100

Director Lu needs it urgently.

When the body was sent here, Director Lu said

252
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,230
I should avoid suspicion about this case.

253
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,030
Yes, that is the case,

255
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,090

Let's put aside the fact that my mistakes might delay the case.

My level of autopsy skills

263
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,000
really does a disservice to the deceased.

264
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,670

270
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,070
Did I emphasize discipline with you?

271
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,710
Yes.

272
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,760
Why did you violate it?

273
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,490
I'm not skilled enough,

274
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,470

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,260
Director Lu,

276
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,110
we should abide by the discipline,

Liu Rui can't do an autopsy alone now.

00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,350

You should understand.

282
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,070
I have a suggestion.

283
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,270
Let's not discuss the case today,

285
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,440

286

I won't do anything.

287
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,440
I'll only instruct him by the side.

If you're still not assured,

289
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,540
you can put on the autopsy suit and supervise it.

It's not good if the case is delayed

our target's life routine,

321
