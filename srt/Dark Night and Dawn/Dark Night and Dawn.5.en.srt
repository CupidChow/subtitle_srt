00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,950
Everything is in its original place.

192
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,800
I said I would clean this room myself.

193
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
It's been four years.

194
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,530
I also want to pay respects to Madam.

195
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,240
Falcon has become increasingly slack.

196
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,130
We need to strengthen our forces.

197
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,510
I've already taken leave.

198
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,310
I'm going to Zhoushan tomorrow.

199
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,310
I'll go with you.

200
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,800
No, you stay home.

201
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,670
Alright.

202
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:15,300
[On an Island in Zhoushan]

203
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,790
Shanghai has fallen.

204
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,580
Shrike, I didn't expect you to break through the blockade

205
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,930
to see the Director.

206
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,070
It's all a matter of effort.

207
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,440
The Communists are keeping a tight watch.

208
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,220
With such a long coastline, there are bound to be some wild docks.

209
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,990
The Director is waiting for you.

210
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,140
Then please lead the way.

211
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,830
Please.

212
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,480
Come in.

213
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,660
Is everything alright?

214
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,310
Come in.

215
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,360
It seems

216
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,330
there is no direct evidence

217
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,230
proving that Lin Shaobai is connected to the agents.

218
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,160
On the contrary,

219
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,760
he helped quite a lot with searching for Luo San

220
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
and the case of the stolen gold bars.

221
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,730
One thing at a time.

222
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,730
Before the matters from that year are clarified,

223
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,930
we must not let him go.

224
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,150
Not to let him go,

225
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,670
but to let him relax.

226
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,580
On one hand,

227
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,150
we need to lower his guard

228
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,020
and draw out what he knows.

229
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
On the other hand,

230
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,160
we must ensure he remains under your control.

231
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
In finding out these agents,

232
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Lin Shaobai is very likely the key.

233
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,270
As for how to use him specifically,

234
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,570
it depends on you.

235
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,420
Director.

236
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,440
Come in.

237
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,640
Lanting.

238
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,990
Director.

239
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,430
Thank you for your hard work.

240
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,420
Please, have a seat.

241
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,880
Your bold act of robbing the gold vault

242
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,670
[Bank vault robbery]

243
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,070
has even reached the ears of the Chairman.

244
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,520
I came specially from Xiamen to commend you.

245
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,610
I must admit,

246
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,950
most of the gold bars

247
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,710
were intercepted by the Public Security Bureau.

248
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,890
What our party lacks now is not money,

249
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,040
but morale.

250
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,640
If we do more of these kinds of things,

251
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,940
and stir up some commotion in Shanghai,

252
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,850
the higher-ups will know

253
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,430
that it's our NBIS people

254
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,190
charging forward in Shanghai.

255
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,240
With that list in hand,

256
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,440
it's not hard to stir up

257
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,650
Shanghai.

258
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,190
The list.

259
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,490
This list

260
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,960
contains not only undercover agents,

261
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,620
but also some important figures

262
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,420
from various social circles

263
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,090
who have cooperated with us.

264
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,790
So it's classified as top secret.

265
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,810
If you want this list now,

266
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,610
there must be some conditions for exchange, right?

267
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,200
Director, you mean?

268
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,840
The trump card you have.

269
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,620
You've been holding it for four years.

270
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,990
It should be used now.

271
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,840
What if I don't?

272
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,720
You should be aware of the NBIS's discipline.

273
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,740
After all these years, you always disobey orders

274
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,750
and secretly hold onto Xiaocang.

275
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,250
By rights,

276
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,630
you should have been dealt with a long time ago.

277
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,640
If you say that, then I certainly can't use it.

278
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,950
Director,

279
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,220
I fully understand your point.

280
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,370
But Xiaocang

281
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,550
is the most important part of my Sea Subversion Plan.

282
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,310
You could say

283
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,740
he is my

284
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,030
trump card.

285
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,880
What do you mean?

286
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,780
You want to use this trump card in Shanghai?

287
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,030
That would be defying the world.

288
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,880
How did the Japanese handle it back then?

289
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,040
Weren't they still covering it up?

290
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,150
If this matter is exposed,

291
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,030
and others catch hold of your weakness,

292
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,790
there would be no place for us in the world.

293
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,040
But one thing I think

294
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,869
you should understand better than I do.

295
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,349
Victors

296
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,540
won't be blamed.

297
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,170
Victors won't be blamed.

298
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,670
That's right.

299
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,940
Makes sense.

300
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,820
Lanting, please sit.

301
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,540
If that's the case,

302
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,190
I must say this in advance.

303
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,700
Once you use this trump card,

304
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,180
whether successful or not,

305
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,660
the Party

306
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,080
will not take responsibility for you.

307
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,190
I, Mao Sen,

308
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,870
have never seen you today.

309
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,790
You can rest assured, Director.

310
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,180
I assure you that

311
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,460
no matter when,

312
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,150
this is my personal action

313
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,580
and has nothing to do with anyone

314
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,270
or any organization.

315
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,510
I will

316
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,080
give the list to you.

317
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,990
But this matter must be carefully considered.

318
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,880
Huzi?

319
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,650
What's the situation?

320
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,260
Can I leave now?

321
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,470
Meal time.

322
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,950
Meal time?

323
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Where's the food?

324
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,000
Your matter has been settled.

325
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
Let's go. We'll have a nice meal.

326
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,600
Wait.

327
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,260
Clarify your words.

328
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,240
What result? What nice meal?

329
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,160
Do you have anything to explain?

330
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,280
This is the last opportunity.

331
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,060
I've explained everything that needs to be explained.

332
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,620
Well.

333
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,380
Make it clear. What result?

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,090
You'll know when you arrive.

335
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,390
Well.

336
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,300
I've done meritorious service. What are you doing?

337
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,700
Stop. What are you doing?

338
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,120
Sit down.

339
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,350
Me?

340
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,780
We'll eat together?

341
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,760
When I tell you to sit, sit down.

343
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,810
How come it's eaten?

344
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,710
Whose is this? It's half-eaten.

345
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,840
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

346
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,100
The handcuffs being removed really makes one feel relieved.

347
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,710
My whole body feels light.

348
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,370
I'm not quite used to it.

349
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,590
You said it was the last meal?

350
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,270
Is this it?

351
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,980
There's not even a piece of meat. It's not sumptuous enough.

352
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,380
This is sumptuous enough.

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,410
Comrade Huzi,

356
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,510
I like to eat vegetarian.

357
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,280
Come, come.

358
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,340
You can't reach it. Eat more.

359
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,550
So delicious.

360
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,680
Director Lu,

361
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,040
your Huzi

362
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,520
need some training.

363
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,890
I thought he was going to take me to be executed just now.

364
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,560
It was my order for him to do so.

365
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,370
I've also helped you quite a lot, haven't I?

366
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,700
Is this how you repay me?

367
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,880
You're quite ungrateful.

368
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,760
We should

369
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,460
thank you for cooperating with our case.

370
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,280
It seems you really only know these things.

371
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,260
Previously, we misunderstood you.

372
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,580
You were indeed accidentally involved.

373
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,540
So once I finish this meal,

374
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,870
I can leave?

375
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,660
Yes.

376

My position as the Xiamen Garrison Commander is not easy.

377
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,990
For me,

378
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,070
you are my eyes and ears

379
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,310
left in Shanghai.

380
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,050
We'll see each other in Zhoushan in the future.

381
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,130
Lanting,

382
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,400
as long as we brothers work together sincerely,

383
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,680
I believe that with your ability,

384
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,220
Shanghai will definitely be turned upside down by you.

385
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,630
That will need your strong support.

386
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,490
By the way, regarding the radio station,

387
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,100
Guiheng is more familiar with it.

388
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,750
Guiheng.

389
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,010
You must fully support Lanting here.

390
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,350
Yes, but it's not so much that I support him.

391
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,690
Rather, I'd like to go through experiences with Shrike.

392
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,890
You're being polite.

393
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm sure the cooperation will be pleasant.

394
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,430
I've looked at your file before.

395
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,290
Before the incident in 1945,

396
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,030
you solved many cases

397
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,150
and even received awards.

398
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,550
But after that,

399
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,620
there are no records of case handling.

400
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,270
Back then, there were many cases

401
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,290
were forged by the police themselves.

402
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,020
People with money and power,

403
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,160
even if they committed crimes and were locked up,

404
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,960
they'd be released in a few days.

405
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,030
Otherwise, why do the common people

406
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,500
call us "black-skin dogs"

407
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,940
or "the loyal dogs of the upper class"?

408
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,210
You look down on this profession,

409
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,870
yet you've stayed in the police for so many years.

410
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,410
It's not quite like that.

411
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,540
Being a police officer at least means having a gun.

412
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,980
I wouldn't be bullied.

413
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,730
I could also look after the neighbors.

414
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,330
Most importantly,

415
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,230
I need to make a living too.

416
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,140
Lin Shaobai,

417
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,720
now that liberation has come,

418
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,070
things are different from before.

419
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,670
You, with your experience in handling cases

420
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,120
and your abilities,

421
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,860
should consider

422
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,400
joining us.

423
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,990
According to the rules,

424
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,310
you wouldn't normally be eligible.

425
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,630
I made a special request

426
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,450
to get you a spot.

427
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,690
[Water Conservation]

428
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,770
Mr. Lu.

429
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:31,200
[Food Is the Most Important Thing]

430
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,910
Right.

431
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,220
You're Director Lu.

432
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,030
Given your position,

433
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,340
is it possible to get me

434
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,240
a small section chief role?

435
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,150
With your situation,

436
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,850
being able to get into the Social Affairs Office is already very special.

437
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:48,840
[Food Is the Most Important Thing]

438
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,750
What I managed to get you

439
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,900
can only be an extra position.

440
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,360
What does "extra" mean?

441
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,260
Temporary?

442
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,110
Pretty much. Just...

443
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,470
Don't explain further.

444
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,830
How much is the salary?

445
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,760
[Food Is the Most Important Thing]

446
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,560
The salary can only be half.

447
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,600
But I guarantee you,

448
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,550
[Food Is the Most Important Thing]

449
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,150
you'll have the highest salary among the extra staff

450
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,790
in the Social Affairs Office.

451
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,720
As for the position you mentioned,

452
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,740
work well,

453
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,620
and you'll get good results.

454
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,960
You're starting to look more and more like Ye Shiwu.

455
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,200
He's the best at playing the game

456
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,910
of filling our stomachs with illusions.

457
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:31,960
[Food Is the Most Important Thing]

458
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,320
I'm full. I won't eat this pie.

459
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,510
You keep it for yourself.

460
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,880
Extra.

461
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,460
I won't even take a formal position.

462
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,390
So arrogant.

463
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,690
This isn't arrogance.

464
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,480
It's valuing my life. Don't you understand?

465
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,690
[After the meal, clean up and keep it clean]

466
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,330
Who are you dealing with?

467
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,640
Those merciless big agents.

468
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,210
If I join you,

469
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,340
I'll be risking my life.

470
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,870
And the salary is only half.

471
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,280
Anyway, with you protecting Shanghai,

472
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
I'm quite reassured.

473
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,170
One less person won't make much difference.

474
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,280
I want to leave. You won't force me to stay, will you?

475
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,240
You are free now.

476
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,060
That's exactly what I was waiting to hear.

477
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,380
Come, let's raise a glass for our freedom.

478
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,410
[After the meal, clean up and keep it clean]

479
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,630
To you.

480
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,030
It's fine. You're free to do as you please.

481
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,830
I'll drink up.

482
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm leaving.

[Water Conservation]

484
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,270
Wait a moment.

485
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,880
You've changed my mind?

486
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,120
Changed my mind about what?

487
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Where is my Liuyi?

488
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,710
Shouldn't it be returned now?

489
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,340
Yes.

490
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,030
Of course, it must be returned to you.

491
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,020
I heard that recently, all the big shots coming from the island.

492
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,950
Don't ask what shouldn't be asked.

493
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,740
Keep an eye on things. I need to take a leak.

494
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,010
Bro, sorry.

495
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,320
I just want to go back.

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,960

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,320
Going this time,

501
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,860
there are many risks.

502
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,010
You need to take care of yourself.

503
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,800
What's going on?

504
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,600
Report. It's Xu Wei.

505
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,570
He took down one of our fellows and escaped.

506
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,830
We are pursuing him with all our efforts.

507
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,860
Once caught, deal with him on the spot.

508
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,590
Understood.

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,180
Director, you should go back.

510
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,070
I'll handle this.

511
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,550
Okay.

512
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,560
Sorry for not seeing you off.

513
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,290
Alright, Director, take care.

I'm here to check.

517
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,300
Xu Wei hasn't boarded the ship, has he?

518
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,180
Rest assured.

519
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,210
It's safe here. Everything is fine.

520
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,890
The ship will set sail soon. Secretary Liu, will you be accompanying us?

521

No.

522
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,020
Then I'll go report to the Director.

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,650
Alright.

00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,900
You,

Why have you gained weight again?

529
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,380
Not bad.

530
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,530
Looks like you're feeding Liuyi well.

531
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,750
It's easy to raise. It eats whatever is given.

532
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,550
Of course.

533
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,390

534
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,390
Is that right?

It's called June 1st.

536
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,320
Was it born on June 1st?

537
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,850
It was picked up on June 1st.

538
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,350
That day, I found it on my way home.

539

It was pouring rain.

540
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,200
As soon as it saw me, it rubbed against me

541
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,280
and followed me all the way.

542
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,210
I had no choice but to bring it home.

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,010
Alright, Liuyi.

545
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,260
No, say "farewell forever."

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,900
We'll never meet again.

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,340
Bro, you're really letting him go just like that?

548
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,400
He didn't clarify the matter from four years ago.

549
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,510
Deputy Commissioner Yang is right.

550

Without direct evidence,

551
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,260
he won't say anything.

552
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,050
There's no point in dragging it out with him.

[Lin's Home]

554
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,550
If you don't want it, just leave.

555

Lin Shaobai, now that liberation has come.

760
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,830
It's different from before.

761
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,650
Consider

762
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,110
joining us.

763
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,830
How about it, Zhang?

764
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,710
I asked my newsboy friends.

765
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,510
They've looked everywhere, even their shoes have worn out.

766
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,170
You need to give me more money.

767
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,860
Here.

768
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,070
How is it? Has anyone seen him?

769
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,430
We've asked everywhere, from the streets to the stations and docks.

770
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,490
No one has seen him.

771
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,870
Take the photo.

772
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,190
Distribute this money

773
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,010
to your newsboy friends.

774
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,770
If you can find this person,

775
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,390
the money in the wallet is yours.

776
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,760
Alright, Officer Lin.

777
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,140
I'm not a police officer anymore.

778
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,060
Just call me Brother.

779
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,120
Alright, Brother.

780
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,290
Go on.

781
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,770
The plan is meticulous and highly organized.

782
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,060
It resembles the methods

783
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,210
used in the explosion case back then.

784
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,700
This Lin Shaobai has no discipline at all.

785
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,340
How could the NBIS tolerate him?

786
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:43,990
Director.

787
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,960
Look at this.

788
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,690
Lin Shaobai has been looking for Xu Wei these days.

789
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,590
If Lin Shaobai is hiding something,

790
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,470
it's likely related to the missing Xu Wei.

791
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,200
Once there's any lead on him, immediately implement the arrest.

792
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,840
Yes.
