37
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,550

and huge profits at that,

43
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,110
then it definitely won't last long.

44

But personally, I'm in a bit of a difficult situation.

53

The Military Control Commission

54
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,870
has clearly restated

55
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,190
that wages must be paid in RMB

56
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,360
and that large shipments must

57
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,770
also be settled in RMB.

58
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,190
So now,

59
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,210

60
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,970

A large amount of counterfeit money has been deposited

191
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,630
in five banks in Huangpu and Xuhui.

192
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,550
The bureau has ordered us to form a special task force immediately

193
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,590
to trace the source of this counterfeit currency.

194
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,150
Counterfeit currency is a highly profitable business.

195
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,650
People have been at it for a long time.

196
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,970
But why are we

197
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,350
only discovering this now?

198
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,070
Although it's counterfeit,

199
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,550
it's almost indistinguishable from the real currency.

200
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,750
The average person wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

201
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,000
It was only a veteran bank employee who noticed something was off,

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,910
relying on the slightest differences in texture.

203
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,390
But one thing is clear:

204
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,350
the serial numbers on both the genuine and counterfeit banknotes are duplicated.

205
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,950
So that means this batch of counterfeit banknotes

206
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,780
had been circulating in the market for quite some time

207
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,350
before they ended up in the bank.

208
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,870
And even then, it was only discovered by banks by chance.

209
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,960
Now, the RMB is depreciating rapidly.

210
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,350
If this news spreads,

211
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,600
it's going to fuel the fire even more.

212
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,670
That's why the Military Control Commission

213
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,820
has temporarily blocked the news about counterfeit currency.

214
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,140
But it's only a temporary measure.

215
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,150
We're not very familiar with the details of counterfeit currency,

216
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,430
so the bureau is sending an expert

217
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,630
who is on his way here.

218
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,550
Everyone, get ready.

219
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,380
Yes, sir.

220
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,150
What do you think,

221
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,150
Mr. Wei?

222
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,270
After nearly two decades,

223
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,260
how do you feel about returning to Shanghai,

224
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,590
the financial capital?

225
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,860
Leaving back then

226
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,830
was for the purpose of coming back stronger today.

227
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,090
Shanghai is now in the midst of recovery.

228
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,040
On the financial battlefield,

229
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,700
we must continue to

230
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,070
ride the long winds

231
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,870
and break through the waves.

232
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,390
How do I look?

233
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,340
It fits you well.

234
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,030
My mom had it tailored for me.

235
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,560
You need to button up your uniform.

236
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,480
I think it's cool to wear a hat.

237
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,190
You need to look sharp.

238
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,120
Let's go. Hurry.

239
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,230
Zhengyang.

240
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,750
Deputy Commissioner Yang.

241
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,270
Come on. Let me introduce you.

242
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,190
This is Mr. Wei, a member of the North China Economic and Financial Affairs Committee

243
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,590
and Vice President of Beihai Bank.

244
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,750
Okay.

245
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,110
Nice to meet you, Vice President Wei.

246
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,620
I'm Lu Zhengyang,

247
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,390
from the Social Affairs Office of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

248
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,230
This is my colleague, Lin Shaobai.

249
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,070
Nice to meet you, Mr. Wei.

250
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,670
Okay.

251
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,780
On the way here,

252
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,000
Deputy Commissioner Yang gave me a brief overview

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,860
of the situation.

254
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,430
Regarding the issue of counterfeit money,

255
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,350
feel free to ask me anything.

256
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,430
I'll

257
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,510
share everything I know openly and honestly.

258
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,310
That's great.

259
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,380
Please, let's head inside.

260
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,070
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

261
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,600
Let's go.

262
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,790
So that's the basic situation

263
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,990
regarding the production and circulation of counterfeit currency.

264
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,520
If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.

265
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,750
How might enemy agents

266
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,490
be counterfeiting RMB?

267
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,840
This time, I convoyed 40 Dodge trucks

268

[The eight methods for detecting counterfeit currency from the first set of fake RMB]

269
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,390
carrying only 400 million RMB

270
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,900
to Shanghai.

271
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,200
After exchanging RMB for gold yuan notes,

272
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,940
there is a noticeable shortage of RMB in circulation.

273
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,630
So we're using

274
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,630
the Mint of the Central Bank of the Kuomintang

275
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,750
to print RMB.

276
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,530
So, it's entirely possible

277
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,710
that the counterfeiters

278
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,960
[Eight methods for detecting counterfeit currency from the first set of fake RMB]

280
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,730
to produce fake currency.

281
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,470
Looks like

282
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,310
it'll be very difficult to distinguish real from fake money.

283
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,240
Indeed.

284
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,750
RMB has just been introduced in Shanghai,

285
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,780
and the public isn't familiar with it.

286
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,190
When regular people receive counterfeit currency,

287
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,870
it's hard for them to tell the difference.

288
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,590
This gives counterfeiters an opportunity to exploit.

289
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,390
Wei,

290
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,590
we're short on time, and the task is daunting.

291
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,110
My main concern is:

292
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,190
how much time do we have left?

293
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,640
According to our estimates,

294
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,100
within a week,

295
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,870
inflation will begin to set in.

296
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,990
And that's if the news doesn't break in the media.

297
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,510
The pathways through which banknotes circulate are highly varied,

298
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,770
so tracing the source of the counterfeit currency is indeed very difficult.

299
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,390
Sorry to interrupt, leaders,

300
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,530
but I have an immature idea.

301
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,350
Go ahead.

302
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,990
In Shanghai,

303
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,190
everything revolves around business.

304
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,110
Making counterfeit banknotes is also a business.

305
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,190
If we could infiltrate their business network

306
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,390
and establish contact

307
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,990
with certain links in their chain,

308
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,750
I think

309
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,700
we could get much closer to finding the source.

310
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,680
You mean,

311
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,280
we fight fire with fire?

312
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,030
We also make counterfeit money

313
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,830
and go head-to-head with them.

314
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,820
In that case, they might come to us,

315
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,380
and sooner or later, we can make contact?

316
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
That's exactly what I'm proposing.

317
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,280
But isn't this against the rules?

318
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,840
Leaders,

319
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,070
how about this?

320
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,010
To gain their trust,

321
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,550
we could use some of the confiscated counterfeit money

322
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,010
and mark them discreetly.

323
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,430
Once the case is solved,

324
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,690
we can reclaim all the marked banknotes.

325
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,590
If we're going to do this,

326
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,110
we need to go all the way.

327
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,640
I propose creating a set of counterfeit copperplates.

328
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,140
Wei, what do you think?

329
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,220
I think Mr. Lin's proposal is very good.

330
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,210
Counterfeiters will avoid the police,

331
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,770
but they might seek out

332
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,910
fellow counterfeiters.

333
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,800
As the saying goes,

334
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,320
"Enemies often meet on a narrow road."

335
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,110
Good.

336
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,880
Catching them off guard

337
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,190
may be the best way to get them.

338
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,150
This is a major operation. I'll need to request approval from the Military Control Commission.

339

Let's strive to

340

locate the source of the counterfeiters

I've checked all the newspapers,

350

and there's still no news about counterfeit currency circulating.

354
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,310
is far more influential than the press.

355
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,590
As rumors spread,

356
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,750

00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,670
Once the case is solved, we'll definitely get it back.

560
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,530
I'm unreliable?

561
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,110
How about this? At the next company,

562
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,770
you be the boss, and I'll be the chauffeur, okay?

563
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,210
Don't worry.

564
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,390
If we go through all of these companies,

565
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,990
someone will reach out to us.

566
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,270
Huzi.

567
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,150
Huzi.

568
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,850
Hurry.

569
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,950
If they find out the printing copperplate is fake,

570
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,430
our game is up.

571
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,510
You take it and go.

572
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,330
Leave the rest to me.

573
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,690
No, it's too dangerous!

574
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,590
Go!

575
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:50,950
Go!

576
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,950
Be careful!

577
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,490
Stop!

578
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,840
Stop!

579
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,710
Hurry!

580
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,190
Sir!

581
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,390
Come on, guys. Don't...

582
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,870
Give me your bag.

583
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,750
Don't shoot!

584
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,160
What are you doing, sir?

585
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Take him away!

586
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,210
Go.

587
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,690
Fellow townsman, we're here.

588
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,420
Okay. Okay.

589
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,480
Thank you, sir!

590
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,150
You're welcome.

591
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,190
Bye. Bye.

592
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,220
Bye.

593
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,990
How is it, Yang?

594
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,910
There should be

595
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,510
another notebook like this on in Falcon's car.

596
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,870
He's an agent.

597
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,200
Would he follow the route in the notebook?

598
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,510
Because only in this way

599
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,840
can he avoid exposing himself too easily.

600
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,190
So, that means

601
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,750
the place where he meets his superior

602
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,470
is among the delivery addresses,

603
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,350
or nearby.

604
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,790
Probably.

605
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,190
Director, I had no other choice at that time,

606
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,590
so I jumped into the water.

607
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,350
We should make the arrests now.

608
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,550
I've only been to those five factories.

609
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,030
They're definitely the ones tipping them off.

610
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,950
We can't make a direct arrest.

611
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,830
If we don't arrest them, how will we rescue Lin Shaobai?

612
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,500
His life is really in danger now.

613
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,510
We need to do it secretly.

614
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,750
If we stir things up, Shaobai will be in even greater danger.

615
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,310
Yes.

616
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,870
Even though there are only five factories,

617
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,310
there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people involved.

618
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,910
Figuring out where to start is still a problem.

619
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,650
Let me think of something.

620
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,670
Go! Go!

621
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,190
We're all brothers making money on the streets.

622
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,790
It's all about money.

623
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,110
I've got plenty of money.

624
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,390
Why are you doing this? Where are you taking me?

625
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,620
Who is your boss?

626
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,910
What boss?

627
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,280
You're the boss?

628
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,740
Who is your boss?

629
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,750
Bingweimo, Zhu Hong.

630
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,510
Bingweimo?

631
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,550
I've never heard of this person in Shanghai!

632
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,190
Our business is a bit off the radar!

633
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,750
My boss was originally from Shandong,

634
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,300
but he got chased down to Shanghai by the Communists.

635
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,830
It's no surprise that you've never heard of him.

636
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,310
So how do you normally

637
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,750
run your counterfeit banknote business?

638
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,510
Sir,

639
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,350
if I spill the beans now, I'm as good as dead.

640
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,030
Good.

641
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,030
Send the God of River the shrimp dumplings.

642
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,270
W-W-What shrimp dumplings?

643
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,750
What do you want?

644
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,270
Let go of me!

645
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,950
It hurts.

646
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,550
I-I-I'll tell you, okay?

647
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,300
Tell me.

648
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,830
My boss, I don't know who he's working with,

649
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,990
got a set of flawless RMB printing plates.

650
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,030
Just this month alone,

651
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,950
the machines have been churning out tens of millions of fake RMB every day.

652
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,990
My runaway partner and I

653
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,960
are just hired to help spend it.

654
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,830
But there's just too much money.

655
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,510
We can't spend it fast enough to keep up with the machine's printing.

656
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,970
He's still hiring people.

657
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,560
I... I really don't know where I've offended you.

658
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,410
But if you want in,

659
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,500
I... I can put in a good word.

660
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,390
As long as you spare my life,

661
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,770
we can all make a fortune together, boss.

662
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,230
It hurts.

663
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,550
What's the price of your counterfeit banknotes?

664
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,670
The larger the amount, the lower the price.

665
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,510
F-F-For one million yuan in goods, we pay two thousand.

666
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,790
As long as you cooperate with us,

667
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,960
you can make more than double apart from the goods.

668
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,750
And you can't tell the money is fake at all.

669
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,010
Not even the banks can.

670
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,150
If you don't... don't believe me,

671
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,270
when you first grabbed me,

672
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,380
I still had a few bills left.

673
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,750
You can take them, and verify for yourselves!

674
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,550
It hurts.

675
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,160
It hurts so much.

676
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,920
It hurts.

677
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,430
Such a fine skill.

678
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,230
And he is working with small fries without backings

679
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,190
or channels, like you?

680
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,510
My boss just wants to pull off a couple of big scores.

681
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,790
The Communists will track us down sooner or later,

682
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,070
and when that happens, we'll move south.

683
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,990
As long as we've got the machines,

684
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,230
we can print anywhere.

685
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,430
Machines. Machines.

686
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,310
Where are the machines?

687
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,410
That, I truly don't know, sir.

688
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,670
What about the source? You must know something about that.

689
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,670
My boss is definitely keeping that locked down tight.

690
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,270
We have different people for production and distribution.

691
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,590
I'm only in charge of distribution.

692
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,070
I don't know anything else.

693
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,140
I swear!

694
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,190
M-M-Mr. Tian, right?

695
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,590
You're Mr. Tian, aren't you?

696
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,670
Aren't we going to be partners?

697
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,000
Say something for me.

698
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,610
Why did you catch me here?

699
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,200
The counterfeit banknotes from Bingweimo

700
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,720
are even better than what we've been getting.

701
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,510
Only Shrike can produce such high-quality fake banknotes.

702
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,030
There are a lot of competitors fleeing from Shandong to Shanghai these days.

703
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,510
I wonder who Bingweimo is,

704
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,150
and Shrike takes him seriously.

705
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,550
They're even trying to steal our business.

706
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,950
A clever rabbit has three burrows.

707
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,350
If I were in his position,

708
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,790
I wouldn't put all my eggs

709
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,300
in one basket either.

710
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,240
Boss, what should we do next?

711
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,560
We've got the leverage.

712
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,010
We should ask Shrike what he should do next.

713
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,860
Call Falcon here.

714
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,460
See if we can get a read on his intentions.

715
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:18,900
Yes.

716
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,980
We still have no news about Lin Shaobai?

717
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,580
Not yet.

718
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,510
Ever since the silver dollar crisis was temporarily contained,

719
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,870
these enemy agents and hooligans have suffered heavy losses.

720
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,870
They'll definitely be looking for new ways to profit.

721
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,440
I've reviewed the data.

722
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,400
Over the past two weeks,

723
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,630
there have been 79 cases of robbery and violent crimes,

724
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,830
which is three times the number from the previous two weeks.

725
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,710
If we don't deliver a swift and decisive blow,

726
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,910
striking them on the head...

727
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,630
They've gotten a taste of it.

728
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,320
They'll only become bolder and more rampant.

729
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,610
I suggest

730
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,740
that we have the Military Control Commission take charge

731
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,030
and that we deploy the Joint Military-Police Unit for action.

732
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,960
In the name of...

733
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,830
a household registration check,

734
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,760
we can carry out a raid within the First Security Area

735
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,390
and, at the same time, clear out

736
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,790
some enemy soldiers, bandits, and agents.

737
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,110
Not just the First Security Area.

738
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,830
We must carry out a coordinated raid

739
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,710
across

740
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,230
all three security areas.

741
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,020

Like this. Keep your hand cupped

835
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,830
and gently pat a few more

836
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,430
from the neck down to the waist.

837
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,080
And the burp will come out.

838
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,750

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,680

to practice as if it were our baby.

847

849
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,590
Of course.

850
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,590
I've been asking my friends at the market

851
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,400
for tips.

852
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,990
Do you know what to do

853
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,920
if a baby burps after drinking milk?

854
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,720
Just pat them.

855
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,820
How?

856
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,750
Like this.

857
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,350
That's not how you do it. You were just hitting.

858
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,270
Your hand should be cupped like this,

859
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,830
creating a hollow space,

860
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,070
and then

861
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,590
you pat gently on their back.

862
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,030
What's wrong?

863
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,490
He fell asleep.

864
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,700
You're so annoying.

865
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,750
Falcon caught you,

866
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,240
but he didn't even suspect you,

867
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,610
and then let you go?

868
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,440
He was testing me all along,

869
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,960
almost ready to make a move.

870
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,510
It wasn't until I mentioned the kids

871
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,110
that his attitude softened.

872
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,790
Maybe he has kids too,

873
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,030
which made him feel a moment of kindness.

874
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,230
Remember.

875
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,080
There won't be next time.

876
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,720
I'll be more careful next time.

877

Victory and defeat are both common in battle.

878

We can turn things around in the next round.

879

880
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,240
