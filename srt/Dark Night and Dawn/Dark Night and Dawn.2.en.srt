Chief,

14
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,930
it's been almost three hours

15
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,460
since Chief Engineer Rong's car departed.

16
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,530
He's still not here.

17
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,890
What I'm worried about

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,870
is that no one here

19
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,110
has seen Chief Engineer Rong personally.

20
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,110
At this time,

21
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,760
the Communist Party won't do anything, right?

22
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,640
Why don't I just blow it up with my men?

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,150
Are you out of your mind?

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,990
Do you think it's like bombing your fishpond?

25
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,470
Where should we put the explosives?

26
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,329
If we don't destroy the core unit,

27
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,180
our efforts will be in vain.

Are we going to blow up the power plant?

What?

not to evacuate workers.

please don't be angry.

167

He

168
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,470
is just a disappointing subordinate.

169
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,630
The Kuomintang is in danger now,

170
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,260
but he wanted to escape.

171
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,470
Plus, the explosion of the power plant tonight

172
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,510
is such a big deal.

173
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,750
I dare not make any mistakes.

174
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,880
So, Mr. Rong,

175
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,470
please forgive me.

176
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,560
Please forgive me.

178
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,640

Pull him over there and shoot him.

195
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,150
What are you talking about, Mr. Rong？

196
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,550
I have no grudge against you.

197
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,140
Don't think I...

198
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,600
Why are you making a commotion late at night?

199
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,670
Chief Ye,

200
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,030
the most important thing now

201
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,660
is to blow up the power plant.

202
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,470
We can shoot him

203
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,520
after the deed is done.

204
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,040
We'll do as you say.

205
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,930
Let's get down to business first.

206
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,080
Lock him in the bathroom first.

207
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,600
Hurry up.

208
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
Move the things here first.

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,840
Hurry.

210
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,240
Okay.

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,380
And these.

212
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,470
Move them all away.

213
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:20,990
Hurry up.

214
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,840
Come on.

215
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,450
Keep an eye on it.

216
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,280
The power plant must be blown up.

217
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,130
Yes.

218
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,800
Xu. Xu.

219
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,250
Have you seen Shaobai and Chief Ye?

220
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:31,990
They all went on a mission.

221
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,330
Where did they go?

222
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,430
Don't ask. I can't tell you.

223
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,050
Mr. Rong,

224
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,040
look.

225
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,290
We've prepared everything.

226
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,130
We only need your magical touch now.

227
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,780
I've brought the blueprint.

228
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,810
Let's start setting things up.

229
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,390
Remember,

230
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,780
after the explosives are installed,

231
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,450
take all the fuses of the detonator

232
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,270
to the entrance of this building

233
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,410
and detonate them together.

234
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,460
Yes.

235
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,780
Don't move the detonator now.

236
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,330
The temperature is too high in the engine room.

237
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,690
The detonator will easily explode.

238
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,730
When the other explosives are installed,

239
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,590
I'll personally guide the setup.

240
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,280
Thank you, Mr. Rong.

241
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,350
Come, pour some water for Mr. Rong.

242
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,040
No need.

243
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,040
Excuse me.

244
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,510
I need to use the bathroom.

245
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,330
You know this place.

246
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,270
Help yourself.

247
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,680
Mr. Rong.

248
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,760
What a coincidence.

249
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,730
You want to escape?

250
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,370
No.

251
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,790
It's too stuffy inside,

252
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,440
so I opened the window for some fresh air.

253
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,080
Really?

254
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,270
Then I

255
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,280
will tell Chief Ye

256
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,460
to take you out for some fresh air.

257
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,330
No need, Mr. Rong.

258
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,490
I may be dressed like this,

259
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,980
but my family is in a difficult situation.

260
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,810
I have an 80-year-old mother

261
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,850
and many siblings to take care of.

262
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
If I die in Chief Ye's hands,

263
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,680
how can they survive?

264
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,380
Just do Uncle Jin a favor.

265
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,480
Turn a blind eye,

266
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,960
please.

267
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,420
You can't beg me.

268
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,700
It seems

269
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,570
you are really capable.

270
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,000
This is amazing.

271
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,420
You can even pry open a steel bar.

272
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,860
Good for you.

273
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,320
This is nothing.

274
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,380
Give it back.

275
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,090
Give it—

276
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,560
Return...

277
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,150
the steel wire!

278
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,580
What I despise the most

279
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,420
are deserters.

280
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,800
You're not Mr. Rong at all.

281
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,170
I've never had dinner with him

282
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,490
at the Sassoon House.

283
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,650
Tell me then.

284
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,050
If I'm not Rong Zheng,

285
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,680
then who am I?

286
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
I don't know who you are,

287
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,310
but you and Ye are different.

288
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,550
You're not here to blow up the power plant today either.

289
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,120
Then you can only be a communist.

290
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,790
You're here to protect the power plant.

291
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,350
But don’t worry.

292
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,720
I, Lin Shaobai, won't ruin your plan.

293
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,980
Then can you help me

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,030
and I help you?

295
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,980
No.

296
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,400
Ye is no ordinary dog.

297
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,410
He's a mad dog.

298
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,380
I know you're good.

299
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
You're a fighter,

300
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,410
but more hands on deck always help, right?

301
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,730
Let me go. I'll help you.

302
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,900
His men are my bros.

303
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,080
They listen to me.

304
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,420
Besides, having one more person to help you

305
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,630
won't hurt, right?

306
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,650
Bro.

307
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,450
Sir.

308
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,540
Can you give me an answer?

309
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,780
No need.

310
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,080
Then don't blame me.

311
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm going to shout now.

312
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,920
He is not—

313
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,320
If you talk nonsense,

314
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,870
I'll put your socks in your mouth.

315
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,330
Listen carefully.

316
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,810
Stay here obediently.

317
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,440
Maybe I’ll be in a good mood after I'm done

318
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,780
and I'll come save you.

319
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,430
If you shout and scream,

320
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,930
either I or Ye Shiwu will come in

321
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,120
and shoot you immediately.

322
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,680
Listeners, city residents,

323
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,800
comrades,

324
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,280
the Chinese People's Liberation Army,

325
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,670
led by the Communist Party of China,

326
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,590
successfully entered Shanghai

327
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,520
this morning.

328
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,230
Shanghai

329
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,720
has been liberated.

330
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,490
Now,

331
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,550
I'll announce

332
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,430
the Chinese People's Liberation Army's proclamation

333
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,680
and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's rules for entering the city.

334
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,420
The Chinese People's Liberation Army's proclamation...

335
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,630
[Director's Office] [Inspector's Office]

336
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,150
Director.

337
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,440
The Kuomintang has declined

338
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,620
to accept the peace treaty

339
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,900
and insist on

340
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,440
that goes against the nation and people.

341
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,890
The whole country hopes...

342
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,970
Send a message with the unencrypted code.

343
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,500
Tell the Communist Party,

344
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,160
tell Chen Yi and Su Yu,

345
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,390
that I, Mao Sen, am leaving for the time being,

346
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,680
but we'll take our territory back.

347
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,040
We will be back.

348
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,839
Shanghai is still ours.

349
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,490
Yes.

350
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,089
Director.

351
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,180
The boat to Zhoushan is about to depart.

352
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,240
We have to hurry up.

353
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,630
Director.

354
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,730
Let me go!

355
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,910
Director, Lin Shaobai was killed by Ye Shiwu.

356
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,910
I have to save him.

357
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,940
Shut up!

358
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,260
Was it you who made the last shot

359
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
yesterday night?

360
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,670
Yes.

361
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,650
Have you shot someone before?

362
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,069
No.

363
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,550
You've never killed anyone,

364
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,530
but you killed two people with two shots.

365
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,880
Good for you.

366
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,070
Let him stay

367
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,710
and go to the island with us.

368
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,110
Yes.

369
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,990
Director.

370
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,870
Secretary Liu.

371
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,720
I beg you.

372
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,580
Tell me where my brother is.

373
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,370
Cut the crap.

374
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:39,710
Take him away.

375
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,510
Let go of me!

376
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,840
I don't know if my brother is alive or dead.

377
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,300
Where is Chief Ye?

378
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,240
Someone from the security office came.

379
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,280
He said there's an important call for Chief Ye.

380
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,410
Mr. Rong, just let me know if you need anything.

381
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,740
Sure.

382
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,630
What's wrong, Mr. Rong?

383
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,640
I have a relapse again.

384
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,730
Go.

385
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,110
Go to the lounge and ask my driver

386
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,860
to get my medicine from the car.

387
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,980
Okay, I'll go now.

388
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,170
Hurry up.

389
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,290
Mr. Rong is not feeling well.

390
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,620
He asked you to get the medicine in the car.

391
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,470
If you get the signal, cut off the power,

392
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,930
and go help Captain Zhang.

393
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,170
Don't worry about me.

394
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,230
Hello, Chief Ye.

395
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,640
Speak.

396
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,640
Bad news.

397
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,820
When we arrived at Hongkou,

398
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,380
we were attacked by communists immediately.

399
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,810
Mr. Rong was kidnapped.

400
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,990
Put down the gunpowder.

401
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,630
Don't move.

402
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,090
Put it down.

403
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,930
You're not Rong Zheng.

404
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,910
You're sent by the Communist Party, right?

405
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,750
Ye Shiwu,

406
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,550
the People's Liberation Army is on their way to the power plant.

407
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,550
If you give up bombing the plant now,

408
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,680
it can be taken as redemption.

409
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,870
Our party has always treated captives nicely.

410
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,040
Besides,

411
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,330
the detonator's fuses

412
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,760
have all been removed.

413
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,080
You can't detonate the explosives.

414
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,760
Since you destroyed our detonator,

415
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,930
I can still detonate it with grenade.

416
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,490
I'm afraid you'll be late.

417
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,160
It's not up to you to decide.

418
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,180
Now,

419
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,030
before I send you to your death,

420
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,210
I'd like to see

421
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,230
who you really are.

422
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:29,990
Don't move.

423
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,650
Don't move.

424
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,180
Communist,

425
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,300
do you really think you can get out of here alive

426
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,030
by taking me captive?

427
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,470
Go.

428
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,860
Step back.

429
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,260
Get in.

430
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,630
Hurry up.

431
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,390
Who are you to arrest us?

432
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,030
Hurry up!

433
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,770
Don't move.

434
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,600
Squat.

435
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,710
Get down!

436
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,690
Behave!

437
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,710
-Behave! Stay still!
-Freeze!

438
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,730
Evacuate my foot.

439
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,270
They only told us to blow up the power plant,

440
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,340
not to evacuate workers.

441
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,330
Listen.

442
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,080
It's these people's fate

443
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,450
to die here.

444
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,120
[Jiangbei Water and Electricity Company]

445
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,310
Chief!

446
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,870
Let our chief go.

447
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,860
Drop the gun.

448
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,410
Communist brother,

449
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,680
it's not good for us to stay in this stalemate.

450
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,260
Let me go.

451
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,190
I'll retreat with my men.

452
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,310
What do you think?

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,930
Sure.

454
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,360
Tell your men to put down their guns

455
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,160
and exit the power plant.

456
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,590
Then I can release you.

457
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,620
Did you hear that?

458
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,000
Drop your guns!

459
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,740
Do as this Communist brother says.

460
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,060
Put it down.

461
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,430
Dong.

462
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,480
We can't.

463
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,190
All of us

464
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,650
have communist blood on our hands.

465
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,950
If we hand over our guns,

466
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,270
we'll all be doomed.

467
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,170
Cao Rui,

468
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,540
when I get out,

469
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,990
I'll kill you first.

470
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,390
These clothes are all new.

471
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,820
But you and Mr. Ye are different.

472
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,960
You're not here to blow up the power plant today either.

473
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,270
Go!

474
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,950
Lin Shaobai, you traitor!

475
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,190
Go!

476
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,610
What are you looking at?

477
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,470
I'm here for revenge.

478
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,120
An eye for an eye, you know?

479
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,720
Lin Shaobai,

480
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,680
if you arrest the communist,

481
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,540
we will still treat you as our brother.

482
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,310
If you keep being stubborn,

483
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,100
I'm telling you.

484
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,790
our bullets can shoot anyone.

485
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,940
Dong,

486
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,820
will you keep your promise?

487
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,140
Of course.

488
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,670
As long as you get him out,

489
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,500
we'll forgive you.

490
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,040
For the sake

491
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,030
of you killing Ye Shiwu,

492
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,670
I'll let you off the hook about earlier.

493
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,990
What are you doing?

494
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,820
They are all my colleagues.

495
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,080
Didn't you hear that?

496
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,930
I'll talk to them.

497
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,820
Maybe they can really release me.

498
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,520
If you really want to be riddled with holes by them,

499
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,730
you can try.

500
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,470
You can do whatever

501
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,080
Do whatever they say.

502
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,050
Put down your gun. Put your hands up.

503
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,260
Put the gun down!

[Jiangbei Water and Electricity Company]

505
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,140
Hands up!

506
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,950
The People's Liberation Army treats captives nicely.

507
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,770
Drop your gun!

508
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,930
Put it down!

510
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,620
Don't move.

511
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,350

512
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,630
We're on the same side.

Remove his gun.

516
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,240
Watch him.

517
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,350
Yes.

518
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,270
We're on the same side, bro.

519
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,950
Handcuff him.

520
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,710
Come on.

521
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,240
Why did he

522
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,250
change so quickly?

523
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,740
I'll leave the power plant to you.

524
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,950
Thank you, Section Chief Lu.

525
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,220
If it weren't for the fear that they might destroy the power plant,

526
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,500
I would have killed them long ago.

527
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,640
Luckily, you went deep into the tiger's den

528
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,310
and helped us solve the problem.

Section Chief,

530
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,050
This is Comrade Xu Yongsheng from the Underground Police Committee.

531
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,790
He provided the intelligence.

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,890
I am Lu Zhengyang, section chief of the Security Department

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,860
Xu Yongsheng.

535
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,100
I've waited for you all for so long.

Xu.

It turns out we're on the same side.

539
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,020
I helped this officer to protect the power plant just now

540
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,960
and made a great contribution.

541
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,490
You must remember it for me.

542
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,170
This is Lin Shaobai,

543
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,370
my colleague in Shanghai Police Station.

544
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,770
No need to introduce him.

545
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,780
We've known each other for a long time.

546
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Or it could be said

547
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,160
that I haven't forgotten you.

548
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,900
It's been four years.

549
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,140
We meet again.

550
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,940
What did you see?

551
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,210
Who killed him?

552
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,170
Officers.

553
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,550
Comrades,

554
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,920
as you can see,

555
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,550
I have nothing to do

556
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,780
with Ye.

557
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,010
We're not on the same side.

558
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,680
You can't arrest people for no reason.

559
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,520
Arresting the wrong person

560
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,390
and solving cases wrongfully

561
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,790
will cost human lives.

562
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,800
The gossip in Shanghai is so advanced.

563
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,010
You just entered Shanghai.

564
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,740
I'm afraid it'll be bad for you.

565
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,830
It's cold outside

566
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,430
and they're just lying on the ground like this?

567
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,830
Not entering civilian residences

568
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,150
is our gift for the citizens of Shanghai.

569
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,850
Comrade Lu,

570
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,320
welcome to Shanghai.

571
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,600
I welcome you too.

572

00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,690
with me.

763
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,830
What are you talking about?

764
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,140
We're friends.

765
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,970
What would I do to you?

766
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,850
This is

767
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,800
a jar of Xianxia Dragon Tea.

768
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,320
It's a specialty from Mr. Mao's hometown.

769
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,510
He must like it.

770
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,530
Please give it to him.

771
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,610
I hope he can

772
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,840
become a dragon in Xiamen.

773
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,850
By the way,

774
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,440
there's another big gift.

775
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,050
Mr. Mao will see it in the newspaper in two days.

776
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,300
Read it to him.

777
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,610
I registered this afternoon.

778
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,350
Okay.

779
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,070
Hello.

780
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,530
Okay.

781
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,960
This way, Director.

782
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,720
How is it, Director?

783
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,270
Not bad, right?

784
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,780
Great.

785
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,810
It's quite clean.

786
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,660
By the way,

787
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,830
this afternoon,

788
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,670
the logistics department helped you clean it up.

789
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,550
Tell me if you need anything.

790
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,820
Inside there is where you'll sleep.

791
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,180
It's been checked too.

792
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,190
Besides,

793
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,450
no one else

794
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,700
can enter this yard.

795
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,190
My brain...

796
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,650
This…

797
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,600
I got it from the canteen for you.

798
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,740
It's still warm.

799
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,150
You haven't eaten, have you?

800
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,280
I'll go back and eat.

801
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,270
Sit down and let's eat together.

802
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,900
Here.

803
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,280
You eat first.

804
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:07,860
Great.

805
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,860
Here.

806
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,100
Director.

807
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,810
When will we interrogate Lin Shaobai?

808
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,260
It's been two days.

809
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,280
We can interrogate him now.

810
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,320
Time flies.

811
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,130
It has been four years

812
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,010
since the Fuzhou Road matter.

813
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,640
When you went to the scene,

814
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,170
Cang had been kidnapped.

815
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,920
Comrade Wen Tian had also died.

816
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,500
Everything had been fine on the way there.

817
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,480
It was all because of Lin Shaobai and those old police officers.

818
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,990
There are no coincidences in this world.

819
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,850
He could've been sent by an agent.

820
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,290
Wen Tian saved my life before,

821
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,080
but he died in Shanghai.

822
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,790
So this time,

823
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,830
we must find out the truth.

824
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,020
Just take is closure for Wen Tian

825
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,280
and for myself.

826
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,550
Officers.

827
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,420
Sirs.

828
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,030
I...

829
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,860
You've been busy these days.

830
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,680
I thought you all had better things to do

831
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,230
and forgot about me.

832
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,220
You look good.

833
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,960
You must've rested well.

834
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,270
It's all thanks to your care.

835
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,230
The new government is so nice.

836
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,600
I don't get beaten or insulted in jail.

837
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,020
I even get fed well.

838
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,580
It's much better than our old police station.

839
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,070
That's good.

840
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,100
Let's

841
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,460
talk.

842
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,360
Sure.

843
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,980
I'll definitely cooperate.

844
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,640
Comrades,

845
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,110
after these two days

846
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,140
of deep self-reflection,

847
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,860
I think I should confess.

848
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,070
I'm indeed guilty.
