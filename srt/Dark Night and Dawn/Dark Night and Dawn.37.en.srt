[Episode 37]

3
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,750
Now that Zheng Lanting's anthrax research

4
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,990
has reached the experimental stage,

5
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,470
Meng Heng couldn't have been the only test subject.

6
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,670
He must have been taking more people

7
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,750
for experiments.

8
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,650
Contact all branches

9
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,070
and pull the files on recent missing persons.

10
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,200
Let's start with the missing persons.

11
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,560
Mr. Shaobai,

12
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,240
I've said it for the eighth time.

13
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,080
I've told you everything and held nothing back.

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,890
I've told you everything I need to say.

15
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,550
It's okay if you don't tell me.

16
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,030
I don't mind staying here with you.

17
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,690
I can keep this up for three days and three nights.

18
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,669
I didn't refuse to talk!

19
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,940
I really don't know where he is!

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,500
I want to know where he is even more than you do.

21
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm desperate to get credit for this!

22
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,720
I swear I don't know where he is! You...

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,430
Zheng Lanting...

24
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,030
he doesn't trust me.

25
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,480
We're not on good terms.

26
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,590
How could he possibly tell me

27
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,250
of the location of his anthrax experiment base?

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,829
I've only been there once.

29
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,270
And that time, I was blindfolded

30
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,270
and taken through twists and turns before I got there.

31
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,160
Why didn't you mention earlier that you'd been there once?

32
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,579
When was it? Where did you go from?

33
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,880
It was at night...

34
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,329
around seven or eight o'clock, I think.

35
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,120
It was Xu Wei who blindfolded me

36
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,350
and brought me there.

37
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,400
Come with me.

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,430
You retrace the route for me.

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,550
Give me the key.

40
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,310
Wait, what are you doing?

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,510
Mr. Shaobai!

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,110
What do you want?

43
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,240
Liu Guiheng, you're a seasoned agent.

44
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,190
Even though you were blindfolded,

45
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,430
there is no way you wouldn't remember anything

46
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,470
about what you heard or

47
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,070
felt.

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:36,670
[Interrogation Room]

49
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,290
You heard what he said, right?

50
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,550
You came at the right time.

51
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,710
Let's go together.

52
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,800
Shaobai, I know you're anxious,

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
but the time now

54
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,460
is different from when Liu Guiheng went the first time.

55
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,990
Let's wait until tomorrow.

56
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,240
Come on.

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
Let's grab something to eat.

58
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,700
You haven't even had dinner.

59
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,190
If you get sick,

60
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,950
how can we catch Zheng Lanting?

61
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,790
Zheng Lanting...

62
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,330
he is really like a rabid dog.

63
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,790
He actually snatched Yan away

64
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,050
right before our eyes.

65
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,050
Do you remember what you told me earlier?

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,300
"Who do you think you are?"

67
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,910
"Are you a god?"

68
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,150
"You can't foresee the future."

69
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,430
Don't take all the responsibility

70
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,750
upon yourself.

71
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,790
I do not.

72
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,510
I just...

73
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,360
Uncle Jin wanted to kill Zheng Lanting before,

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,790
and now that he's taken his daughter.

75
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,800
Won't he take it out on her?

76
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,110
Lin Shaobai,

77
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,000
have you thought about it?

78
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,830
If Zheng Lanting really wanted to kill Dr. Jin,

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,810
he would have done so as he took her.

80
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,070
Dr. Jin is useful to him.

81
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,710
He'll definitely use Yan as a hostage.

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,320
It's better to have a card in hand than to have none.

83
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,040
So,

84
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,390
you can't lose your composure.

85
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,210
Let's find her together.

86
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,850
Also,

87
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,710
with Dr. Jin's personality,

88
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,240
she should be wise enough to protect herself.

89
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,030
But once Zheng Lanting

90
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,070
succeeds with his anthrax development

91
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,660
and starts deploying it,

92
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,510
Yan will have

93
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,150
no value to him at all.

94
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,580
We will definitely find his anthrax base

95
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,940
and rescue Dr. Jin

96
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,450
before that happens.

97
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,870
Now, eat.

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,220
Let's hurry and eat.

99
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,080
I'll go back and interrogate Liu Guiheng again after I finish eating.

100
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,470
Why didn't you knock?

101
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,400
You startled me.

102
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,200
You're opening letters?

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,930
Yes.

104
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,070
It's the official procedure.

105
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,130
Is there one for me?

106
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,710
I've checked. None.

107
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,040
It's been such a long time, and still, there isn't a letter for me?

108
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,060
There really isn't.

109
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,650
Your wife, Zhao Lan, is busy taking care of your child.

110
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,070
It's normal that she didn't have time to write.

111
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,250
Then, what's that?

112
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,190
It's a letter for me.

113
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,450
If it's yours, why are you hiding it?

114
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,520
Xu Wei, don't go too far!

115
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,830
[To Xu Wei]

116
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,220
What's this?

117
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,110
Didn't you say there wasn't a letter for me?

118
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,659
Wei,

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
you never reply to any of my letters.

120
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,500
Have you forgotten about us?

121
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,630
Our child has been sick,

122
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,010
with a high fever for several days.

123
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,510
I want to take him to the hospital,

124
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,909
but they're keeping a close watch

125
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,460
and won't allow us to contact anyone outside.

126
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,159
[Wei, our child has been sick]

127
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,720
I really don't know what else to do, Wei.

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,630
Think of something

129
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,550
to save us.

130
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,190
We have no one else

131
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,090
in this world.

132
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,040
Xu Wei!

133
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,310
Chief.

134
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,370
My child is only two months old.

135
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,330
He's very sick.

136
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,460
I really can't stop worrying.

137
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,930
Just let me go just this once, please.

138
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,390
I'll be right back after I send the medicine.

139
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,700
Now is the crucial time for the Sea Subversion Plan.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,630
I don't want any complications.

141
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,780
Chief, I...

142
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,220
You send a telegram to them.

143
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,090
Tell them that they must cure the child's illness.

144
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,820
Yes.

145
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,250
You can just wait for the news.

146
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,340
It's half past seven.

147
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,790
Last time, Xu Wei took you away from here

148
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,190
around this time, right?

149
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,670
Yes.

150
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,780
Put on the blindfold.

151
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,659
It's okay. No need.

152
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,190
I'll just close my eyes.

153
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,880
Do as you're told!

154
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,150
Okay.

155
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,620
Liu Guiheng,

156
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,370
if we can't find this chemical plant tonight,

157
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,710
let's settle our recent and past grievances together.

158
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,710
I'll make your life a living hell.

159
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,770
I'll do my best. I'll do my best.

160
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,570
Get in.

161
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,820
Be gentle.

162
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,950
Didn't the director tell you

163
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,080
not to be so anxious?

164
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,430
I'm not being anxious.

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,680
When he was taken away by Xu Wei that day,

166
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,610
he must have felt both nervous and scared.

167
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,270
I'm just creating a certain atmosphere for him.

168
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,940
Officers, are we going or not?

169
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:33,950
Shut up.

170
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,270
If you can't find it tonight,

171
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,730
I'll blow your brains out.

172
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,410
Li Xu.

173
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,910
Let me ask you.

174
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,310
Did the Chief ask you to withhold the letters,

175
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,170
or did you decide that on your own?

176
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
I didn't want you to get distracted.

177
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,120
Where is Zhao Lan?

178
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,640
Xu Wei,

179
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,750
is this really the appropriate time for that?

180
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,870
Get a grip!

181
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,080
The Boss's patience with you is wearing thin.

182
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,310
Don't be ungrateful.

183
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,150
You keep calling him "Boss,"

184
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,420
yet I haven't seen your skills improve.

185
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,760
What's that supposed to mean?

186
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,990
How long have I been with Boss?

187
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,950
How long have you been?

188
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,950
He saved your life

189
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,110
and gave you a position.

190
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,190
Don't be an ingrate!

191
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,620
Xiao Yun was with him longer than you.

192
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,020
She's dead, and so what?

193
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
With your poor skills,

194
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,330
do you think you're better than her?

195
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,410
Watch your mouth!

196
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,230
Who the hell do you think you are?

197
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,310
Tell me, where is Zhao Lan?

198
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,150
Since we came out of the pawnshop,

199
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,570
we've been driving for about five minutes, right?

200
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,860
About that.

201
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,700
There should be the sound of metal being hammered around this time.

202
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,060
[Yao's Breakfast Shop]

203
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,030
[Yao's Breakfast Shop]

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,370
Is this the sound?

205
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:17,950
Yes, yes,

206
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,910
that's the one.

207
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,220
This time, it matches.

208
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,040
And then? And then how?

209
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,840
Then, after about five seconds.

210
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,100
One.

211
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,320
Two.

212
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,510
Three.

213
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,630
Four.

214
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,550
Five.

215
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,190
Turn left.

216
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,800
Is there an opening?

217
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes, there is.

218
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,120
Then that's right.

219
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,430
Did we just go over a bump?

220
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,870
Yes.

221
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,800
And then?

222
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,460
That's right.

223
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,750
This time is right for sure.

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,010
Keep driving forward.

225
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,550
Why did we stop?

226
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,350
Keep driving.

227
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,320
Are you sure?

228
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,950
I...

229
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm sure.

230
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,400
This is the fifth time now.

231
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,980
Are you messing with us?

232
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,890
Mr. Shaobai,

233
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,800
you're really giving me a hard time here.

234
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,990
When I joined the NBIS, I was assigned to the telecom department.

235
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,490
I work with transmitter-receivers.

236
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,830
You could ask me to decipher some secret codes...

237
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,790
Stop wasting time.

238
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,470
You...

239
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,310
Turn around and go back.

240
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,310
Let's do it again.

241
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
No, you...

242
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,910
Don't be nervous.

243
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,800
Relax.

244
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,270
Think it over carefully again.

245
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,010
We won't make it too hard for you.

246
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,200
This isn't hard enough yet?

247
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,350
Be gentle.

248
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,860
Mr. Shaobai!

249
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,510
How long has it been?

250
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,320
Six to eight hours.

251
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,400
He threatened me with a knife, asking where Zhao Lan and his kid were.

252
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,270
I told you he would definitely turn against us.

253
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,220
Did you tell him?

254
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,340
If I hadn't,

255
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,400
the knife would have gone in.

256
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,340
At such a critical time,

257
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,540
he is still thinking about his family.

258
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,680
I told him

259
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,840
that there were people looking after Zhao Lan and his kid.

260
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,900
Nothing would happen to them.

261
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,950
Then suddenly, he lost it

262
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,030
and attacked me.

263
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,400
He's probably already headed toward Jiashan now.

264
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,510
I'll take some men and go after him right away.

265
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,730
You won't catch up with him.

266
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,130
Wait for him to come back.

267
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,300
Will he come back?

268
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,570
He has to come back.

269
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,960
His child is seriously ill,

270
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,510
and only hospitals in Shanghai can treat him.

271
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,150
Ogura just needs to run a few more tests,

272
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,500
and then we'll be able to mass-produce it.

273
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,820
Send a telegram to Taiwan.

274
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,220
Tell them

275
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,960
that Liu Guiheng has betrayed us

276
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,490
and that Zombie Sparrow...

277
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,210
has fallen heroically.

278
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,430
Our ace card

279
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,930
will soon destroy everything in Shanghai.

280
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,020
Boss,

281
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,780
earlier Taiwan

282
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,190
only responded to Liu Guiheng.

283
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,530
Whether they reply or not,

284
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,610
and to whom,

285
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,790
is their business.

286
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,720
Reporting

287
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,270
is my duty.

288
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,630
Send it directly to Mao Sen.

289
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,400
Go quickly.

290
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,660
Yes, sir.

291
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
Who are you?

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,700
Man,

293
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,600
I'm a peddler.

294
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,620
Would you like to buy something?

295
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,950
We don't need anything.

296
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,560
Leave.

297
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,600
Come on, buy something.

298
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,230
Stock up a bit.

299
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,150
You're in a remote area.

300
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,230
Some items might come in handy.

301
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,270
Can't you understand?

302
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,380
Leave now.

303
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,950
I beg you.

304
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,790
Please don't hurt my baby!

305
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,470
I beg you.

306
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,830
Don't hurt my baby!

307
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,710
Lan.

308
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,750
Lan.

309
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,380
It's me.

310
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,950
Lan.

311
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,670
I'm Wei.

312
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,000
Wei!

313
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,180
What took you so long?

314
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,960
Please save our baby.

315
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,430
The fever hasn't gone down.

316
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,320
We've tried all the medications, but nothing works.

317
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
What should we do?

318
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,840
Let's go.

319
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,510
I'll take you away.

320
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,540
Don't be afraid.

321
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,460
I'll take you away.

322
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,050
Let's go.

323
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,230
I've checked

324
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,710
all the missing persons cases from the branches

325
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,040
over the past few months.

326
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,370
These cases are either elderly people getting lost

327
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,860
or children going missing.

328
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,590
There hasn't been a single case

329
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,190
of a young or middle-aged adult going missing.

330
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,450
That doesn't add up, Yaohong.

331
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,190
Zheng Lanting is conducting human experiments,

332
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,390
so he's definitely targeting young and strong adults.

333
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,020
What if...

334
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,390
they didn't dare to report the case?

335
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,920
That's impossible.

336
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,910
Nowadays,

337
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,460
any family whose member goes missing,

338
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,670
they'll come to us.

339
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,840
What if they were all alone?

340
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,090
They don't have any family in Shanghai

341
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,380
and no social ties.

342
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,880
So even if they go missing,

343
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,510
no one will care.

344
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,800
These people

345
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,030
are usually from out of town.

346
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,990
They don't have stable jobs in Shanghai

347
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,510
or are even homeless.

348
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,030
They generally live in

349
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,150
the old rundown areas of Shanghai,

350
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,070
like Fanggualong or Gundilong.

351
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,830
Let's divide into several groups.

352
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,660
Let's slip into groups

353
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,920
and visit these areas.

354
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,020
[Human experiment] [Target group]

355
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,890
How is it going?

356
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,920
Any clues?

357
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,680
That Liu Guiheng was so sure

358
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,870
that he could find the place,

359
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,790
yet all he did was lead us in circles,

360
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,850
and we still haven't found anything.

361
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,880
Don't worry.

362
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,270
We'll find clues.

363
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,000
He's still running a bit of a fever.

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,030
The doctor said

365
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,440
after a few more injections

366
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,870
and continuing with the medicine,

367
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,930
he should recover.

368
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,930
Luckily, it didn't develop into pneumonia.

369
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,180
Wei,

370
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,370
can you be honest with me?

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,080
During our time in Zhejiang countryside,

372
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,310
there's been someone watching us every day,

373
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,570
and they all have guns.

374
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,530
Today, I even heard gunshots.

375
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,830

it's wherever I went...

I didn't mean to actually do it.

583

But at that moment, if I hadn't fired,

584

and relocates?

688

710
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,930
do you think that if war were to break out,

711
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,470
the U.S. would intervene?

712
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,530
If the U.S. were to get involved,

713
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,740
would Chiang Kai-shek

I don't know.

717
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,900
If Chiang Kai-shek were to launch a counterattack,

718
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,030
it would lead to another Shanghai campaign.

719
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,460
By then, Zheng Lanting

720
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:17,090

733
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,590
you wouldn't get up no matter how much I called you.

734
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,760
Why didn't you mind the bed back then?

735
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,400
Well,

736
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,370

I won't sneak out in the middle of the night.

I'll stay here and sleep properly.

745

the meaning of true belief.

754
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,400
As Comrade Lu Zhengyang said,

755
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,830
"Belief

756
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,550
is a truth for which a person is willing to

757
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,040
give everything."

758
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,540
"It is that for which you would do anything

759
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,010
and find it worthwhile."

760
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,800
"Even when a gun to your head

761
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,060
or a knife at your throat,

762
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,500
you will not back down."

763
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,560
"Because even if you die,

764
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,700
your heart remains bright

765
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,440
and proud."

766
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,180
I want to be such a person too.

767
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,050
Applicant:

768
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,340
Lin Shaobai.

769
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,660
Not bad.

770
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,960
Come on. Get in the car.

771
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,040
Make a full turn.

772
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,110
Next.

773
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,030
Make a full turn first.

774
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,240
Where are we going?

775
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,690
If you want to make money, behave yourself.

776
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,090
That's not something you should be asking.

777
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,150
Take that guy in the hat with us.

778
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,340
We've arrived. Get off!

779
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,870
Where are we going?

780
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,620
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

781
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,060
Move.

782
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,900
Hurry!

783
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,100
Move it.

784
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,830
Hurry up! Get off.

785
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,860
Get off!

786
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,380
Hurry up. Hurry up.

787
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,460
Hurry up. Hurry up.

788
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,210
Aren't you hiring workers?

789
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,500
Attention.

790
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,500
Go.

791
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,730
Go. Hurry up!

792
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,720
Sir.

793
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,190
Aren't you looking for workers?

794
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,660
Where are you taking us?

795
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,410
Less nonsense!

796
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,570
Lin Shaobai,

797
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,750
are you crazy?

798
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,830
What are you doing here?

799
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,340
You brought me here.

800
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,830
What do you want?

801
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,240
How are Zhao Lan and my baby?

802
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,020
Zhao Lan is currently in surgery,

803
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,540
but she's no longer in critical condition.

804
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,630
Surgery?

805
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,150
What have you done to them?

806
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,190
You should be asking Zheng Lanting what he did to them.

807
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,390
Li Xu and his men are responsible for it.

808
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,110
Our people have been protecting them.

809
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,050
Impossible.

810
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,630
Zheng Lanting doesn't even know where she is.

811
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,560
Wouldn't he have investigated it?

812
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,690
Xu Wei,

813
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,640
Zheng Lanting is using you as cannon fodder.

814
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,970
Can't you see that?

815
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,440
Stop trying to create discord between us.

816
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,200
Zhao Lan is at Guangci Hospital.

817
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,800
If you don't believe me, go check for yourself.

818
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,460
If you dare to lie to me, you know the consequences.

819
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,770
Where is Jin Yan?

820
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,810
All I can tell you is that she's alive.

821
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,230
Someone,

822
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,440
take him away!

823
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,990
Let me tell you, keep your mouth shut.

824
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,800
I'm sorry.

825
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,420
Take him away.

826
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,400
-Go!
-Go!

827
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,230
Sir!

828
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,360
Sir!

829
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,450
I'm just a part-time worker.

830
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,620
I came for a job.

831
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,810
-Go in!
-Go in!

832
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,270
To destroy Zheng Lanting's anthrax research base,

833
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,920
we do need to send someone

834
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,350
to infiltrate it,

835
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,490
find out its location,

836
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,300
and understand the situation inside.

837
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,640
What Shaobai is doing

838
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,880
is indeed dangerous.

839
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,970
This is a

840
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,070
risky move,

841
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,070
but it's also a clever one.

842
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,670
Do we have confidence?

843
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,240
Lin Shaobai told me

844
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,960
that Xu Wei cares most about his family.

845
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,770
If he knew that Zheng Lanting

846
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,700
wanted to kill his wife and his son,

847
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,750
he wouldn't

848
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,350
stay devoted to him.

849
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,790
Xu Wei will definitely infiltrate the hospital

850
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,320
to visit his wife and child.

851
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,440
This is also our opportunity to divide

852
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,100
and dismantle Zheng Lanting.

853
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,870
If we can make good use of Xu Wei,

854
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,910
then Lin Shaobai will be much safer.

855
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,400
Xu Wei

856
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,740
is indeed the breakthrough of our whole plan.

857
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,530
I've arranged everything;

858
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,920
now we just need to wait for him to come.

859
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,390
See?

860
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,130
It's all because of you

861
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,150
who let that girl cause such a scene;

862
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,680
the Boss has asked us to reinforce the guards.

863
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,340
Come in.

864
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,840
Boss,

865
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,670
we've finally received a reply from Taiwan.

866
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,080
However, their stance on using anthrax weapons

867
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,320
is still unclear.

868
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,070
I'm very clear.

869
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,310
They're just afraid of taking responsibility

870
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,660
and need to maintain their international image.

871
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:11,770
Of course.

872
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,700
But we have no image.

873
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,180
We just need to

874
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,650
do our job well.

875
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,880
How is the recruitment going?

876
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,240
Everything is going smoothly.

877
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,940
Chief,

878
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,590
we've already mass-produced the anthrax weapons.

879
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,820
Why are we still recruiting people for human experiments?

880
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,240
Shanghai is just the beginning.

881
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,290
Continuous experiments

882
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,990
aim to maximize

883
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,580
the lethality of anthrax.

884
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,210
We need to set up hidden sentries

885
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,820
within a five-kilometer radius.

886
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,430
Once we detect any police presence

887
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,070
or unusual activity,

888
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,560
report it immediately.

889
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,320
Understood.

890
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,140
I hope

891
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,210
this is the final phase.

892
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,870
After it's done,

893
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,810
I will send you

894
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,180
and your families

895
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,280
to wherever you want to go.
