00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,980
that the backbone of the Social Affairs Office

191
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,190
of Shanghai Public Security Bureau...

192
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

193
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,770
Put it down as Director.

194
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,350
Write that Director Lin Shaobai was captured by us.

195
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,990
Nothing is better

196
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,110
than some solid merits.

197
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,950
Secretary Liu.

198
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,380
So it was you who wrote

199
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,910
that letter of accusation?

200
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,070
It was indeed me.

201
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,900
How did you like it?

202
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,750
Listen to my advice.

203
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,550
If you come with me to the police station now and explain the situation,

204
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,750
you may be able to get a chance to redeem yourself.

205
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,670
Are you out of your mind?

206
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,620
You know where I am,

207
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,270
and you saw me.

208
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,800
You think you can leave?

209
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,030
Kill him.

210
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,110
Don't splatter blood everywhere.

211
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,710
Get a basin to hold his blood.

212
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,130
Ten gold bars, 10,000 US dollars, and 8 gold watch.

213
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,960
So you took them!

214
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,390
Do you know how long I've been looking for them?

215
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,310
Where is my money?

216
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,590
Give my money back!

217
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,880
Where is my money?

218
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,030
Hey.

219
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,630
Why are you yelling so loudly?

220
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,140
After you left last time,

221
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,590
I was the one who searched your watch shop.

222
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,230
You know what I mean, right?

223
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,870
I'll strangle you to death!

224
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,550
Where is my money? Give it back to me!

225
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,150
I still remembered it just now,

226
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,350
but you suddenly scared me by strangling me.

227
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,230
The blood couldn't circulate in my brain,

228
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,550
so I forgot.

229
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,890
Where was it?

230
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,190
You think I don't know medicine,

231
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,750
right?

232
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,270
Trying to play tricks with me?

233
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,270
Give me the knife.

234
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,270
If you don't tell me

235
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,780
where my money is,

236
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,360
you'll be useless.

237
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,280
I'll stab you to death today, do you believe me?

238
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,350
If you kill me,

239
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,850
you'll never know where the money is.

240
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,190
You...

241
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,710
Why did you have to

242
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,950
tie me up so tightly?

243
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,070
You really wanted to strangle me to death?

244
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,230
Sorry.

245
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,790
Go get me some tea.

246
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,790
I'm a bit thirsty.

247
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:11,950
Serve tea.

248
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,030
Liu.

249
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,840
You go first.

250
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,150
Here's what I thought, Liu.

251
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,110
If I help you now,

252
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,750
I'll become an agent too.

253
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,990
I won't be able to stay in Shanghai anymore.

254
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,720
But I'm a native Shanghainese.

255
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,350
What should I do with the rest of my life?

256
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,350
Buddy.

257
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,840
You don't have to worry about that.

258
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,640
I can take you to Taiwan

259
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,030
or Hong Kong by then.

260
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,590
You can choose where you want to stay.

261
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,570
And I'll get you a job there.

262
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,630
You'll have nothing to worry about.

263
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,190
There's too little meat for too many wolves in Taiwan, if you know what I mean.

264
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,230
You don't have to lie to me.

265
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,290
I know it very well.

266
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,270
My friend.

267
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,560
You, get out.

268
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,640
My friend.

269
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,980
I have

270
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,790
been promoted to the chief of Shanghai Special Station.

271
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,590
Now my words weigh a lot

272
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,430
in NBIS.

273
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,400
Even Commissioner Mao Renfeng

274
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,210
has to show me some respect...

275
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,920
Or should I say, honor me.

276
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,270
Hey.

277
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,660
Liu.

278
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,920
You're the chief now?

279
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

280
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,550
I'm a little hungry.

281
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,790
How about we talk while eating?

282
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,670
Sure.

283
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,920
Get us some dishes.

284
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,990
Chief Liu.

285
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,990
Who is it?

286
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,810
At such a late hour.

287
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,010
[Shenghe]

288
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,359
Don't speak.

289
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,020
How's the taste?

290
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,599
The beef from Huang's

291
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,290
is still better.

292
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,599
I'll buy Huang's beef tomorrow.

293
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,349
Yes.

294
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,310
It's not that good.

295
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,109
Don't move!

296
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,110
You came so fast.

297
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,550
Why did you fall to the ground?

298
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,190
Come on.

299
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,310
Why are you having a feast here, Lin Shaobai?

300
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,870
No.

301
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,910
Sit.

302
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,790
You are meeting for the first time.

303
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,130
Let me introduce.

304
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,430
This is Director Lu of the Social Affairs Office.

305
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,390
This is

306
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,150
Chief Liu Guiheng of Shanghai Special Station,

307
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,390
Chief Liu.

308
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,310
Hello, Chief Liu.

309
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,070
Hello, Director Lu.

310
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,670
Look at me.

311
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,230
Chief Liu, I suddenly remembered.

312
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,970
That money of yours

313
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,160
has long been turned over to the national treasury.

314
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,320
You tricked me once, and I cheated you once in return.

315
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,870
We're even now.

316
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,950
Okay.

317
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,710
If I were you, I would have done the same.

318
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,150
Huzi.

319
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
Take the rest of them back.

320
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,220
Shaobai, Xiaoman.

321
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,830
Interrogate him on the spot.

322
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,510
Yes.

323
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,720
Hello, Director Lu.

324
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,420
Liu Guiheng.

325
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,880
I advise you to tell the truth.

326
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,670
I don't need your advice.

327
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,120
Is everything ready?

328
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,630
Don't just...

329
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,150
Don't beat around the bush.

330
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,110
Get to the point.

331
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,970
First,

332
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,820
I want to say

333
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,070
a Kuomintang agent of my level,

334
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,330
whether being reactive or proactive,

335
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,830
must have

336
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,290
the blood of the Communist Party on my hands.

337
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,200
I hereby

338
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,410
plead guilty.

339
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,630
Second,

340
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,710
what I want to confess is that

341
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,710
I'm already extremely disappointed

342
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,370
in Kuomintang.

343
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,680
They sent me back this time

344
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,290
to stir up trouble

345
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,400
just to get me killed.

346
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,280
Those bastards have abandoned me.

347
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,600
Over the years,

348
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,520
they forced me

349
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,720
to do a few things against the people.

350
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,710
But I have conscience.

351
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,690
I avoided and refused

352
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,190
as much as I could.

353
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,560
You know the rules of NBIS.

354
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,150
Anyone who disobeys orders will be shot.

355
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,750
This is the rule set by Dai Li.

356
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,550
I had no choice. I was forced.

357
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,850
I've been living in pain every day.

358
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,190
Third,

359
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,160
I want to admit that

360
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,310
I'm guilty!

361
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,910
Sit down.

362
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,790
Sit down.

363
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,990
I've been dealing with you guys

364
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,500
for so many years.

365
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,510
I can feel more and more deeply that

366
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,630
only the Communist Party truly works

367
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,510
for the sake of the people

368
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,640
and hopes they can live a good life.

369
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,400
You are wholeheartedly willing

370
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,670
to sacrifice your lives for the people

371
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,780
at any cost.

372
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,030
But what about Kuomintang?

373
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,350
They eat, drink, gamble, and engage in corruption.

374
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,920
They oppress the people

375
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,230
and go against the people.

376
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,720
And they failed in the end as expected.

377
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,270

whoever goes against the historical trend

383
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,550

386

387

388
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,470

390

391

to redeem myself.

395
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,090
I can prove right now that

396
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,310
Lin Shaobai was framed by us at that time.

397

402
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,390
is whether Zheng Lanting is still in Shanghai,

403
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,800
and where exactly he is.

404

Zheng Lanting

406
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,180
has never left Shanghai.

407
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,000
But as for his exact whereabouts,

408
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,750
I don't know about that.

409
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,270
You talked so much nonsense,

410
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,130
but when it comes to key issues, you shut your mouth?

411
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,780
You are the chief of Shanghai Special Station.

412
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,640
How could you not know where he is?

413

414

I really don't know where Zheng Lanting is.

415
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,950
The conflict between Zheng Lanting and I is very deep.

416
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,660

418
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,970

You are a leader.

424
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,150
Zheng Lanting never obeys

426
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,350
Even those thugs who work for him

427

dare to arrange work for me.

428

All the bad things were done by Zheng Lanting.

429

There are a lot of things that I don't know.

430
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,220
I feel so aggrieved as the chief.

431

432

I can send a telegram to him

437

Mr. Zheng, there's a telegram from Liu Guiheng

479
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,240
saying that Commissioner Mao Renfeng issued a new order

480
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,010

481
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,850

So what should I reply?

487
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,600
We have to let the higher-ups know that

488
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,500
our target is not any person,

Everything we do now

492
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,910
Last time when we tried to assassinate Meng Heng,

493
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,550
we used Liu Guiheng's men as bait

494

Many of his men died.

496
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,390
He must have a lot of resentment built up in his heart.

568
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,270
He changed the place.

569
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,500
He asked me to meet him at Leyouyuan Restaurant at 5:30.

There's half an hour left.

571
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,710
Could it be he noticed something wrong?

572
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,510
Although he's always paranoid and cautious,

573
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,110
it shouldn't be.

Even if I have to stay in jail for the rest of my life,

604
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,060
it's still better than going there to die.

There's a gas leak in our restaurant. Please leave.

750

You have to think about me.

751
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,830
Mr. Zheng, something happened.

752
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,630
They say there's a gas leak here.

753
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,890
The guests outside have been evacuated.

754
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,960
Why are you pointing the gun at me?

755
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,630
Stop talking and run!

756
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,390
You lured the police here, didn't you?

757

What are you talking about?

Make this car disappear.

Yes.

Yes.

Miss.

Tell me.

How should I deal with you?

805
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,640
You killed my father.

806
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,770
Unfortunately, I failed to kill you myself.

807
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,550
I understand you saying this

808
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,610
as his daughter.

809
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,070
But he was not just a father.

810
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,960
He was disloyal.

811
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,410
Didn't he deserve to die?

812
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,560
Killing people to establish prestige

813
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,250
is nothing but a sign of extreme weakness.

814

You will definitely lose.

then you're no different from the devil.

This Leyouyuan Restaurant

838
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,620
was a former NBIS stronghold.

839
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,880
So it has a secret door.

840
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,710
Even the boss who later rented it didn't know about it.

It was abandoned in the wilderness.

to arrest Zheng Lanting

Meng Heng can't be the only one there.

856
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,990
He must have captured more people there

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,280
to experiment on.
