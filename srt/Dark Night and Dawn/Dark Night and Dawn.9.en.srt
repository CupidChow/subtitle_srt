00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,620
Leave.

191
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,720
Get out.

192
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,550
Leave.

193
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,860
Lili.

194
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,030
Mr. Wang, you haven't left yet?

195
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,090
Where are you going?

196
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,860
I'm off work.

197
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,850
Off work?

198
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,760
Didn't we agree

199
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,750
to go to my place and have a chat?

200
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,280
Brother,

201
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,550
t... today I'm not going.

202
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,730
There's no time like the present.

203
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,910
Let's go today.

204
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,710
We agreed

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
that since I learned some new terms,

206
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,930
you would discuss them with me at my place, didn't we?

207
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,530
You've got to keep your word.

208
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,730
Sir, I...

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,920
I really can't go today.

210
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,830
Lili,

211
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,970
this isn't how you do things.

212
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,370
You took my money,

213
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,510
so now you're mine.

214
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,050
If you don't come,

215
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,890
I'll destroy you.

216
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,550
Sir.

217
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,380
Sir.

218
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,090
Sir, I...

219
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,190
Are you coming or not?

220
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,870
I...

221
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,650
Let's go home.

222
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,310
The Director sent a telegram,

223
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,150
asking me why

224
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,900
there hasn't been any action yet.

225
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,890
There were neither assassinations

226
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,000
nor explosions.

227
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,450
"The greatest sound is barely heard,

228
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,720
and the greatest form is invisible."

229
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,290
The Director should understand that principle, right?

230
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,280
Do you think

231
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,870
if I send the Director a telegram like this,

232
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,250
he'll be satisfied?

233
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,030
The PLA has indeed entered Shanghai,

234
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,570
but whether they can secure their foothold

235
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,990
depends on the future economic situation.

236
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,330
So, compared to the fighting and killing you mentioned,

237
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,770
I'm more interested in how to sabotage

238
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,490
Shanghai's economy.

239
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,940
What's your next step?

240
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,430
That's something

241
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,800
I should report directly to the Director myself, I believe.

242
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,880
You were sent here to assist,

243
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,820
not to monopolize

244
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,480
the communication between me and the Director.

245
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,960
Secretary Liu, please send the Director a telegram.

246
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,970
To facilitate communication,

247
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,230
ask him to equip me with a few radios.

248
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,830
Is that alright?

249
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,370
Sure.

250
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,550
Take the money and go home.

251
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,390
This is not something you should be looking at.

252
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,430
No,

253
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,570
please,

254
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,710
Please.

255
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,970
Is this really necessary?

256
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,710
What do you mean?

257
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,119
Killing an unarmed woman?

258
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,550
Why so much talk?

259
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,819
You're here to dump the body,

260
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,880
so shut your mouth.

261
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,650
Why are you here?

262
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,680
You're here too?

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,340
Mr. Zheng sent me to ask

264
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,640
how the talks with Dai Yueqing are going.

265
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,600
That woman took the money but wouldn't do anything.

266
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,990
It's at a standstill.

267
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,790
Xu Wei,

268
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,990
you've been gathering information at the docks.

269
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,270
What do you think?

270
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,130
Dai Yueqing's Hook Sword Gang has always wanted

271
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,600
to take over the River Gang.

272
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,970
Most of Hook Sword Gang's weapons are just hook swords,

273
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,710
while River Gang has quite a few guns,

274
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,370
so they're at a disadvantage.

275
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,980
If we can help Dai Yueqing,

276
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,910
that would be an offer she can't refuse.

277
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,970
What kind of offer?

278
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,850
You're not clear about how many people the River Gang has?

279
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,040
Now that these two forces

280
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,470
are clear to me,

281
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,240
we have only one thing to do,

282
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,170
which is to wait.

283
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,660
When crickets fight,

284
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,070
the fisherman gains.

285
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,020
How good is that?

286
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,510
Wait?

287
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,610
Wait until when?

288
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,820
If we wait until both gangs are mutually destroyed,

289
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,190
the power we can control

290
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,390
will be greatly depleted.

291
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,860
If we intervene early,

292
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,410
capturing the leaders first,

293
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,670
then the power of the two gangs

294
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,190
will merge into one, used by us.

295
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,620
You're talking too much.

296
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,430
I think what Xu Wei said

297
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,470
is not without possibility.

298
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,050
I'll report this to Mr. Zheng.

299
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,520
Tell me.

300
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,690
Another murder, what's going on?

301
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,090
She was a dancer.

302
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,650
She saw something she shouldn't have.

303
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,880
So I shut her mouth.

304
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,010
People like this aren't worth much

305
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,720
and won't affect us.

306
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,820
Mr. Zheng warned you long ago

307
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,390
not to act without orders.

308
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,310
After dealing with the body,

309
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,700
no more actions

310
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,250
without Mr. Zheng's command.

311
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,440
Why are you just standing there?

312
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,500
Go clean it up.

313
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,030
Stop the car.

314
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,300
What are you doing?

315
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,490
Park the car here. Wash it.

316
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,580
Hurry up.

317
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,880
Xu Wei,

318
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,280
why did you escalate the report

319
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,230
about helping Dai Yueqing

320
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,740
to take over the River Gang?

321
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,050
Trying to show off your skills

322
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,170
and capability?

323
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,190
Xiao Yun asked me, so I told her.

324
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,310
If she asked you to die, will you go?

325
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,600
In your heart,

326
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,980
have you ever thought about replacing me?

327
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,170
Be honest.

328
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,490
Falcon.

329
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,980
I'm just a small character.

330
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,590
Surviving is already good enough.

331
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,040
How could I dare to have such thoughts?

332
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,680
No thoughts?

333
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,740
Is that the truth?

334
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,230
Ambition is a good thing.

335
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,420
In the future,

336
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,460
before you act or speak,

337
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,360
you must first consult me.

338
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,630
I am your direct superior,

339
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,140
your only superior.

340
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,670
This is also the organizational discipline set by Mr. Zheng.

341
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,150
No one dares to violate it.

342
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,690
Do you understand?

343
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,830
Understood.

344
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,160
Go clean up.

345
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,060
Make sure to wash the car thoroughly.

What are you doing here?

Are you going to watch "The White-Haired Girl" too?

You're early.

Didn't sleep all night, I suppose?

354
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,930
Help me get two tickets.

355
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,950
Otherwise, there won't be any ticket left for me.

my wife insists on watching it. I have no choice.

Hurry up and get in line at the back.

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,730
Otherwise, there will be more and more people.

I'm also a comrade. Why don't you help me buy one?

379
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,590
Really.

380
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,850
I don't want to argue with you.

381
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,580
Hurry up and get in line. Tickets will be sold out.

382
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,300
Good.

383
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,920
You're really doing a good job as the director.

384
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,940
Don't cut in line.

385
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,190
That's my spot.

386
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,680
Everyone did a thorough job with the preliminary work yesterday.

387
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,710
Continue today.

388
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,430
Yes.

389
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,210
Okay.

390
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,830
Why hasn't Lin Shaobai arrived yet?

391
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,510
Isn't it just the right time?

392
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,180
Director Lu,

393
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,510
come.

394
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,700
What about the ticket?

395
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,100
Did you get it?

396
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,530
[Liberation Theater]

397
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,530
They really are tickets for "The White-Haired Girl."

398
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,350
I'll thank you on behalf of my two mothers.

399
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,080
Director Lu.

400
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,730
Everyone!

401
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,590
Tickets for "The White-Haired Girl."

402
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,720
These are really tickets for "The White-Haired Girl."

403
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,280
Our Director Lu is impressive.

404
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,190
He managed to get

405
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,110
such hard-to-get tickets.

406
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,990
Director,

407
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,370
you can get tickets for "The White-Haired Girl."

408
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,520
What position is our Social Affairs Office?

409
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,720
And our Director Lu

410
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,640
is a favorite in front of Deputy Commissioner Yang.

411
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,540
Getting a few tickets

412
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,910
is not just a matter of asking.

413
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,720
Lin Shaobai.

414
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,630
Director.

415
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,190
Director.

416
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,470
Do you still have tickets for "The White-Haired Girl?"

417
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,310
We haven't watched "The White-Haired Girl" yet.

418
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,590
Could you get us some tickets so we can watch it too?

419
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,520
Director, I want two tickets. Two.

420
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,150
Stop causing a ruckus here.

421
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,690
Hurry back to work properly.

422
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,560
Director, I'm different from them.

423
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,890
I don't need to watch it,

424
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,610
but my family does.

425
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,590
Can you get me one too?

426
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,790
It can't be like this.

427
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,390
Family needs it.

428
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,190
We came first, so we get them first.

429
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,070
Alright, then.

430
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,360
It's settled.

431
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,300
When the case is over,

432
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,550
Each of you will get two tickets for "The White-Haired Girl."

433
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,590
Thank you, Director.

434
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,030
Thank you, Director.

435
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,090
But now,

436
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,930
dimiss.

437
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:33,900
We'll set off on time

438
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,780
in half an hour.

439
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,630
Yes!

440
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,870
Wow!

441
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,690
Huzi, Huzi, Huzi,

442
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,050
Have you watched it?

443
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,460
I'm telling you,

444
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,670
if you haven't watched it,

445
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,990
ask Director Lu for two tickets.

446
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,190
We'll each take one.

447
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,790
How do you think he got the tickets

448
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,960
for "The White-Haired Girl?"

449
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,190
He must have obtained them through connections.

450
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,790
What connections?

451
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,470
Is the director that kind of person?

452
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,290
He went to the Liberation Theater early in the morning,

453
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,590
queued up for a long time,

454
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,120
and didn't sleep all night.

455
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,910
Bro.

456
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,790
Wang Liqun's portrait has been scattered everywhere.

457
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,570
Colleagues at the sub-bureau are working overtime to investigate.

458
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,700
But there are too many businesses in Putuo.

459
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,980
It will take at least a week to be thorough.

460
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,950
Make everyone stay alert.

461
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,880
Don't slack off.

462
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,470
Lu.

463
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,110
Alright.

464
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,710
Lu.

465
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,020
It's an official car, you...

466
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,550
An urgent...

467
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,730
An urgent matter.

468
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,770
My former colleague told me

469
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,660
that this morning at the garbage station on Anyuan Road,

470
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,090
a female corpse was found.

471
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,720
The death was extremely tragic.

472
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,550
It has been classified as a serious case.

473
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,190
Anyuan Road is in Putuo.

474
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,620
Next, they'll definitely start investigating.

475
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,050
If Wang Liqun is alerted,

476
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,350
all our previous efforts will be in vain.

477
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,650
Let's go. Return to the bureau immediately.

478
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,320
Help me ride the bike back.

479
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,840
The deceased is female,

480
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,530
around 22 years old.

481
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,000
The time of death has been over 24 hours.

482
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,020
The preliminary determination of the fatal injury is in the neck area,

483
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,070
most likely due to mechanical asphyxiation.

484
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,530
The body is severely damaged,

485
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,090
especially the face, which is almost unrecognizable.

486
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,630
From the wounds on the limbs, face, and abdomen,

487
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,040
it appears that the body

488
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,100
was attacked by animals after death.

489
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,380
The internal organs were nearly eaten away.

490
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,710
The body was found at the garbage station,

491
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,500
which often has wild dogs.

492
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,850
It was likely bitten by wild dogs.

493
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,080
According to our investigation,

494
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,320
this is not the original crime scene,

495
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,540
but rather a random place to dispose of the body.

496
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,080
This is not a random disposal.

497
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,210
It is a deliberately chosen location.

498
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,120
Lu.

499
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,790
Comrade Lin is a Shanghai local.

500
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,430
Let's hear his opinion.

501
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,100
Here's what I think, Captain Zhang.

502
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,440
Typically, bodies

503
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,090
are disposed of in the sea,

504
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,240
the Huangpu River,

505
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,630
or in remote, desolate areas

506
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,240
to avoid detection.

507
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,960
But now, the situation is different.

508
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,580
We have soldiers

509
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,540
patrolling the docks and rivers.

510
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,340
Choosing a remote area

511
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,330
would be too far

512
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,030
and would likely attract attention during the process.

513
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,280
So now, the garbage dump,

514
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,440
which everyone avoids,

515
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,020
becomes the best choice.

516
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,560
The murderer must be very familiar with the area.

517
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,190
But what he didn't anticipate was

518
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,590
that although there were no people around the garbage station,

519
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,350
wild dogs appeared.

520
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
That's not right.

521
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,000
The murderer chose the garbage station

522
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,460
to let the wild dogs chew on the body,

523
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,390
damaging it

524
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,470
to make identification impossible.

525
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,170
Captain Zhang,

526
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,480
you may not be very familiar with our area.

527
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,860
At our garbage station, the trash

528
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,890
is burned every five days.

529
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,990
If I were the murderer,

530
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,820
I would hide the body in the trash,

531
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,570
bury it,

532
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,600
and wait for it to be burned to ashes.

533
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,730
At that point, no traces would be left.

534
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,830
This time,

535
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,130
we were fortunate that the wild dogs uncovered the body.

536
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,710
Otherwise, it would have become a wrongful conviction.

537
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,310
We wouldn't have had any place to investigate.

538
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,360
Is there any other discovery?

539
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,610
These red high-heeled shoes

540
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,940
belong to the deceased.

541
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,020
The deceased

542
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,730
was likely a dancer in life,

543
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,710
and a rather successful one at that.

544
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,060
A dancer?

545
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,180
Besides dancers,

546
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,320
socialites, and actresses,

547
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,640
many fashionable girls also wear these red high heels.

548
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
How are you sure these shoes belong to a dancer?

549
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
From the deformation of the arch and big toe,

550
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,280
we can confirm that the deceased frequently wore high heels.

551
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,900
But there are too many girls in Shanghai

552
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,560
who wear high heels,

553
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,100
so it's hard to determine her identity.

554
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,460
Look at her ears.

555
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,860
Her ear holes

556
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,430
are larger than those of most people.

557
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,930
Many dancers

558
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,670
are accustomed to changing into a new outfit

559
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,250
and new earrings and other accessories

560
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,490
after every dance performance,

561
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,180
to keep things fresh for their customers.

562
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,130
Moreover, their earrings and other accessories

563
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,400
are very exaggerated,

564
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,230
heavier, and larger than usual.

565
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,000
Wearing them for years

566
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,370
makes it hard not to have larger ear holes.

567
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,330
That makes sense.

568
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,040
Thank you.

569
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,300
Start checking immediately

570
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,410
for any missing persons reports from bars or dance halls.

571
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,990
If there are none, we will start the investigation right away.

572
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,600
Yes.

573
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,500
Wait a moment, Captain Zhang.

574
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,790
We can hold off on the investigation for now.

575
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,040
Shanghai has thousands of dance halls.

576
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,810
We can't investigate them all.

577
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,980
I believe that three days from now,

578
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,150
the dancer's employer will come forward

579
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,610
to report her missing.

580
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Is that possible?

581
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,220
Doctor Jin just said

582
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,940
that the dancer was murdered yesterday.

583
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,340
Looking at her attire,

584
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,430
she must be a prominent dancer from the dance hall,

585
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,580
commonly referred to as a "lead dancer."

586
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,880
It's normal for these lead dancers to be absent for a day or two

587
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,170
if they go out with clients.

588
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,990
If they're gone for three or four days,

589
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,600
the employers will start looking for them through their own channels.

590
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,620
If they're still missing after five or six days,

591
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,930
in other words, if they haven't returned by three days from now,

592
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,200
then the employers will definitely come to report their missing.

593
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,640
After all, this dancer

594
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,390
is their cash cow.

595
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,390
Comrade Lin, you are very knowledgeable

596
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,790
about the dance halls.

597
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,180
Director Lu, Captain Zhang,

598
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,580
I need to get back to work.

599
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,110
Lin,

600
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,490
you are a Shanghai native, right?

601
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,910
Yes, Captain Zhang.

602
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,910
Our Criminal Police Division

603
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,860
is lacking someone like you who understands Shanghai so well

604
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,290
and is sharp-minded.

605
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,970
I think

606
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,320
you would be more adept at investigating homicides than catching agents.

607
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,650
Would you consider coming to work with me?

608
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,000
Is that for real, Captain Zhang?

609
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,910
Yes, it is.

610
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,850
If I join your department,

611
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,710
could I be transferred from an auxiliary officer

612
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,050
to a regular police officer?

613
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,930
What?

614
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,850
You're still an auxiliary personnel?

615
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,650
Yes.

616
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,440
A talent like you is still an auxiliary?

617
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,370
Here's the deal.

618
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,230
The hardships you endured in the Social Affairs Office

619
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,350
will all be compensated for

620
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,830
in my Criminal Police Division.

621
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,650
Here,

622
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,910
give me your data.

623
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,000
Bring it over now.

624
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,880
Captain Zhang.

625
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,530
Comrade Lin won't be coming to your department.

626
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,460
We also urgently need manpower for catching agents,

627
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,040
right, Comrade Lin?

628
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,060
Yes.

629
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,500
Director Lu is right.

630
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,590
Lu,

631
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,100
based on our relationship...

632
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,400
What does our relationship have to do with this?

633
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,530
Right now, we are discussing the case.

634
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,670
I understand the case.

635
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,930
If there are any updates, let's communicate at any time.

636
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,570
Let's go.

637
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,420
Lu.

638
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,620
Lu.

639
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,320
Captain Zhang,

640
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,390
once this case is over,

641
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,460
we can discuss it in detail.

642
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,590
I'll be going ahead.

643
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,790
So petty.

644
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,570
I'll find a day to bring him over.

645
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,340
I discovered a truth today.

646
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,560
Gold shines everywhere.

647
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,920
Did you shine before the liberation?

648
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,630
You thought Zhang really wanted you?

649
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,640
What else?

650
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,650
It's because our department took Cen Xiaoman,

651
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,110
and he's unhappy about it.

652
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,890
You, gold?

653
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,690
By the way,

654
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,080
how much of your area

655
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,469
has been checked?

656
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,090
About a quarter.

657
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,150
Well, mainly the method

658
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,420
is really both clumsy and slow.

659
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,020
I want to go faster but can't.

660
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,790
When investigating a case,

661
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,850
you can't always look for shortcuts.

662
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,460
It's necessary to investigate methodically.

663
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,350
Sometimes slow is actually fast.

664
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,239
Yes, yes, yes,

665
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,130
you're the leader, and everything you say is right.

666
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,020
Lu.

667
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,080
what are you doing?

668
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,940
Mr. Jin, I'll return the money to you.

669
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,760
Sorry, I missed it.

670
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,219
The person wasn't found.

671
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,920
This person is not ordinary.

672
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,150
His movements are secretive, and there are few clues.

673
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,550
Mr. Jiang, I didn't expect you, as a killer,

674
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,120
to be so honest.

675
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,680
Every profession has its own rules.

676
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,880
I only take what I'm owed.

677
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,940
I prefer

678
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,070
to cooperate with those who follow the rules.

679
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,000
Returning the money is a bit early.

680
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,240
Our cooperation is not over yet.

681
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,890
Mr. Jin, do you have other methods?

682
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,370
Once the arrow is released, there's no turning back.

683
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,470
Mr. Jiang,

684
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,490
let me remind you again

685
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,730
that this person is a senior Kuomintang agent.

686
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,360
He's sly and ruthless.

687
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,040
You must not expose yourself

688
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,210
or...

689
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,680
Rest assured, Mr. Jin,

690
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,310
even if I die,

691
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,290
I will never expose you.

692
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,330
That's also a rule.

693
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,940
Wait for my news.

694
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,810
Take a look.

695
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,350
Do you recognize this person?

696
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,540
Have you seen this person?

697
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,400
Have you seen this person?

698
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,660
I really haven't seen her.

699
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,310
I definitely haven't seen her.

700
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:57,990
Alright.

701
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,080
How's it going?

702
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,000
Nothing was found.

703
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,060
Nothing was found.

704
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,110
Xiaoman.

705
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,130
How's it going?

706
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,920
Can you hurry up?

707
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,210
We're already behind.

708
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:13,770
Well.

709
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,400
I was already very fast.

710
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,940
My legs are about to cramp.

711
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,710
Can you help me carry this?

712
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,540
Why?

713
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,290
I see you're tired too.

714
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,080
I'll go buy two bottles of soda.

715
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,190
I'm not tired.

716
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,350
Hurry up.

717
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,780
[Investigators: Xu Wei, Lin Shaobai]

718
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,520
Thank you, Officer Lin.

719
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,680
Yes.

720
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,500
If you hadn't insisted on helping us,

721
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,320
Wangju would have been sold to the Southeast Asia.

722
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,800
Yes, thank you very much.

723
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,180
It's good that she's been found now.

724
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,860
Wangju,

725
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,630
quickly bow to Officer Lin.

726
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,420
Hurry up.

727
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,460
Thank you, Officer Lin.

728
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,460
Sorry for my poor drawing.

729
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,270
It's Zhao Wangju.

730
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,280
Our team has done the least checking.

731
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,200
[Team check]

732
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,480
Lin Shaobai checked for a while and then said he was so thirsty

733
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,300
that he needed to go buy some water.

734
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,010
But he hasn't come back.

735
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,050
Speaking ill of me again, Xiaoman?

736
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,670
Director, I've found a clue.

737
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,360
The one who killed Zhao Wangju

738
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,820
is very likely Wang Liqun.

739
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,390
Zhao Wangju?

740
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,440
The first case I handled as a police officer

741
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,590
was rescuing a group of trafficked girls.

742
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,230
Zhao Wangju was among them,

743
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,370
the very dancer

744
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,980
who was just murdered.

745
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,030
Do you remember our assumptions

746
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,490
about Wang Liqun's personality?

747
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,660
He is ruthless,

748
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,760
impulsive,

749
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,650
and lustful.

750
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,480
And the victim happened to be in Putuo.

751
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,520
Based on these,

752
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,470
you conclude that Wang Liqun is the killer?

753
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,200
The possibility is very high.

754
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,860
This is just your conjecture.

755
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,330
According to Li Qian's confession,

756
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,580
we have basically confirmed

757
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,850
[Arrangement]

758
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,050
Wang Liqun's activity range.

759
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,470
As long as we continue the investigation,

760
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,200
we will definitely find clues.

761
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,030
Diverting limited resources

762
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,330
to investigate another case

763
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,790
will only delay the progress.

764
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,100
Director, trust me.

765
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,120
Investigating from the dancer case

766
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,580
will only speed things up.

767
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,120
Currently, the dancer case is a criminal case,

768
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,510
and it's not under our jurisdiction.

769
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,550
Captain Zhang is already investigating.

770
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,720
If any information about Wang Liqun

771
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,760
is discovered,

772
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,640
he will inform us in time,

773
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,160
so you don't need to worry about it.

774
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,520
Alright,

775
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,090
Director, it turns out you're so thoughtful.

776
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,420
We'll follow your plan.

777
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:15,580
[Arrangement]

778
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,590
Tomorrow, we continue the investigation.

779
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,910
I'll emphasize again.

780
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,600
All teams must not leave your posts without permission.

781
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,270
Work in pairs and act together.

782
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,250
Yes.

783
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,020
We're going to fail to finish the task again today.

784
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,740
Don't worry.

785
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,840
This time, I guarantee we'll finish the task on time.

786
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,070
What time is it? You're still bragging.

787
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,790
Listen to me.

788
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,310
We'll act separately.

789
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,570
Our speed will double.

790
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
But what if the Director finds out?

791
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,700
What's our job?

792
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,650
Don't you know how to keep secrets?

793
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,330
Where are you going?

794
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,800
[Shanghai People's Government Public Security Bureau]

795
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,670
You're saying

796
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,790
the dead dancer is Zhao Wangju?

797
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,610
Yes.

798
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,230
Look at these two photos.

799
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,790
Both show a distinct birthmark

800
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,140
in the same spot on the wrist.

801
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,410
Although the birthmark on the corpse has been destroyed,

802
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,240
the remaining part matches exactly

803
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,430
with the one in Zhao Wangju's photo.

804
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:09,880
Alright,

805
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,280
confirming the victim's identity makes it easier.

806
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,590
Let's immediately check Zhao Wangju's

807
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,520
dancer license.

808
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,280
Let's go.

809
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,180
Hello?

810
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,300
The dancer case has been exposed.

811
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,590
Stay away from

812
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,000
the Dai Yueqing matter.

813
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,010
But I've been

814
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,140
tracking this matter.

815
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,880
May I ask

816
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,860
if it will be handed over to Xu Wei?

817
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,070
It's all for your safety.

818
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,900
Don't be ungrateful.

819
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,960
From now on, you'll only handle the Bulbul lead.

820
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,140
Clear out the Putuo points immediately.

821
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,940
Do as I say.

822
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,950
Alright, I understand.

823
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,060
Lin Shaobai,

824
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,670
why are you just coming back?

825
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,180
You scared me half to death.

826
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,350
The meeting is about to start.

827
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,950
We're the only ones missing.

828
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,470
Calm down.

829
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,800
Let's go.

831
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,830
Why haven't Lin Shaobai and Cen Xiaoman arrived yet?

832
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,470
Is Lin Shaobai slacking off again?

833
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,550
Doggy.

834
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,490
I've noticed you seem to enjoy targeting me.

835
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,310
Who said I'm slacking off?

836

837
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,510
Let me tell you,

838
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,710
today we

839
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,360
investigated 132 households.

840
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,550
Everything is recorded.

841
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,100
My legs are about to break.

842
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,190
Right, Xiaoman?

843
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,990
Shaobai did well.

844
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,260
He's more than us.

845
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,200
Yes, Xiaoman.

846
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,090
How did you investigate?

847
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,000
Teach us.

848
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,060
First, let's have the meeting.

849
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,300
We'll tell you after the meeting.

850
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,930
Xiaoman,

851
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,830
did you investigate together?

852
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,940
Of course.

853
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,200
We coordinated very well today.

854
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,260
Is that so?

855
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,220
I...

856
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,390
We didn't investigate together.

857
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,570
[Team check]

858
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,180
Report, Director.

859
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,520
Today, we were delayed for half a day

860
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,870
because of catching a thief.

861
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,850
To avoid delaying progress,

862
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,030
we split up to investigate.

863
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,480
But most of it was investigated by Shaobai.

864
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,510
I only investigated 35 households.

865
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,530
Lin Shaobai,

866
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,230
Cen Xiaoman investigated

867
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,760
35 households alone today.

868
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,270
Have you considered the consequences

869
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,600
if Wang Liqun was hiding

870
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,580
in one of those households?

871
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,650
I understand.

872
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,870
I guarantee it won't happen

873
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,730
again tomorrow.

874
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,930
There is no tomorrow.

875
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,280
Xiaoman will be in my team tomorrow.

876
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,120
Yes, Director.
