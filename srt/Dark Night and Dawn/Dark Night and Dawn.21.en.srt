00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,789
Attention!

4
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,759
Sir,

5
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,030
you've probably heard of me, right?

6
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,810
Who are you?

7
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,590
I'm the one who's cracked all those recent big cases.

8
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,100
I am Lin Shaobai.

9
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,970
You cracked them?

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,020
Did my pigeons play any part in solving them?

11
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,470
No, I don't think so.

12
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,630
Then it has nothing to do with me.

13
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,080
By the way,

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,210
w-w-what did you say

15
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,620
your name was again?

16
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,050
Lin Shaobai.

17
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,780
S-H-A-O, Shao, and B-A-I, Bai.

18
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,270
Let me tell you, the only 'Bai' I care about is my pigeon.

19
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,110
So, from now on,

20
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,550
don't mention any "Shaobai" or whatever.

21
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,590
I don't know any of them.

22
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,470
Don't bring it up to me.

23
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,270
Let me introduce you.

24
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,990
See?

25
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,350
These are the pigeons for the Jing'an District.

26
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,410
This cage is for the Zhabei District,

27
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,070
and this one is for the Hongkou District.

28
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,710
Got it?

29
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,660
Uh,

30
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,430
no.

31
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,150

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,860
Jing'an. Zhabei.

34
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,430
You got the district names right,

35
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,890
but you mixed up the cages.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,980
Get serious.

37
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,250
Mom, I want to feed the pigeons too.

38
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,940
They are so cute. I want to touch them.

39
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,340
Mom didn't bring any pigeon feed today.

40

You don't know him.

43
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,800
Be good.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,530
Be good. Maybe next time.

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,700
Thank you, uncle.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,170
Thank you.

Chief,

48
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,829
you like kids so much.

49

Why don't you have one of your own?

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,640
The revolution isn't over yet.

51
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,100
Having kids now would only be a burden.

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,590
You should

53
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,970
understand this better than anyone.

54
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,550
Yes.

Okay.

saw a case abroad.

Eventually,

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,870
he couldn't even speak any human language anymore.

119
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,110

while you were far away in the Social Affairs Office.

Now that we're in the same building,

127
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,610
you're suddenly reserved.

128
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,490
What? Are you embarrassed to come to see me

129

Comrade Jin Yan,

131
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,030

142
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,060
And show it to Lu

143
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,520
that it's their loss

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,820
that I'm not working at the Social Affairs Office anymore!

145
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,830
You still can't let go of the Social Affairs Office.

Go say some nice words to Director Lu and apologize.

148
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,150
I won't.

149

Don't believe me, right?

156
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,280

177
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,340

It'll be back soon.

179

180
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,190
perhaps you should go rest for a bit.

181

The sun is too hot.

182
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,230
You're going to find the pigeon, right?

183

Hu will be furious and won't let me off easy.

185

Be back in ten seconds? Stop bragging in the future.

186
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,590
Go apologize to Director Lu when you have time.

187

189

192

Dr. Zhao from Guangci Hospital called.

201

He said it was urgent

202
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,310
and asked you to return his call when you get back.

203
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,550
Okay, got it.

204
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,070
Okay.

205
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,210
Okay.

206

207
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,900
Dr. Zhao, you've worked hard too.

208
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,060
Tonight at seven.

209
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,490
I'll try to make it.

210
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,020
What's the urgent matter?

211
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,730
There are two matters,

212
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,270
both quite tricky.

213
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,750
The first is

214
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,220
that Dr. Zhao's team found anthrax bacteria

215
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,530
in the mouse droppings they sampled in the field,

216
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,750
all of which

217
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,150
were discovered near Jin's Sugar Factory.

218
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,870
The initial suspicion is that the source of contamination is near the sugar factory;

219
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,370
therefore, we need to expand the investigation area.

220
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,710
Dr. Zhao will cooperate with us

221
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,550
for further investigation nearby.

222
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,310
That means our last samples

223
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,780
were effective.

224
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,470
Liu Rui, you'll assist Dr. Zhao with the investigation

225
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,360
and report any updates to the department in a timely manner.

226
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,340
I'll go?

227
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,700
Okay.

228
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,170
What about the second matter?

229
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,970
For the second matter,

230
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,720
Dr. Zhao has asked me out

231
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,150
to give me the test report at 7 p.m. tonight.

232
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,110
Is...

233
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,220

235

Okay.

245
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,610
I need to get a glass of water.

246
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,540
Wait, is that really appropriate?

247
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,850
You eat too. Don't be so polite.

248
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,680

where's Dr. Jin?

250
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,460
She was called away by the Criminal Police Division for a case,

251
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,510
so she asked me to come and keep you company.

252

744
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,500
Agents must have received this kind of training.

745
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,040
For them,

746
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,470
these photos can't be taken out to be developed.

747
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,730
I have a total of twenty-one photos here.

748
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,460
How many does each of you have?

749
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,260
Fifteen.

750
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,760
Ten.

751
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,650
Eleven.

752
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,260
That makes a total of fifty-seven photos.

753
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,700
So many photos.

754
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,580
Even if the agent developed the photos themselves,

755
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,190
they would still need to purchase

756
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,630
some related materials,

757
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,450
like photo paper and developer.

758
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,180
Especially the photo paper,

759
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,380
which has always relied on imports.

760
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,980
Now that Shanghai has just been liberated

761
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,560
and the Kuomintang's navy and air force control the port,

762
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,370
photo paper is in short supply.

763
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,890
Xiang, go investigate

764
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,970
how many shops in Shanghai sell photo paper.

765
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,710
Yes.

766
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,500
It's been a long time.

767
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,520
Xu.

768
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,800
Bring me a green onion next time.

769
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
I'll bring you two pancakes too.

770
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,510
Me too.

771
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,670
Why does this dish smell bad?

772
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,780
It's gone bad?

773
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,080
I don't smell anything.

774
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,510
Lin Shaobai?

775
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,430
What are you doing here?

776
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,270
You're just putting these basic materials

777
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,550
on the board?

778
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,370
There is not a bit of useful information at all.

779
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,520
We've already sorted out those leads.

780
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,100
It's just that we haven't written them on the board.

781
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,940
Tell me.

782
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,150
In the past, we could tell you everything,

783
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,600
but now...

784
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,340
There are rules. Please understand.

785
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,070
I get it; there are rules.

786
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,770
I understand if you can't say.

787
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,540
This is Lu Zhengyang's lunch box, right?

788
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,510
Perfect, I haven't had lunch yet.

789
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,970
Director Lu hasn't eaten.

790
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,030
It's okay. I'll get another one.

791
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,360
Shaobai, since you're here, you are our guest.

792
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
Sit there and eat.

793
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,050
See? It has to be Xu.

794
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,050
Xu is so nice to me.

795
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,880
Come on.

796
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,230
Thanks.

797
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,600
Let me tell you.

798
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I didn't come empty-handed today.

799
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,100
I've just gotten hold of some important leads.

800
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,900
Do you have any progress on your side?

801
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,430
Let's discuss it together.

802
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,580
Lin Shaobai,

803
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,860
come out with me.

804
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,270
Coming.

805
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,280
I still need to eat it when I'm back.

806
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,280
Come here.

807
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,510
What's wrong, Director Lu?

808
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,320
I'm just a pigeon keeper.

809
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,220
How could I solve your case?

810
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,350
I see right through you.

811
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,100
What is it? Tell me. What are you doing here?

812
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,570
Here's the thing.

813
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,930
Our Police Pigeon Squad will distribute new pigeons

814
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,050
to various departments.

815
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,920
There is a pigeon for the Social Affairs Office too.

816
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,000
So, I specifically selected a good one for you.

817
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,310
Its name is Bai,

818
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,880
and it has a very serious work ethic,

819
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,900
never slacking off.

820
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,830
Wherever I go, it can always find me.

821
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,550
You... can just take care of your pigeons.

822
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,810
The kidnapping case has nothing to do with you.

823
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,220
If you violate the rules again,

824
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,000
you won't even have the chance to scoop up pigeon droppings here.

825
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,510
I just came to deliver a pigeon.

826
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,710
I didn't mention any kidnapping cases.

827
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,900
Alright.

828
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,040
Is it still not allowed

829
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,130
that I want to know the progress of the case

830
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,970
as Uncle Jin's nephew

831
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,660
rather than a police officer?

832
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,650
Director Lu, we're colleagues.

833
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,430
At least you can do me a favor.

834
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,700
You still don't understand.

835
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,200
You were punished and relegated

836
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,570
to the Police Pigeon Squad because of the favors.

837
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,750
Jin Yan still remains in her position.

838
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,550
If so, she should be the one to ask,

839
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,600
not you.

840
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Go back to your Police Pigeon Squad.

841
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
I can solve this case without you.

842
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,100
You really can't solve it.

843
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,820
This case falls under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Office.

844
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,150
That's the regulation.

845
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,920
If we're talking about regulations,

846
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,870
the bureau has included this case

847
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,370
in the report,

848
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,000
which means that all police officers

849
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,390
have the obligation to pay attention to leads regarding the case.

850
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,300
I'm in the Police Pigeon Squad. So what?

851
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,280
Even if I were in the Logistics Unit now,

852
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,880
I'd still be wearing this uniform, right?

853
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,320
I have the obligation.

854
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,300
Lin Shaobai, let me tell you.

855
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,610
If you investigate without permission and alert the enemy,

856
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,090
I will definitely strip you of this uniform.

857
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,740
You've vouched for me.

858
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,710
If I'm stripped, you'll be stripped too.

859
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,310
You...

860
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,850
Keeping this from me?

861
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,800
I'm telling you. Just wait.

862
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,370
I won't tell you if I have any leads.

863
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,620
Go through your files.

864
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,950
Stop right there!

865
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,480
You've changed your mind?

866
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,140
Leave the pigeon here.

The ink doesn't dissolve when it enters water,

869
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,990
and the paper is remarkably durable.

870
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,900

Why did he buy more personally than the photo studios?

882
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,220
That's because of his profession.

883

What does he do?

884
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,690
His line of work is called private detective.

Actually, they just take pictures of people's private lives,
