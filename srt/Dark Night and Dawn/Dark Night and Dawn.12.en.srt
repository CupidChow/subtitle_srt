00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,250
Mr. Zheng,

5
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,720
my brother fell into the trap set by the Plum Blossom Agency.

6
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,620
He's dead.

7
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,780
I'll go find out who did this to him.

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,100
Come back.

9
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,100
Don't be impulsive.

10
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,780
Am I being impulsive?

11
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,910
He was my brother!

12
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,770
He was also my comrade for many years.

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,730
I feel the same anger and grief.

14
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,880
But we can't forget Mr. Dai's rule.

15
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,150

16
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,310
and the dead out.

17
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,370
Since your brother chose this path,

18
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,070
he had to accept this.

19
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,570
What if I insist on going?

20
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,480
Are you trying to defy my order?

21
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,140
If you go now, you'll end up just like your brother.

22
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,360
Sit.

23
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,330
Don't let me find out who did this.

24
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,790
Or I'll kill them with my own hands.

25
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,050
My brother and I grew up without our parents.

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,660
Since we were kids, I've always loved eating apples.

27
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,470
Every time my brother earned money,

28
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,930
he'd buy me apples...

29
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
and tell me,

30
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,579
"Eating more apples

31
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,300
will help you grow tall

32
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,760
and keep you safe."

33
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,440
Safe? We couldn't even protect ourselves.

34
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,770
I swear.

35
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,590
I will find out who killed him.

36
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,400
And I'll avenge him.

37
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,800
The Plum Blossom Agency owes us a lot,

38
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,370
and they have to pay it all back.

39
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,390
But not now.

40
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,430

to transfer Wang Liqun.

43
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,390
Once we bring him here, we'll gradually wear him down.

44
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,110
Even if he's tough as nails,

45
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,100
we'll keep at it until he breaks.

Director,

126
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,270
we found this

127
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,330
at the site of the firefight earlier.

128
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,870
It's a fragmentation shell.

129
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,520
I've seen this kind of bullet on the battlefield.

130
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,990
It's also known as the dumdum bullet.

131
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,990
Once this kind of bullet enters the body,

132
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,170
the tip expands into petal-like fragments,

133
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,930
causing much larger wounds.

134
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,930
It's several times more lethal than ordinary bullets.

135
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,240
Once one is shot by this, they're either dead or disabled.

136
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,560
But because it's too brutal

137
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,520
and inhumane,

138
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,650
it has long been banned by the International Convention.

139
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,950
Now, only a small number of them

140
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,540
are circulating on the black market.

141
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,800
But who would use this kind of bullet now?

142
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,310
Assassins?

143
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,550

145
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,210

146
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,310
another group

147
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,360

And this group

151
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,770
came to kill him.

152
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,860

155
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,300
Dead?

156
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,670
He was fine

157
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,740
when he leaped from the Flying Fortress Jeep onto your motorcycle.

158
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,930
How did he die?

159
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,630
I did it.

160
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,840
I killed him.

161
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,520
Give me a reason.

162
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,620
The police shot out the tire.

163
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,560
When the motorcycle flipped, it crushed Falcon's leg.

164
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,830
I couldn't bring him back

165
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,630
on my own.

166
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
That's not a good enough reason.

167
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,610
He was brainwashed by the Communists.

168
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,600
He actually suspected

169
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,200
that you had sold out his brother back in the day.

170
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,190
I figured since I couldn't save him,

171
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,650
it'd be better to kill him.

172
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,380
Otherwise, we would

173
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,950
give us all away.

174
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,670
Falcon was driven by lust and violence.

175
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,640
It was only a matter of time before this happened.

176
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,900
Don't take it too hard.

177
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,520
I want Xu Wei

178
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,830
to replace Liqun as the leader of the action team.

179
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,030
What do you think?

180
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,930
He's not as skilled as Liqun,

181
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,570
but he's much sharper.

182
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,670
It's just

183
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,300
that he lacks experience, which might make it difficult for others to follow him.

184
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,960
Then, let's wait a bit longer.

185
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,750
How much can we trust him?

186
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,430
He'll make us trust him.

187
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,760
Right now, our biggest problem is Lu Zhengyang.

188
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,460

Why do you all look like

190
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,850
defeated roosters?

191
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,760
Lu Zhengyang.

192
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,319
Is this what your soldiers are like?

193
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,630
I can understand the ones

194
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,510
who've never been to the battlefield,

195
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,359
but you veterans,

196
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,930
don't you know better?

197
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,420
Victory and defeat are both common in war.

198
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,069
This mission to transfer Wang Liqun

199
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,950
has failed.

200
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,250
But just grit your teeth

201
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,069
and win it back next time!

202
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,020
This time,

203
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,110
it was an ambush, carefully planned by enemy agents.

204
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,430
What does it mean?

205
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,870
It means that despite the liberation,

206
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,840
the situation of our city's defense work is

207
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,140
that the enemy lurks in the shadows while we are exposed.

208
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,270
I can give you time to rest and regroup,

209
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,790
but will the enemy agents give you that time?

210
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,050
Right now, all the citizens of Shanghai,

211
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,990
Chairman Mao of the Party Central Committee,

212
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,070
all of China,

213
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,060
and even the whole world are watching our city.

214
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,820
They've witnessed us taking over Shanghai,

215
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,860
and now they want to see

216
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,400
if we can govern it well!

217
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,340
Do you have confidence?

218
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,070
Yes!

219
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,070
Then, pull yourselves together

220
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,520
and show them the answer

221
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,090
through victory.

222
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,310
Yes!

223
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:20,320
[Strive and persevere; Be determined and resolute in our pursuit]

224
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,380
I know what you're about to say.

225
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,200
This operation has failed,

226
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,900
which means someone among us has leaked information

227
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,840
or

228
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,680
that the enemy has planted a mole

229
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,730
within us.

230
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,160
Regarding the transfer route and schedule we established,

231
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,260
besides the comrades involved from the bureau,

232
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,390
the entire Office 2 responsible for execution is under suspicion.

233
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,310
We have to find this person;

234
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,520
otherwise, every future operation

235
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,320
could be exposed to the enemy.

236
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,150
Let's do this.

237
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,760
You will take the lead on this

238
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,960
and start an internal investigation immediately.

239
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,820
[Strive and persevere; Be determined and resolute in our pursuit]

240
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,490
Yes.

241
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,410
During the transfer,

242
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,210
Lin Shaobai was in confinement,

243
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,640
so his suspicion can be ruled out first.

244
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,520
I request

245
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,960
that he assist me

246
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,920
in conducting the investigation.

247
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,880
Your payment.

248
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,250
I didn't kill him after all.

249
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,680
Someone else got to him first.

250
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,630
I only took what I was supposed to take.

251
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,640
Who did it?

252
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,630
The one who came to rescue him.

253
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,060
When he realized that he couldn't rescue Wang Liqun,

254
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,810
he decided to take care of him instead.

255
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,810
Were you exposed?

256
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm not sure.

257
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,340
But even if they find me,

258
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,090
there won't be anything that can be traced back to you.

259
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,590
I trust you with the job.

260
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,510
But this isn't over yet.

261
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,350
Your final task is

262
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,910
to find out who Wang Liqun's superior is.

263
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,350
These agents are bold enough to hijack even a public security convoy.

264
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,150
We may all get dragged down if things go wrong.

265
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,130
Zhao Lan, hurry up.

266
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,260
Help me change all of these price tags.

267
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,570
[Daxin Department Store; Silver Dollar; Two Dollars]

268
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,250
This is the price of silver dollars.

[Silver Dollar; Two Silver Dollars And a dime]

270
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,590
Are we no longer accepting RMB?

271
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,680
We're not allowed to say to the customers that we're not accepting it;

272
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,390
just tell them to pay the listed price.

273
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,830
Today, all four major department stores on East Nanjing Road

274
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,270
are switching to silver dollar pricing.

275
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,880
The RMB won't work anymore.

276
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,430
The manager says that all of Shanghai will follow suit.

277
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,190
Hurry up.

278
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,430

[Mao Zedong; On the People's Democratic Dictatorship]

280
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,030
You've been confined for two days,

281
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,270
and all you've written is two words?

282
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,110
This is called "silence speaks louder than words."

283
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,490
I have to leave room for the imagination.

284
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,220
Pack up.

285
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
You can leave now.

286
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,250
What happened?

287
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,430
The mission to transfer Wang Liqun failed.

288
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,810
Wang Liqun is dead.

289
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,230
Wait.

290
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,310
I've only been confined for a few days,

291
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,370
and you guys managed to mess it all up?

292
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,700
How about I write you a self-criticism?

293
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
That won't be necessary.

294
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,390
The problem of the failure this time

295
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,880
may be internal.

296
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,550
Anyone in Office 2 is a potential suspect.

297
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,430
Except for you, since you've been confined here for two days,

298
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,230
you're clear.

299
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,430
Deputy Commissioner Yang has asked you to assist me in the internal investigation.

300
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,860
Now I get it.

301
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,760
When there's nothing happening, I'm confined here.

302
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,730
But when you need someone to ruffle feathers, you let me out.

303
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,860
I won't help you.

304
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,980
Really?

305
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,210
I'm busy.

No.

315
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,110
Why haven't you gone home yet?

316
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,420
I'll explain it to you later.

317
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,590
Right now, hurry and pack your things.

Why so sudden? Aren't you coming with me?

I still have some things to finish.

what you're doing?

326
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,680
My work is confidential.

327
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,430
Don't worry.

328
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,400
I won't be in danger.

329
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,930
Let's leave today. Come on.

330
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,950
Comrade Xu Wei.

331
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,050
This must be Zhao Lan, right?

332
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,150
Who are you?

333
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,900
I've heard a lot about you from Xu Wei.

334
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,550
We finally meet today.

335
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,100
Allow me to introduce myself.

336
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,230
I'm Xu Wei's superior.

337
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,350
Since the Liberation, we've been working

338
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,210
in the Secret Counter-Espionage Unit of the Public Security Bureau.

339
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,340
Yes.

340
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,110
Why didn't you tell me

341
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,550
that you're working at the Public Security Bureau?

342
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,600
In our line of work,

343
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,100
we can't reveal anything

344
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,630
without the organization's approval.

345
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,290
I'm sorry that you've been kept in the dark.

346
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,740
We've come to you today

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,420
to protect you for Comrade Xu Wei.

348
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,150
Comrade Xu Wei wants to send you back to your hometown,

349
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,680
but we believe it's not safe there.

350
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,510
We have a better place for you,

351
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,610
which will completely alleviate

352
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,450
Xu Wei's concerns.

353
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,950
We can handle our own matters.

354
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,680
We won't trouble you.

355
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,210
Since the organization has thought it for you,

356
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,920
I suggest you listen to the organization.

357
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,060
Shanghai has been liberated,

358
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,920
and you're all from the Public Security Bureau.

359
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,010
Can I not leave?

360
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,720
No.

361
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,120
Our identities are highly sensitive,

362
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,410
and you're already being targeted by enemy agents.

363
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,800
The new male clerk across from your counter,

364
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,420
the one selling flashlights,

365
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,570
could harm you at any moment.

366
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,380
So, we need to transfer you as soon as possible.

367
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,390
Then... where am I going?

368
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,800
A rural area in Zhejiang.

369
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,530
A lot of our comrades' families are living there.

370
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,880
Once you're there,

371
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,200
you can focus on preparing for the baby.

372
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,870
But in the countryside,

373
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,530
the doctors aren't as good as those in Shanghai.

374
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,070
Don't worry.

375
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,580
When you're nearing your due date,

376
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,960
we'll send the best doctors

377
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,460
from the Public Security system to deliver you.

378
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,190
Your child will be born

379
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,180
as a descendant of revolutionaries.

380
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,910
We have to take good care of him.

381
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,770
How often will we be able to see each other?

382
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,100
As long as the condition allows,

383
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,670
he can visit you anytime.

384
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,070
This brief separation

385
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,850
is for the sake of a longer reunion in the future.

386
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,120
I'm also a woman.

387
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,440
We are all the same.

388
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,750
I understand.

389
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,460
Wei.

390
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,630
I know you're doing something

391
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,870
very important.

392
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,470
But no matter what,

393
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,390
please stay safe.

394
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,590
Thank you for your sacrifice.

395
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,700
Comrade Xu Wei,

396
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,300
say goodbye to your wife.

397
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,160
You won't look pretty if you keep crying.

398
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,810
All right.

399
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,770
Don't worry.

400
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,380
I'll be fine.

401
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,080
Remember,

402
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,940
take care of yourself

403
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,450
and our baby.

404
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,490
Don't cry.

405
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,010
You have to stay safe.

406
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,530
Comrade Zhao Lan, come with me.

407
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,780
Who gave you the right to drag her into this?

408
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,540
Is it Shrike's order?

409
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,120
You should know.

410
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,580
Trust

411
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,760
is very fragile.

412
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,910
It needs something to sustain it.

413
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,880
Then tell Shrike

414
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,290
that Zhao Lan and the child she's carrying

415
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,500
are my final line.

416
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,560
If anyone dares to harm them,

417
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,380
I won't let it go.

418
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,710
Shrike never accepts threats.

419
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,760
By the way...

420
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,860
Falcon is dead.

421
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,320
The Public Security Bureau will investigate it.

422
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,740
Clean up all traces

423
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,990
so that they won't be able to find you.

424
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,170
As for Zhao Lan,

425
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,550
I'll make sure she's well taken care of.

426
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,830
Go ahead, tell me.

427
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,390
What did you do last night?

428
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,350
When I was not on a mission,

429
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,750
I went straight back to the dorm after work.

430
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,980
Except for me, everyone in the Social Affairs Office

431
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,380
is a clean and innocent member of the Party.

432
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,230
We've just verified

433
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,950
their whereabouts for the days of the incident,

434
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,680
and they all have solid alibis.

435
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,990
If we really need to identify a suspect,

436
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,960
it can only be Xu.

437
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,750
When Xu comes later,

438
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,710
your only responsibility is to record what he says

439
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,040
and don't talk too much.

440
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,360
I'll be the bad cop,

441
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,550
and you can be the good cop.

442
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,290
Consider this a favor for you.

443
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,230
You're not worried about offending people now?

444
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,030
I'm worried that your camaraderie

445
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,560
might cloud your judgment.

446
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,360
Are you suspecting me?

447
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,560
Only you, Deputy Commissioner Yang, and Lu

448
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,200
are most familiar with the transfer route map.

449
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,150
You're the only one

450
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,980
who has had the map out of your sight for a long time.

451
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,070
So it could only

452
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,670
have been leaked by you.

453
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:46,950
Where is the evidence?

454
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,990
It'll come soon.

455
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,940
If it's my fault,

456
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,500
then cuff me and send me to military court now!

457
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,910
No.

458
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,030
Come on, Xu.

459
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,030
You're a long-time comrade here.

460
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,170
Don't throw a tantrum.

461
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,110
I'm only addressing the matter, not attacking the person.

462
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,030
Deputy Commissioner Yang has asked me to investigate this.

463
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,990
Get to the point.

464
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,230
Hurry up

465
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,110
and tell me everything and all the details

466
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,510
about your visit to the Taiping Bathhouse.

467
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,340
I did go to the Taiping Bathhouse that day,

468
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,470
but I have a witness.

469
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,220
Chen went with me.

470
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,470
[Deputy Commissioner's Office]

471
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,310
Chen?

472
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,150
Long time no see.

473
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,950
Indeed.

474
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,350
I've been meaning to buy you a drink.

475
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,480
Everyone in the Social Affairs Office

476
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,570
[Deputy Commissioner's Office]

477
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,970
is as busy as a spinning top,

478
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,700
so I didn't want to disturb you.

479
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,010
Don't get me started on it. There are all kinds of cases.

480
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,610
[Deputy Commissioner's Office]

481
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,850
Every time we solve one case, another pops up.

482
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,880
My neck is getting stiffer and stiffer.

483
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,300
It's an old problem of yours.

484
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,340
Well, I'm off work soon.

485
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,220
Come on. Let's go soak in a bath together.

486
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,560
My treat.

487
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,430
So, you two were together

488
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,430
the whole time at the bath?

489
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,590
Of course, we were.

490
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,770
We were soaking.

491
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,610
Lu, you know

492
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,040
that my leg isn't great,

493
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,870
so I just stayed in the pool.

494
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,510
Except for when Xu went to the restroom,

495
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,210
we should have been together the whole time.

496
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,940
How long was he in the restroom?

497
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,150
Lu,

498
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,580
it's all for work.

499
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,500
I understand.

500
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,400
He was in the restroom for no more than five minutes.

501
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,580
Alright, got it.

502
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,640
After you came out of the bath,

503
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,080
where did you go?

504
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,150
We came out of the bath

505
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,790
around ten o'clock,

506
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,170
so we each went home.

507
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,460
I stopped by Wu's Cake Shop on No. 3 Horse Road,

508
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,950
bought some nougat,

509
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,330
and then went home.

510
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,620
There are some bathhouses in Shanghai I haven't visited yet.

511
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,420
You can take me to them sometime.

512
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,770
I'll treat you next time.

513
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,910
I'll treat you, too.

514
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,730
There is a master from Yangzhou

515
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,790
who is excellent at scrubbing backs.

516
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,690
It's the rule.

517
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,030
The weather is bad.

518
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,070
Your leg starts to hurt, right?

519
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,380
Yes, Lu, you know me well.

520
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,760
It's an old problem.

521
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,020
I used to think that, given Chen's leg condition,

522
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,420
he'd be capable of nothing more than cleaning the archives room.

523
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,390
I didn't expect that he'd be one of your underground agents.

524
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,860
You really aren't picky.

525
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,720
Now he's a section chief after the liberation.

526
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,940
Speak properly.

527
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,390
Chen's leg was injured by Japanese agents

528
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,910
from the Mei Agency during a mission,

529
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,640
while the Japanese puppet regime was still here.

530
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,190
A few days before the Liberation,

531
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,920
Mao Sen ordered the destruction of all the files,

532
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,580
including not only

533
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,110
criminal records

534
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,280
but also the household registration data

535
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,240
of all Shanghai citizens.

536
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,470
If Chen hadn't smuggled those files

537
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,860
dozens of times, despite his injured leg,

538
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,650
our Public Security Bureau

539
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,650
might still be struggling to function normally now.

540
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,290
Chen is quite something.

541
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,370
But I still suspect him.

542
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,240
He could easily take advantage of

543
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,060
the five minutes while Xu was in the restroom

544
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,920
to access the transfer route map.

545
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,970
Go. Let's go to the Taiping Bathhouse.

546
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,580
[Please don't enter the pool with soap]

547
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,830
I'll be Chen now.

548
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,210
You take care of the timing.

549
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,100
Okay.

550
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's start.

551
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,090
[Route Map to Transfer Wang Liqun]

552
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,659
How long did I use?

553
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,989
Five minutes and fifty seconds.

554
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,199
That pretty much rules out Chen.

555
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
There's no way he could have made it.

556

He's not a bad guy.

He used to collect a little protection money.

After the Liberation, he joined the Public Security Bureau

For men, there are a few common ones.

What exactly does he dabble in?

603
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,390
His right hand was stained yellow from the opium pipe,

604
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,530
and there was always a scent of makeup lingering behind his neck.

605
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,310
That was from the nightclub dancers.

606
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,970
He was a cop, but he wore a thumb ring but no watch.

607
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,510
That clearly shows he was a gambler who always tried to win back his losses.
