[Dark Night and Dawn]

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,930
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,380
I think he planted a spy

4
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,990
around me.

5
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,050
Planted a spy?

6
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,310
Who could it be?

7
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,390
There must be a reason for things going wrong.

8
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,539
Think about it.

9
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,640
Since when

10
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,039
things started to go wrong?

11
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,820
Since Liu Mingjian was killed.

12
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,030
Everything was fine before that.

13
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,640
Before Liu Mingjian died,

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,480
he threatened me

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,650
with many accounts.

16
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,620
Some of them

17
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,140
were beyond his reach.

18
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,360
So I guess

19
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,030
someone must have given them to him.

20
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,079
During that period,

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,900
Mr. Li of the sugar factory came.

22
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,410
He said

23
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,550
he came to share experience with the textile factory.

24
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,560
He also drank wine with Mr. Liu a few times.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,260
Li Yuquan doesn't drink.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,200
That's right.

27
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,630
As you said just now,

28
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,350
something went wrong.

29
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,280
By the way, Mr. Jin,

30
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,310
why does Shrike insist

31
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,650
on building a sugar research institute

32
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,010
in Li Yuquan's sugar factory

33
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,390
instead of somewhere else?

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,650
Isn't he worried Li Yuquan will find out?

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,400
I remember Yan

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,829
went to investigate the anthrax's case.

37
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,380
I asked her later

38
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,070
how she got in.

39
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,580
What did she say?

40
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,870
Yan said

41
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,790
Mr. Li personally went to negotiate.

42
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,050
That was how she got in.

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,720
Then I thought about it.

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Those agents

45
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,170
only listen to Falcon and Shrike.

46
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,780
Why would they listen to Li Yuquan?

47
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,260
Unless he is an agent.

48
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,620
That ungrateful jerk.

49
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,160
Mr. Jin, you treated him so well.

50
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,910
Since he's willing to be a spy,

51
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,210
he should know the consequences of a spy.

52
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,490
To deal with Shrike,

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,940
we need to get rid of the spy first.

54
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,079
Will this...

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,079
irritate Shrike?

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,030
The art of battle

57
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,460
is not about fighting head-on.

58
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,780
You mean...

59
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,390
We need to make the spy

60
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,590
disappear without anyone

61
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,710
knowing.

62
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,029
Here, over here.

63
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,510
Put it here.

64
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,070
Report!

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,750
Lin Shaobai from Office 2 is here to report for duty!

66
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,150
No one is paying any attention to you at all.

67
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,590
Still, Office 2 is better.

68
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,380
Thanks.

69
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,490
Don't thank me.

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,910
Your seat is still occupied by me.

71
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,270
Hurry up and sort out your things.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,110
Lin Shaobai!

73
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,720
Welcome back.

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,280
Thanks.

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,620
Lin Shaobai.

76
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,770
Come in.

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm going to Lu.

78
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,030
Show some respect.

79
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,370
That's what happened.

80
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,270
The people we caught in the warehouse were just nobodies.

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,790
I only saw Xu Wei.

82
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,010
I didn't see Shrike.

83
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,090
The incendiary bombs made by Xu Wei

84
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,060
also include white phosphorus

85
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,160
besides napalm.

86
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,420
Once they ignite,

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,110
even water can't put them out.

88
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,500
It's not easy to get white phosphorus.

89
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,490
He made almost 100 incendiary bombs.

90
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,690
So a lot of white phosphorus was needed.

91
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,190
Huzi and the others have conducted an investigation.

92
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,320
These

93
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,070
are the names

94
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,720
of the companies and factories involved

95
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,980
in recent transactions of white phosphorus.

96
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,640
One of them is familiar to you.

97
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,400
[Jin's Sugar Factory: 500 kilograms of white phosphorus, Jin Maochang]

98
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,210
Uncle Jin?

99
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,100
The incendiary bombs were found in a few warehouses.

100
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,760
They are also his properties.

101
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,659
You suspect Uncle Jin?

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
He purchased white phosphorus

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,290
and his warehouses were involved.

104
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,490
That inevitably makes him suspicious.

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,670
But Jin Maochang

106
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,520
has always been a progressive entrepreneur.

107
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,530
We just saved him not long ago.

108
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,520
I don't believe

109
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,770
he would stand against the government.

110
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,870
But the work that needs to be done

111
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,000
still has to be done.

112
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,470
I know.

113
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,790
You want to investigate him,

114
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,670
but you don't want to hurt his feelings.

115
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,430
So you can only send me, who is close to him.

116
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,370
That's the most appropriate way.

117
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,670
You catch on to it quickly.

118
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,620
Cut it out.

119
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,820
This kind of thing would offend people.

120
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:14,990
Fine.

121
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,030
I'll figure something out.

122
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,870
Okay, Mr. Jin.

123
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,610
We've got a basic understanding of the warehouses' situation.

124
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,150
One more thing.

125
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,970
Young officer, feel free to ask.

126
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,230
I'll answer your questions.

127
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,600
Not long ago, did your factory

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,290
purchase a batch of white phosphorus?

129
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:29,990
Yes.

130
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,430
It's true.

131
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,370
Is it also related to the agents' case?

132
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,220
How much did you purchase?

133
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,420
What was it used for?

134
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,600
I can't recall the exact amount,

135
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,130
but it was around 300 catties or so.

136
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,820
Did you personally check the white phosphorus

137
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,070
when it was delivered?

138
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,190
No.

139
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,770
The factories report how much

140
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,840
they need.

141
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
I just need to sign it.

142
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,310
The factories that need much white phosphorus now

143
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,630
are the match factory

144
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,150
and the sugar factory.

145
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,640
There are records in the factories.

146
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
If you need,

147
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,270
I can take you to verify them.

148
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,760
It's okay. No need to trouble you.

149
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,080
We can go ourselves.

150
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,090
Uncle Jin, do you have those accounts

151
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,280
here at home?

152
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,110
Yes.

153
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,450
They're on the desk in my study.

154
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,510
I'll go get them for you.

155
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,570
No need, Uncle Jin.

156
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,550
Xiaoman,

157
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
you go take a look.

158
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,300
Ms. Zhang.

159
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,720
Yes.

160
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,500
Please take my colleague to the study.

161
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,450
Okay.

162
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,970
Uncle Jin, there are only the two of us now.

163
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,990
If there is anything uncomfortable,

164
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,390
you can tell me directly.

165
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,900
What uncomfortable thing would I have?

166
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,920
I've said everything I should.

167
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,320
Don't be worried.

168
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,380
You watched me grow up.

169
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,920
Our families go way back.

170
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,250
If you're really in trouble,

171
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,310
I'll do whatever it takes to help you.

172
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,990
Shaobai,

173
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,740
I just want to ask you one thing.

174
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,190
Do the police suspect me

175
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,980
of having ties to the agents?

176
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,950
No.

177
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,570
But I'll just break the rules

178
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,870
and tell you this.

179
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,050
When Kuomintang ruled Shanghai,

180
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,670
your business was prosperous.

181
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,880
So it was inevitable that you helped the NBIS.

182
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,620
If agents are causing you trouble

183
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,210
and you can't go to the police,

184
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,260
I can help sort it out for you.

185
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,429
Really?

186
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,440
I helped people solve many problems when I was in the bureau.

187
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,300
It's a new society now.

188
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,850
It's better to resolve things early.

189
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,050
If there are more people involved,

190
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,780
there could be bigger trouble.

191
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,610
Thank you.

193

Even if there is something,

195
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,450

196
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,970
transparently and by the book.

197
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,510
That's how I can prove I'm innocent.

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,540
Okay.

Jin Maochang did purchase white phosphorus.

219

But it's only for his factories.

220
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,400
He doesn't know

221
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,110
what it has been used for.

222
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,780
Based on the investigation, that's the situation.

223
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,130

225
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,580
During the investigation,

226
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,200
Lin Shaobai deliberately sent me away

227
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,130
to talk to Jin Maochang privately.

228
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,910
I don't know what they talked about.

229
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,760
But given their relationship,

230
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,870
I think he might be hiding something.

231
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,180
Xiaoman,

232
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,260
can you not tell on me in front of me next time?

233
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,220
Telling him behind your back is called telling on you.

234
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,480
I told him in front of you. This is called reporting.

235
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,640
It's aboveboard.

236
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,380

237
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,110
I think Lin Shaobai sent you away deliberately

238
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,570
to lower Jin Maochang's guard

239
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
and get him to open up.

240
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,320

241
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,030

there were some words

244
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,390
I couldn't say to him in front of you.

245
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,960
Even if I said in front of you, he wouldn't believe me.

251

your plan in advance,

252

Mr. Jin.

377
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,440
When you find Li Yuquan, no matter where he is,

378
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,410
let me know immediately.

379
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:04,900
Okay.

380
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,270
Alright, Uncle Jin,

381
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,870
you can go back to rest.

382
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,850
We'll contact you immediately

383
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,320
if anything comes up.

384
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,090
Okay.

385
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,230
Bring that plate here.

386
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,540
Bye.

387
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,280
I'll also take a sample back

388
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,340
and ask Dr. Jin to run some tests on it.

389
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,710
Who is it?

390
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,610
Where are you going?

391
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,130
Yan?

392
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,450
Why are you here?

393
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,170
Are you investigating my dad's sugar factory?

394
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,600
No.

395
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,870
We're just here to verify

396
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,200
if the raw materials match up.

397
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
I heard everything.

398
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,560
The white phosphorus is missing and has been replaced.

399
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,980
Don't worry, Yan.

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,860
We'll get to the bottom of it soon.

401
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,250
But look at you.

402
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,750
What's with your outfit?

403
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,640
Why are you here?

404
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,790
Do you remember

405
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,790
the anthrax I told you about before?

406
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,610
We found rats

407
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,170
carrying anthrax bacteria near the sugar factory.

408
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,790
At first, I thought someone was developing anthrax.

409
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,390
But later, I discovered anthrax bombs nearby

410
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,330
left behind by the Japanese.

411
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,880
So the rats were infected

412
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
by those anthrax bombs.

413
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,530
I think so too.

414
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,510
But I've received the test report.

415
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,200
The bacteria on the anthrax bombs

416
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,130
and the bacteria carried by the rats aren't the same.

417
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,410
That means

418
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,390
the true source of the infection hasn't been found yet.

419
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,280
Someone wants to use the anthrax bombs

420
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,040
to cover up the fact that there are anthrax bacteria here.

421
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,580
So you came here

422
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,520
to secretly investigate the infection source of anthrax?

423
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,950
If I came in openly,

424
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,410
they would have to report it.

425
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,470
So I snuck in.

426
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,650
But you still saw me.

427
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,460
You need to stop investigating it, Yan.

428
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,660
Have you thought about this?

429
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,180
If someone really is developing anthrax here,

430
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,090
what would happen to you if you meet them?

431
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,370
Of course I know that.

432
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,790
I just want to confirm

433
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,030
if this matter has anything to do with my dad.

434
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,950
Even so, you still need to stop!

435
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,950
Trust me.

436
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,730
I'll discuss this with Lu.

437
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,310
The Social Affairs Office will investigate it.

438
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,390
You should stay out of this.

439
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,250
Just go home and wait for our news.

440
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,670
Okay?

441
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,220
Li Yuquan is very suspicious.

[Be modest, cautious, humble, and patient]

443
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,030
He was probably the one who provided the white phosphorus for Shrike.

444
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,780
His business trip to Ningbo

445
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,390
is probably just an excuse for his escape.

446
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,210
I'll ask Shi Pengfei and Zhou Hong to verify it in Ningbo.

447
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,990
Before we receive their news,

448
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,720
we need to keep an eye on the sugar factory.

449
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,010
Don't act rashly

450
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,230
to alert them.

451
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,880
Okay.

452
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,080
What should we do about the anthrax matter

453
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,430
Jin Yan mentioned?

454
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,890
Anthrax was also found near the sugar factory.

455
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,220
After we find Li Yuquan,

456
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,150
everything will become clear.

457
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,680

459
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,590

Why are you still up?

462
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,200
Is something bothering you so that you can't sleep?

463
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,710
Or are you sick?

464
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,190
Nothing is bothering me.

465
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,610
It's just that I'm... I'm not feeling very well.

466
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,490
Come, sit down and talk.

467
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,730

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,230

go to you first.

475
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,760
You scared me just now.

476
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,350
I thought there was a thief in our house.

477
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,770
I just couldn't sleep,

478
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,800
so I was writing an autopsy report.

479

But...

480
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
But my pen ran out of ink.

481
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,880
So I came to grab a bottle of ink.

482
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,550
Alright, I'm going back to continue to write my report.

483

547
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,810
his real identity?

548
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,870
Then he pretended to be Chen

549

553
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,650

He never remarried.

is gone.

That's what makes him suspicious.

562
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,910
Where should we start?

563
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,590
In May 1943, he severely injured his left leg

564
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,100
during a mission

565
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,840
[In May 1943, he severely injured his left leg during a mission and was left with a disability.]

566
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,860
and was left with a disability.

567
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,870
If Chen

568
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,750
really is an imposter,

569
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,230
what would he do?

570
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,210
He'd imitate everything,

571
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,080
including the disability of his left leg.

572
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,870
Then let's start with checking his leg.

573
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,960
If he's pretending to be crippled,

574
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,330
he's an agent

575
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,770
and the mole who infiltrated us.

576
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,860
I just received a notice.

577
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,040
The organization has arranged

578
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,460
a physical examination for everyone this weekend.

579
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,510
It'll last for two days.

580
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,620
Just take this physical examination form

581
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,410
and go directly to Guangci Hospital, okay?

582
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,820
Our bureau offers benefits like this?

583
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,820
When will you go? Let's go together.

584
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,420
My home is next to the hospital.

585
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,470
I'll go tomorrow morning.

586
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,280
Lin Shaobai, don't be late for the physical examination.

587
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,680
I can't promise you that.

588
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,650
I'm not much of a morning person.

589
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,390

590
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,860
You've also got an X-ray for your lower limbs.

591
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,210
This must be a special arrangement for old comrades.

592
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,060
Okay.

593
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,480
You won't do it?

594
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,710
Director Lu.

595
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,580
The bureau didn't arrange a physical examination, right?

596
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,430
Is it only

597
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,160
for the Social Affairs Office?

598
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,620
Maybe the bureau noticed

599
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,840
we've been working very hard lately,

600
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,250
so they arranged it for our department first.

601
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,950
I'm sure they'll arrange it for the other departments too.

602
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,320
Okay.

603
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,550
I'll

604
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,950
go with the other colleagues in the bureau.

605
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,000
After all, I was seconded here.

606
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,090
My membership credential is still in the Archives Department.

607
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,550
We are all colleagues in the bureau.

You hid it well.

620

It took me a lot of effort to track it down.

621

I trusted you so much.

622
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,550
You're the one they planted around me, right?

623
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,230
Mr. Jin,

624
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,940
you also work for Shrike.

625
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,070
Do you think Shrike will stand by

626
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,040
and just let you treat me like this?

627
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,550
You know what he's capable of.

628
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,590
The police are already investigating the white phosphorus.

629
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,890
We can't keep it under wraps anymore.

630
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,010
I'm wondering

631
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,930
who Shrike will sacrifice

635
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,680
What exactly do you want?

636
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,550
Write a confession.

638
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,900
Shrike ordered me to do.

639
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,880
You...

640
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,100
You want me to take the blame for you?

641
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,639
I'm saving you.

642
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,610
Once Shrike finds out

643
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,370

644
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,570

Only I

647
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,320
can save you.

648
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,100

There is also a steamer ticket to Hong Kong.

655
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,770
I don't think Shrike would give you this much.

656
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,530
Of course, you can refuse.

657
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,880
Then I can solve the problem for Shrike.

658
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,120
Don't.

659
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,520

660
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,310
to think about it.

661

Someone from Jinan's Public Security Bureau came.

746
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,580
I had to accompany them. So I didn't have time for my physical examination.

747
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,860
What a pity.

748
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,580
Not at all.

749
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,760
I've talked to the person in charge

750
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,590
of the physical examination.

751
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,880
He asked me to go this morning.

752
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,920
Let's go together.

753
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,560
I don't want to trouble them.

754
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,840
I know my health condition. There's nothing wrong with me.

755
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,840
Chen,

756
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,750
you should go.

757
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,910
Maybe your leg can be cured.

758
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,180
If it can be cured, it would have been cured long ago.

759
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,270
You never know. Medicine has advanced a lot.

760
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,780
You should trust science.

761
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,990
I'm not going.

762
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,560
I don't want to trouble them.

763
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,430
How is this causing trouble?

764
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,630
Also,

765
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,600
why did I get an X-ray

766
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,380
when no one else did?

767
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,560
That must be special care

768
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,190
from the higher-ups.

769
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,230
Look, your leg...

770
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,090
My leg is fine!

771
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,900
I don't need special treatment.

772
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,920
I'm not going.

773
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,030
How is this special treatment?

774
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,210
Your leg's condition is obvious.

775
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,250
Li,

776
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,870
what do you mean?

777
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,930
What do you mean by saying my leg's condition is obvious?

778
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,110
You're trying to say I'm a cripple, right?

779
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,600
Yes, my leg's a bit stiff!

780
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,460
But have I ever done less than anyone else?

781
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,240
Have I ever fallen behind when we were on a mission?

782
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,210
I'm no different from you guys!

783
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,860
Why are you so angry?

784
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,450
I'm doing this for your own good.

785
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,950
Then stop bringing up my leg!

786
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,320
My leg was injured for the revolution!

787
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,140
It's a badge of honor,

788
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,280
not an excuse for special treatment!

789
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,990
Chen,

790
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,720
Yaohong just wants to show you some care.

791
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,710
I don't need it!

792
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,140
I don't need his sympathy

793
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,600
either!

794
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,540
You showed no respect to an old revolutionary!

795
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,460
What are you doing?

796
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,310
All right.

797
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,810
Calm down.

798
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,420
Chen, don't be angry.

799
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,660
Let's talk properly.

800
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,310
It's just a physical examination!

801
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,910
Why are you making a fuss?

802
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,170
Who's making a fuss?

803
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,460
You just want to see

804
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,390
if there's something wrong with my leg, don't you?

805
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:09,920
I... I...

806
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,690
Director Lu, you came at the right time.

807
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,510
Lu, I want to ask you something.

808
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,160
Is the physical examination

809
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,770
mandatory?

810
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,110
Is there a file

811
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,370
ordering me to go?

812
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,570
If not,

813
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,430
I am not going for the physical examination this time!

814
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,920
You...

815
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,830
It's Deputy Commissioner Yang's idea.

816
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,630
He wants to make sure

817
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,990
our old comrades are well taken care of.

818
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,690
We didn't have the resources before.

819
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,930
Many old comrades have shrapnel in their bodies

820
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,270
and they have health issues.

821
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,580
Now that we do,

822
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,720
we should cure them

823
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,850
so that we can build a new China better.

824
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,400
Chen, this is not special treatment.

825
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,310
It's part of work.

826
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,640
If you don't go,

827
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,610
I can't explain to the higher-ups.

828
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,070
Do me a favor

829
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,060
and help me finish this task.

830
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,790
Director Lu,

831
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,560
I'll go.

832
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,290
I'll go.

833
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,940
Here.

834
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,900
Chen, don't be angry.

835
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,200
I'm not being difficult.

836
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,870
Look at Li's attitude.

837
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,770
He acted like he wanted to take me,

838
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,110
an old revolutionary, to my execution

839
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,180
instead of a physical examination!

840
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,140
When did I say...

841
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Enough.

842
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,610
Let's just drop it.

843
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,610
It's just a physical examination. It's not a big deal.

844
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,450
How about this?

845
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,880
I need to go to the hospital to get some medicine for my mom anyway.

846
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,710
I'll hitch a ride with you guys.

847
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,090
Great, I'll drive you there.

848
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,920
Chen.

849
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,050
I'll go.
