00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,100
She stopped working here long ago.

190
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,690
She came here three years ago.

191
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,970
She only worked here for two months.

192
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,400
Where does she work now?

193
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,310
How would I know that?

194
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,910
It's a big world.

195
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,510
Maybe she went to Southeast Asia with some man.

196
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,390
Gentlemen,

197
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,860
why do you insist on having her accompany you?

198
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,230
There are many beautiful girls here.

199
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,950
The price is negotiable.

200
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,870
Be serious.

201
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,780
Money is not a problem.

202
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,200
Since we're here today,

203
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,750
ask all the beautiful girls here to come out

204
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,950

Okay.

206
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,150
Wait a minute.

207
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,710
What do you mean?

208
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,290
We can't come here for nothing.

Don't be so nervous.

210
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,530

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,990
What's wrong?

218
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,000
The cable is stuck here.

219

Something's not right.

220
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,370
The cable is too clean.

221
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,100
If this transmitter-receiver has been used for a long time,

222
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,410
this cable should be covered with dust.

223
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,110
You mean this transmitter-receiver

224
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,280
was given to Wang Liqun recently?

225
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,290
Transmitter-receivers are usually high-power.

226
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,810
Wang Liqun has made many movements recently.

227
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,360
If he used it frequently,

228
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,370
it should be reflected through the electricity meter.

229
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,780
The electricity meters were just read after the Liberation.

230
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,060
We paid the bills once.

231
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,410
This is the bill left by the Administration of Power Supply last time.

232
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,370
He used 17 or 18 kWh of electricity per month.

234
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,390
Check

235
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,250
how much electricity he used after the Liberation.

236
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,170
After the Liberation, he used...

237
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,280
one point...

238
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,790

That's right, Director. Less than 2 kWh.

If that's the case,

242
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,860
there's only one possibility.

243
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,420
The transmitter-receiver was specially left here.

244
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,370
It's for misleading us again.

245
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,270
He's so cunning.

246
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,650
Now it's useless to investigate in Putuo again.

247
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,910
Obviously, Wang Liqun has found out

248
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,310
we've been investigating in Putuo.

249
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,710
He won't come back again.

250
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,250
What should we do, Director?

251
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,760
Since he lived here,

252
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,670
traces must have been left.

253
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,690
Next, we should

visit the surrounding areas

He didn't talk to me every time he came.

He always went in directly to see Mr. Zhao.

280
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,170
I guess he told Mr. Zhao his things.

281

00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,860
The Criminal Police Division

751
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,430
is doing its best to protect an agent.

752
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,360
I can't believe it.

753
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,890
He's not an ordinary agent.

754
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,640
If we can make him confess,

755
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,330
we can gain information on someone more powerful behind him.

756
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,220
So,

757
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
besides security measures,

758
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,500
we need to think about

759
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,530
how to interrogate him.

760
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,450
It's not that easy to make an agent like Wang Liqun

761
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,530
confess.

762
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,620
And Lin Shaobai,

763
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,630
in future operations,

764
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,430
you must never behave

765
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,760
as you did during last time's investigation.

766
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,340
Don't worry, Director Lu. I won't.

767
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,430
Shaobai,

768
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,820
are you afraid of Lu?

769
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,220
He's not a tiger.

770
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,650
He won't eat you.

771
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,310
I'm afraid of him?

772
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,020
I saved him twice.

773
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,930
Right, Director Lu?

774
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,390
No one is as smart as you.

775
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,140
The door of the Criminal Police Division

776
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,870
will always remain open to you.

777
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,090
You're poaching him in front of me again.

778
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,850
Zhang, that is immoral.

779
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,760
I haven't succeeded yet.

780
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,850
Dad.

781
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,620
You're going to work so early?

782
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,590
I'm not going to the bureau today.

783
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,050
I'm going to the hospital.

784
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,080
Dad.

785
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,900
This is...

786
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,500
You came at the right time. Help me bundle them up.

787
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,090
Your Uncle Liu is going to be buried today.

788
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,320
He worked in the yarn factory for decades.

789
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,520
Today is his funeral.

790
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,300
I'm his old friend. I should go say goodbye.

791
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,590
The flowers are for him.

792
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,980
Don't be too sad.

793
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,320
The person who killed him has been caught.

794
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,850
Uncle Liu can rest in peace.

795
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,130
The murderer has been caught?

796
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,830
I knew it. People who do bad things

797
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,670
will be caught sooner or later.

798
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,970
Yan, let me ask you.

799
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,960
Who killed him?

800
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,250
Why did he have to

801
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,560
kill your Uncle Liu?

802
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,150
The murderer is still unconscious.

803
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,480
Director Lu hasn't interrogated him yet.

804
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,480
Dad, I should get going.

805
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,260
Okay.

806
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,030
In spring, bamboo shoots sprout.

807
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,150
In spring, bamboo shoots sprout.

808
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,080
We pick bamboo shoots to make soup.

809
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,380
Jiang,

810
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,990
what are you cooking?

811
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,490
Braised tofu with vegetables.

812
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,600
This dish is good.

813
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,590
It has a refreshing taste.

814
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,230
I like it very much.

815
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,270
I like it very much.

816
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,990
Father told me...

817
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,930
Father told me

818
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,030
garden vegetables...

819
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,710
Dabao, Xiaobao,

820
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,860
read the textbook a few more times.

821
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,670
The meal is ready.

822
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,050
Okay.

823
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,790
Okay.

824
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,340
Brother.

825
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,530
The coat is ready.

826
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,090
[Guangci Hospital]

827
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,840
[Guangci Hospital]

828
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,830
It's too new. Make it older.

829
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,990
Okay, Brother.

830
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,930
Give it to me.

831
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,540
Dabao, Xiaobao, come in to eat.

832
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,080
Time to eat.

833
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,640
Okay.

834
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,560
Tell Xiaoman and Lin Shaobai

835
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,940
to get ready to interrogate him.

836
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,620
Yes.

837
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,080
Do you know this person?

838
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,690
I asked you to look at the photo!

839
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,030
Have you seen him?

840
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,440
Wang Liqun,

841
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,110
don't think we can't convict you

842
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,040
because you're playing dumb here.

843
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,310
We have evidence against you

844
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,630
in the vault's case, the case of Mr. Liu from the yarn factory,

845
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,830
the dancing girl's case, and the case from four years ago.

846
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,720
You didn't expect this either, right?

847
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,340
You committed so many crimes,

848
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,340
but you got caught because of a dancing girl in the end.

849
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,090
Did you think you were awesome

850
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,280
and no one could catch you?

851
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,090
But in fact,

852
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,740
you were just lucky.

853
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,180
You're just a greedy and lecherous loser.

854
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,350
Understand?

855
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,160
Young man,

856
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,230
provocation doesn't work on me.

857
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,380
Lu Zhengyang, is this your team?

858
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,740
It's not good.

859
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,420
We are in the same field.

860
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,540
I know about

861
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,980
interrogations.

862
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,830
Four years ago,

863
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,530
I killed your comrade with a butterfly knife.

864
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,260
I killed him with just one stab.

865
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,860
You're quite an odd person.

866
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,160
You don't hate me.

867
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,830
It's been four years.

868
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,680
Even hatred hasn't made you improve.

869
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,980
Idiotic.
