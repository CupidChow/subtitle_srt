aside from exposing

big agents like Shrike,

353
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,430
we must also promote our policies:

354
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,940

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,080
One more.

386
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,200
Enough, it's too spicy for me.

387
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,470
I've made an appointment for you.

388
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,660
You have to go.

389
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,620
I never promised you to go.

390
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,300
You decided this on your own.

391
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,350
Let go.

392
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,650
Go get changed. You really have to go.

393
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,290
Can you listen to me for once?

394
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,780
Who is the director meeting?

395
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,450
A lady journalist.

396
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,250
Director, are you going on a blind date?

397
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,840
That's ridiculous.

398
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,850
It's a reporter from Big News.

399
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,360
Xiaoman,

400
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,920
come

401
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,960
help me convince him.

402
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,630
This is an exclusive interview.

403
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,200
As soon as Lu's article is published,

404
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,030
he can clear his name immediately.

405
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,910
Yeah, Director,

406
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,030
it's a good thing. Why won't you go?

407
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,430
Listen,

408
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,300
once the article is out,

409
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,860
the agents will recognize me.

410
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,040
How am I supposed to work on cases?

411
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,890
Of course they'll recognize you.

412
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,460
Your photos are everywhere.

413
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,520
If you need to question citizens

414
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,240
during investigations,

415
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,230
people will see you

416
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,390
and avoid you.

417
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,430
How will you handle cases then?

418
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,830
Besides, this

419
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,170
isn't just about you.

420
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,470
It's about the reputation

421
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,230
of our entire police force.

422
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,320
Let me think about it.

423
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
Don't.

424
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,310
She's already here.

425
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,710
I... I don't know what to say.

426
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,390
Director, I have an idea.

427
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,440
Shaobai, can I borrow your hat?

428
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,270
You should go to the interview,

429
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,570
but the photo in the paper should be this.

430
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,670
This

431
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,680
could be Director Lu who saved the entrepreneurs,

432
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,060
or Xiang who risked his life to protect Tong Susu,

433
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,420
or Dr. Jin Yan and Mr. Liu Rui,

434
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,589
who faced anthrax fearlessly,

435
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,630
or our liaison Lin

436
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,290
from the Police Pigeon Squad.

437
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,160
It could represent all the police officers

438
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,760
who build an impenetrable defense for Shanghai.

439
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,310
As long as its stories are told,

440
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,230
whenever people see this hat,

441
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,650
they'll know who we are

442
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,359
and who we serve.

443
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,359
It could also be Xiaoman,

444
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,819
who infiltrated the gangs

445
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,620
to capture their leader, right?

446
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,980
Good.

447
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,680
Let's use his own way against him

448
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,310
and fight a public opinion battle with Shrike.

449
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,510
Based on our reporter's

450
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,820
interview with local police,

451
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,510
the recent kidnappings targeting private entrepreneurs

452
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,040
were meticulously planned

453
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,030
by the agent group, aiming to disrupt

454
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,310
Shanghai's improving economic situation

455
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,700
[People's Enemy: Shrike, Unmerciful and Unjust]

456
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,150
economic growth and tarnish

457
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,200
the image of law enforcement.

458
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,990
The head of this agent group, codenamed Shrike,

459
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,040
has been sabotaging

460
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,750
the new government's

461
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,460
efforts to rebuild Shanghai

462
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,840
since the Liberation.

463
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,830
He's even gone so far as to

464
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,220
ruthlessly eliminate

465
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,820
his own subordinates.

466
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,450
Agents hiding in Shanghai,

467
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,810
it's time to see Shrike's true colors.

468
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,450
Look,

469
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,000
the broadcast is talking about Shrike.

470
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,080
He's a major agent.

471
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,420
He should be arrested now.

472
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,470
No one can accept

473
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,910
a madman like this as their leader.

474
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,000
The new government's

475
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,520
policy toward those who

476
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,350
surrender and repent is lenient.

477
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,310
No one is born a reactionary.

478
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,220
Our Party's goal in united front work

479
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,130
is to turn enemies into friends

480
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,710
and friends into allies.

481
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,950
Under this principle,

482
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,730
except for those with heinous crimes

483
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,770
and die-hard reactionaries,

484
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,450
anyone willing to repent and surrender

485
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,730
will be forgiven by the people,

486
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,980
and will be given a chance

487
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,910
to start over in the new society.

488
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,900
Sir,

489
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,980
all the newspapers you want are here.

490
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,330
It's okay if you don't read it.

491
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,260
It's just Communist propaganda.

492
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,310
[Punish the ringleaders, show leniency to those coerced, and reward those who contribute.]

493
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,310
[The new government's policy: Combination of suppression and leniency]

494
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,550
Playing mind games.

495
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,570
They want us to lose our composure.

496
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,940
The most infuriating part is saying you

497
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,980
betrayed your friends for personal gain.

498
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,740
It's their usual trick.

499
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,650
Don't mind it.

500
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,230
Are you really okay?

501
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,920
Do you want me to be okay or not?

502
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,790
I sure hope you're okay.

503
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,800
Public opinion can be guided.

504
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,830
It's fine.

505
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,720
These newspapers make for

506
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,790
decent reading

507
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,050
material during free time.

508
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,310
This tactic is likely

509
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,390
the work of this young man.

510
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,470
Recently, prices

511
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,630
have been rising,

512
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,300
but the government is concerned

513
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,920
and has arranged to distribute

514
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,950
supplies to everyone.

515
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,210
Thank you, Principal.

516
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,360
Ms. Huang,

517
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,990
that egg portion is for Mr. Zheng.

518
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,550
Mr. Zheng runs an art studio.

519
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,470
Good business.

520
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,150
They surely don't lack eggs.

521
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,040
Ms. Huang,

522
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,100
the studio belongs to my wife.

523
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,510
I just help out.

524
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,750
Sure,

525
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,110
but you even

526
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,330
skip classes to help.

527
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,690
That's nonsense.

528
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,480
I've never missed a class,

529
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,760
and the studio has even printed

530
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,350
the school paper for us many times for free.

531
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,190
Right, Principal?

532
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,720
Yes, yes.

533
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,790
Good.

534
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,210
Since the papers are all about catching agents,

535
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,700
let's have Mr. Zheng

536
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,650
educate our students

537
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,100
and staff about

538
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,310
the evil agents like Shrike,

539
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,020
and encourage everyone

540
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,490
to report them.

541
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,590
The government even gives rewards for reporting.

542
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,230
Zheng, what do you think?

543
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,930
I'll do as the principal says.

544
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,040
Okay.

545
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,240
Wait.

546
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,280
Put my eggs here.

547
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,930
I have a class to attend.

548
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,940
I'll take up the afternoon class.

549
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,390
I'll be teaching composition.

550
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,150
Stop!

551
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,620
Put the eggs down!

552
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,570
And let me be clear,

553
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,070
don't you take over any of my classes again!

554
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,020
Why are you mad?

555
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,030
Put it down.

556
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,510
Go.

557
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,660
You...

558
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,230
Principal,

559
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,000
it's been years,

560
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,570
and this isn't the first time.

561
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,070
Yes, yes.

562
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,260
She's always picking on you.

563
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,850
We've all seen it.

564
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,630
True.

565
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,340
Everyone's human. We all have tempers.

566
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,870
What?

567
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,620
What's going on?

568
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,630
First time seeing him lose his temper.

569
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,690
Losing his temper.

570
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,220
Mr. Jin,

571
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,870
he's here.

572
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,710
Don't worry,

573
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,400
no one noticed me coming to see you.

574
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,710
If you hadn't come to me, I would've come to you.

575
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,710
I only found out you were back

576
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,040
after seeing the paper.

577
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,660
Where's my brother?

578
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,720
Kui,

579
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,820
prepare yourself for what I'm about to say.

580
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,150
Your brother

581
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,140
was killed by the agents.

582
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Who did it?

583
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,980
Who did it?

584
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,750
Who else could it be?

585
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,260
After I was kidnapped,

586
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,940
your brother tried to take action against them.

587
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,290
But the operation failed,

588
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,830
and he was caught by Zheng.

589
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,480
They buried him alive

590
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,620
right in front of me.

591
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,150
Your brother was a real man.

592
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,730
He never gave me up, even at the end.

593
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,110
That's the rule.

594
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,880
Zheng will pay for

595
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,810
my brother's life.

596
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,050
Kui,

597
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,510
don't do anything reckless.

598
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,110
If you rush for revenge,

599
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,270
what about your brother's two kids?

600
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,750
I've already sent the kids to a safe place.

601
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,750
They're settled.

602
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,080
I've got

603
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,010
nothing left to lose.

604
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,470
Let me tell you,

605
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,280
if your brother couldn't handle him,

606
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,380
wouldn't you be throwing your life away?

607
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,510
It was my brother who was buried alive!

608
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,660
Even if it's suicide,

609
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,850
I have to try.

610
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,540
Kui, you're being impulsive.

611
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,660
Have you thought about the consequences?

612
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,270
If you make one mistake,

613
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,090
and they find the kids,

614
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,850
how will you face your brother?

615
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,900
This money was originally for your brother.

616
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,760
Now you take it on his behalf.

617
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,620
It's for the two kids.

618
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,890
Your brother died for me.

619
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,240
I also really like

620
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,540
these two kids.

621
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,050
From now on,

622
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,510
I'll cover all expenses for the kids.

623
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,280
As for you, Kui,

624
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,830
I've already thought it through.

625
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,360
I'll get you a new identity.

626
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,460
You'll work in my factory.

627
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,420
I'll call on you when I need you.

628
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,990
What do you think?

629
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,630
Mr. Jin,

630
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,370
thank you on behalf of my brother.

631
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,500
Kui.

632
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,620
Kui.

633
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,910
I've already submitted

634
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,340
the case report.

635
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,590
Along with it,

636
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,350
I sent the request for your transfer back to the Social Affairs Office.

637
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,410
Once it's approved,

638
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,070
you can officially come back.

639
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,780
Everyone's waiting for your return.

640
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,490
Did I say I'm coming back?

641
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,450
Didn't you tell Captain Zhang

642
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,540
that you, Lin Shaobai, is going nowhere

643
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,270
but the Social Affairs Office?

644
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,490
Hold on.

645
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,330
You didn't hear the second part

646
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,900
of my sentence.

647
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,220
I said if you want me back,

648
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,330
I should at least

649
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,280
be promoted to deputy director,

650
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,120
and you have to get a grand sedan

651
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,150
to carry me

652
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,890
and welcome me back.

653
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,570
And we'll pull out a banner

654
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,920
and fire off two strings of firecrackers.

655
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,100
Now you're talking, Lu.

656
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,540
Stop showing off.

657
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,230
You think you're

658
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,630
a new bride or something?

659
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,280
What are you all laughing at?

660
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,000
When I left the Social Affairs Office

661
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,830
I was exiled.

662
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,030
If I return

663
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,750
all quietly and shamefully,

664
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,400
where's my dignity?

665
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,310
Director asked you to come back.

666
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,390
Just stop acting tough.

667
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,230
That's my condition.

668
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,330
If you want me back,

669
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,140
I'd miss my pigeons too much.

670
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,770
I raise pigeons there.

671
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,010
When I'm free,

672
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,070
I can sunbathe and read books,

673
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,500
sit on my sun deck and enjoy the breeze.

674
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,350
That's a much better life than working at the Social Affairs Office.

675
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,000
You do have a point there.

676
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:58,820
Right?

677
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,480
That's my condition.

678
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,030
Think it over.

679
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,280
Alright.

680
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,820
Anyway, the Social Affairs Office

681
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,220
won't be much different

682
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,310
with you there

683
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,300
or without you.

684
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,070
If you don't want to come back,

685
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,180
there are plenty

686
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,150
who do.

687
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,300
Yes.

688
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,740
I'll ask you one more time.

689
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,470
Are you really not coming back?

690
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,950
I'll answer one more time.

691
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm really not coming back.

692
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,540
Fine.

693
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,880
Don't regret it later.

694
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,640
You're leaving?

695
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,990
Weren't you going to take me to the station, Lu?

696
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,390
Are you drunk?

697
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,750
Are you out of your mind?

698
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,890
Are you out of your mind?

699
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,040
Get some rest early.

700
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,070
Shaobai,

701
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,270
it's alright.

702
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,590
If you want to come back in the future

703
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,750
and you're too embarrassed, tell me,

704
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,960
and I'll talk to the director.

705
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,340
You don't need to thank me.

706
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,310
Just bring me a catty of sorghum candies.

707
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,510
I'm off. Bye.

708
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Be serious.

709
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,920
Take me to the station.

710
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,020
Let's go.

711
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,030
You just can't talk nicely.

712
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,190
Your stomach isn't good.

713
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,040
Drink more millet porridge.

714
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,970
Currently, six people on the awakened

715
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,150
personnel list have gone missing.

716
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,460
Whether they turn themselves in to the police,

717
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,870
we're still waiting for confirmation from Nyctibius.

718
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,530
Do we even need confirmation?

719
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,870
They've defected.

720
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,590
Fine,

721
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,830
I'll notify Falcon

722
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,690
to handle them.

723
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,770
If we don't kill a few, we won't be able to intimidate them.

724
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,070
Those who are hesitating,

725
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,910
watching and waiting,

726
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,840
or those who haven't done much

727
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,370
might follow suit and turn themselves in too.

728
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,700
Whoever needs to leave

729
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,730
should go.

730
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,750
This is a chance to

731
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,820
test our team.

732
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,380
Sir,

733
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,640
if they all surrender,

734
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,430
our strength will be weakened.

735
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,730
Keeping them is worse.

736
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,470
These people

737
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,730
have no faith.

738
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,750
All they care about

739
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,070
is the funds I have.

740
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,630
We'll cleanse them out,

741
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,850
and lull Lu Zhengyang,

742
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,190
creating an opportunity

743
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,390
for our next move.

744
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,100
You have a new plan?

745
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,470
Victory is the best adhesive.

746
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,050
We desperately need

747
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,620
a solid victory

748
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,860
that will shock the world.

749
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,660
My Lord, there's a visitor.

750
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,910
An honored guest has arrived.

751
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,320
Prepare some food

752
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,570
Yes, My Lord.

753
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,380
Please have a seat.

754
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,950
I came uninvited. I hope it's not inconvenient.

755
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,190
No, no, not at all.

756
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,590
What a mansion.

757
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,540
[Wanted Poster]

758
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,830
Mr. Jin, you've been studying Communist

759
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,110
policies these days?

760
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,680
Doing business,

761
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,960
it's important to study policies well.

762
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,530
The Communists always like to play mind games,

763
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,730
I know that.

764
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,130
I heard many people have surrendered recently.

765
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,590
Those are just outsiders,

766
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,440
not from my circle.

767
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,840
Lu's caught quite a few,

768
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,300
but it doesn't affect us.

769
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm actually a bit worried.

770
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,060
His way of catching

771
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,950
might lull their police.

772
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,920
In that case,

773
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,580
I have nothing to worry about.

774
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,750
You know the Communists are holding their

775
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,560
founding ceremony next month on the first, right?

776
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,020
I've received the notice.

777
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,660
Aren't you planning on

778
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,190
offering some kind of gift?

779
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,340
The Labor, Military, and Commerce Association discussed with the government,

780
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,800
thinking of making some sculptures

781
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,330
or monuments to celebrate,

782
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,100
but they declined.

783
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,680
The government wants us to rest and recuperate,

784
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,540
focusing on restoring production first.

785
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,500
They're being polite, but you should take it seriously.

786
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,370
For such a grand event,

787
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,250
you have to present a gift.

788
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,270
I've thought it through for you.

789
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,310
Go buy a batch of

790
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
high-purity white phosphorus.

791
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,410
Shrike,

792
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,470
what do you need it for?

793
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,030
Recently, the whole country

794
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,160
has been supporting Shanghai, right?

795
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,340
How much aid is being

796
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,530
transported in and out every day?

797
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,680
Hundreds of tons.

798
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,550
More than that.

799
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,110
All stored in that

800
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,770
warehouse street.

801
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,620
You have four warehouses

802
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,110
on that street, right?

803
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,160
In the central location.

804
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,690
The central location, huh.

805
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,060
Well, I have a plan now.

806
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,370
To turn this white phosphorus

807
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,310
into gasoline bombs

808
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,680
adn let them explode

809
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,270
in your central location.

810
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,550
Can you imagine the scene?

811
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,330
It would surely be a sea of fire.

812
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,230
How about it? Is this gift big enough?

813
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,390
Shrike,

814
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,330
this matter is too big.

815
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,590
Not to mention if it fails,

816
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,610
even if it succeeds,

817
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,910
it will surely alert the top levels of the Communists.

818
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,880
They will spare no effort to investigate.

819
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,150
That would be pushing us to

820
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,740
a... dead end.

821
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,390
Shrike, please reconsider.

822
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,230
Reconsider what?

823
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,960
Are you still holding onto illusions?

824
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,370
Do you think the Communists will spare us?

825
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,200
You're wrong. Wake up.

826
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,590
You only have one path now—

827
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,660
support the Kuomintang,

828
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,520
and prepare for a counterattack.

829
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,100
When Shanghai is taken back,

830
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,100
I can promise you,

831
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,670
the president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce

832
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,990
will be you.

833
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,600
How about that?

834
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,910
But...

835
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,150
those are my own warehouses.

836
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,020
If they catch fire and explode,

837
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,380
I'd be bringing disaster upon myself.

838
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,610
This makes things even simpler.

839
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,560
Donate all four warehouses to the government.

840
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,590
Then whatever happens won't be your responsibility.

841
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,110
Shrike,

842
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,100
I'll think about it.

843
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,520
Getting white phosphorus is too difficult.

844
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,120
Really, it's too hard.

845
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,880
I just remembered,

846
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,790
Wang Qinghua has a fertilizer factory,

847
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,300
he must have white phosphorus.

848
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,530
He lost a fortune in the silver dollar

849
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,110
speculation recently,

850
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,270
and he hates the new government.

851
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,400
Go talk to him.

852
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,790
He'll definitely help you.

853
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,330
No.

854
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,909
Someone like him

855
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,310
has been under the Communist watch.

856
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,239
You're our only option now.

857
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,060
You're clean,

858
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,230
a progressive entrepreneur.

859
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,530
Get us 300 catties of white phosphorus,

860
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,679
alright?

861
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,100
300 catties?

862
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,219
That's too difficult.

863
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,409
Right now, rice, flour,

864
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:38,510
even coal prices are sky-high.

865
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,980
I really can't do it.

866
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,070
Aren't you a major shareholder in Changhua Match Factory?

867
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,540
Yes.

868
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,650
So if the factory imports some white phosphorus,

869
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,909
would that be strange?

870
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,300
It's perfectly legitimate.

871
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,000
And as far as I know,

872
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,210
the factory already has over 100 catties.

873
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,210
Isn't that right?

874
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,000
Nothing gets past you, does it?

875
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,520
How much money do you have in your accounts?

876
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,660
We

877
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,350
know better than you do.

878
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,340
This fire attack

879
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,890
must succeed.

880
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,130
If anyone makes a mistake

881
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,330
at any point,

882
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,070
it will be unforgivable.

883
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,600
Let me repeat—

884
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,830
this is not a deal.

885
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,490
This is an order.

886
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,430
I'll come in a couple of days

887
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,640
to announce the specific plan.

888
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,590
Shrike,

889
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,230
you're ruthless.

890
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,380
[On an Island in Zhoushan]

891
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,550
This failure

892
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,700
has let down the President's expectations.

893
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,030
I take responsibility.

894
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,490
Lanting,

895
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,100
you're being too harsh on yourself.

896
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,320
Victory is victory, no matter the scale.

897
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,920
Whether it's three ships of grain

898
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,680
and cotton or 300 ships,

899
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,980
it doesn't matter.

900
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,100
We've achieved our propaganda goal.

901
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,600
Now, Taiwan has made you out to be a hero,

902
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,180
fighting alone behind enemy lines.

903
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,290
I don't deserve it.

904
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,960
I really don't.

905
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,700
A hero is a hero,

906
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,720
and heroes should be rewarded.

907
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,170
The higher-ups at NBIS have decided to

908
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,230
bring you back to the rear,

909
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,000
to serve as

910
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,750
deputy director of the office.

911
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,630
It's also likely the President himself

912
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,590
will give you a personal commendation,

913
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,670
to boost morale.

914
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,940
I appreciate the kindness from you and the higher-ups.

915
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,030
But

916
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,350
to be honest,

917
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,480
returning now,

918
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,570
I'd feel unsatisfied.

919
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,470
Could you give me another chance,

920
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,000
so I can achieve something

921
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,120
truly worthy of recognition?

922
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,060
Lanting, look,

923
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,500
at your age,

924
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,710
you're no longer suited for the frontlines.

925
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,510
This is for your own good.

926
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,890
Indeed,

927
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,440
precisely because of my age,

928
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,340
there are things I must do,

929
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,540
or it will be too late.

930
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,140
The Sea Subversion Plan

931
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,380
has only hit a few setbacks.

932
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,870
As the saying goes,

933
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,870
good things take time.

934
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,580
But this is the decision from the higher-ups.

935
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,950
What if they force you to go back?

936
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,900
Of course.

937
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,110
If...

938
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:44,820
Director,

939
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,480
a few ships have arrived.

940
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,340
It seems they might be against us.

941
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,160
I didn't get a chance to report to you.

942
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,570
They're all our people.

943
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,160
They know you're here,

944
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,240
so they came to collectively request to join the fight.

945
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,390
No need for that.

946
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,380
Lanting, I have no doubt about

947
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,720
your personal loyalty.

948
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,390
But you need to keep

949
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,570
a tighter rein on your men.

950
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,440
I've heard some have

951
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,900
already surrendered to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

952
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,390
In my view, it might not be a bad thing.

953
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,180
It purifies our team.

954
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,710
Purity is fine,

955
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,680
but what we need now is a victory

956
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,400
to boost morale.

957
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,170
I've already got a plan.

958
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,430
Go on.

959
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,750
The battle over rice and cotton isn't over.

960
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,750
Victory hasn't been decided yet.

961
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,520
The Communists are shipping supplies

962
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,350
from all over the country to stabilize prices,

963
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,900
stockpiling them in warehouses.

964
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,590
That's our chance.

965
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,220
So, you're planning to target those supplies?

966
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,170
Aren't they going to hold

967
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,000
the founding ceremony in Beijing on October 1st?

968
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,710
While they're setting off fireworks in Beijing,

969
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,410
I'll light a few fires in Shanghai

970
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,050
to complement them.

971
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,150
What do you think?

972
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,260
Brilliant!

973
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,940
Lanting, your fires will be the real show.

974
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,700
Brilliant!

975
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,610
Guiheng.

976
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,080
Yes.

977
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,290
All your men are

978
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,550
at Lanting's disposal.

979
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,990
Yes.

980
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,370
No holding back.

981
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,010
Shrike,

982
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,470
please feel free.

983
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,080
My men are yours to command.

984
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,480
Then I'll get to work right away.

985
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,420
Okay.

986
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,250
Be careful.

987
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,710
Keep a close

988
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,290
eye on him.

989
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,090
Understood.

990
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,270
Chief, how did the talk go?

991
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,590
Same old promises of positions and rewards.

992
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,880
The NBIS is in a fierce internal power struggle.

993
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,780
They're looking for a scapegoat.

994
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,210
The day I land on the island will be the day I die.

995
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,670
I didn't handle this well.

996
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,100
Fortunately, you...

997
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,970
How's the preparation for the incendiary bombs?

998
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,950
We've mastered the blueprints,

999
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,210
ready to go at any time.

1000
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,190
Good.

1001
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,060
We've all been through death together,

1002
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,260
so I'll speak frankly.

1003
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,910
Without the Communists,

1004
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,420
the currency in Shanghai

1005
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,550
would still be the gold yuan note.

1006
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,950
All our businesses would have gone bankrupt long ago.

1007
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,260
Without the rescue by the Public Security Bureau,

1008
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,430
we'd all be buried by now.

1009
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,190
The government is struggling now,

1010
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,940
shouldn't we lend a hand?

1011
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,870
Jin spoke with me before I came.

1012
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,220
To stabilize prices in Shanghai,

1013
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,640
the central government is gathering rice, flour,

1014
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,000
coal, oil, and cloth

1015
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,090
from all over the country,

1016
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,160
constantly shipping them to Shanghai.

1017
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,160
The warehouses storing these supplies are running out of space.

1018
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,860
They hope we can free up some of our own warehouses

1019
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,940
to temporarily

1020
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,380
donate to the government.

1021
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,900
I've heard

1022
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,640
big speculators opposing the government predict

1023
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,120
that the Communists score 100 in military,

1024
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,710
80 in politics,

1025
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,950
and zero in economics.

1026
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,330
But have you ever heard of

1027
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,680
a liberated area

1028
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,000
where people go hungry,

1029
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,310
or can't get cotton to wear?

1030
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,980
Only when Shanghai's economy is truly stable

1031
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,610
can we all safely make money.

1032
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,010
Right.

1033
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,630
Let me take the lead.

1034
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,750
I will donate four warehouses.

1035
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,590
I'll donate three.

1036
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,340
I'll...

1037
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,130
donate two.

1038
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,830
I'll donate two as well.

1039
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,440
Five.

1040
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,800
I'll donate all.

1041
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,700
Donate all?

1042
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,280
Since you're so sincere,

1043
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,020
I'll take the lead

1044
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,400
and report to the Military Control Commission

1045
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,090
to show our attitude.

1046
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,940
[Office 2 of Social Affairs Office]

1047
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,390
Everyone,

1048
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,900
Deputy Commissioner Yang has an important announcement.

1049
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,240
Comrades,

1050
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,100
due to the heavy workload

1051
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,980
in Office 2 recently,

1052
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,090
with many agents to interrogate,

1053
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,650
and a large amount of data to investigate, organize, and archive,

1054
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,310
Zhengyang has requested more staff.

1055
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,410
After consideration,

1056
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,050
I've decided to add two more people to Office 2.

1057
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,230
One of them is Chen.

1058
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,180
I believe you all know him well.
