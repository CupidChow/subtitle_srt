(This program is intended for mature audiences.
It may feature explicit content, violence, and strong language.)

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,824
- CRIS: I'm excited.
- JANEYEH: Yeah.

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,672
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG.

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,600
NAMNUNG: Why did you choose me?

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey, hey.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
TIMETHAI: Here we go.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,304
SUNNY: To be honest, I've been curious
from the start that you're into me.

8
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:54,400
SUNNY: The cameras can't follow
into the bathroom.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,248
SUNNY: You have moments where you
come to kiss me, like that.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,784
TIMETHAI: Ouch!

11
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,720
SUNNY: Can't you tell I like you?

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,200
JANEYEH: Giddy, sis.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,920
- CRIS: Giddy, I don't know what to do.
- JANEYEH: I'm blushing!

14
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:05,376
SUNNY: I'm not flirting
with anyone else,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,912
SUNNY: except for mixed ones.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,920
- CRIS: Come on.
- RUSAMEEKAE: You're making moves, baby.

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,840
RUSAMEEKAE: I've never seen SUNNY
go for someone.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,600
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm so giddy right now.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,880
SUNNY: I like people with beautiful eyes.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,352
JANEYEH: Wow.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,920
NAMNUNG: I like people
with beautiful smiles.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,720
JANEYEH: Ouch, just looking like that,
just complimenting like that.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,976
TIMETHAI: Oh wow.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
(Next,)

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,440
(we'll start the final couple date
battle before the confession.)

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,800
(Start the competition)
RUSAMEEKAE: Game for the privilege first.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,320
(The person who gets the limited-date
invitation card is...)

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,624
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see again
who will get it.

29
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:39,584
JANEYEH: Ah, random.

30
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,264
(TOD and NAMNUNG)

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,392
CRIS: These two again,
they're really lucky.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,040
NAMNUNG: Hesitating.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Who is NAMNUNG
inviting over?

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

35
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:58,541
FRAME: Oh.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
- FRAME: Hello.
- SUNNY: So pretty.

37
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:01,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,048
JANEYEH: TIME.

39
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:02,840
CRIS: SUNNY.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
(Who will NAMNUNG take?)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my god.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,560
CRIS: Hello, welcome everyone
to a brand new love reality show

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,216
CRIS: from Thailand,

43
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,792
- CRIS: Borderless Love, LOVE(X).
- ALL: Borderless Love, LOVE(X).

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,320
CRIS: But wait, before we watch today,
I must tell you

45
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,824
CRIS: Last time we had a Sherlock Holmes
theme, but couldn't solve it at all.

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,840
JANEYEH: Couldn't solve it.

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,640
- CRIS: Couldn't solve it at all.
- JANEYEH: Let's change it.

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,080
(CRIS, LOVE(X)PERT)
CRIS: Today's theme is Chinese attire.

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,720
(Chinese Attire Theme)
RUSAMEEKAE: Wearing Chinese attires.

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,120
CRIS: You've practiced Chinese, right?

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,016
RUSAMEEKAE: Practiced already.

52
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:34,600
CRIS: Yeah.

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,864
(RUSAMEEKAE, LOVE(X)PERT)
RUSAMEEKAE: Hi everyone, I'm RUSAMEEKAE.

54
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,240
- JANEYEH: Oh.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,816
JANEYEH: It's awesome.

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,520
(TIMETHAI, LOVE(X)PERT)

57
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,880
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY grabbed the paper
and walked away.

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Suddenly, who has the most
shell coins left gets

59
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,536
(JANEYEH, LOVE(X)PERT)
RUSAMEEKAE: the final date at X-Land.

60
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,376
CRIS: It turns out to be SUNNY,
and ends the episode by saying,

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,000
CRIS: "who will go with TIME or NAMNUNG?"
Oh, I'm so excited.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,720
JANEYEH: Excited.

63
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, it's exciting.
Shall we go see who SUNNY will pick?

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,336
CRIS: Sure.

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,880
MATHEUS: So, you think tonight
you're gonna go to X-Land again?

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,160
NAMNUNG: I feel like this time
SUNNY will pick TIME,

67
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:27,000
NAMNUNG: because I think the chance
for SUNNY to pick me isn't that high.

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,216
MATHEUS: It's gonna be so hard.

69
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:30,800
CRIS: MATHEUS.

70
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,720
JANEYEH: Don't.

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,760
KONG: But imagine if SUNNY picks you

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
KONG: and NAMNUNG too...

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,440
FRAME: Oh.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,664
TIMETHAI: A stirrer.

75
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:47,880
(Silence)
CRIS: Such a stirrer!

76
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,472
CRIS: You're such a stirrer!

77
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:03,436
(Looks towards...)

78
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,600
JANEYEH: Oh wow,
they're all standing here.

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,240
RUSAMEEKAE: And standing
on opposite sides.

80
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:10,720
CRIS: By coincidence.

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Hmm.

82
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:13,480
CRIS: Isn't it so stressful?

83
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,432
RUSAMEEKAE: I wish they'd stand
closer together.

84
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,224
RUSAMEEKAE: And then walk over and ask.

85
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:27,480
TIME: She's here.

86
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:29,472
- KONG: Oh my god.
- FRAME: She's here.

87
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:30,120
FRAME: Oh.

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
ASSE: She's here.

89
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,960
CRIS: Oops, and SUNNY is behind.

91
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,344
JANEYEH: Hey.

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
JANEYEH: SUNNY must be stressed
not knowing who to pick.

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
FRAME: She's here.

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
TOD: Wow.

95
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,720
CRIS: Right now for SUNNY, there's TIME
and NAMNUNG in her heart, right?

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,416
(Avoids eye contact)
JANEYEH: Avoids eye contact.

97
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,088
JANEYEH: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

98
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,512
(Turns around)

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
CRIS: Oh my god.

100
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,680
KONG: Oh my god.

101
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:14,336
TOD: Wow.

102
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:14,816
(Looks)
JANEYEH: TOD, wow.

103
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,480
JANEYEH: Oh my god.

104
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,720
CRIS: I'm excited.

105
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,814
NAMNUNG: Careful.

106
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:26,303
SUNNY: Hi.

107
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh, MATHEUS?

108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,104
JUNSU: NAMNUNG or MATHEUS?

109
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,560
CRIS: Everyone is so confused.

110
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:36,896
SUNNY: Hi.

111
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:38,400
MATHEUS: Hi.

112
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,988
SUNNY: Can I?

113
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:40,423
SUNNY: Can I?

114
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:43,520
SUNNY: Can I?

115
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:46,891

it's good, it's good.

MATHEUS: Happy for you guys.

123
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:21,080
NAMNUNG: I really didn't expect SUNNY
to pick me. I'm very surprised.

124
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,416
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

125

JOY: Just now.

129
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,680
TOD: Really?

130
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240

I wanted it to be JOY.

134

RUSAMEEKAE: This is the MVP.

142
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,600
JANEYEH: Absolutely fabulous.

143
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,240
RUSAMEEKAE: I cheer
for NAMNUNG and SUNNY.

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,864
RUSAMEEKAE: Because this is SUNNY.

145
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:37,520
(Support)
CRIS: Me too.

146
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,680
TIMETHAI: I'm with NAMNUNG and SUNNY.

147

JANEYEH: Honestly,
I'm secretly cheering.

148
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,560
CRIS: Yeah.

149
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,784
RUSAMEEKAE: We have to call MARIO
and tell him that.

150
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,920
- TIMETHAI: MARIO, wait a moment, bro.
- RUSAMEEKAE: MARIO.

151
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,016
TIMETHAI: If anything comes up,
I'll let you know, bro.

152
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,656
RUSAMEEKAE: In the end, SUNNY

153
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:52,288
RUSAMEEKAE: actually chose NAMNUNG.

154
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:56,192
RUSAMEEKAE: It might be due to
the chemistry happening in X-Land

155
00:07:56,288 --> 00:08:00,200
RUSAMEEKAE: last time, so
SUNNY still feels a bit shaken.

156
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,160
RUSAMEEKAE: And she wants to know
if it's real.

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,880
CRIS: Sure.

158
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,040
RUSAMEEKAE: If you're ready,
let's watch together.

159
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,760
SUNNY: Bye-bye, see everyone tomorrow.

160

CHERRY: We look exactly alike, FRAME.

164
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,520

more tanned.

165
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:19,456

167
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,008
JANEYEH: What are you seeking?

168
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:23,552
RUSAMEEKAE: What is it?

169
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,760

257
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,720
NAMNUNG: It confuses me a bit.

258
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,720
NAMNUNG: I'm not sure if she chose me
to talk for clarity or not.

259
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,680
NAMNUNG: Sit.

260
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,520

TIMETHAI: Here we go.

267
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,416
SUNNY: At first,
it was really hard to think about.

268
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,680
SUNNY: It must be a relationship
that can develop.

269
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,888
NAMNUNG: Interesting.

270
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:55,616

271
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:01,080
- RUSAMEEKAE: I sent signals.
- JANEYEH: I sent signals.

272

CRIS: That's a bold move.

273
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,560
SUNNY: What signal?
I'm clueless. You need to tell me.

274
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,248
CRIS: You're clueless?
You're the best here.

275
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,120
NAMNUNG: I don't know, either.

276
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:22,912
NAMNUNG: Maybe you didn't
notice me before.

277
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:30,880
SUNNY: Well, before I thought
we were like siblings.

278
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

279
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,850

made me wonder. I've told you before.

280
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,304
SUNNY: Last time we were here.

281
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:38,886
NAMNUNG: Uh-huh.

282
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:42,080

if you're interested in me.

283
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,815
(You're interested in me)

284
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:46,880

293
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,480
CRIS: Oh my, they're both so beautiful.
What should I do?

294
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,160
(Looks around)

295
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,592
TIMETHAI: She's sleeping
with the pillow on her.

296
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,256
(Teamwork while playing games)

297
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:21,480
CRIS: I'm blushing, sis.

298
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
RUSAMEEKAE: And it has to be sweeter
than the last time at X-Land.

299
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:32,840
(Closeness while playing games)

300
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,240
JANEYEH: They don't give off
friend vibes.

301
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,720
RUSAMEEKAE: They talked and it clicked.

302
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,080
CRIS: Yeah, still cute.

303
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:40,320
(Thinking out loud)

in 'flirting mode' before.

307
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,960
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm loving this so much!

308
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,360
TIMETHAI: This is so cinematic.

309
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,520

312
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,448
SUNNY: I don't know. I want to know
if it will develop into something else.

313
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,280
TIMETHAI: Oh!

314
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,280

320
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,608
- CRIS: Oops.
- JANEYEH: Whoa.

321
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,560

You're roommates, anyway.

322
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,760
CRIS: Yeah.

you must be hungry by now.

326
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,000

NAMNUNG: What do they call this fish?

330
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
SUNNY: I don't know.

331
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:38,912
- NAMNUNG: Fish something.
- SUNNY: Steak.

332
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Why is it so natural like...

333
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
CRIS: Yeah, it's natural.

334
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,560
SUNNY: Honestly, I've wanted to know from
the beginning if you're interested in me.

335
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,640
SUNNY: 'Cause you would
actually be my type.

if you didn't know.

JANEYEH: Oh, my God!

342
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,640
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm loving this so much!

343
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:12,040
NAMNUNG: Now I know it.

344
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,427
(Look)

345
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,400
SUNNY: Can't you tell that I like you?

346
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,048
JANEYEH: Oh, wow.

347
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:19,744
JANEYEH: SUNNY.

348
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,560
CRIS: She's just firing off
pick-up lines one after another!

349
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,880
TIMETHAI: Pew!

350
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,040
JANEYEH: Non-stop.

351
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,240
SUNNY: Can't you tell that I like you?

352
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,760
NAMNUNG: I can't tell.

353
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
CRIS: Can't tell? Keep it going!

354
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
SUNNY: I'm not flirting
with anyone else.

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,840
SUNNY: Except for mixed ones.

356
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:36,960
CRIS: Here we go!

357
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:41,600
(Feeling awkward)

358
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,520
TIMETHAI: Oh,
she can't keep her hands still.

359
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,200
RUSAMEEKAE: She's getting all fidgety.

360
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,880
SUNNY: I thought
you'd show it from day one.

361
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,240
SUNNY: I think now we're paired
like ASSE and CHERRY.

362
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, they're like
ASSE and CHERRY now.

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,040
TIMETHAI: Pew!

364
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,200
NAMNUNG: But I still
feel like it's really too late.

365
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:08,928
(Feeling regret starting too late)

366
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,320
SUNNY: It's fine.

367
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
JANEYEH: Yes, it's fine.

368
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,464
NAMNUNG: The more I think, the more I keep
wondering if I should've done this or that.

369
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:21,664
NAMNUNG: I feel like
it went off plan from like...

370
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,072
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, don't.
I'm so invested in this.

371
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:25,440
JANEYEH: It's okay.
You can always start anew.

372
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,560
NAMNUNG: On the second day.

373
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,120
NAMNUNG: When we
played the game to X-Land.

374
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,080
SUNNY: Uh-huh.

375
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,880
NAMNUNG: We should've been together
since then.

376
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,720
CRIS: Seriously, it's not too late.

377
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,328
JANEYEH: It's not too late.

378
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

379
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,480
SUNNY: But that day you thought
if you chose, you'd still pick TIME.

380
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,640
CRIS: Alright, let's get into it.

381
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,480
NAMNUNG: Yes, if it were then.

382
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,000
JANEYEH: Yes, if it were then.

383
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,776
TIMETHAI: Wow.

384
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,136
(Nods)

385
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
NAMNUNG: And are you confident
with TIME?

386
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,347
(Put everything down)

387
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,480
CRIS: Alright. TIME, get ready.
TIME, get ready to be run over.

388
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,456
(Let go)

389
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,520
(Shake head)

390
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,064
SUNNY: No.

391
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,920
- CRIS: No.
- JANEYEH: No.

392
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,624
(Raises an eyebrow)

393
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:19,360
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

394
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:20,672
JANEYEH: Neither is confident.

395
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:21,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Still not confident.

396
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:22,912
SUNNY: That's why you're here.

397
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:25,248
SUNNY: That's why you're here.

398
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,032
(Sigh)

399
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,680
(Smile)
TIMETHAI: Straightforward.

400
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,200
SUNNY: TIME knows
I'm not confident with him.

401
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Is this called
testing the waters?

402
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,680
(Headache)
JANEYEH: Yes, it is.

403
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,840
NAMNUNG: Umm.

404
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,760
SUNNY: You do this pose often.

405
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,960
NAMNUNG: Ugh.

406
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,560
NAMNUNG: Recently I feel like...

407
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,480
SUNNY: I have to sort it out in my mind.

408
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,800
SUNNY: Whether my liking for TIME
is just sexual tension or not.

409
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,672
CRIS: There are two kinds
of attraction for two humans.

410
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,760
CRIS: Horizontal attraction
is sexual tension.

411
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,360
CRIS: Vertical attraction starts with conversation, followed
by liking, longing, and admiring their personality or image.

412
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:17,560
RUSAMEEKAE: We think there's something
when these two are in a room together.

413
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,520
RUSAMEEKAE: And if TIME interferes
again, I'll be very angry right now.

414
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:28,040
SUNNY: I have to sort it out in my mind.
Whether my liking for TIME is just sexual tension or not.

415
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,880
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

416
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,080
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

417
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,680
NAMNUNG: But
I don't want you to overthink.

418
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,360
(Don't want SUNNY to overthink)

419
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:37,600
SUNNY: Can't help
but overthink inside, you know?

420
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,664
NAMNUNG: Oh, yes.

421
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:47,400
(Hold)

422
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,600
CRIS: I think SUNNY really feels this way.
NAMNUNG is confused like TIME.

423
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,760
SUNNY: Honestly,
if I had to choose, on the last day.

424
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,080
SUNNY: It's very difficult
to answer now.

425
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,400
SUNNY: TIME knows I can't answer,
so he says I'm not a hundred percent sure.

426
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,080
NAMNUNG: He said over the past few days he's changed his mind,
so I was like, "Why would SUNNY change her mind?"

427
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,960
NAMNUNG: So I started thinking
like is it because of me or something like that.

428
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
(Am I the one who made you change your mind?)
CRIS: Wow, she's so good at this.

429
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,520
JANEYEH: Look at her touching her hair.

430
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,296
(Nods) SUNNY: Uh, yes.
It's been two or three days.

431
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,880
SUNNY: That I've clocked
you might actually be interested in me.

432
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:40,960
RUSAMEEKAE: That's my girl!

433
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,320
CRIS: She's killing it.

434
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,760
SUNNY: At first, I didn't even think you're the one
who kissed me on the first day. I can't figure it out.

435
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,560
TIMETHAI: Pew!

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,680
CRIS: I don't think they're just friends.

437
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:58,880
NAMNUNG: Because I am, sort of, like...

438
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,568
NAMNUNG: I'm not close
to anyone except you.

439
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,840
(You're the only one) NAMNUNG:
It's like you're the only one, you know?

440
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,632
JANEYEH: Oh!
That's exactly how you do it!

441
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,680
NAMNUNG: You're the only one.

442
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:14,009
RUSAMEEKAE: You're the only one.

443
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,760
(Blush) RUSAMEEKAE:
I'm so satisfied now, CRIS, JANEYEH.

444
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,664
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm loving this.

445
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,016
SUNNY: It's also
the little things off camera.

446
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,720
SUNNY: Obviously, the camera
can't follow in the bathroom, you know.

447
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,880
SUNNY: You'd have moments
where you come to kiss me, like that.

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,800
CRIS: Really?

449
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:36,800
(SUNNY)

450
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
CRIS: Oh, that day.

451
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,616
(NAMNUNG follows into the bathroom)

452
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
CRIS: They've been in the bathroom.
What are they doing?

453
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:52,760
NAMNUNG: Don't go yet. Wait for me.

454
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,680
SUNNY: Oh, okay.

455
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:01,888
(Close the door)

456
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:03,886
TIMETHAI: Hey. Hold on.

457
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,280
SUNNY: Here, this one.

458
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,880
NAMNUNG: Close it first.
Close the curtain. People outside can see.

459
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,360
JANEYEH: I want to know.

460
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
NAMNUNG: Wanna shower together?

461
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,168
SUNNY: We're thinking to ourselves.
"Oh, my God. This feels so good."

462
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:28,416
SUNNY: Really.

463
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
TIMETHAI: When two double bisexuality meet.

464
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,360
CRIS: It's absolutely iconic!

465
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,424
(Feeling awkward)

466
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,360
SUNNY: I thought it was just for fun.

467
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,160
SUNNY: But you sneakily kissed me.

468
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:50,040
(Intentionally kiss)

469
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,120
TIMETHAI: Pew!

470
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,680
(Shy)
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm so loving this.

471
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,280
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY, you're so cool.

472
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,840
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY is like...

473
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
NAMNUNG: Just a little touchy-feely.

474
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,600
NAMNUNG: You might not
think much of it, but...

475
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:09,560
NAMNUNG: Just want you
to know that, well...

476
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
NAMNUNG: That person is me.

477
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,840
NAMNUNG: That's it.

478
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,282
(That person is me)

479
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,664
CRIS: Isn't this too intense.

480
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:22,592
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, dear. I'm loving this.

481
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,520
JANEYEH: SUNNY is absolutely iconic.

482
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,704
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY
makes me feel like a woman.

483
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,560
RUSAMEEKAE: She's cool.
She's a gentleman. She is like...

484
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
TIMETHAI: If I meet a woman
like this, and she says this...

485
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,280
TIMETHAI: I will sit like this.

486
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,000
CRIS: Yes.

487
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Exactly.

488
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

489
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,560
RUSAMEEKAE: She's
really good at flirting.

490
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,320
JANEYEH: Very good.

491
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,632
CRIS: It's like...

492
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,160
CRIS: Things that seem
like trust between them?

493
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,720
(Agree)
CRIS: They look so natural.

494
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,440
RUSAMEEKAE: And SUNNY, you have
to admit, when SUNNY went on a date...

495
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
RUSAMEEKAE: When she went on a date with TIME,
she was making moves, but in a strategic way.

496
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,640
- CRIS: Strategic.
- JANEYEH: Strategic indeed.

497
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, but this is like...

498
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,600
TIMETHAI: Real.

499
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,360
CRIS: It's real.

500
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,080
RUSAMEEKAE: It comes
from within... It's just...

501
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, it's like two people
who trust each other sitting and talking openly.

502
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,080
CRIS: Isn't the show too good?

503
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Can we
take TIME out of the show?

504
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,800
CRIS: No, he's still here.

505
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's end it at X-Land.
No need to return to the villa.

drawing each other, like that.

539
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:10,840

CRIS: Ask back.

545
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,664
NAMNUNG: Why'd you think I was fierce
at first? Or was I just unapproachable?

546
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:22,496
SUNNY: First day.

547
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,480

I showed that I'm interested in you.

550

SUNNY: If you talk about the eyes,

551
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,400
SUNNY: you're deceiving yourself.

552
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,000

CRIS: That's strong.

573
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,584

574
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,160

NAMNUNG: What is this?

602
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,400
SUNNY: At first,

603
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,600
SUNNY: your legs are short like this.
But it's not proportions because you have long legs.

604
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,640
NAMNUNG: Oh, my body looks
proportional though. My body is long.

605
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480

606
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,160

613
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,240

614
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,360

(So sweet)

634
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,224
RUSAMEEKAE: Instead
of being in the bathtub,

635
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
RUSAMEEKAE: the show switched the mood.

636
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Just sit and draw.

637
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,560
(X-Land, new style)
RUSAMEEKAE: And how so?

638
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,440

couldn't be romantic?

639
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,240

640
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,840

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,560
CRIS: It's natural.

646
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,920

and I've never seen NAMNUNG like this.

647
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,640
RUSAMEEKAE: This might be
the happiest part for NAMNUNG.

648
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,440
JANEYEH: Indeed.

649
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000

hanging his head in sadness.

653
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,320
TIME: Cheers.

654
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600

together for ten days?

661
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,000
TOD: Can't believe it's been ten days.

662
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,360
JANEYEH: Only looking at TIME, huh?

663
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
TIME: Time flies, doesn't it?

664
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,720
RUSAMEEKAE: What else is the show
going to make them do?

665
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,880
(TIME, please get ready
to leave for X-Land.)

666
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,920
(So, what exactly happened?)
TIMETHAI: Oh!

667
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
SUNNY: You have the right
to invite two people to join you for a date.

668
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,120
CRIS: Oh, my God.

669
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,000
(Can invite two people to go on a date)

670
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,080

671
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,760
(Another is after midnight) SUNNY:
Another is a silent conversation after midnight.

672
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,200
CRIS: What?

673
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
TIMETHAI: You told them
not to bring him, RUSAMEEKAE.

674
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,080
CRIS: No, it can't be a triangle.

675
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,096
(Chooses NAMNUNG before evening)

676
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,000
MATHEUS: Happy for you guys.

677
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,800
(SUNNY invites TIME)

678
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,600
JANEYEH: What's going on here?

679
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,160
(Chooses TIME after evening)

680
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,920
CRIS: Very happy.

681
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,760
TIMETHAI: Jump and then into the water?

682
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,280
TIME: Goodnight, everyone.

683
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,040
MILL: Good luck.

684
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,520
MILL: Oh, now he's smiling.

685
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,320
JANEYEH: Look at TOD.

686
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,200
CRIS: TOD looks so tense.

687
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,424
(Head down)
JANEYEH: Oh, TOD.

688
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,720
JANEYEH: Oh, JOY is also down.

689
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,200
MATHEUS: Wow.

690
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,720
CRIS: Does this mean NAMNUNG
will be sent back and replaced?

691
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
RUSAMEEKAE: But they talked it out,
well...

692
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,480
RUSAMEEKAE: And SUNNY will be with TIME.

693
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,840
CRIS: Oh, I'm not okay at all.

694
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,600
TIMETHAI: But, look, considering NAMNUNG and SUNNY,
they've slept together every night, and they already have their X-Land.

695
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,920
RUSAMEEKAE: I have nothing else to say.

696
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:48,832
(X-Land)

697
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,200
CRIS: Let the heart be shattered.

698
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:10,200
TIMETHAI: Crushed and shattered.

699
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,920
(Hugging)
TIMETHAI: See?

700
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,600
TIMETHAI: No need to go anywhere at all.

701
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:28,640
(TIME arrives at X-Land)

702
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Come on.

703
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,880
(Looking)

704
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,040
CRIS: She's facing that way?

705
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:41,661
RUSAMEEKAE: He saw them.

706
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,240
JANEYEH: Give a kiss on the ear.

707
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,760
NAMNUNG: If you

708
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,880
NAMNUNG: have a friend

709
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
NAMNUNG: I'm okay.

710
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,240
NAMNUNG: If I talk to you,
I will do more.

711
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,880
SUNNY: Thank you.

712
00:34:02,746 --> 00:34:03,651
NAMNUNG: Have fun.

713
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,440
(Looking at TIME)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, she knows.

714
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,400
CRIS: We're the ones who don't know.

715
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,560
(Sigh)

716
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,360
CRIS: So stressed.

717
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,608
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

718
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,120
NAMNUNG: Shopping.

719
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,840
NAMNUNG: Have fun.

720
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,240
RUSAMEEKAE: See? NAMNUNG has changed.

721
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,400
JANEYEH: Have fun.

722
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Where was NAMNUNG
who was with SUNNY just now?

723
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,280
CRIS: Her inner viper just came out.

724
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:41,824
NAMNUNG: Have fun.

725
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:48,840
TIME: Thanks.

RUSAMEEKAE: Stressed.

728
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,400
CRIS: Oh, SUNNY.

729
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,000
JANEYEH: Look at the camera.

730
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:07,360
CRIS: Look at the camera.

731
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,280
(Turning back)

732
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,760
JANEYEH: She smiles!

733
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,680
RUSAMEEKAE: One person's like bye,
the other's like hi.

734
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:33,987
TIME: You look good.

735
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,800
SUNNY: Thank you.

736
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:42,010
(Looking)

737
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,688
(Smiling)

738
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,000
SUNNY: Can I take a break first?

739
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,792
TIME: Go ahead.

740
00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:54,944
(Going to the bathroom)

741
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,832
SUNNY: Right now I'm really confused.

742
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:05,984
SUNNY: I want to be alone.

743
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,160
SUNNY: I want to sit and reflect

744
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,520
SUNNY: how I and others
feel? I need to shift my perspective.

745
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,520
JANEYEH: My head hurts.

746
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,800
CRIS: Here comes my little mermaid.

747
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:41,440
(Sigh)

748
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,392
TIME: I know you're tired.

749
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,840
SUNNY: So tired.

750
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,640
SUNNY: It's hot.

751
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,640
(Sit down)

752
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,280
TIME: how was it?

753
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,128
SUNNY: It was good.

754
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,960
TIME: Yeah?

755
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:02,112
TIME: Good, good.

756
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:07,920
TIME: What did you guys do?

757
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,408
(Asking)

758
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:11,374
CRIS: Exactly.

759
00:37:14,656 --> 00:37:15,840
SUNNY: Eat.

760
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,880
SUNNY: We chatted and drew,
like you saw earlier.

761
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,080
TIME: Yeah, and what else?

762
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,600
SUNNY: She said that as well.

763
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,856
SUNNY: She couldn't decide from
the first day, right? It made her like...

764
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,456
TIME: Okay.

765
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,912
SUNNY: Slower than everyone else.

766
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,040
SUNNY: Every connection,
whether it's about you

767
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,000
SUNNY: or me.

768
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,984
(Thinking)

769
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,379

(We are here)

773
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,904
TIMETHAI: Oh.

774
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,920
TIME: I think I like you, SUNNY.

775
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,080
TIME: But there are some people that...
But I haven't told everyone yet.

776
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,800
TIME: I haven't announced anything yet,
such as saying everything is okay.

777
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,960
TIME: I've been waiting
for this moment for so long.

778
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:24,096
(Waiting for this moment for so long)

779
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,960
TIMETHAI: He's really good at answering.

780
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,752

781
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,600
CRIS: I like it, rooting for them.

782
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,200
TIMETHAI: The way they're looking
at each other.

783
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
RUSAMEEKAE: It's time now.

784
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,688
(Close contact)

785
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:48,760
(Kissing)

786
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,960
CRIS: This is another kind of nature.

787
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,112
(Rubbing)

788
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Having mood swings?

789
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,984
JANEYEH: Totally!

790
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,128

792
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,088

with my heart.

793
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,992
CRIS: TIME and SUNNY, I believe in
the first connection that's like sparking.

794
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:17,640
CRIS: But my heart
is rooting for SUNNY and NAMNUNG.

795
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,064
- TIMETHAI: Feels like a different vibe.
- CRIS: Yes.

796
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,440
- TIMETHAI: It's a different vibe.
- CRIS: Yes, different vibe but it...

797
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,000
TIMETHAI: They're not fake,
but it's a different vibe.

798
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,712
CRIS: Yeah.

799
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,520

800
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,952

to the pool downstairs.

801
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:34,048
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't tell me.

802
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,640
(Blocking for her)
CRIS: What's being blocked here?

803
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,280
TIMETHAI: What's being blocked?

804
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,840
RUSAMEEKAE: The air is getting less hot.

805
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,368
CRIS: They invited each other.
No games were involved. Totally genuine!

806
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:03,320
TIMETHAI: Try forcing them.

807
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,624
TIME: Come here.

808
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,600

JANEYEH: What is he doing?

810
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,232

TIMETHAI: It's starting.

817
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
(Holding hands)
RUSAMEEKAE: Holding has exceptions.

818
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
(Smiling)
CRIS: Aw, how can SUNNY be so shy?

819
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:53,376
(Pulling closer)

820
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,277
SUNNY: This hug is better.

821
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,360
JANEYEH: Oh wow.

822

RUSAMEEKAE: And that's good,
unexpectedly good.

824
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,394
SUNNY: This hug is better.

825
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,960
JANEYEH: SUNNY!

826
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:15,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Goosebumps.

827
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,632
TIMETHAI: How can you resist this, boy?

828
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:24,320
SUNNY: How did I end up this close?

829
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,392
TIME: Try it for one minute.

830
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,240
SUNNY: Do you wanna die?
Don't come close.

831
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,824
- CRIS: Do you wanna die?
- RUSAMEEKAE: Then die.

832
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:36,032

TIMETHAI: Can they kiss?

835
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:44,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Go ahead and kiss.

836
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:03,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Why run away?

837
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,120
(What are you showing me?)

838
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,800
CRIS: Remember, women can endure it.

839
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:10,000
RUSAMEEKAE: But as for me...

840
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,080
CRIS: You won't endure it.

841
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I won't endure it.

842

JANEYEH: Get on my back.

845
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,204
SUNNY: It's okay, as long as
you don't get hurt.

846
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Thie is SUNNY.

847
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,424
CRIS: Absolutely amazing, my baby.

848
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
JANEYEH: She's a true queen,
more than a queen.

849
00:42:40,149 --> 00:42:41,840
(Kissing)

850
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,280
CRIS: Oops, he kisses on her arm.

851
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Why kiss the arm?

852
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,040
(Embrace)

853
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
CRIS: Aw, that's so cute. Aw.

854
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:56,600
(Embrace)

855
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
JANEYEH: I've got chills.

856
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:03,991
TIMETHAI: Oh, my god.

857
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,640
SUNNY: I can't take it, I've got chills.

858
00:43:08,904 --> 00:43:09,748
TIME: Let's go.

859
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,808
CRIS: So, they get to sleep together?

860
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:14,035
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

861
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:20,864
CRIS: Oh wow, it's a mess.

862
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,680
TIMETHAI: That's proper pajamas
right there.

863
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,944
TIME: Thank you.

864
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:44,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Thank you for what?

865
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,056
SUNNY: For what?

866
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,592
TIMETHAI: Calm down,
he hasn't said anything yet.

867
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
TIME: Over the past ten days,

868
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,320
TIME: truly thank you.

869
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:02,656
(Kissing)

870
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Where are you going?

871
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,528
- TIME: Where are you going?
- SUNNY: Run away.

872
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,080
CRIS: And then turn off the lights.

873
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,320
TIME: God, you're so cute.

874
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,952
JANEYEH: Oh, those eyes.

875
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,880
SUNNY: We're at X-Land, I can ask you.

876
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:42,920
CRIS: Oh, here she comes.

877
00:44:45,736 --> 00:44:46,718
SUNNY: Are you straight?

878
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:48,731
CRIS: Are you straight?

879
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:52,192
TIME: No.

880
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,480
TIME: No.

881
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,880
- TIMETHAI: Whoa.
- CRIS: No?

882
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,192
JANEYEH: What?

883
00:44:56,672 --> 00:44:57,472
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

884
00:44:57,632 --> 00:44:58,560
CRIS: Oh, my God.

885
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,400
TIMETHAI: Oh.

886
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,856
SUNNY: What's your preference?

887
00:45:02,824 --> 00:45:03,499
TIME: Pan.

888
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:05,440
SUNNY: Really?

889
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
RUSAMEEKAE: What's it, a pan?

890
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,415
SUNNY: That's cool.

891
00:45:08,262 --> 00:45:09,475
RUSAMEEKAE: Pan, what is pan?

892
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,680
(Pansexuality: Attraction to people regardless of gender)
CRIS: Being pansexual is liking every gender.

893
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,464
CRIS: Men, women, trans, or gay.
It's basically the ultimate melting pot.

894
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,640
TIME: I don't think about gender.
If we connect, we connect.

895
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,768
RUSAMEEKAE: He goes by the vibe.

896
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,120
CRIS: He goes by the vibe.

897
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,400
TIMETHAI: Whoa.

898
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,600
JANEYEH: Wow.

899
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,320
CRIS: Oh, if that's the case,
there is hope for TOD.

900
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Exactly.

901
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,680
SUNNY: Have you ever been attracted
to the same gender?

902
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,080
RUSAMEEKAE: It must have happened.

903
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

904
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:50,480
(Nodding)

905
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,424
TIME: It has happened.

906
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,120
SUNNY: Who are they?

907
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,128
(Asking)

908
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,632
(Living up to her reputation)
CRIS: SUNNY is absolutely terrific.

909
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,168
TIME: Honestly, it just happened today.

910
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:08,640
JANEYEH: It happened today.

911
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,400
TIME: But there happened before too.

912
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,968
TIME: With TOD.

913
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,040
TIME: With TOD.

914
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:14,280
CRIS: TOD.

915
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,688
CRIS: Plot twist.

916
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:19,488
CRIS: Another plot twist.

917
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

918
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,424
TIME: I just feel like
he really takes care of me.

919
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,360
TIME: And today I cried,
and he came to hug me and comfort me.

920
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,600
TOD: Cry it out.

921
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,128
CRIS: Oh, TOD.

922
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:37,172
RUSAMEEKAE: Senior.

923
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,280
TIME: Thank you.

924
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,880
TIME: Thank you for being there for me.

925
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,760
TIME: So it felt like a moment.

926
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,600
TIME: Or do I like TOD or something?

927
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,264
CRIS: Drag him back here, come on.

928
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,504
TIME: At first I thought
we were like siblings,

929
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,080
TIME: but sometimes being siblings
can develop into being lovers too, right?

930
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,832
(Siblings can become lovers.)

931
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,368
- CRIS: This is insane.
- JANEYEH: This is insane.

932
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,400
TIME: So sometimes I feel like
maybe it's TOD.

933
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,920
TIMETHAI: Wait, that's allowed?

934
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,040
CRIS: And add the roommate.

935
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,360
JANEYEH: Is that the end?

936
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,080
JANEYEH: Ending it all tense like that?

937
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,256
TIMETHAI: That's it?

938
00:47:52,256 --> 00:47:56,840
RUSAMEEKAE: So the answer
turned into Pansexuality.

939
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,360
CRIS: The wild part is...

940
00:47:59,808 --> 00:48:03,040
CRIS: Honestly, it also hurts SUNNY.

941
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,304
CRIS: It hurts the first person,
because the second person got to stay over.

942
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:06,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah.

943
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,736
CRIS: But I think what she said before that and what
she feels for TIME might be more like an attractive show.

944
00:48:12,928 --> 00:48:14,600
CRIS: Kind of attachment.

945
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,360
CRIS: So she probably wanted to compare.

946
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,784
RUSAMEEKAE: I understand SUNNY now,
but this time it's about TIME and TOD again.

947
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,480
TIMETHAI: So TIME and TOD made fun
of each other from the start of Episode one.

948
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,040
JANEYEH: I knew it.

949
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,640
CRIS: Complimenting the pants.

950
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Ugh, it's chaotic and messy.

951
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,280
TIMETHAI: Okay, then.

952
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:43,556
(NAMNUNG returns to the room)

953
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:10,368
(Prepare the bed for SUNNY)

954
00:49:23,855 --> 00:49:25,856
(Pick up the photo)

955
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,720
TIMETHAI: NAMNUNG has been hit
so many times at this point.

956
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,776
CRIS: True, NAMNUNG 's been
absolutely battered.

957
00:49:36,448 --> 00:49:38,320
CRIS: This is so hard.

958
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,936
CRIS: Ugh, I'm so confused.
My head hurts.

959
00:49:54,207 --> 00:49:56,440
(Comforting herself)

960
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,920
NAMNUNG: If I could go back in time,

961
00:49:58,464 --> 00:50:00,040
NAMNUNG: I might have started earlier,

962
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,712
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, dear.

963
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:09,216
NAMNUNG: If there was a chance that
could let us be together, just the two of us...

964
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:10,368
NAMNUNG: I would do it.

965
00:50:10,368 --> 00:50:12,280
NAMNUNG: But I know that in the end,

966
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,480
NAMNUNG: we probably
wouldn't choose each other.

967
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,280
RUSAMEEKAE: This is that feeling.

968
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Better regret having done it
than regret not doing it.

969
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:45,280
(X Villa)

970
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,400
CRIS: Oh, TOD.

971
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,008
CRIS: Oh, TOD still doesn't know.

972
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,760
JANEYEH: TOD, keep fighting!

973
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,120
(Waiting)

974
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,480
(Staring)
CRIS: She's waiting for TIME.

975
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:08,320
RUSAMEEKAE: They've been together for 10 days
of course. They never even separated rooms.

976
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,360
JANEYEH: It's lonely.

977
00:51:11,136 --> 00:51:12,256
JANEYEH: It's lonely, right?

978
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,160
JANEYEH: Right? He looks really sad.

979
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,208
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh!

980
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,456
CRIS: JOY is so sad.

981
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:20,560
JANEYEH: JOY is no longer joyful.

982
00:51:21,472 --> 00:51:22,880
CRIS: It's uncomfortable.

983
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:27,616
(The two return from X-Land)

984
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:28,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, it's back!

985
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,800
JANEYEH: Bring it on!

986
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,680
TIME: Might be in the room, right?

987
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:35,392
JUNSU: SUNNY.

988
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, JOY!

989
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,824
CRIS: Come to this room,
it's the safest.

990
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:44,360
- KONG: How is it, happy?
- MILL: Yep.

991
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:45,536
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG has started.

992
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,240
CRIS: He has started again.

993
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:48,680
SUNNY: Answer it.

994
00:51:49,184 --> 00:51:49,640
(Nod)

995
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,272
TIME: Happy.

996
00:51:50,432 --> 00:51:50,760
(Smile)

997
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,480
CRIS: Why does the answer mean?

998
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:54,520
JANEYEH: That's so iconic.

999
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,480
SUNNY: I think there'll definitely be
a date today.

1000
00:51:56,832 --> 00:51:58,048
JOY: There's already been one.

1001
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,944
SUNNY: Who went?

1002
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:03,480
JOY: They went separately; one girl, one guy.
But it wasn't revealed who got what.

1003
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,128
LOVE(X)PERT: Is this a trick?

1004
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,632
JOY: They went diving.

1005
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,160
JOY: Yes, diving to find shells
is the invitation card.

1006
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,736
MILL: Yes.

1007
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,328
JOY: Yes, men and women split.

1008
00:52:11,552 --> 00:52:12,416
LOVE(X)PERT: When did you secretly play?

1009
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:14,656
(30 minutes earlier)

1010
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:15,488
CRIS: Oh, it really exists.

1011
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:17,120
(30 minutes earlier)

1012
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,432
(Next, we'll start the final couple's date
competition before the love confession.)

1013
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,000
TIMETHAI: TOD's muscles!

1014
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,984
CRIS: TOD's muscles!

1015
00:52:25,984 --> 00:52:30,240
(Both male and female sides will have
one chance to compete for the file.)

1016
00:52:30,688 --> 00:52:32,512
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, playing
the rights competition game first.

1017
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,760
(Now, everyone please get ready.)

1018
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,408
TOD: Okay.

1019
00:52:37,664 --> 00:52:38,336
(3,)

1020
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,056
(2,)

1021
00:52:43,008 --> 00:52:43,720
(1.)

1022
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:47,136
(Start the competition)

1023
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,888
RUSAMEEKAE:
Women compete against women, right?

1024
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,880
(Competition ended)
(The person who got the limited date invitation card is...)

1025
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,136
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1026
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:05,184
RUSAMEEKAE:
Oh, we need to check again who'll get it.

1027
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:08,384
CRIS: Oh, it's random.

1028
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:12,096
(TOD and NAMNUNG, wow.)

1029
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,360
CRIS: It's starting the scene again.

1030
00:53:15,808 --> 00:53:16,960
TIMETHAI: Oh, these two again.

1031
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:19,424
CRIS: These two again,
they're very lucky!

1032
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:23,008
RUSAMEEKAE: And congratulations to
TOD and NAMNUNG.

1033
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:26,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Who will the two of them
choose to invite?

1034
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,024
KONG: It's the final date.

1035
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,192
SUNNY: TOD, I want to go.

1036
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:32,864
CRIS: Wants to go again.

1037
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,168
KONG: You just came from X-Land,
what else do you want?

1038
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,200
RUSAMEEKAE: From the heart,
KONGPOP said just now.

1039
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,200
SUNNY: How many people will get it?

1040
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,760
JOY: One woman, one man.

1041
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:44,520
SUNNY: Good, bye-bye.

1042
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,520
CRIS: Yeah, JOY never got to go anywhere.
You know?

1043
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,360
SUNNY: NAMNUNG is asleep.
I think NAMNUNG is asleep for sure.

1044
00:54:02,624 --> 00:54:03,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

1045
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,640
CRIS: Did she see? Did she see those two?

1046
00:54:09,818 --> 00:54:10,969
(Looks from afar)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

1047
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,280
(Biting lip)
RUSAMEEKAE: Who did NAMNUNG invite?

1048
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,320
JANEYEH: TIME.

1049
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,320
CRIS: SUNNY.

1050
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:30,960
(Use thought)

1051
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,800
CRIS: TOD is thinking again.

1052
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Who did TOD invite?

1053
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,480
TIMETHAI: MILL and him
still haven't really talked.

1054
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,960
TIMETHAI: And he still doesn't know
TIME's already hoping it might be MILL, you know.

1055
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,760
JANEYEH: But he said,
will you go together next time?

1056
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,240
CRIS: Yeah, he did say that.

1057
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:45,664
(The final date activity)

1058
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:47,520
RUSAMEEKAE: The final date activity.

1059
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,920
CRIS: So beautiful.

1060
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,160
JANEYEH: Oh wow, so beautiful!

1061
00:55:13,504 --> 00:55:14,336
(Smile)

1062
00:55:14,336 --> 00:55:15,240
(Who did NAMNUNG choose?)

1063
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Who came? Wow!

1064
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:22,920
(After receiving
the date invitation rights)

1065
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,800
LOVE(X)PERT: She's hesitating.

1066
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,920
CRIS: Oh, I feel sorry for her.

1067
00:55:53,152 --> 00:55:54,688
(Glance over)

1068
00:55:58,577 --> 00:55:59,338
TOD: What?

1069
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,560
NAMNUNG: I'm feeling hesitant
and confused inside.

1070
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,080
NAMNUNG: At...

1071
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,640
NAMNUNG: At that time,
because I thought SUNNY wouldn't choose me.

1072
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,440
NAMNUNG: Hello.

1073
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,200
CRIS: SUNNY is here too.

1074
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,028
NAMNUNG: Can we talk?

1075
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:17,406
NAMNUNG: Can we talk?

1076
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,800
TIME: Okay.

1077
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,720
TIMETHAI: Oh wow!

1078
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,000
CRIS: Oh my God.

1079
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,640
TIMETHAI: She's asking right
in front of everyone!

1080
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,920
NAMNUNG: So I decided to go with TIME
because we never really had a chance to talk one-on-one

1081
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,520
NAMNUNG: or to talk seriously.

1082
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,120
CRIS: Oh wow, NAMNUNG.

1083
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,880
NAMNUNG: Can we go
on a date with me, just for this one time?

1084
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,040
TIME: Okay.

1085
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,760
TIME: Agreed.

1086
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,720
NAMNUNG: It's just that
we never really had the chance to go...

1087
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,720
NAMNUNG: just the two of us
seriously. So I...

1088
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,640
TIME: Sure, absolutely.

1089
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,440
NAMNUNG: I feel like it's a good opportunity
for us to talk with someone truly one-on-one.

1090
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,880
CRIS: NAMNUNG is about to show her skills,
because last night she let SUNNY show hers.

1091
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,800
RUSAMEEKAE: But it's that vibe of
follow your heart a little.

1092
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,920
CRIS: Of course if it turns into war,
nobody backs down.

1093
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,440
CRIS: Let's watch NAMNUNG's moves.
She brings a knife, I bring a gun.

1094
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,360
NAMNUNG: Can you sit next to me?

1095
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,106
CRIS: See?

1096
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:26,428
CRIS: Found it.

1097
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,720
JANEYEH: Let's start.

1098
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,400
NAMNUNG: Lucky again today.

1099
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,920
NAMNUNG:
I didn't even have to do anything.

1100
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,480
TIME: FRAME was telling me...

1101
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,080
TIME: It's funny.

1102
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,200
TIME: You get to go on every date,
you get to go to X-Land every time.

1103
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,480
RUSAMEEKAE: A date blessed by fate.

1104
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,040
TIMETHAI: He chooses...

1105
00:57:58,406 --> 00:57:59,776
(Look over)

1106
00:58:01,952 --> 00:58:02,720
(Look over)

1107
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,320
NAMNUNG: What are you thinking?

1108
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,280
NAMNUNG: I'm better than SUNNY,
you know?

1109
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,680
NAMNUNG: I'm better than SUNNY,
you know?

1110
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,080
NAMNUNG: If I could pick two people,
I would've picked you guys already.

1111
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,160
CRIS: Let them know!

1112
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,400
RUSAMEEKAE: It's true, CRIS.

1113
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,000
RUSAMEEKAE: It's war, you know.

1114
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,560
CRIS: I told you.

1115
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
CRIS: If they bring a knife, I bring a gun.

1116
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,720
TIME: I'm not thinking.

1117
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,520
TIME: Not thinking anymore.

1118
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,440
TIME: I just want one day
where I don't have to think.

1119
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:42,480
(Stare)

1120
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,880
RUSAMEEKAE: But it doesn't look
as close or intimate as with SUNNY, though.

1121
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,600
JANEYEH: Yeah, SUNNY is like, uh-huh.

1122
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,640
RUSAMEEKAE: This is distant.

1123
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,360
TIMETHAI: And he keeps turning to look
at other people too.

1124
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,480
TIME: Come here.

1125
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,160
- NAMNUNG: Is it TOD?
- RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

1126
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,280
CRIS: Let it be messy,
let it all fall apart!

1127
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,520
NAMNUNG: So handsome.

1128
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,000
CRIS: Same boat, too brutal.

1129
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
TIME: I miss you so much.

1130
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,720
TIME: Miss you.

1131
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,640
CRIS: TIME said I miss you.

1132
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
NAMNUNG: Such a superstar vibe.

1133
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,920
TIME: Uh-huh.

1134
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,280
LOVE(X)PERT: Who is TOD coming with?

1135
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,560
RUSAMEEKAE:
Don't tell me he picked TIME.

1136
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,480
JANEYEH: Is someone coming?

1137
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,520
(Who did TOD invite?)

1138
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,800
(Smiling)
CRIS: TOD came with SUNNY, what a surprise.

1139
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,400
TIMETHAI: See, told you, perfect.

1140
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,360
TOD: Please come.

1141
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,290
MILL: Hello.

1142
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,680
TOD: Let's go.

1143
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,360
TOD: Let's go on a date.

1144
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,880
TOD: Let's go on a date.

1145
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,520
JANEYEH: It's her.

1146
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,480
(Looking)
RUSAMEEKAE: Aww, that gaze.

1147
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,480
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG, how's it going?

1148
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,960
JANEYEH: Ouch, that's so sad.

1149
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,440
(Smiling)
MILL: I feel really happy.

1150
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,400
MILL: I mean, of course I'm happy.

1151
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,800
MILL: And this is like the first time,
and it's the show's last chance for real.

1152
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,640
(hands behind back)
JANEYEH: Yeah, this is her first date.

1153
00:59:56,832 --> 00:59:57,792
(Peeking)

1154
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,560
JANEYEH: They look like
they missed each other so much.

1155
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,080
NAMNUNG: Hello.

1156
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,400
MILL: Wow.

1157
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,680
TOD: Haven't seen you in a long time.

1158
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,560
MILL: Haven't seen you in a long time.
Hug, hug.

1159
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,680
CRIS: What a rush, right?

1160
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,960
TOD: Tonight we're going together
and I feel like...

1161
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:20,880
TOD: Oh.

1162
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,080
TOD: It's three people that I feel good about,
and I'm also interested in.

1163
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,520
TOD: So we feel like, wow.

1164
01:00:26,596 --> 01:00:27,872
(Wow)

1165
01:00:27,895 --> 01:00:28,960
(Even just thinking about it
makes me happy.)

1166
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,600
CRIS: Ohhh,
so TOD's three people are all here.

1167
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,600
JANEYEH: Wow, TOD's got three!

1168
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,640
TIMETHAI: But still, no one on this boat
knows yet that TIME is pan.

1169
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,480
JANEYEH: True.

1170
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,360
NAMNUNG: My daddy.

1171
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,680
RUSAMEEKAE:
TOD gives big-brother vibes, huh?

1172
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,400
CRIS: Big-brother vibes.

1173
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,880
NAMNUNG: Why are we so lucky?

1174
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,560
MILL: Finally getting out.

1175
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,960
CRIS: MILL,
you have to fight for this, my dear.

1176
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,200
TOD: Go ahead.

1177
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,042
(Nudge)

1178
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,080
TOD: Here we go.

1179
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,520
(Laughing)
RUSAMEEKAE: Why do they match so well?

1180
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,800
(Approach)

1181
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,320
(Looking)
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow!

1182
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,560
JANEYEH: They're totally sneaking glances
at each other.

1183
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,560
MILL: Do you know where we're going?

1184
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,480
NAMNUNG: Chiang Mai.

1185
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,960
TIME: We got to go on a date together.

1186
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,496
(Look)

1187
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,400
(Nudging)
TIME: We got to go on a date together.

1188
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,560
JANEYEH: What about MILL?

1189
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,400
TIME: We've been talking for
a long time already.

1190
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,960
TOD: Ah-ha, got it.

1191
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,280
NAMNUNG: Yeah, whatever. Whatever.

1192
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,520
NAMNUNG: I want to sit in the front,
let me ask to drive the boat.

1193
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,880
TIME: You're going to drive?

1194
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,480
(Standing up)
NAMNUNG: What?

1195
01:01:55,136 --> 01:01:56,160
(Follow)

1196
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,440
CRIS: Get up.

1197
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,968
(Get up and follow)

1198
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,160
(Look)

1199
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,680
CRIS: TOD is watching.

1200
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,608
(Glance)

1201
01:02:10,304 --> 01:02:11,776
(Look)

1202
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,680
CRIS: TOD.

1203
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,600
JANEYEH: He's only looking at TIME.

1204
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,520
TOD: Are you scared up front?

1205
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,320
- TOD: Go ahead.
- MILL: No.

1206
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,360
- TOD: Do you want to go?
- MILL: I'm not afraid.

1207
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,680
MILL: If they let us go.

1208
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,440
CRIS: TOD, wait a moment.

1209
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,240
CRIS: TOD, don't go yet.

1210
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,400
CRIS: Oh, TOD, stop for a moment.

1211
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,480
(Glancing) TIMETHAI: MILL is caught up
in a war unrelated to her.

1212
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,480
(Observing)
CRIS: TOD, could you go back and sit down, please?

1213
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,640
TIME: Let's take a photo.

1214
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,176
(Nudge)

1215
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,600
NAMNUNG: Look at my hair.

1216
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,880
TIME: It's totally fine.

1217
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,720
(Look)

1218
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,520
CRIS: Look at that.

1219
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,000
(Aiming)
MILL: What's that? Saiyan? Super Saiyan?

1220
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,040
TOD: Want to eat something first?

1221
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:50,920
CRIS: TOD.

1222
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,000
(Nodding)
CRIS: Is this called interrupting?

1223
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,840
JANEYEH: It's a big interruption.

1224
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,240
TOD: I'll go get it for you.

1225
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,600
TOD: Just wait here.

1226
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,480
MILL: Okay.

1227
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,800
TIME: It's nice having TOD.

1228
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,200
(Turn to look)
TIME: It's nice having TOD.

1229
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:05,536
(Smile)

1230
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,440
JANEYEH: Do you want him for life?

1231
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,360
JANEYEH: Do you want him for life?

1232
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,280
JANEYEH: Try to open your heart.

1233
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,288
(Nod)

1234
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:13,408
(Look)

1235
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,000
NAMNUNG: TOD takes care of everything,
all that's left is to feed you.

1236
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,320
MILL: All we have to do is chew.

1237
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,600
JANEYEH: So cute.

1238
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:22,989
TIME: Yes.

1239
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:25,280
(Food's served)

1240
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,560
TIME: It's alright, it's alright.

1241
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,520
TIME: Your skirt.

1242
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:29,728
(Look)

1243
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,000
(Help carry it)
TOD: Thank you.

1244
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,120
RUSAMEEKAE: It's like TOD and TIME now.
Like a date between TOD and TIME.

1245
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,560
CRIS: MILL still has a lot to learn
from SUNNY and NAMNUNG.

1246
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,000
JANEYEH: Indeed.
She has to take a lot of notes.

1247
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,128
(Look)

1248
01:03:46,483 --> 01:03:48,032
(Hand over)

1249
01:03:48,384 --> 01:03:50,592
(Smile)

1250
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,280
NAMNUNG: Cheers.

1251
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,440
(Looking)
CRIS: TOD.

1252
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,080
CRIS: Always investigating.
TOD is like Sherlock Holmes.

1253
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,440
TOD: Wow.

1254
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,600
JANEYEH: Wow, did TOD see that?

1255
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,040
CRIS: TOD wows again.

1256
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:10,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow throughout the show.

1257
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,680
TOD: Shall we go downstairs then?

1258
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,824
(Nod)

1259
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,280
(Getting up)
CRIS: Let's go.

1260
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,520
TIMETHAI: Let's go somewhere else.

1261
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,720
TOD: Use a big bait.

1262
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:22,304
(Help bait)

1263
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,360
TOD: Okay.

1264
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,080
(Looking that way)
JANEYEH: He keeps looking that way

1265
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,040
MILL: Eat some, I want to eat you.

1266
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:42,816
(Glance)

1267
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,280
(Looking over)
TOD: It's surprising the fish isn't biting.

1268
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,600
TOD: Not biting at all.

1269
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,280
TIMETHAI: Oh, he's not looking.
He's talking about someone else.

1270
01:04:58,112 --> 01:04:59,000
(Laugh)

1271
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
CRIS: I can't think well.

1272
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Really can't think well.

1273
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,880
CANDIDATE: Shall we go for a swim?

1274
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,120
CANDIDATE: Let's change outfits first.

1275
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's sunbathe.

1276
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,200
TIME: Life is good?

1277
01:05:17,728 --> 01:05:18,685
NAMNUNG: Life is great.

1278
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,760
TIMETHAI: Rolling in, rolling in.

1279
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,160
JANEYEH: That's how it should be, dear.

1280
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,160
(Getting closer)
RUSAMEEKAE: That's it.

1281
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:47,066
(Look)

1282
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,280
TIMETHAI: TIME's heart
isn't there anymore.

1283
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

1284
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,920
RUSAMEEKAE: I think
there's some distance here.

1285
01:06:16,436 --> 01:06:17,917
NAMNUNG: Are you alright?
Do you need a break?

1286
01:06:18,681 --> 01:06:20,128
NAMNUNG: Are you alright? Go to sleep.

1287
01:06:23,004 --> 01:06:23,998
TIME: I'm alright.

1288
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,480
TIME: It's not too bad.

1289
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,120
TIME: What's the first thing
you're gonna do

1290
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,200
TIME: after this?

1291
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,320
NAMNUNG: I might have to
adjust a little bit.

1292
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,600
TIME: Everyone has to adjust.

1293
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,560
TIME: It's something like...

1294
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,480
TIME: I didn't think about it
and didn't prepare either.

1295
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,760
TIME: Right here.

1296
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,840
NAMNUNG: Help me.

1297
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,280
JANEYEH: Help me.

1298
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Help me.

1299
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,480
CRIS: Look. Note this down.

1300
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,400
TIMETHAI: Bring eyeliner when going
to the beach with a girl.

1301
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,760
(Get prepared)

1302
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,520
JANEYEH: No, that's not it.

1303
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,760
(Empathizing with women)
TIMETHAI: They'll often smudge.

1304
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,440
RUSAMEEKAE: No, that's not it.

1305
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,040
RUSAMEEKAE: No, I told you to look
at how she does it.

1306
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,840
NAMNUNG: Help me.

1307
01:07:42,304 --> 01:07:43,456
NAMNUNG: Could you wipe it off a bit?

1308
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,200
CRIS: Can you come closer?

1309
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,360
CRIS: The light is great.

1310
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,181
NAMNUNG: Okay?

1311
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,040
JANEYEH: It's smudged.

1312
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:57,760
RUSAMEEKAE: It's the same.

1313
01:07:59,003 --> 01:07:59,968
(Nod)

1314
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:01,222
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

1315
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,800
RUSAMEEKAE: The more you wipe,
the more it smudges.

1316
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,600
CRIS: Looking at TOD?

1317
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,520
JANEYEH: Oh, that's harsh.

1318
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,000
CRIS: That's really harsh.

1319
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,280
(Look)

1320
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,400
TIMETHAI: Look at TOD's face.

1321
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,360
JANEYEH: TOD's not mentally here at all.

1322
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,480
TOD: Can you get it?

1323
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,640
MILL: No.

1324
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,520
MILL: Why?

1325
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,600
TOD: Wait, wait, you have to be patient.

1326
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,680
MILL: Okay, okay.

1327
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,080
MILL: I've been patient
for about 15 minutes now.

1328
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,472
(Pick up water)

1329
01:08:31,904 --> 01:08:33,680
(Looking the other way)
- MILL: Thank you - TOD: Want more cake?

1330
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,520
(Shaking head) TIMETHAI: One's all over the place,
and the other wants to go home.

1331
01:08:39,968 --> 01:08:40,864
(Stare)

1332
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:44,640
(Bite lips)

1333
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,120
TIME: Hmm, our timing
really doesn't match, does it?

1334
01:09:00,747 --> 01:09:01,439
NAMNUNG: Have fun.

1335
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,200
TIME: Need a hug?

1336
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,080
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh.

1337
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:47,400
NAMNUNG: I told you, I don't want you to think about
my feelings that much. Just follow your heart.

1338
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,920
TIME: Hmm.

1339
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,640
LOVE(X)PERT: Does it feel like
NAMNUNG is about to say goodbye?

1340
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,040
LOVE(X)PERT: Ugh.

1341
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,400
LOVE(X)PERT: TOD still doesn't realize
anything can happen. Be careful.

1342
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,040
LOVE(X)PERT: TOD,
just do what you feel like doing.

1343
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,000
LOVE(X)PERT: Yes.

1344
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,440
CRIS: I'm so stressed.

1345
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,080
JANEYEH: It's such an awkward date.

1346
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,160
TIMETHAI: But seeing this,
it's clear now.

1347
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,720
TIMETHAI: But if I were in their shoes,
I'd be much dumber.

1348
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,360
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD inviting MILL
shows interest.

1349
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,280
TIMETHAI: He might really be interested,
but TIME is his top priority.

1350
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,640
CRIS: He keeps looking at TIME, right?

1351
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,160
RUSAMEEKAE: But when he sees TIME,
it's like he can't resist.

1352
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Can't resist at all.

1353
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,040
JANEYEH: To look at him.

1354
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:46,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Regardless, we are cheering
and want everyone to keep fighting. Want to know what's going to happen?

1355
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,160
TIMETHAI: Let's go. To the paradise.

1356
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,672
(X-Villa)

1357
01:10:58,496 --> 01:10:59,920
(Look)

1358
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops, SUNNY is lost.

1359
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:07,720
JANEYEH: NAMNUNG and

1360
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,680
JANEYEH: TIME are gone.

1361
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,440
JOY: Should we go talk?

1362
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:16,920
SUNNY: Sure.

1363
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

1364
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,280
JANEYEH: Let's go.

1365
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,240
CRIS: Let's do it.

1366
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,680
TIMETHAI: They gotta push through.
It's the last day.

1367
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,520
JOY: Normally, I never talk to you.
just in case we won't have the chance to chat anymore.

1368
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,440
SUNNY: Oh, okay.

1369
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,240
TIMETHAI: Gotta push through.

1370
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,600
JANEYEH: Let's do it.

1371
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,320
(Silent)
JANEYEH: Hmm?

1372
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:42,944
(Smile)

1373
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,920
(Tapping foot)
JANEYEH: Oh, I hope JOY has hope.

1374
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:53,344
(Look carefully)

1375
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,080
SUNNY: Hey, are you sad?

1376
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,920
JOY: No, like...

1377
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,056
JOY: Soon we won't meet again.

1378
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:09,960
JOY: Yes.

1379
01:12:11,648 --> 01:12:13,824
(Look down)

1380
01:12:15,104 --> 01:12:17,120
JOY: I'm someone who doesn't
really dare to say much.

1381
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,392
JOY: Seeing you happy
makes me happy too.

1382
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,320
SUNNY: Thank you.

1383
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,760
JOY: Because at first, I talked to TIME.

1384
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,960
JOY: He asked if I liked you.

1385
01:12:31,456 --> 01:12:32,200
JOY: I said yes.

1386
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,840
JOY: TIME said he likes you too.

1387
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,720
JOY: Same feeling.

1388
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,480
JOY: But it's okay, it's fine to court.
I said okay then.

1389
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,720
JOY: I said he could go all in with you.

1390
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,200
JOY: I'll keep watching, you know?

1391
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,600
JANEYEH: Oh, JOY backed off like that?

1392
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,800
RUSAMEEKAE: It's a feeling of delight
for SUNNY as long as she is happy.

1393
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,200
SUNNY: Did you know
I like women more than men?

1394
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

1395
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,200
SUNNY: At first, I found you pretty.

1396
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,320
SUNNY: But the other fought for me,
so I was like, okay.

1397
01:13:02,656 --> 01:13:04,672
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, there's
so much misunderstanding.

1398
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,960
SUNNY: If you like someone,
why don't you try harder?

1399
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

1400
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,560
JANEYEH: It's true,
like JOY rarely makes a move.

1401
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,280
JOY: I'm someone
who doesn't really dare to flirt.

1402
01:13:17,216 --> 01:13:19,040
JOY: Just asking how things are going
is hard for me.

1403
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,400
SUNNY: Really?

1404
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,920
- SUNNY: I saw you talk a lot. I thought you'd be bolder.
- JOY: Yes.

1405
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,760
JOY: I'm talkative with people
I don't think of romantically, like friends.

1406
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,960
JOY: Yes.

1407
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,960
JOY: Also, at first,
I thought you liked men.

1408
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,800
JOY: So I didn't know,
you understand? I thought...

1409
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,280
JOY: If you like men, I lose.

1410
01:13:45,024 --> 01:13:46,320
JOY: I really lose, yes.

1411
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,640
RUSAMEEKAE: And you just say it now?

1412
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,800
JANEYEH: Really, the last day, JOY.

1413
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,520
JOY: So...

1414
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,880
JOY: I always overthink, wondering if
you want a future and stability.

1415
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,160
JOY: Because women
can actually provide it, but...

1416
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,760
JOY: At that time,
I thought you were probably like...

1417
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1418
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,440
JOY: You are interested in TIME.
So I wouldn't dare to approach.

1419
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1420
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,800
JANEYEH: Why?

1421
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,320
RUSAMEEKAE: She means if SUNNY likes men,
she will lose like that.

1422
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Look at her choice of words.

1423
01:14:36,192 --> 01:14:37,056
SUNNY: It's okay.

1424
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,360
RUSAMEEKAE: This is another feeling
of insecurity among those who are gender diverse.

1425
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,360
JOY: Sorry I didn't say it sooner.

1426
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:50,960
SUNNY: It's okay.

1427
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,720
SUNNY: Sorry,
I wasn't very smart either.

1428
01:15:04,992 --> 01:15:07,200
RUSAMEEKAE: But it's good
that JOY managed to say it.

1429
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Finally! It is the last day.

1430
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:15,920
JOY: In this life, I feel like if I were
to marry someone, it would probably be a woman.

1431
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,400
JOY: Kids can be done medically.

1432
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, very clear-cut.

1433
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,584
(Look)

1434
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,200
JOY: But it would be great
if it were you.

1435
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,440
JANEYEH: Oh my God.

1436
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:28,960
TIMETHAI: Oh.

1437
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,200
JOY: But it would be great
if it were you.

1438
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:33,800
JOY: Was that cheesy?

1439
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,640
SUNNY: That's cheesy, but I like it.

1440
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,888
(Hug)

1441
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,000
JOY: You've already chosen someone.

1442
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:56,200
JOY: I don't regret it.
I'm happy for you.

1443
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,800
JOY: It's the kind of love that wishes
happiness for the ones we love

1444
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,160
JOY: and who are perfect for each other.

1445
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,400
JOY: It's not about giving up,
but realizing that love...

1446
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,400
JOY: can't be one-sided.

1447
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,680
JANEYEH: Oh.

1448
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,280
JANEYEH: JOY is really mature.

1449
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,560
JOY: If I had another chance to talk to you,
I wouldn't let it slip away again.

1450
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, JOY.

1451
01:16:26,752 --> 01:16:28,160
JOY: I'd use it well.

1452
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Beautiful.

1453
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,600
JANEYEH: It's kind of sad, isn't it?

1454
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,840
SUNNY: Can I have a hug?

1455
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,600
(Hug tightly)

1456
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,720
SUNNY: Thanks for telling me.

1457
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,000
(Tears flowing)
JOY: I feel I'd be sad if I didn't tell you.

1458
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, JOY.

1459
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,520
SUNNY: Don't cry.

1460
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,160
SUNNY: Don't cry, or I'll cry.

1461
01:17:03,648 --> 01:17:05,440
(Wipes tears)

1462
01:17:09,088 --> 01:17:10,560
(Wipes)

1463
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,040
JOY: I feel sorry
for not telling you sooner.

1464
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,240
SUNNY: Sometimes, it's okay
to be a little selfish, you know.

1465
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,240
RUSAMEEKAE: See?

1466
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,880
RUSAMEEKAE:
It's okay to be a bit selfish.

1467
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,640
TIMETHAI: Both mature women.

1468
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,640
CRIS: It's a universe of sexuality.

1469
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,200
CRIS: However anyone is,
whatever they like.

1470
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,880
CRIS: Everything is about timing.

1471
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,400
CRIS: Regardless of age,
gender, or preferences.

1472
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,840
JANEYEH: True, it's timing.

1473
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,000
JANEYEH: It's very important.

1474
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,360
RUSAMEEKAE: The one thing money
can't buy back is time.

1475
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,008
JANEYEH: But I really like
what SUNNY said.

1476
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,768
JANEYEH: That it's okay
to be selfish sometimes.

1477
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,488
JANEYEH: That's good, it's true,
sometimes we should be a bit selfish.

1478
01:17:51,552 --> 01:17:55,440
RUSAMEEKAE: You can shout out what you like,
what you want to do, who you like.

1479
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Looking at JOY today,
it feels like...

1480
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,520
RUSAMEEKAE: I totally understand
the feeling of secretly liking someone.

1481
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Whether it's a guy
or something else.

1482
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,760
RUSAMEEKAE: We don't dare to speak up.

1483
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,120
RUSAMEEKAE: So, I want to support JOY.

1484
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,040
RUSAMEEKAE: I want JOY to be confident
that love between women

1485
01:18:11,072 --> 01:18:13,040
RUSAMEEKAE: or any kind of love,

1486
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,120
RUSAMEEKAE: as long as we're sincere
and dedicated,

1487
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,800
RUSAMEEKAE: it will always be
a good form of love.

1488
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,640
RUSAMEEKAE: And for today,
do you feel the same?

1489
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,000
RUSAMEEKAE: It feels that JOY has won.

1490
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,320
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY didn't lose.

1491
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,040
JANEYEH: Absolutely.

1492
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,600
TIMETHAI: At least she said it.

1493
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

1494
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,240
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY has won her own heart.

1495
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's give JOY
a round of applause, everyone.

1496
01:18:37,248 --> 01:18:43,440
(Now everyone, please head
to the THAI VILLA for the final meal.)

1497
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,600
(Last dinner)

1498
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Ten days together
have created bonds.

1499
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,320
CRIS: They've had every meal together.

1500
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,600
JANEYEH: It's kind of sad
that it's ending soon.

1501
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,720
- CRIS: True
- JANEYEH: If it were me, I'd feel heartbroken.

1502
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,040
CRIS: They're walking together,
this pair's so cute.

1503
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:06,560
NAMNUNG: Oh, sushi.

1504
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:13,792
(Sits opposite to SUNNY)

1505
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,200
CRIS: TOD, aren't you
sitting next to KONG?

1506
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,760
RUSAMEEKAE: No,
but he's sitting next to MILL.

1507
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1508
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,800
CRIS: What's KONG blushing about?

1509
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,440
CRIS: What's KONG blushing about?

1510
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,240
JANEYEH: He's very obvious.

1511
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:38,272
(Look)

1512
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,240
CRIS: Oh, they're looking
at each other again.

1513
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,120
RUSAMEEKAE: The same table
where they met on the first day.

1514
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,320
CRIS: What's up with this pair?

1515
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Could it be that TOD
is opening his heart?
