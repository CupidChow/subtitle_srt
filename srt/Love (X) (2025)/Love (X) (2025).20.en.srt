(This program is intended for mature audiences.
It may feature explicit content, violence, and strong language.)

2
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Hello, viewers.

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Welcome to a brand new
love reality show from Thailand,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,408
RUSAMEEKAE: Borderless Love,
LOVE(X). Dum, dum.

5
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:50,624
RUSAMEEKAE: The last episode.

6
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:53,344
TIMETHAI: The last episode. There won't be
our program on WeTV anymore?

7
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:53,792
JANEYEH: True.

8
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,136
RUSAMEEKAE: There won't be any.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,032
JANEYEH: There won't be any.

10
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
TIMETHAI: Oh, no.

11
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:58,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Except for one thing,
you know?

12
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,200
RUSAMEEKAE: There will be a Season 2.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,128
CRIS: Hey, there has to be one!
It's too much fun, there has to be.

14
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:04,688
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

15
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,944
(RUSAMEEKAE, LOVE(X)PERT)
CRIS: They're going to confess their love.

16
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:08,448
(CRIS, LOVE(X)PERT)
CRIS: We saw in the teaser last time.

17
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:11,928
RUSAMEEKAE: We'll witness
the final confession of love.

18
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,008
(Final confession of love)

19
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,808
RUSAMEEKAE: Everyone gets just
one chance to confess their love.

20
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:19,578
RUSAMEEKAE: If the confession succeeds,

21
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:23,648
(JANEYEH, LOVE(X)PERT)
RUSAMEEKAE: the pair held hands and left the show together.

22
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,746
(TIMETHAI, LOVE(X)PERT)
RUSAMEEKAE: But if the confession fails,

23
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:30,368
RUSAMEEKAE: they must turn away
and walk out alone.

24
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:31,872
CRIS: Does that mean they have to
leave the show?

25
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:32,512
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, leave the show.

26
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:33,368
JANEYEH: Just walk away.

27
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:36,768
RUSAMEEKAE: Let me go first.
I'm rooting for ASSE and CHERRY.

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,648
RUSAMEEKAE: And for the JUNSU
and FRAME pair too.

29
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:42,368
CRIS: Duh! No matter what,
it's like hitting a sitting duck.

30
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:43,904
TIMETHAI: For this,
there's no need to choose.

31
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:46,912
CRIS: That's such a safe bet.
That doesn't count!

32
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:50,784
RUSAMEEKAE: There must be... Well,
there must be other matches out there.

33
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:52,704
RUSAMEEKAE: Do you have anything
in mind, CRIS?

34
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,288
CRIS: SUNNY and NAMNUNG then.

35
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:56,768
TIMETHAI: It feels like
they're starting a bit late.

36
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:59,088
TIMETHAI: The chemistry between TIME
and SUNNY seems stronger.

37
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:00,128
RUSAMEEKAE: JANEYEH.

38
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:01,088
JANEYEH: TOD and TIME.

39
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:02,568
TIMETHAI: Oh.

40
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:04,048
CRIS: Right?

41
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:06,728
RUSAMEEKAE: Whether right or wrong,
we'll find out. Let's see

42
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:09,768
RUSAMEEKAE: who's the master predictor
out of the four of us.

43
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,368
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's begin
the confession ceremony.

44
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:26,688
RUSAMEEKAE: All 12 candidates
will stand in their designated X booths.

45
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:31,616
RUSAMEEKAE: The X stands for the sexual
orientation they've bravely revealed.

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,368
(Confession Day)
JANEYEH: Wow.

47
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,008
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, goosebumps.

48
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:40,192
CRIS: Oh, so beautiful.

49
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:44,320
RUSAMEEKAE: All are so beautiful
and handsome.

50
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,808
JANEYEH: Everyone's stunning today.

51
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:47,768
JANEYEH: Oh.

52
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:53,848
MILL: I'm well-prepared. Will they
respond to my confession?

53
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,088
MILL: I'm feeling very nervous.

54
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:58,368
RUSAMEEKAE: Best of luck to everyone.

55
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,288
CRIS: Truly, best of luck to everyone.

56
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:02,528
JANEYEH: Oh.

57
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:03,848
JANEYEH: Oh my god.

58
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,360
NAMNUNG: Right now,
my feelings are so complex.

59
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,048
NAMNUNG: But the decision has been made.

60
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,848
SUNNY: Very nervous, but excited too.

61
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:23,808
TIME: At this moment, the answer
in my heart is very clear.

62
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:25,128
JANEYEH: He's clear now.

63
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:26,928
JANEYEH: Keep fighting, little one.

64
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:28,848
CRIS: TOD.

65
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:29,568
JANEYEH: TOD, go for it.

66
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,328
TOD: On the final day
when we must confess,

67
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,648
TOD: we truly have to confront
our own feelings.

68
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,688
TOD: And say what we most want to say.

69
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:42,624
ASSE: I hope this confession goes well.

70
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:46,248
FRAME: We share the same thought,
or something like that.

71
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:54,368
RUSAMEEKAE: Here we go.

72
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:56,096
CRIS: Oh.

73
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,304
RUSAMEEKAE: Who's the first on stage?

74
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:02,848
RUSAMEEKAE: Please.

75
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:03,552
CRIS: Please.

76
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:04,160
JANEYEH: Hey!

77
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:07,568
(Welcome CHERRY
onto the confession stage.)

78
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:11,088
- CRIS: See? This rigged pair goes first.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Okay.

79
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:20,808
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

80
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:22,288
JANEYEH: That outfit is great.

81
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,624
RUSAMEEKAE: CHERRY is gorgeous
every day. I give up.

82
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:27,768
CRIS: So beautiful.

83
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,568
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

84
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:31,328
JANEYEH: Oh, so beautiful.

85
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:35,728
CRIS: Her figure, oh my god.

86
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:37,168
JANEYEH: She walks with such confidence.

87
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,448
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, truly beautiful.

88
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:55,248
(The final confession for CHERRY)
CRIS: The final confession.

89
00:04:55,968 --> 00:05:00,248
(Anyone who wants to confess to CHERRY,
come out of the door.)

90
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:02,288
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

91
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,536
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, will I guess correctly
that it's ASSE?

92
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:12,848
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

93
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:35,528
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, ASSE is so handsome.

94
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:39,232
CHERRY: He opens the door,

95
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:42,608
CHERRY: and is exactly who I hoped for.
One hundred percent sure.

96
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,808
CHERRY: Really him.

97
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,168
(Making eye contact)

98
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:46,848
RUSAMEEKAE: These two might not need
to say anything.

99
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,064
JANEYEH: No need for more confession.

100
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,328
(Shy)
CRIS: Oh my god, he's so cute with her.

101
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:01,408
TIMETHAI: Just get married now.

102
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,248
CRIS: They can just get married now.

103
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:05,488
JANEYEH: Is your heart pounding?

104
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:06,928
CRIS: Heart pounding, so cute.

105
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:11,808
ASSE: Oh, there's a bug.

106
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,208
RUSAMEEKAE: It has to be like this,
that's ASSE.

107
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:18,048
CRIS: So adorable.

108
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,448
RUSAMEEKAE: Insects are
the helpers, you know.

109
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,184
CHERRY: Am I beautiful today?

110
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:31,528
ASSE: Very beautiful.

111
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:35,008
(Happy)
ASSE: I like this one.

112
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:36,209
CHERRY: This clip, right?

113
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:37,248
ASSE: Beautiful.

114
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:42,304
RUSAMEEKAE: And he's like... "beautiful".

115
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,320
CRIS: So cute.

116
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,088
TIMETHAI: Don't be nervous.

117
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:53,208
CRIS: Hurry up, ASSE.

118
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:55,072
ASSE: Well...

119
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:57,888
ASSE: From the first day

120
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:01,728
(Approaching)
ASSE: until today, we get to know each other.

121
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,768
ASSE: I feel so...

122
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,568
ASSE: comfortable being
with you, CHERRY.

123
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:09,504
JANEYEH: So cute.

124
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:11,568
ASSE: And it feels like I can be myself.

125
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:13,608
ASSE: And it's like a comfort zone.

126
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:14,408
RUSAMEEKAE: Aww.

127
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:15,848
CRIS: I can't take it anymore.

128
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:17,488
CHERRY: Let's hold hands first.

129
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:18,648
TIMETHAI: Whoa.

130
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,968
ASSE: Back then, we held hands
and stayed close.

131
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:30,784
ASSE: I feel this is the person
I can talk to and be interested in.

132
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:37,184
ASSE: I'm sure now.

133
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:38,488
ASSE: You're the right one.

134
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,608
RUSAMEEKAE: He's sure that CHERRY
is the right one.

135
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:41,688
JANEYEH: Right one.

136
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:45,768
CRIS: See? In every game they play,
whether they win or lose doesn't matter.

137
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,088
ASSE: I'd like to invite you
for a special date one day.

138
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,568
JANEYEH: This is really cute.

139
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:54,128
TIMETHAI: Yeah.

140
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,568
CHERRY: Will you take me... to Sweden?

141
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:58,768
ASSE: Sure, sure.

142
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:05,312
ASSE: Sweden is so beautiful, and I want
to take a special one to a special place.

143
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:06,888
JANEYEH: So cute.

144
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:08,848
CHERRY: Oh, fireworks.

145
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,368
ASSE: This is the perfect date.

146
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:19,048
CRIS: Aw, so very cute.

147
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,728
JANEYEH: It feels like we're
at their wedding now.

148
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,568
JANEYEH: And we're really
happy for them.

149
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,920
ASSE: Glad to be with you

150
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:31,424
ASSE: these past 12 days,
and I'd like to keep

151
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:32,848
ASSE: it going.

152
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,160
ASSE: I feel great.

153
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:38,888
JANEYEH: So cute.

154
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:40,488
JANEYEH: What?

155
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:41,792
ASSE: Yes.

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,048
CHERRY: I can tell he's very shy.

157
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:49,368
CHERRY: He's shy, and
when he's shy, he smiles.

158
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:51,568
CRIS: So cute.

159
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:58,288
CRIS: Not very good at Thai but always
says 'Krub.' That's so cute.

160
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:06,528
(ASSE, please return
to stand at the door?)

161
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:07,448
CHERRY: Yes.

162
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:10,568
ASSE: See you.

163
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:12,088
CRIS: See you then.

164
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,968
CRIS: Are Swedish people
usually this polite?

165
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,392
RUSAMEEKAE: Judging from me.

166
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,968
(And CHERRY, please give a response
to the one confessing to you.)

167
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:23,968
(Moment of responding to the confession)

168
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,768
RUSAMEEKAE: And he has to wait for
her answer, whether she accepts or not.

169
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,088
RUSAMEEKAE: CHERRY, dear?

170
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,288
JANEYEH: Go for it.

171
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:06,880
CRIS: Aww.

172
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,392
(Smiles)

173
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,112
CHERRY: I want to say that I feel...

174
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:16,848
CRIS: Aww.

175
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:18,944
CHERRY: Well,

176
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,368
CHERRY: I fall for you
from the very first day.

177
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:23,200
CRIS: From the first day.

178
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,728
CHERRY: Never felt a change,
it's just like...

179
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:31,968
CHERRY: From the first day until today,
for all 12 days, I've only liked you.

180
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,128
CRIS: Awww.

181
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:39,328
CHERRY: Yes, and I think I'd like to
go out and learn and then

182
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:47,608
CHERRY: learn more about each other so
we can enjoy together out in the world.

183
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:50,928
CRIS: So cute.

184
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,208
ASSE: Yes.

185
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:54,464
CHERRY: Feels so shy.

186
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:55,296
ASSE: Same here.

187
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,288
CRIS: Same here.

188
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:57,776
ASSE: Hug.

189
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:58,752
CHERRY: Okay.

190
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,528
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow.

191
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,616
LOVE(X)PERT: So cute.

192
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:12,008
CHERRY: After this, we'll be living
our lives together on the outside.

193
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,112
CHERRY: First, maybe plan a meal
and see a movie.

194
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:18,048
CHERRY: Starting to live together
in real life.

195
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:26,336
ASSE: Her eyes look like she's shy.

196
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:31,608
ASSE: She's like a kid falling in love
with someone for the first time.

197
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:36,488
JUNSU: Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

198
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:38,112
JUNSU: Kiss.

199
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,968
RUSAMEEKAE: Aww, JUNSU.

200
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,208
CRIS: JUNSU again.

201
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:42,304
JUNSU: Kiss.

202
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:44,672
JUNSU: Kiss.

203
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:55,688
JANEYEH: Aw, so cute.

204
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,848
CRIS: Congratulations.

205
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:02,544
CHERRY: Okay, okay.

206
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:04,688
TIMETHAI: This is so sweet.

207
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:06,288
JANEYEH: Sweet, really sweet.

208
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:11,568
RUSAMEEKAE: Very wedding-like.

209
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:13,762
CRIS: Very wedding-like.

210
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:14,842
ASSE: Shy.

211
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:15,802
CHERRY: You feel shy too.

212
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:16,698
ASSE: Yes.

213
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,424
ASSE: The atmosphere is nice, isn't it?

214
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:20,000
CHERRY: Yes.

215
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:23,138
JANEYEH: Congratulations.

216
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:24,538
JANEYEH: Invite me to the wedding too.

217
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:28,458
CRIS: So cute.

218
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,578
JANEYEH: Cute.

219
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,362
CRIS: Oh, I'm so happy for this couple.

220
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:42,042
CRIS: From the first day that
we saw CHERRY with ASSE,

221
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,578
CRIS: we've all been saying all along

222
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:46,018
CRIS: that no one should come
between them.

223
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:47,658
TIMETHAI: And indeed,
there hasn't been any.

224
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:48,474
CRIS: There hasn't been any.

225
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,834
RUSAMEEKAE: You could say this couple
isn't flashy but they're solid.

226
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,522
RUSAMEEKAE: Certainly, we've seen
surprising moments and their cuteness.

227
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,666
RUSAMEEKAE: It's rare
to see ASSE like this.

228
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:00,698
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, so blushing
but he has to say what's called...

229
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,258
JANEYEH: Confessing love.

230
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:05,466
RUSAMEEKAE: his true feelings, and
we hope their life in reality continues.

231
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:08,762
RUSAMEEKAE: One day we might see ASSE
and CHERRY, something like that,

232
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:10,498
- CRIS: Really like it.
- RUSAMEEKAE: being together outside.

233
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,058
CRIS: This is so much like
a princess and prince.

234
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:17,378
CRIS: Wishing both of them to go
together on a very happy journey.

235
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:19,258
CRIS: And may they be
this sweet forever.

236
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:20,498
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

237
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:22,058
RUSAMEEKAE: One relieved couple.

238
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,072
CRIS: Relieved couple.

239
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:24,978
CRIS: There's still a lot
to think about.

240
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:25,458
RUSAMEEKAE: A lot, indeed.

241
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,378
RUSAMEEKAE: So then, dear viewers,

242
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:29,498
RUSAMEEKAE: let's watch the next pair

243
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:32,098
RUSAMEEKAE: to see who will go up
to confess their love.

244
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:36,058
(Please welcome TOD
onto the confession stage.)

245
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,338
CRIS: TOD!

246
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,042
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

247
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:38,714
JANEYEH: TOD now?

248
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:39,674
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD now?

249
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:41,818
(Deep breath)

250
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,178
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, he looks handsome today.

251
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,178
CRIS: TOD is handsome.

252
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:50,106
JANEYEH: This color suits him.

253
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:50,978
CRIS: Yes.

254
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:55,658
TIMETHAI: Here we go.

255
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:11,138
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, so exciting.

256
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:14,010
CRIS: TOD is standing on the stage,
who will come out.

257
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,778
CRIS: MILL will, who else?

258
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:16,698
- JANEYEH: KONG.
- CRIS: KONG.

259
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:17,378
JANEYEH: TIME.

260
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:28,634
JANEYEH: TIME.

261
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:30,138
CRIS: KONG, MILL.

262
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:31,658
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG, MILL, same here.

263
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:35,658
RUSAMEEKAE: Who opens up?

264
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,178
(Looks)
TIMETHAI: Oh, oh.

265
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:40,738
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

266
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:44,346
RUSAMEEKAE: Whoa.

267
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:45,658
JANEYEH: KONG will choose him.

268
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:46,586
JANEYEH: This is predictable.

269
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,658
CRIS: Predictable.

270
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,938
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my god.

271
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,378
JANEYEH: Hang in there.

272
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,738
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, someone else is coming.

273
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,258
- RUSAMEEKAE: Who?
- CRIS: Who?

274
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:04,122
CRIS: TIME?

275
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:05,298
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah.

276
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:07,482
CRIS: Oh.

277
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:08,666
CRIS: Oh, MILL.

278
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,770
TIMETHAI: Oh my god.

279
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:14,018
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

280
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:14,898
CRIS: Oh.

281
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,298
JANEYEH: Gonna go crazy.

282
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:25,098
TIMETHAI: Even we're stressed
just watching this. Imagine being him.

283
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,098
CRIS: Stressed, yeah.

284
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:39,738
CRIS: Oh, TIME's door isn't open.

285
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:41,098
CRIS: TIME's door isn't open.

286
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,378
CRIS: Oh, TOD is looking at it.

287
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:47,538
CRIS: Is TIME opening?

288
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,698
TIMETHAI: TOD is clear.

289
00:15:57,114 --> 00:16:00,058
CRIS: Oh, MILL.

290
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,434
CRIS: Oh.

291
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:06,234
TIMETHAI: Oh, wow.

292
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:07,258
JANEYEH: Oh.

293
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,490
CRIS: Oh, TOD.

294
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:24,058
(Holds hands)
JANEYEH: Oh.

295
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:27,450
RUSAMEEKAE: It's okay, KONGPOP,
hang in there.

296
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:28,898
JANEYEH: Hang in there.

297
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:34,906
(Shy)
CRIS: TOD says "wow" again.

298
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:36,338
CRIS: Hang tight, everyone.

299
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:42,906
MILL: Uh.

300
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:44,178
JANEYEH: I'm stressed.

301
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,178
MILL: I might never have said it,

302
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:54,522
MILL: but actually, since coming here,
the first impression was you, TOD.

303
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:55,658
JANEYEH: Oh.

304
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:56,138
TIMETHAI: Wow.

305
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,978
MILL: Like when you reached
down your hand,

306
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,210
TOD: Oh.

307
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,578
- MILL: helping me up the stairs. Yes.
- TOD: Oh.

308
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:03,338
TOD: Really?

309
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:03,930
MILL: Yes, yes.

310
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,058
TOD: Thank you.

311
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,290
CRIS: Just like that from the first day.

312
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,576
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD is like a microwave.

313
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,570
MILL: And then,

314
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,818
MILL: like I told you, I feel like

315
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,570
MILL: I can't easily open up
to just anyone.

316
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:25,578
MILL: But if it's you,

317
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:26,858
MILL: yeah, it's easy.

318
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:32,634
(When it's you, it's easy to open up)

319
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,418
TOD: Come on.

320
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:36,298
MILL: Thank you.

321
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:36,858
TOD: Sure.

322
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:39,418
JANEYEH: Oh, that was the first day.

323
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,898
TOD: I'm very satisfied
with MILL's answer.

324
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,578
TOD: Then I'll drink myself.

325
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:47,138
RUSAMEEKAE: And the day they asked
questions had an impact.

326
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:48,898
TOD: I wish you find someone better.

327
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:50,618
MILL: Thanks.

328
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:51,858
CRIS: It's you.

329
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:54,778
RUSAMEEKAE: From someone who was hurt
to being cared for.

330
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:57,298
TOD: MILL... let's go on a date.

331
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:58,554
MILL: Uh-huh.

332
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:08,658
CRIS: "MILL, let's go on a date."

333
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,898
CRIS: MILL is cute, right?
She has dimples.

334
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:11,680
TIMETHAI: Hmm.

335
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,072
MILL: And...

336
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:18,496
MILL: I don't know what will happen
from now on, but

337
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:21,786
MILL: the feeling
that's happening now is like...

338
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:24,346
MILL: It's truly from my heart.

339
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:25,786
MILL: I'm happy.

340
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:27,994
CRIS: Very good.

341
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,098
RUSAMEEKAE: Very good, MILL.

342
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:33,088
CRIS: Whether he'll choose you or not,
being honest with yourself is the bravest.

343
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,136
MILL: Nice to meet you.

344
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:43,930
(Nice to meet you)

345
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:46,016
(Shake)

346
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,538
MILL: Nice to meet you.

347
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:50,586
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

348
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,098
(Repeat softly)
CRIS: Nice to meet you.

349
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,202
CRIS: This is quite a lot
for MILL already.

350
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:55,018
JANEYEH: Yes.

351
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:05,378
CRIS: Anyway, KONG has to keep fighting.

352
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:10,906
TOD: Okay. Keep it up.

353
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:18,578
CRIS: No one wants
to make anyone sad, right?

354
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:19,858
TIMETHAI: Yes.

355
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:21,210
CRIS: Sigh.

356
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,130
RUSAMEEKAE: It feels like there's
a lump in my throat right now.

357
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,258
JANEYEH: Yes, it feels like
I'm about to suffocate.

358
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:26,778
JANEYEH: Can I get some oxygen?

359
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,322
RUSAMEEKAE: Go ahead.

360
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:32,658
RUSAMEEKAE: Just say it.

361
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:34,058
RUSAMEEKAE: There's nothing to lose.

362
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,858
CRIS: KONG is here now.

363
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,218
JANEYEH: Keep going!

364
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:48,098
(smile)
TOD: Wow.

365
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:48,826
JANEYEH: Another wow.

366
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:49,632
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow again.

367
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:50,528
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

368
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:51,392
JANEYEH: Wonderful.

369
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:52,000
CRIS: KONG.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,768
(Hold)

371
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,410
TOD: Wow.

372
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:00,314
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, my God!

373
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:01,578
JANEYEH: MILL.

374
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:07,698
CRIS: Come on.

375
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,306
(Sigh)

376
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,858
JANEYEH: TOD is really cute.

377
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,370
(Clutching hands tightly)

378
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:21,938
KONG: I want to tell you
that since the first day we met,

379
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,058
KONG: I've always told myself that...

380
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,578
JANEYEH: Oh.

381
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:29,978
KONG: It's the initial feeling
that I wanted to know you better,

382
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,314
KONG: and wanted to know you even more.

383
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:34,138
(Want to be closer to you,
want to know you more)

384
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:37,458
CRIS: He got hit hard
by TOD on the first day.

385
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:45,778
KONG: I think that
if you were in my life,

386
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:49,210
KONG: it would be special.

387
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:50,778
CRIS: Cute.

388
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:56,658
KONG: Have you been
in every important moment of my life.

389
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:59,418
KONG: Until today,

390
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:02,330
KONG: my first feeling

391
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,834
KONG: is still you, TOD.

392
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,378
(The first feeling is still TOD)

393
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:06,898
CRIS: KONG is cute, you know.

394
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,298
RUSAMEEKAE: They didn't know
each other before and then sparked here.

395
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,018
JANEYEH: It's like love at first sight.

396
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,946
- JANEYEH: Oh. The camera angle.
- CRIS: The frame.

397
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:30,624
JANEYEH: Oh.

398
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:37,722
KONG: And thank you, TOD,

399
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:42,058
KONG: for always taking care
of me all along.

400
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:48,698
KONG: Whatever the result is today,
or however you decide,

401
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:54,298
KONG: I accept your decision.

402
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:55,698
(Whatever the outcome is,
KONG will accept) CRIS: Oh.

403
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:58,338
RUSAMEEKAE: That's right.
It has to be like that.

404
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:01,568
RUSAMEEKAE: Very strong.
Accepting the truth. Accepting the pain.

405
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
CRIS: But I'm not strong at all.
My tears are about to flow.

406
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,416
JANEYEH: Yes, me too.

407
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:10,858
TOD: Wow.

408
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:13,938
TOD: Hello.

409
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:16,458
KONG: Hello.

410
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:17,898
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

411
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:19,802
JOY: Kiss.

412
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:20,954
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

413
00:22:20,954 --> 00:22:22,338
CRIS: Wow.

414
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:26,842
TIMETHAI: Wow.

415
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,320
TOD: Do you want some?

416
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:29,984
KONG: Thank you.

417
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:31,258
TOD: Just a bit sweet.

418
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,186
JANEYEH: Oh, wow.
That's a lot of moments!

419
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:38,218
CRIS: This couple
sure has a lot of moments.

420
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:53,778
TOD: I can feel
all the feelings you have for me.

421
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:55,298
CRIS: Oh.

422
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:57,786
TOD: Thank you.

423
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,458
CRIS: Thank you.

424
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:01,458
KONG: Thank you.

425
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:07,298
JANEYEH: Oh, TOD is so cute.

426
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:08,378
CRIS: TOD is so cute.

427
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:09,738
TIMETHAI: Mr. Microwave.

428
00:23:09,738 --> 00:23:10,202
JANEYEH: Truly Mr. Microwave.

429
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,514
CRIS: Mr. Microwave.

430
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:14,746
JANEYEH: I'm stressed out now.

431
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:18,098
TOD: When MILL and KONG
confessed their love to me,

432
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:21,578
TOD: I felt their sincerity,

433
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,178
TOD: and the good feelings
they both have towards him.

434
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,098
TOD: I am so happy and touched
that they feel good about me.

435
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:32,154
TOD: But I already have an answer.

436
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:33,082
JANEYEH: Oh.

437
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:33,888
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, my God.

438
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:44,282
CRIS: TOD goes to seek answers first.

439
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,410
CRIS: Is he going back into his box?

440
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,402
RUSAMEEKAE: Or back to the room?

441
00:23:57,082 --> 00:23:57,850
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

442
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,778
CRIS: Who?

443
00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:02,498
RUSAMEEKAE: Hopefully,
there won't be any twists.

444
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:03,610
(Walks to KONG)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

445
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,378
TIMETHAI: Oh.

446
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:13,114
TIMETHAI: Oh.

447
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:14,362
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes or no?

448
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,298
JANEYEH: Oh, the show's so harsh.

449
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,384
CRIS: Even though he walks there,
you're still unsure what he'll say.

450
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:20,858
TIMETHAI: Yes.

451
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:21,858
CRIS: Hmm.

452
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:24,058
JANEYEH: I want to hear this.

453
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:25,658
RUSAMEEKAE: Because everyone
wants to hear the answer.

454
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:34,106
TOD: Thanks

455
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,538
TOD: for choosing me from the first day.

456
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:37,210
TOD: You said that

457
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:39,322
TOD: until today, you still choose me.

458
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:43,802
TOD: I want to tell you that...

459
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:50,042
TOD: I have good feelings for you too.

460
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:50,938
(TOD has good feelings for KONG too)
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah?

461
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:52,090
CRIS: No! Wait!

462
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:53,946
TIMETHAI: What? No.

463
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:59,226
TOD: I wanted to get to know you more.

464
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,618
TOD: I wanted to know you better.

465
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:03,386
CRIS: TOD, come on.

466
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,498
CRIS: Oh, TOD! Oh, no.

467
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,282
- JANEYEH: And then what?
- CRIS: Really?

468
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,290
TOD: But...

469
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,050
CRIS: But again.

470
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,018
TOD: There was not enough time
for us to know each other well.

471
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:22,330
TOD: I need to apologize to you

472
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:24,890
TOD: for not choosing you today.

473
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:27,834
(TOD rejects KONG)

474
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:28,506
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, my God.

475
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,794
TIMETHAI: But his answer was good.

476
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:33,498
JANEYEH: He's good.

477
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,746
CRIS: As good as he can get.

478
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:35,578
JANEYEH: True.

479
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,114
TIMETHAI: Yes.
He didn't have enough time.

480
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:41,938
TOD: We can still know each other outside.

481
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:43,226
TOD: You can always reach out to me.

482
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,626
TOD: You can call me.

483
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,482
TOD: And follow me too.

484
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:50,202
TOD: I will follow you as well.

485
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:52,730
JANEYEH: Oh, cute.

486
00:25:58,234 --> 00:25:59,610
TOD: You're not mad at me, right?

487
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:03,298
- JANEYEH: Oh, TOD.
- CRIS: Mr. Microwave.

488
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:04,698
KONG: I'm not mad.

489
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,474
KONG: I understand
what you're trying to say.

490
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:10,874
KONG: I accept your decision.

491
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:12,890
RUSAMEEKAE: He already knows it.

492
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,898
TOD: Thank you so much.

493
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:21,298
KONG: Thank you as well.

494
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:26,218
RUSAMEEKAE: Saying yes is easy.
Saying no is harder.

495
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,658
CRIS: But KONG is cute.

496
00:26:28,506 --> 00:26:29,274
TOD: Okay.

497
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,738
KONG: Thank you.

498
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:32,378
KONG: Thank you.

499
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:35,546
JANEYEH: Ouch.

500
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:37,146
CRIS: My heart.

501
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,538
TIMETHAI: MILL.

502
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:51,898
- TOD: Thank you.
- KONG: Thank you.

503
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,578
CRIS: Ah. My heart. Bye-bye.

504
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,538
JANEYEH: He walked back alone.

505
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:12,218
KONG: The result isn't what I expected.

506
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:15,258
KONG: It's a relationship
where he's clearer with that person.

507
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:19,194
KONG: So he decided to choose
someone else. I understand him. Okay.

508
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:23,618
KONG: It's okay for this relationship.
You can make the decision.

509
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:25,818
KONG: And I respect your decision.

510
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:29,210
(Until today, feelings remain unchanged.
Whatever the result, I will accept the decision)

511
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:36,090
RUSAMEEKAE: Feelings remain unchanged.
Whatever the result, I will accept the decision.

512
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,018
JANEYEH: Oh.

513
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:42,522
CRIS: Give KONG a big hand.

514
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,234
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm so happy for KONG.

515
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:47,706
TIMETHAI: I think this hurts the least.

516
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:49,434
TIMETHAI: The least it could.

517
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,618
TIMETHAI: Otherwise, he'd hold onto this
for a long time before saying anything.

518
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:52,538
TIMETHAI: I don't know when.

519
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,850
RUSAMEEKAE: Please give
a message to KONG.

520
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,298
RUSAMEEKAE: Our world has a population

521
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,856
RUSAMEEKAE: of trillions,
countless people. KONG.

522
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,130
RUSAMEEKAE: Your day will come.

523
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe not in Thailand,
but somewhere else.

524
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,922
(Find true love soon) TIMETHAI:
Just go to the pier and take the boat back.

525
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:05,946
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's continue with MILL.

526
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:09,242
- CRIS: MILL. - RUSAMEEKAE:
There's still one person standing there.

527
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:13,338
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see
if TOD will say yes or no to MILL.

528
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,058
TIMETHAI: Oh. That's hard to answer.

529
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,362
TIMETHAI: It's hard to answer.

530
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:34,970
CRIS: It's unbearable. You know?

531
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:36,762
TOD: How are you?

532
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:38,650
MILL: I'm good.

533
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:44,698
TOD: I just realized too that

534
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,274
TOD: you were impressed
with me from the first day we met.

535
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,282
TOD: I never knew that before.

536
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,570
TOD: But upon hearing it today,

537
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:58,938
TOD: I'm happy.

538
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,602
RUSAMEEKAE: Going in a good direction?

539
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,282
TOD: Honestly, when you opened the door,

540
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,834
TOD: you were so slow. I was nervous.

541
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:12,602
TOD: "Will you feel good about me?"
"Will you be impressed with me?" Questions popped up.

542
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:13,050
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

543
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,362
TIMETHAI: It should be a yes.

544
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:16,602
JANEYEH: It should go to yes
if it's this way.

545
00:29:16,634 --> 00:29:22,978
TOD: And thank you
so much for seeing me.

546
00:29:25,594 --> 00:29:27,858
TOD: Really, thank you so much.
Thank you for...

547
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:29,778
TOD: Oh. Thank you for...

548
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,898
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD.

549
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,330
TOD: Thank you for choosing me.

550
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:38,586
TOD: Can I stay in your life?

551
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:39,162
MILL: Yes.

552
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:41,242
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

553
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:42,778
TIMETHAI: Here we go.

554
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,178
MILL: Thank you.

555
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,370
TOD: Today, I'm...

556
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:55,642
RUSAMEEKAE: Finish the conversation.

557
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:02,074
TOD: I'm sorry. I...

558
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,162
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

559
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:06,106
TOD: I haven't chosen you yet.

560
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:08,442
(TOD rejects MILL)
- TIMETHAI: Wow. - CRIS: Oh.

561
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:10,650
CRIS: Hey.

562
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:16,090
(TOD rejects MILL)

563
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:23,706

- MILL: I'm okay.

564

- TOD: Sorry.
- MILL: Why?

565
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,802
MILL: Don't cry.

566
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:30,650
- CRIS: TOD is crying. He doesn't want
to hurt anyone. - JANEYEH: Don't cry.

567
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:32,762
MILL: Don't cry. Why are you crying?

568
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,266
MILL: Don't cry.

569
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:39,178
TOD: I didn't want it to be like this.

570
00:30:39,258 --> 00:30:40,666
CRIS: TOD!

571
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:48,058
TOD: I don't want
to make you or anyone sad.

572
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:49,786
JANEYEH: Oh.

573
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:58,682
TOD: I think...

574
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:02,586
TOD: I think I must be honest
with my own feelings.

575
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:06,170
MILL: That's good.

576
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:11,226
TOD: I'm sorry. Thank you so much.

577
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:12,920
MILL: Hug.

578
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:20,122
CRIS: Oh, MILL.

579
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,066
JANEYEH: Oh, I don't like
watching things like this.

580
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:25,178
JANEYEH: I don't like
watching things like this.

581
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,098
MILL: Don't cry.

582
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,610
CRIS: Oh.

583
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:49,370
TOD: Don't cry.

584
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:53,178
CRIS: Mr. Microwave.

585
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,770
MILL: No, just feels like
it's the last night to be...

586
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,650
MILL: Hmm...

587
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,114
MILL: To talk with you
and stay with you here.

588
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:11,130
MILL: But in the end, we aren't staying.

589
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:14,426
MILL: So, I'm sad.

590
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:16,730
TOD: When we go outside,
we'll still talk.

591
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:19,770
TOD: Alright?

592
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:21,018
TOD: Okay?

593
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:22,778
JANEYEH: Wow.

594
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,170
TOD: Don't cry.

595
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:33,082
- JANEYEH: Oh.
- TIMETHAI: Oh.

596
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:38,394

597
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,250
JANEYEH: Oh, I adore her.

598
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,786
CRIS: I adore her too.

599
00:33:02,074 --> 00:33:06,458
MILL: I regret not saying
my feelings earlier.

600
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,752
MILL: It might not be successful,
but I feel like...

601
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:15,178
MILL: gaining another brother.

602
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,018
TIMETHAI: Because he didn't
have enough time.

603
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:18,970
RUSAMEEKAE: You came too late.

604
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,630
(Thanks for opening your heart
so sincerely. Hope in the journey ahead,)

605
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,706
(you'll let this courage lead you
to meet the person waiting for you)

606
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:25,050
JANEYEH: Oh.

607
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,362
CRIS: Let's give MILL
a round of applause.

608
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:28,474
(Applaud MILL's courage)
JANEYEH: You're amazing.

609
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,042
CRIS: Everyone is amazing.

610
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:32,378
RUSAMEEKAE: You're amazing.

611
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,786
RUSAMEEKAE: You're brave
to share your pain.

612
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:34,842
TIMETHAI: Brave enough to open up.

613
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:36,602
RUSAMEEKAE: In front of everyone.

614
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:40,090
RUSAMEEKAE: Say what you've been through.
Today, you're brave to open up.

615
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:46,074
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't be afraid to walk away.
You're brave to accept and not fear rejection.

616
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:48,024
TIMETHAI: But she said
she dared to open up because it's TOD.

617
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:48,538
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

618
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:50,074
RUSAMEEKAE: Do you understand the warmth

619
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:51,936
(Gentle)
RUSAMEEKAE: of TOD?

620
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,402
JANEYEH: He's really warm.

621
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:53,850
CRIS: Yes.

622
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,442
RUSAMEEKAE: He cares about MILL,
but his own feelings are important.

623
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:56,922
JANEYEH: Hmm.

624
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,714
RUSAMEEKAE: I told you
it's at a point where...

625
00:33:58,714 --> 00:33:59,514
CRIS: Clap.

626
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,232

627
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:01,434
- JANEYEH: Fabulous.
- TIMETHAI: So real.

628
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:02,458

00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,898
RUSAMEEKAE: It's okay, MILL.

630
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,306
TIMETHAI: Take her to see me sing.

631
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:05,946
RUSAMEEKAE: No.

632
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,178
RUSAMEEKAE: It's heavy on my heart now.

633
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:10,554
RUSAMEEKAE: Those watching at home

634
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,730
RUSAMEEKAE: might shed tears too.

635
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,746
RUSAMEEKAE: How much pain
will we bear for them?

636
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:17,722
RUSAMEEKAE: Anyway, we must move on.

637
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:21,498
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's continue watching
to see who will confess their love next.

638

JANEYEH: She's so beautiful in yellow.

641
00:34:39,073 --> 00:34:39,674
(Hand on her chest)

642
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:41,338
CRIS: Why does everyone
have such a small waist?

643
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:50,650
(Sigh)

644
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:53,530
(Looks to the right)

645
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,962
RUSAMEEKAE: No one else
might show up, just one person.

646
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:00,890
CRIS: I'm waiting
to see JUNSU being cute.

647
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:06,330
(Closes eyes)

648
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:13,938

CRIS: I want to hear what he'll say.

656
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:42,010
CRIS: He doesn't talk much, does he?

657
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:47,994
JUNSU: It's very hot.

658
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:51,770

CRIS: JUNSU, you can do it!

662
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:00,314
JUNSU: I think, sometimes...

663
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:07,066
JUNSU: You and I
had so much fun and were happy.

664
00:36:07,738 --> 00:36:09,858
(Smiles) RUSAMEEKAE:
Being together makes them happy.

665
00:36:13,594 --> 00:36:14,266

thank you for all the memories.

672
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:30,624

RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, right.

830
00:45:24,882 --> 00:45:25,722
JANEYEH: SUNNY must be stressed.

832
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:39,290
NAMNUNG: Until this morning,

833
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,722
NAMNUNG: actually, I feel kind of

834
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:41,762
NAMNUNG: confused with myself.

835
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:42,810
NAMNUNG: Until the day...

836
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:44,858
NAMNUNG: the day I have to choose,
which is today.

837
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:51,322
NAMNUNG: Is this best choice for me?

838
00:45:51,802 --> 00:45:53,202
CRIS: NAMNUNG must be very stressed.

839
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:57,050
NAMNUNG: How will SUNNY feel?
Will she feel pressured?

840
00:45:57,602 --> 00:45:58,405
TIMETHAI: Love triangle.

841
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:02,458
NAMNUNG: I really don't want to
make SUNNY uncomfortable.

842
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:07,202
JANEYEH: NAMNUNG and SUNNY
feel good about each other.

843
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,362
RUSAMEEKAE: They don't want

844
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:10,682
RUSAMEEKAE: to make anyone sad
or anything like that.

845
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:11,882
CRIS: Yes.

846
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:22,074
(TIME and NAMNUNG choose
not to confess their love to SUNNY)

847
00:46:26,322 --> 00:46:28,522
RUSAMEEKAE: I'll accept the decision.

848
00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:29,242
TIMETHAI: For real?

849
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:31,922
JANEYEH: Oh, I feel sorry for her.

850
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:34,842
CRIS: NAMNUNG might think

851
00:46:34,842 --> 00:46:37,802
CRIS: SUNNY and TIME are probably
a hundred percent already.

852
00:46:37,802 --> 00:46:40,058
CRIS: So she doesn't want to come out
and make everyone uncomfortable.

853
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:40,730
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

854
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:48,698
SUNNY: In the end, NAMNUNG
didn't open the door for me.

855
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,134
SUNNY: She might think that...

856
00:46:51,426 --> 00:46:53,371
SUNNY: it's too late for us.

857
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,020

she's ready to cry.

JOY: from the start.

876

JOY: I didn't say it from the start.

877
00:48:26,562 --> 00:48:29,114

878
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:31,402
JOY: I regret not telling you.

879
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:36,362

(Think of her as a close friend)

JOY: If someday,
you don't have anyone left,

JOY: The...

900
00:49:24,186 --> 00:49:25,402
JOY: The last time or not.

901
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:34,442

SUNNY: And what do you think I like?

917

both women and men.

918
00:50:37,892 --> 00:50:39,092
JOY: I'm just guessing.

919
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:40,346

if it were you.

928
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:01,372
JOY: SUNNY, do you want to go rowing?

929
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:02,652

out of it by now.

MATHEUS: For a surprise,
can I hold your hand?

941

MATHEUS: Since the first day,

948
00:52:33,412 --> 00:52:34,252
MATHEUS: when you look at me,

949
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:36,532

and your smile,

950

MATHEUS: comfortable right away.

952
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,448
MATHEUS: You know, the first day
and the second day were like...

953
00:52:44,864 --> 00:52:46,132
MATHEUS: throughout all the two weeks,

954
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:49,532
MATHEUS: and even though
our conversations

955
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:52,332
MATHEUS: were not, you know,
interactions super long,

956
00:52:52,532 --> 00:52:53,812
MATHEUS: but like meaningful,

957
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:55,332
MATHEUS: and that's what matters, right?

958
00:52:55,776 --> 00:52:56,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Right.

959
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:59,812

you're helping me

960
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:03,932
MATHEUS: as you know,
I'm like a fighter, not a quitter.

961
00:53:03,936 --> 00:53:04,852
MATHEUS: So...

962
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:06,092
CRIS: Oh, that's so cute.

963

MATHEUS: how much I care about you,

965
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:12,572
MATHEUS: and how deeply
I actually like you.

966
00:53:13,018 --> 00:53:15,852
(How much I care about you,
how much I like you)

967
00:53:15,852 --> 00:53:17,532
RUSAMEEKAE: Like he said,
he's a fighter.

968
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:19,292
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS is really fighting.

969
00:53:20,652 --> 00:53:22,452

00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:25,132
MATHEUS: My name is LEIMANN.

972
00:53:25,732 --> 00:53:28,372
(Ask for a date)

973
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:29,652
MATHEUS: I will not disappoint you.

974

00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:49,492
MATHEUS: SUNNY.

983
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:51,854
MATHEUS: She's like wearing a red dress,

984
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,986
MATHEUS: caught my eyes the most.

985
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:55,372
CRIS: But she's really good at smiling,
I mean SUNNY.

986
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:56,692
CRIS: Yeah.

987
00:53:56,892 --> 00:53:59,332
TIMETHAI: SUNNY keeps smiling
all the time, no matter what.

988
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:13,732
MATHEUS: You know deep in your heart.

989
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:15,492
MATHEUS: And you know
you're just totally

990
00:54:16,532 --> 00:54:17,332
MATHEUS: my type.

991
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:19,852
MATHEUS: You know, and yeah,

992
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:22,212
MATHEUS: there's no other way
to describe it.

993
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:26,892
SUNNY: Thank you, MATHEUS.

994
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:30,492
MATHEUS: Oh.

995
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:34,292
MATHEUS: It felt very powerful,
very magical, that moment,

996
00:54:34,332 --> 00:54:35,532
MATHEUS: because it was

997
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,012
MATHEUS: nice to feel her that close.

998
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:41,412
MATHEUS: Thank you.

999
00:54:42,932 --> 00:54:43,612
MATHEUS: See you later.

1000
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:44,452
SUNNY: See you.

1001
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:51,962
(Look)

1002
00:55:01,492 --> 00:55:02,492
(It's time for SUNNY to choose)
(Now)

1003
00:55:02,812 --> 00:55:03,892
(SUNNY,)

1004
00:55:04,452 --> 00:55:06,572
(please respond to your love confession.)

1005
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,812
RUSAMEEKAE: It's time for SUNNY
to choose now.

1006
00:55:17,612 --> 00:55:20,012
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes or no.

1007
00:55:30,812 --> 00:55:32,692
RUSAMEEKAE: It's tough
for the one answering, right?

1008
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:51,212
TIMETHAI: Watching this is so tense,
my hands are sweaty.

1009
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:53,932
CRIS: NAMNUNG looks stressed.

1010
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:06,932
SUNNY: JOY.

1011
00:56:06,932 --> 00:56:09,932
SUNNY: Thanks for telling me.
I understand how hard it is.

1012
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,451
SUNNY: Honestly, I was so surprised.
I didn't expect it.

1013
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:19,972
JOY: As I said, you're

1014
00:56:21,012 --> 00:56:22,972
JOY: the first one
and I think probably the only one

1015
00:56:24,452 --> 00:56:25,852
JOY: that I'd be
brave enough to say this.

1016
00:56:37,306 --> 00:56:38,252
CRIS: That's all.

1017
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:39,092
- JANEYEH: That's it, done
- RUSAMEEKAE: Done.

1018
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:41,434
TIMETHAI: She's already known it.

1019
00:56:44,252 --> 00:56:46,652
JOY: SUNNY is the first one
who gave me the courage

1020
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:49,172
JOY: to go up and flirt with her,
and to tell her I like her.

1021
00:56:51,092 --> 00:56:55,092
JOY: I want to thank this experience
for helping me overcome this fear.

1022
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:56,972
JOY: I think,

1023
00:56:57,012 --> 00:56:59,092
JOY: if I had been brave enough
to flirt from the beginning,

1024
00:56:59,492 --> 00:57:01,812
JOY: I probably wouldn't regret
like I do today.

1025
00:57:04,492 --> 00:57:05,892
- JANEYEH: Well done, JOY
- CRIS: Well done.

1026
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:06,892

1027
00:57:06,892 --> 00:57:08,492
JANEYEH: Leave like a Queen.

1028
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:09,112
(Keep your courage and sincerity)

1029
00:57:09,112 --> 00:57:10,242
(to await the day to seek true love
once more.)

1030
00:57:10,242 --> 00:57:11,352
(You will wear the most beautiful wedding
outfit beside the one you love the most.)

1031
00:57:11,352 --> 00:57:12,192
(Wishing JOY can find
her true love someday.)

1032
00:57:18,412 --> 00:57:19,332
RUSAMEEKAE: It's not JOY

1033
00:57:19,372 --> 00:57:20,612
RUSAMEEKAE: who is looking awkward,

1034
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:21,892
RUSAMEEKAE: or defeated.

1035
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,452
- RUSAMEEKAE: What we've seen...
- CRIS: Yeah.

1036
00:57:23,492 --> 00:57:24,772
RUSAMEEKAE: Today we get to see

1037
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:26,172
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY who looks calm.

1038
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:28,172
CRIS: Who am I? Pretty JOY.

1039
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,332
- CRIS: Remember Pretty JOY?
- RUSAMEEKAE: I remember.

1040
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,692
CRIS: She was still so bright then.

1041
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:33,412
CRIS: But once she started having
a lot of feelings for SUNNY,

1042
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:34,652
CRIS: she started

1043
00:57:34,812 --> 00:57:36,212
- RUSAMEEKAE: Be reserved.
- CRIS: to be quiet, you know.

1044
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:37,332
TIMETHAI: She ended up
liking the top one.

1045
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,852
RUSAMEEKAE: Now MATHEUS
is still standing.

1046
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:44,252
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's watch together
whether SUNNY will say yes or no.

1047
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,332
- CRIS: See you.
- JANEYEH: See you.

1048
00:57:57,562 --> 00:57:58,874
SUNNY: I love you so much.

1049
00:57:58,906 --> 00:58:00,194
JANEYEH: Huh? This is...

1050
00:58:03,732 --> 00:58:04,532
SUNNY: But you know,

1051
00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:05,772
SUNNY: I love you as a friend.

1052
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:08,576
CRIS: Love you like a real friend.

1053
00:58:09,412 --> 00:58:10,692
SUNNY: And I know we have like,

1054
00:58:10,812 --> 00:58:11,612
SUNNY: so many things

1055
00:58:11,932 --> 00:58:13,652
SUNNY: that we could do outside.

1056
00:58:13,812 --> 00:58:16,212
SUNNY: I can actually see myself
hanging out with you.

1057
00:58:18,052 --> 00:58:19,132
SUNNY: You're a wonderful person,

1058
00:58:19,692 --> 00:58:22,892
SUNNY: an amazing, fun person
to be with all the time.

1059
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:28,452
SUNNY: And you always bring like
great energy to the house.

1060
00:58:29,932 --> 00:58:31,932
SUNNY: And I'm really happy
to have met you.

1061
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:33,332
SUNNY: Really.

1062
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:36,332
MATHEUS: Likewise, for real.

1063
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:37,212
RUSAMEEKAE: Crystal clear.

1064
00:58:38,532 --> 00:58:39,514
SUNNY: Love you.

1065
00:58:46,671 --> 00:58:50,199
- SUNNY: Let's find time together.
- MATHEUS: I respect your decision.

1066
00:58:51,452 --> 00:58:52,652
CRIS: But MATHEUS knew already that

1067
00:58:52,692 --> 00:58:54,092
CRIS: it's probably "No".

1068
00:59:01,252 --> 00:59:02,652
MATHEUS: I felt very relieved.

1069
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:07,360
MATHEUS: Kind of like a stone just
falls from my heart.

1070
00:59:07,968 --> 00:59:10,132
MATHEUS: I was happy everything was...
was done

1071
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:12,532
MATHEUS: I said everything
what I could do.

1072
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:16,292
MATHEUS: And we knew this was
not the end.

1073
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,412
MATHEUS: There will be a continuation.

1074
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:21,868
(MATHEUS's determination and confidence
make him stand out, growing with grace.)

1075
00:59:21,868 --> 00:59:24,047
(And keep shining brighter
and brighter. Heartfelt thanks to you.)

1076
00:59:24,047 --> 00:59:25,146
CRIS: MATHEUS.

1077
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:26,412
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS also left.

1078
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:28,212
JANEYEH: Oh, that's splendid.

1079
00:59:28,612 --> 00:59:30,532
RUSAMEEKAE: We've got to admire MATHEUS.

1080
00:59:30,732 --> 00:59:32,812
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS said
he just wanted to express his love.

1081
00:59:33,212 --> 00:59:34,412
RUSAMEEKAE: It's an honor

1082
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:36,612
RUSAMEEKAE: to his own heart above all.

1083
00:59:36,852 --> 00:59:37,692
CRIS: Splendid indeed.

1084
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:39,012
RUSAMEEKAE: Even though he knew
well that

1085
00:59:39,012 --> 00:59:41,412
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY just treated
him as a friend,

1086
00:59:41,772 --> 00:59:44,332
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS still
smiled and accepted everything.

1087
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:45,412
RUSAMEEKAE: He's an optimist.

1088
00:59:45,932 --> 00:59:49,172
RUSAMEEKAE: Some love sometimes
comes in the form of friendship

1089
00:59:49,412 --> 00:59:50,772
RUSAMEEKAE: that's good and beautiful.

1090
00:59:51,162 --> 00:59:52,212
RUSAMEEKAE: That's possible too, right?

1091
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:53,212
RUSAMEEKAE: Come on.

1092
00:59:53,452 --> 00:59:54,652
RUSAMEEKAE: Some people are gone now.

1093
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,412
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's check out who's left.

1094
00:59:57,252 --> 00:59:59,452
CRIS: Right now, the ones who are left
are NAMNUNG, TOD, TIME,

1095
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:00,372
CRIS: and SUNNY.

1096
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:02,074
RUSAMEEKAE: But only NAMNUNG and TIME
haven't come out yet.

1097
01:00:02,074 --> 01:00:03,092
CRIS: Yes.

1098
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,692
CRIS: Right now, we don't know who
will be selected, but everything's a mess.

1099
01:00:05,692 --> 01:00:07,652
CRIS: Whoever comes out,
it's a mess right now, a complete mess.

1100
01:00:07,852 --> 01:00:10,092
RUSAMEEKAE: Well, since we're sure
it'll be messy anyway,

1101
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:13,492
RUSAMEEKAE: let's watch
the mess together.

1102
01:00:13,492 --> 01:00:14,332
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's find out.

1103
01:00:25,612 --> 01:00:28,132
SUNNY: When I went up
on the stage of confession,

1104
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:30,252
SUNNY: I didn't see the ones I expected.

1105
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:32,972
SUNNY: I didn't see NAMNUNG.

1106
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:36,252
SUNNY: I didn't see TIME.

1107
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:40,932
SUNNY: So I felt confused.

1108
01:00:41,452 --> 01:00:42,812
RUSAMEEKAE: Poor SUNNY.

1109
01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:48,346
(Welcome TIME)

1110
01:00:48,346 --> 01:00:50,170
(onto the confession stage.)

1111
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,034
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME.

1112
01:00:51,034 --> 01:00:51,962
TIMETHAI: Here it is.

1113
01:00:51,962 --> 01:00:52,954
CRIS: TIME.

1114
01:00:55,002 --> 01:00:56,452
JANEYEH: The show likes to do this!

1115
01:00:58,394 --> 01:00:59,546
TIMETHAI: Messy!

1116
01:00:59,546 --> 01:01:00,410
CRIS: Messy!

1117
01:01:04,602 --> 01:01:06,010
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME came out.

1118
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,418
RUSAMEEKAE: Hope TOD can come out alone.

1119
01:01:07,578 --> 01:01:08,730
CRIS: Everyone will come out.

1120
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:19,450
CRIS: But wouldn't it be better
if TOD comes out alone?

1121
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,850
CRIS: Because NAMNUNG and SUNNY
still have a chance.

1122
01:01:25,818 --> 01:01:27,258
RUSAMEEKAE: I pray that TOD
comes out alone.

1123
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:29,652
RUSAMEEKAE: I hope it's like that.

1124
01:01:31,674 --> 01:01:33,370
TIMETHAI: But I want to see
TOD's confession.

1125
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,002
JANEYEH: TIME must be really surprised.

1126
01:01:41,466 --> 01:01:43,610
(The final confession for TIME)

1127
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:46,458
(Anyone who wants to confess to TIME,)

1128
01:01:46,554 --> 01:01:48,442
(come to the front door.)

1129
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:49,690
RUSAMEEKAE: Come on.

1130
01:01:51,866 --> 01:01:53,121
LOVE(X)PERT: Come on, man.

1131
01:01:56,442 --> 01:01:58,277
CRIS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1132
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:24,314
CRIS: He's shocked.

1133
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:25,850
CRIS: He's actually shocked!

1134
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:36,250
TIMETHAI: Ouch.

1135
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,306
CRIS: I'm shocked now.

1136
01:02:39,834 --> 01:02:41,658
CRIS: He's really shocked!

1137
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:47,002
JANEYEH: Oh, it's too messy.

1138
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:49,498
TIMETHAI: Just let it be over.

1139
01:02:51,732 --> 01:02:53,690
CRIS: TIME is shocked.

1140
01:02:57,626 --> 01:03:00,026
(Looking)

1141
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:02,810
RUSAMEEKAE: But everyone is honest
with themselves.

1142
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,378
TIMETHAI: Everyone's really real.

1143
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,274
(Looking)

1144
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,890
CRIS: Oh, TOD looks really serious!

1145
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,410
RUSAMEEKAE: It hurts everyone so much.

1146
01:03:31,962 --> 01:03:33,786
JANEYEH: She's really not
coming out, is she?

1147
01:03:40,743 --> 01:03:42,618
(Turning)

1148
01:03:44,602 --> 01:03:46,170
(Looking)

1149
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:48,373
SUNNY: NAMNUNG must have made
her decision.

1150
01:03:50,746 --> 01:03:53,589
SUNNY: I have to make up my mind
quickly as well.

1151
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,674
TIMETHAI: They're not coming out,
are they?

1152
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:30,554
(Looking)

1153
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,282
(NAMNUNG does not open the door)

1154
01:04:38,714 --> 01:04:40,090
CRIS: Because she doesn't know.

1155
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:42,490
RUSAMEEKAE: Misunderstood.

1156
01:04:50,714 --> 01:04:52,890
- JANEYEH: Really messy.
- CRIS: Really messy.

1157
01:05:00,058 --> 01:05:02,234
(Looking)
CRIS: What should they do?

1158
01:05:05,274 --> 01:05:06,458
CRIS: NAMNUNG, come on.

1159
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:14,618
(Sitting down)

1160
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:22,710
TIMETHAI: What the heck?

1161
01:05:27,354 --> 01:05:29,242
CRIS: NAMNUNG really isn't coming out?

1162
01:05:38,202 --> 01:05:40,602
NAMNUNG: I'm the type
who always considers feelings

1163
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:42,554
NAMNUNG: of others

1164
01:05:42,554 --> 01:05:44,250
NAMNUNG: before my own feelings,

1165
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:47,610
NAMNUNG: until it makes me feel
that, sometimes,

1166
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,818
NAMNUNG: it's me who ends up feeling
bad and uncomfortable.

1167
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,250
NAMNUNG: I just hope that all of us

1168
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:57,306
NAMNUNG: stay connected, including with
SUNNY, whatever the relationship,

1169
01:05:57,306 --> 01:06:01,114
NAMNUNG: Like friends or sisters,
I'm happy with anything,

1170
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,938
NAMNUNG: as long as I can have
everyone in my life.

1171
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:05,754
(NAMNUNG chooses not to confess)

1172
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:07,194
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG, my baby.

1173
01:06:10,906 --> 01:06:13,498
JANEYEH: Oh, I feel sorry,
but I understand.

1174
01:06:13,978 --> 01:06:16,602
JANEYEH: We must respect her decisions.

1175
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,034
RUSAMEEKAE: Who's first?

1176
01:06:27,962 --> 01:06:30,170
- CRIS: TOD.
- JANEYEH: TOD.

1177
01:06:32,058 --> 01:06:33,018
CRIS: Ouch!

1178
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:35,162
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, my God.

1179
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:40,250
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm definitely going to cry.

1180
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,338
CRIS: Can I just cry now?

1181
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:43,898
CRIS: Can I start already? Could you
please hand me the tissue first?

1182
01:06:48,154 --> 01:06:50,452
CRIS: Choosing TOD makes it
easier to end this.

1183
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:53,562
TIMETHAI: Whoa, it gave me goosebumps!

1184
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:58,970
JANEYEH: Ouch!

1185
01:07:03,578 --> 01:07:04,762
CRIS: That's so intense.

1186
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,064
(Can't believe it)

1187
01:07:23,642 --> 01:07:24,794
TIMETHAI: Two very handsome guys.

1188
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:31,322
(Smiling)

1189
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:35,194
TOD: Are you surprised?

1190
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,466
CRIS: Whoa, TOD also doesn't know
what to do.

1191
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:38,810
JANEYEH: Are you surprised?

1192
01:07:43,002 --> 01:07:44,634
JANEYEH: TOD is shy, look at him.

1193
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:49,434
TOD: Well...

1194
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:54,138
JANEYEH: TOD looks ready to cry.

1195
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:06,298
TOD: I don't know how to tell you

1196
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:08,698
TOD: in which way.

1197
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,122
TOD: Well, I have good feelings
towards you, TIME.

1198
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:20,890
TOD: I just don't know

1199
01:08:21,594 --> 01:08:23,066
TOD: what to do because...

1200
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,066
TOD: Well...

1201
01:08:36,314 --> 01:08:39,732
TOD: Every night before bed,
we sit and recap.

1202
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:45,242
TOD: Like discussing who you are
interested in and who I'm interested in.

1203
01:08:48,218 --> 01:08:51,456
TOD: But your answer never included me

1204
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:55,290
TOD: as someone you liked.

1205
01:08:55,425 --> 01:08:58,010
JANEYEH: TOD.

1206
01:09:00,922 --> 01:09:02,970
TIME: On the first day,
I liked NAMNUNG, right?

1207
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:05,658
TIME: Interested, but not liking,
just interested.

1208
01:09:06,266 --> 01:09:08,026
TIME: But when she went to X-Land,

1209
01:09:08,442 --> 01:09:10,138
TIME: I got the chance to talk to SUNNY.

1210
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:11,226
TIME: Hmm...

1211
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:14,394
TIME: I felt more
for SUNNY than NAMNUNG.

1212
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:16,250
TIME: I still wonder about her.

1213
01:09:16,378 --> 01:09:18,074
TOD: Hmm, yes.

1214
01:09:18,074 --> 01:09:19,898
TIME: If you meet SUNNY then,

1215
01:09:20,314 --> 01:09:22,394
TIME: Just look after her for me.

1216
01:09:23,354 --> 01:09:25,370
CRIS: Oh, it's like a TV series.

1217
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:51,770
TOD: It makes me even less confident

1218
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,050
TOD: whether

1219
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:56,058
TOD: to tell you

1220
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:58,746
TOD: or not.

1221
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:09,754
TOD: I also want to take you to X-Land.

1222
01:10:09,754 --> 01:10:11,217
LOVE(X)PERT: TOD, alas.

1223
01:10:18,586 --> 01:10:20,474
TOD: So if I take you to X-Land,

1224
01:10:21,402 --> 01:10:23,866
TOD: you will definitely feel strange
with me when we come back.

1225
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:26,042
TOD: Because like,

1226
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,898
TOD: there's no way it's possible.

1227
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:39,162
TOD: Think of it as how great it is
that we're roommates.

1228
01:10:39,162 --> 01:10:40,692
TOD: I'm with you, I get to see you.

1229
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,858
(Being together every day feels just like going to X-Land)
TOD: It's not different from going to X-Land.

1230
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,826
(Sighs)

1231
01:11:04,122 --> 01:11:05,210
TOD: Well...

1232
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:07,002
TOD: No matter what the answer is,

1233
01:11:09,274 --> 01:11:11,034
TOD: it's okay.

1234
01:11:11,674 --> 01:11:13,466
TOD: At least I'm happy that

1235
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,738
TOD: I can say it today, TIME.

1236
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,098
RUSAMEEKAE: That's good.

1237
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:21,452
RUSAMEEKAE: Very good, TOD.

1238
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:24,506
TOD: And then,

1239
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,258
TOD: I'm proud of myself that

1240
01:11:29,146 --> 01:11:30,298
TOD: I said it.

1241
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:31,514
TIMETHAI: Finally...

1242
01:11:31,514 --> 01:11:32,666
TIMETHAI: Finally...

1243
01:11:32,986 --> 01:11:34,810
JANEYEH: TOD is very good.

1244
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:53,466
TOD: Well...

1245
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:55,802
TOD: If we go out,

1246
01:11:57,914 --> 01:11:59,130
TOD: can you still meet me?

1247
01:12:03,098 --> 01:12:04,058
RUSAMEEKAE: Sure.

1248
01:12:05,306 --> 01:12:06,746
TOD: You're not grossed out
by me, are you?

1249
01:12:08,602 --> 01:12:10,234
JANEYEH: Don't say that.

1250
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:12,532
CRIS: Why does he care about this?

1251
01:12:15,098 --> 01:12:17,114
JANEYEH: Why is it so heartbreaking?

1252
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:25,370
TOD: You're not grossed out
by me, are you?

1253
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:28,794
TOD: Nothing's going to change, right?

1254
01:12:34,394 --> 01:12:35,354
CRIS: TOD.

1255
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:54,572
TOD: Thank you.

1256
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:57,562
- TOD: Thank you.
- TIME: Thank you.

1257
01:13:05,274 --> 01:13:06,860
CRIS: TOD.

1258
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,140
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD.

1259
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:35,260
TIME: I never thought that TOD...

1260
01:13:36,314 --> 01:13:38,220
TIME: Actually, I'm interested in TOD.

1261
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:41,900
TIME: It's like if we had a chance
to talk earlier,

1262
01:13:42,138 --> 01:13:43,260
TIME: it would have been different.

1263
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:46,300
RUSAMEEKAE: It's all wrong.

1264
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,060
JANEYEH: The timing is all wrong.

1265
01:13:53,402 --> 01:13:55,460
JANEYEH: Poor TOD.

1266
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,820
JANEYEH: Can I have some tissue?

1267
01:14:25,018 --> 01:14:26,540
JANEYEH: I'm losing it.

1268
01:14:30,426 --> 01:14:32,340
JANEYEH: Poor TOD.

1269
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,260
RUSAMEEKAE: Alright.

1270
01:14:33,498 --> 01:14:36,340
RUSAMEEKAE: The viewers, we have reached
this point.

1271
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,300
RUSAMEEKAE: See you on Saturday

1272
01:14:39,514 --> 01:14:40,620
(Let's end here)
RUSAMEEKAE: at 5 PM.

1273
01:14:40,858 --> 01:14:43,258
JANEYEH: I won't film anymore,
I'm tired.

1274
01:14:43,386 --> 01:14:45,210
TIMETHAI: Just a single sentence
made me cry.

1275
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,426
JANEYEH: True.

1276
01:14:46,426 --> 01:14:48,460
RUSAMEEKAE: You're not grossed out
by me, are you?

1277
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,940
CRIS: You're not grossed out
by me, are you?

1278
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:50,682
CRIS: It's kind of

1279
01:14:50,746 --> 01:14:52,140
CRIS: the tears started falling.

1280
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,106
TIMETHAI: I was upset just now.

1281
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,140
JANEYEH: I feel for TOD.

1282
01:14:56,154 --> 01:14:58,620
RUSAMEEKAE: But we don't know
if the viewers at home

1283
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,700
RUSAMEEKAE: are feeling like us
right now.

1284
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,060
RUSAMEEKAE: But this whole story
isn't ending just yet.

1285
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,740
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's continue watching.

1286
01:15:09,594 --> 01:15:10,780
CRIS: SUNNY?

1287
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:24,220
TIMETHAI: Watching to the end
will drive me crazy, huh?

1288
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,860
CRIS: True, bipolar vibes.

1289
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,074
JANEYEH: Oh wow.

1290
01:15:47,898 --> 01:15:50,740
SUNNY: Since the first day
I got off the jet ski,

1291
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,020
SUNNY: I saw your almond-shaped eyes.

1292
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,180
SUNNY: I found your eyes
are really beautiful.

1293
01:15:56,634 --> 01:16:00,140
SUNNY: I think we have
a lot of similar thoughts.

1294
01:16:01,018 --> 01:16:02,620
SUNNY: And also,

1295
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:06,380
SUNNY: I like that
you're very intelligent.

1296
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:10,860
SUNNY: Aside from your handsomeness,
I think this is your best trait.

1297
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,340
SUNNY: Your handsomeness.

1298
01:16:13,082 --> 01:16:15,450
(Smiles)

1299
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,540
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

1300
01:16:23,738 --> 01:16:25,312
TIMETHAI: This is more serious.

1301
01:16:25,344 --> 01:16:26,340
RUSAMEEKAE: This is the most serious.

1302
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,620
CRIS: Oh wow.

1303
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,780
SUNNY: When we went on a date,

1304
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:41,060
SUNNY: you told me about your mom,
obviously we cried together.

1305
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:43,020
SUNNY: I thought it was

1306
01:16:44,954 --> 01:16:46,940
SUNNY: a very special moment.

1307
01:16:47,418 --> 01:16:51,290
SUNNY: And I kept appreciating you
for being brave enough to tell me this.

1308
01:16:56,314 --> 01:16:59,100
SUNNY: Within a few days,
you told me something

1309
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,660
SUNNY: so personal.

1310
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:05,220
SUNNY: I could lower my guard,
slowly but surely.

1311
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:09,060
SUNNY: TIME opened up about his mom,
and I felt that

1312
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,180
SUNNY: it was truly sincere.

1313
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:13,420
SUNNY: That's why I feel he's sincere.

1314
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,420
TIME: Thank you.

1315
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,220
(Smiles)
JANEYEH: Another smile, ouch.

1316
01:17:25,498 --> 01:17:27,580
RUSAMEEKAE: She's got him.

1317
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:28,260
JANEYEH: She's got him.

1318
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,900
JANEYEH: No way to resist.

1319
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,740
RUSAMEEKAE: She's got him.

1320
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,298
(Shy)

1321
01:18:00,346 --> 01:18:01,860
RUSAMEEKAE: So uncomfortable.

1322
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,250
SUNNY: Can you hold me?

1323
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:09,338
TIME: Go ahead.

1324
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:11,898
SUNNY: Are you trying to sabotage me?

1325
01:18:11,898 --> 01:18:13,100
TIME: No, never.

1326
01:18:13,306 --> 01:18:15,060
TIME: This is our first game together.

1327
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,060
SUNNY: Yes, it's crazy.

1328
01:18:16,634 --> 01:18:17,338
SUNNY: Whoa.

1329
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,940
TIME: If only going back
to the first day.

1330
01:18:26,714 --> 01:18:28,340
TIME: Then we should go on a date.

1331
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:30,340
TOD: Let's try it, give it a shot.

1332
01:18:30,938 --> 01:18:32,940
TIME: I want you to be happy.

1333
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,460
TOD: I want you to be happy too.

1334
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:36,666
(Grabs hair)

1335
01:18:38,266 --> 01:18:39,740
TOD: Just cry!

1336
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:45,658
TOD: We'll go together.

1337
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,060
TIME: Next round.

1338
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,300
TIME: Bye-bye.

1339
01:18:52,698 --> 01:18:55,140
CRIS: Each moment is unique
for everyone.

1340
01:18:56,474 --> 01:18:57,940
JANEYEH: Who will he choose?

1341
01:19:04,314 --> 01:19:05,540
RUSAMEEKAE: Who's first?

1342
01:19:07,226 --> 01:19:08,620
RUSAMEEKAE: Who is he going to see?

1343
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:17,980
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY?

1344
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,980
TIMETHAI: Probably not SUNNY.

1345
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,820
RUSAMEEKAE: Or will he say no
to everyone?

1346
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:23,930
TIMETHAI: Too harsh.

1347
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:24,740
JANEYEH: Why doing so?

1348
01:19:26,746 --> 01:19:28,180
CRIS: Who he stops by first?

1349
01:19:31,514 --> 01:19:32,154
JANEYEH: TOD.

1350
01:19:32,186 --> 01:19:33,380
RUSAMEEKAE: It must be TOD.

1351
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,300
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, TOD!

1352
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:42,580
JANEYEH: Such a headache.

1353
01:19:43,674 --> 01:19:45,460
(Thinking hard)
JANEYEH: Oh, I can barely breathe.

1354
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,186
(Patting)

1355
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:49,754
(Looks)

1356
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,300
CRIS: TOD is serious.

1357
01:19:55,386 --> 01:19:56,922
TIME: And I'm sorry for

1358
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:06,298
TIME: sharing my feelings,
showing interest in others besides you.

1359
01:20:10,842 --> 01:20:13,660
TIME: I'm really sorry.

1360
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:16,282
CRIS: The end, close the book.

1361
01:20:20,602 --> 01:20:23,962
- TOD: It's really okay, really okay.
- TIME: Sorry.

1362
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,050
TOD: Really.

1363
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:27,578
JANEYEH: Oh, poor TOD.

1364
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,820
TIME: Thank you for listening
since day one.

1365
01:20:32,506 --> 01:20:33,940
TOD: Thanks to you too.

1366
01:20:34,234 --> 01:20:35,380
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

1367
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:40,220
TIME: Honestly, I didn't know
you felt this way about me.

1368
01:20:40,474 --> 01:20:41,434
TOD: Yeah.

1369
01:20:41,562 --> 01:20:43,140
TIME: But I have to say,

1370
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:45,740
TIME: out of everyone here,

1371
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:48,860
TIME: you're the only one
who makes me feel comfortable.

1372
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:54,458
CRIS: There it goes again.

1373
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,100
CRIS: TOD is dead.

1374
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:06,060
TIME: From the very first minute,
since you walked in.

1375
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,660
CRIS: Then why didn't you choose him?

1376
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:12,250
(Tearful)
TOD: Oh.

1377
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,380
TOD: Thank you.

1378
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,020
TIME: If I could turn back time,

1379
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,940
TIME: I'd want to know
if I could've met you from the start.

1380
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,100
TIME: How would it be?

1381
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:41,500
TOD: It's okay.

1382
01:21:41,946 --> 01:21:43,420
TOD: It's okay.

1383
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:49,300
TIME: No matter what happens,

1384
01:21:49,466 --> 01:21:52,140
TIME: I still want you in my life.

1385
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:02,300
TIME: Would it be possible?

1386
01:22:02,362 --> 01:22:03,580
TOD: It's possible.

1387
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:06,260
TOD: I want to be in your life.

1388
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,180
TOD: I'm the one who should be
asking your permission.

1389
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,740
CRIS: Ouch, TOD!

1390
01:22:14,464 --> 01:22:15,008
TIME: Then keep touch.

1391
01:22:17,818 --> 01:22:18,780
TOD: Sure.

1392
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:23,940
JANEYEH: Oh, dead.

1393
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,220
TIMETHAI: Oh, wow.

1394
01:22:29,722 --> 01:22:31,020
RUSAMEEKAE: Very good, TOD.

1395
01:22:32,218 --> 01:22:33,940
TOD: Come on, let's hug.

1396
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,060
TOD: If you need anything, tell me.

1397
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:35,834
TIME: Thank you.

1398
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:37,402
TIME: Thanks for being by my side.

1399
01:22:38,362 --> 01:22:40,260
TOD: Don't, hey, there's one star.

1400
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:42,420
TIME: I want you to be happy.

1401
01:22:42,426 --> 01:22:43,660
TOD: I want you to be happy too.

1402
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:44,980
TIME: If I kiss you...

1403
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:46,490
TIME: Hey, you might have
a partner then.

1404
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,380
TIME: Then we should go on a date,
let's try it.

1405
01:22:48,954 --> 01:22:50,660
TIME: If I could turn back time,

1406
01:22:51,514 --> 01:22:53,180
TOD: Should we introduce ourselves?

1407
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,300
TIME: My name's TIME.

1408
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,580
TOD: I'm TOD.

1409
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:57,300
TIME: How would it be?

1410
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,090
(If we could turn back time,
what would it be like?)

1411
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:06,500
CRIS: This is so heavy.

1412
01:23:07,706 --> 01:23:11,546
TOD: I'm glad to have met you.

1413
01:23:12,506 --> 01:23:13,658
TOD: Okay.

1414
01:23:26,586 --> 01:23:28,300
TOD: Just as I thought.

1415
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,980
TOD: Because he clearly
wouldn't choose me anyway.

1416
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:32,500
TOD: I just expected to tell him,

1417
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:34,140
TOD: and let him know

1418
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:36,140
TOD: what I truly think of him.

1419
01:23:36,218 --> 01:23:37,780
TOD: I just wanted to express that.

1420
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,026
TOD: And I'll remember that forever.

1421
01:23:45,722 --> 01:23:47,380
RUSAMEEKAE:
"You're not grossed out by me, are you?"

1422
01:23:47,418 --> 01:23:49,300
RUSAMEEKAE: "I want to be in your life."

1423
01:23:49,818 --> 01:23:52,060
RUSAMEEKAE: "I want you in my life."

1424
01:23:52,538 --> 01:23:54,220
CRIS: He really loves him, doesn't he?

1425
01:24:00,058 --> 01:24:01,978
TOD: I want to thank TIME.

1426
01:24:01,978 --> 01:24:04,026
TOD: Thanks to TIME
for always being by my side.

1427
01:24:04,026 --> 01:24:08,500
TOD: He hasn't forgotten me,
and he always sees me too.

1428
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,620
TOD: Thank you. Thank you, TIME.

1429
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,180
CRIS: I'm dying.

1430
01:24:18,074 --> 01:24:19,220
TIMETHAI: Oh, my God.

1431
01:24:22,874 --> 01:24:24,754
(Thanks to TOD for making us
believe in the power of love.)

1432
01:24:24,754 --> 01:24:26,484
(Don't let society's gaze
stop your steadfast emotions)

1433
01:24:26,484 --> 01:24:28,826
(Thank you for showing how vast
and boundless the power of love is)

1434
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:31,700
TOD: We'll see each other again soon.

1435
01:24:37,914 --> 01:24:39,300
JANEYEH: TOD is really great.

1436
01:24:41,338 --> 01:24:43,340
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD's courage

1437
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:47,674
RUSAMEEKAE: shows that sometimes,
love isn't wrong.

1438
01:24:47,674 --> 01:24:48,570
JANEYEH: Yes.

1439
01:24:48,602 --> 01:24:51,180
RUSAMEEKAE: Loving someone isn't wrong.

1440
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:54,820
RUSAMEEKAE: And not being loved
isn't wrong either.

1441
01:24:54,842 --> 01:25:00,540
RUSAMEEKAE: We can coexist as friends,
or anything good together.

1442
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:02,460
RUSAMEEKAE:
Just take emotions out of it.

1443
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,130
RUSAMEEKAE: And we...

1444
01:25:03,162 --> 01:25:04,058
TIMETHAI: Be sincere with yourself.

1445
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:06,980
RUSAMEEKAE: are sincere
and understand that person.

1446
01:25:08,954 --> 01:25:12,380
JANEYEH: Oh, I'm rooting for them,
TOD and TIME.

1447
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,780
TIMETHAI: See, you finally
got to witness it.

1448
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,140
JANEYEH: They didn't end up together,
but I get it.

1449
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,460
JANEYEH: Maybe it's all about timing.

1450
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:22,180
JANEYEH: TIME didn't know how TOD felt,
and TOD didn't dare to speak.

1451
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,060
JANEYEH: Because they talked
about things every night.

1452
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,780
TIMETHAI: They shared the same room too.

1453
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:25,700
JANEYEH: Shared the same room too.

1454
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,300
JANEYEH: But what he said was like,
you're not...

1455
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,740
JANEYEH: "You're not grossed out by me?"

1456
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,220
JANEYEH: Oh, I can't handle
lines like this.

1457
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,020
CRIS: Really can't handle it.

1458
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:31,940
RUSAMEEKAE: This is so heavy.

1459
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,300
JANEYEH: This one's so heavy.

1460
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,420
CRIS: Shocked.

1461
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,220
JANEYEH: Shocked.

1462
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,100
CRIS: Shocked, confused.

1463
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,060
RUSAMEEKAE: She collapsed
to the floor, viewers.

1464
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,980
CRIS: Crawling to get the napkin.

1465
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:47,700
CRIS: Well...

1466
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:50,746
CRIS: Honestly, if I put it all
together, speaking maturely, I think...

1467
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:53,660
CRIS: Everyone is honest
with their own feelings.

1468
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,060
CRIS: It's a good thing, but...

1469
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:58,780
CRIS: For me, seeing TOD
throughout the season...

1470
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,260
CRIS: The fact that
he didn't say anything

1471
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:07,258
CRIS: might be the best thing for
him now and in the future,

1472
01:26:07,258 --> 01:26:08,420
CRIS: so that he

1473
01:26:08,634 --> 01:26:11,770
CRIS: can keep TIME in his life
for a long time.

1474
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,300
TIMETHAI: This might be the best answer.

1475
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,994
CRIS: This might be the best timing.

1476
01:26:16,954 --> 01:26:19,580
RUSAMEEKAE: So we surely believe that
when they step out,

1477
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,146
RUSAMEEKAE:
he'll be a bro and a friend.

1478
01:26:21,146 --> 01:26:22,460
RUSAMEEKAE: A really good one, right?

1479
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:26,540
RUSAMEEKAE: They'll be very close friends
and look after each other like this.

1480
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:27,500
RUSAMEEKAE: And see each other grow.

1481
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:31,580
RUSAMEEKAE: Alright, now it's just
SUNNY left alone.

1482
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,900
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME has two choices left.

1483
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,420
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes or no.

1484
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:38,660
RUSAMEEKAE: Because TIME still has
the right to say no.

1485
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,140
RUSAMEEKAE:
So, viewers, let's see how

1486
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,700
RUSAMEEKAE: this game will end.

1487
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,660
TIME: How should I start?

1488
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:48,058
CRIS: So cute, right?

1489
01:26:48,282 --> 01:26:49,210
TIME: Let's start from the first day.

1490
01:26:49,306 --> 01:26:50,180
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh wow.

1491
01:26:55,994 --> 01:27:00,058
TIME: As soon as you arrived, I asked,
"Hey, can you get down? Need my help?"

1492
01:27:01,498 --> 01:27:04,220
TIME: And that moment
when we locked eyes,

1493
01:27:04,794 --> 01:27:06,780
TIME: I felt like there was
something there.

1494
01:27:11,258 --> 01:27:12,580
TIME: And...

1495
01:27:14,298 --> 01:27:15,940
TIME: Seeing you often...

1496
01:27:22,202 --> 01:27:24,060
RUSAMEEKAE: They seem shy, right?

1497
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:29,754
TIME: I started feeling good
about you, SUNNY.

1498
01:27:29,754 --> 01:27:32,380
TIME: I started feeling good
about you, SUNNY.

1499
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,020
RUSAMEEKAE: And then?

1500
01:27:34,522 --> 01:27:35,460
CRIS: Can you handle it?

1501
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,540
CRIS: It's the end.

1502
01:27:38,618 --> 01:27:40,940
CRIS: I really believe
in this kind of initial spark.

1503
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:41,700
- RUSAMEEKAE: Right?
- CRIS: Yes.

1504
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:42,260
CRIS: It...

1505
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:44,420
CRIS: Nothing can kill it.

1506
01:27:50,234 --> 01:27:51,700
TIME: It's the first time

1507
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:57,300
TIME: I truly felt
my own feelings like...

1508
01:27:57,914 --> 01:27:59,450
TIME: I really like this person.

1509
01:28:02,682 --> 01:28:03,980
TIME: Really shocked.

1510
01:28:05,434 --> 01:28:06,700
TIME: SUNNY,

1511
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:08,460
TIME: I chose you yesterday.

1512
01:28:10,138 --> 01:28:11,340
TIME: I choose you today.

1513
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,618
TIME: And I'll continue to choose
you tomorrow.

1514
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:18,874
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

1515
01:28:18,874 --> 01:28:20,538
TIMETHAI: Here we go.

1516
01:28:20,538 --> 01:28:21,500
CRIS: Boy.

1517
01:28:22,842 --> 01:28:24,300
JANEYEH: The top with the top.

1518
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,540
TIME: I'll continue to choose
you tomorrow.

1519
01:28:27,546 --> 01:28:28,900
SUNNY: So cute.

1520
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,016
(I chose you yesterday, choose you
today, and will choose you tomorrow)

1521
01:28:31,546 --> 01:28:33,420
RUSAMEEKAE:
He's saying it right these days.

1522
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,820
CRIS: Oh, how sweet.

1523
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,643
TIME: Okay.

1524
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:48,570
SUNNY: Wow, you're such a smooth talker.
I'm going to be blushing for a while.

1525
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:50,100
CRIS: That's cute.

1526
01:28:52,826 --> 01:28:54,300
TIMETHAI: She's becoming more ladylike.

1527
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,482
CRIS: Suddenly so small.

1528
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:56,980
TIMETHAI: She's just turned
into a little girl.

1529
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:00,890
RUSAMEEKAE: So excited!

1530
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,340
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm so excited!

1531
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,168
JANEYEH: So intense.

1532
01:29:08,186 --> 01:29:09,340
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh wow.

1533
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,420
CRIS: But this couple is
so natural, right?

1534
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:12,420
JANEYEH: Very natural.

1535
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,658
(The chemistry works)
CRIS: So natural.

1536
01:29:13,658 --> 01:29:14,060
CRIS: It's natural like...

1537
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:16,940
CRIS: natural since the first day
they went on a date.

1538
01:29:16,986 --> 01:29:18,522
CRIS: It's cute.

1539
01:29:18,682 --> 01:29:19,180
CRIS: I think it's cute.

1540
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:22,138
RUSAMEEKAE: I like that one thing
TIME said to SUNNY, what was it?

1541
01:29:22,138 --> 01:29:23,514
TIMETHAI: I chose you yesterday,

1542
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,442
TIMETHAI: today, and tomorrow.

1543
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:25,306
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

1544
01:29:25,306 --> 01:29:26,906
TIMETHAI: Darn, okay, okay.

1545
01:29:26,906 --> 01:29:27,820
(Need to note this)
JANEYEH: Jot it down.

1546
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:28,700
CRIS: Jot it down.

1547
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,700
RUSAMEEKAE: So deep,
let's hear it for them!

1548
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:36,220
JANEYEH: And what about NAMNUNG,
what's NAMNUNG going to do next?

1549
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,980
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, NAMNUNG, dear.

1550
01:29:50,394 --> 01:29:52,380
NAMNUNG: But considering
the current situation...

1551
01:29:52,442 --> 01:29:55,620
NAMNUNG: This might be the best outcome.

1552
01:29:56,602 --> 01:30:02,682
NAMNUNG: If I had shown them I wanted
to choose them, or was into them,

1553
01:30:02,682 --> 01:30:04,260
NAMNUNG: things would have
been different completely.

1554
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:10,042
NAMNUNG: Even though in the end,
I might walk out alone.

1555
01:30:10,234 --> 01:30:13,580
NAMNUNG: But I don't regret
the time I chose at all.

1556
01:30:15,418 --> 01:30:20,300
NAMNUNG: And anyway, in the real life,
there's no going back to change things.

1557
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,980
NAMNUNG: I just have to accept it and...

1558
01:30:22,298 --> 01:30:23,900
NAMNUNG: think about the future.

1559
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:25,274
NAMNUNG: Yes.

1560
01:30:28,154 --> 01:30:29,178
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

1561
01:30:33,146 --> 01:30:39,140
NAMNUNG: No matter what path everyone chooses,
or how their relationships change from here on,

1562
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:44,026
NAMNUNG: I'll be supporting them.
I'd love for them to do a recap sometime.

1563
01:30:44,410 --> 01:30:46,220
(Even though the walk along path X
has ended, love doesn't stop just here.)

1564
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:48,410
(Because your shining self is the reason
"love" keeps going... without end.)

1565
01:31:03,386 --> 01:31:06,170
JANEYEH: Honestly, I was rooting
for SUNNY and NAMNUNG.

1566
01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:10,700
JANEYEH: I understand, perhaps due to
various missed timings.

1567
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:12,940
JANEYEH: Actually, NAMNUNG and SUNNY
have good feelings for each other.

1568
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:14,060
JANEYEH: Truly, but in the end...

1569
01:31:14,106 --> 01:31:16,260
JANEYEH: really, it might not be
the right time now.

1570
01:31:16,282 --> 01:31:19,020
RUSAMEEKAE: We hope that one day...

1571
01:31:19,418 --> 01:31:22,500
RUSAMEEKAE: We, ourselves, and
the fans watching,

1572
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,180
RUSAMEEKAE: will get to see
both SUNNY and NAMNUNG.

1573
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:27,980
CRIS: Honestly, I'm rooting
for every couple.

1574
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:32,140
CRIS: I'm rooting for all couples for
the impressions. Each couple is unique.

1575
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:35,820
CRIS: But those I like and find joyful
rather than headache-inducing

1576
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:37,860
CRIS: Like the two couples
that are steady.

1577
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:40,700
CRIS: Like ASSE with CHERRY,
and JUNSU with FRAME.

1578
01:31:40,826 --> 01:31:42,460
CRIS: Watching them makes me feel happy.

1579
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:43,500
RUSAMEEKAE: Easy to cheer for.

1580
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:44,380
CRIS: Easy to cheer for.

1581
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:45,180
CRIS: Shippable.

1582
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,300
CRIS: Delightful to watch.

1583
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,860
CRIS: This one here.

1584
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,100
TIMETHAI: I've never watched
anyone else's life until...

1585
01:31:51,802 --> 01:31:54,810
TIMETHAI: Normally, I'd walk away
from other people's matters, but...

1586
01:31:54,906 --> 01:31:58,060
TIMETHAI: it's a new feeling
that makes me feel...

1587
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,900
TIMETHAI: I don't see genders,
just see them as two people.

1588
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:00,500
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

1589
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,980
TIMETHAI: Oh, is this what
the feeling is like?

1590
01:32:02,042 --> 01:32:05,660
RUSAMEEKAE: Thank you for everyone
being themselves.

1591
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:08,860
RUSAMEEKAE: And for daring to be open
with themselves.

1592
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:14,330
RUSAMEEKAE: Daring to come out and open
their hearts to everyone, even though

1593
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:18,540
RUSAMEEKAE: some things return as
smiles, happiness, or sadness.

1594
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,180
RUSAMEEKAE: Or even tears, indeed.

1595
01:32:20,186 --> 01:32:22,380
RUSAMEEKAE: Please give a round
of applause for all the participants.

1596
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,860
CRIS: You guys did great.

1597
01:32:24,314 --> 01:32:26,554
TIMETHAI: Everyone's spoken their mind.

1598
01:32:26,618 --> 01:32:31,100
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes. I'd like to say thanks
for the journey over these past 12 days.

1599
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:33,580
RUSAMEEKAE: We started
with the symbol X.

1600
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:36,380
RUSAMEEKAE: A sign of endless change.

1601
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:40,060
RUSAMEEKAE: Ending with stability
on the day of confessions.

1602
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,620
CRIS: Thank you to all 12 people
for showing love beyond

1603
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,060
CRIS: any definition.

1604
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,620
CRIS: Embracing all the uncertainties
in life.

1605
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,860
CRIS: Total freedom.

1606
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,140
CRIS: Thank you
to all the viewers as well

1607
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:52,410
CRIS: for traveling with us
so delightfully.

1608
01:32:52,506 --> 01:32:53,660
(It's just the beginning)
CRIS: And this is only season one.

1609
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,226
CRIS: There's a little hint.

1610
01:32:55,226 --> 01:32:55,866
TIMETHAI: Oops!

1611
01:32:55,866 --> 01:32:57,140
RUSAMEEKAE: Pain.

1612
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,140
RUSAMEEKAE: Pain.

1613
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:58,940
CRIS: No, it's the excitement.

1614
01:32:59,100 --> 01:32:59,820
RUSAMEEKAE: Excitement.

1615
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:00,660
CRIS: The excitement.

1616
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:01,980
CRIS: The mess.

1617
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:04,220
CRIS: Will there be a season 2?

1618
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:07,380
(Keep supporting us)
CRIS: Stay tuned for the next season.

1619
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:08,620
(Same time?)
TIMETHAI: 6 PM Beijing Time on WeTV.

1620
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,300
CRIS: No.

1621
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,460
JANEYEH: Not yet.

1622
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,260
CRIS: Give them some time
to do the shoot.

1623
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:16,700
CRIS: Now, thank you all for following
us through to the end of this season.

1624
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,140
CRIS: It's so much fun with the show,

1625
01:33:18,266 --> 01:33:20,122
RUSAMEEKAE: Borderless Love,

1626
01:33:20,122 --> 01:33:21,500
RUSAMEEKAE: LOVE(X).

1627
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,860
RUSAMEEKAE: See you next season, bye!

1628
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:27,740
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's suffer together
next season.

1629
01:33:35,386 --> 01:33:36,661
(Is X actually over?)

1630
01:33:39,194 --> 01:33:42,170
(Q: The show's over, do you have any
expectations or plans for the future?)

1631
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,538
TOD: We never know
what the future holds.

1632
01:33:44,634 --> 01:33:47,514
TOD: Because nobody knows
what will happen in the future, right?

1633
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,900
TOD: Let it go with our feelings.

1634
01:33:50,938 --> 01:33:52,500
TOD: Whether it's TOD and TIME.

1635
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,220
TOD: To make it happen, we have to ask
the other side too what they want.

1636
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:58,394
TOD: Whether to develop the relationship
or feelings further than before.

1637
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:02,980
KONG: Well, I hope that after the show
ends, we'll get to talk more.

1638
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:05,860
KONG: And hopefully develop
into being a couple.

1639
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:10,580
SUNNY: The show might be over,
but now TIME and I have to see

1640
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:13,498
SUNNY: how we fit into each other's
lives in the real world.

1641
01:34:13,498 --> 01:34:15,700
NAMNUNG: I hope that in the real world,

1642
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,978
NAMNUNG: when we return
to our own lives,

1643
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:21,780
NAMNUNG: if we have some free time,
I'd like everyone to

1644
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:25,740
NAMNUNG: plan small get-togethers
for meals sometimes.

1645
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,820
MATHEUS: We've already
checked Instagram,

1646
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,100
MATHEUS: and now social media contacts,

1647
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,700
MATHEUS: so that we'll keep in touch.

1648
01:34:30,906 --> 01:34:33,300
FRAME: I want to see
how it goes from here.

1649
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,674
FRAME: But I don't expect that

1650
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,940
FRAME: I have to be in a relationship
with him or anything like that.

1651
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:40,020
FRAME: I want it to happen
naturally, and

1652
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,060
FRAME: I don't want to rush,
I want it to go step by step.

1653
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,660
ASSE: And we've planned to go on a date,

1654
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,580
ASSE: to have a meal

1655
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,460
ASSE: just like ordinary people.

1656
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,860
ASSE: After that, we don't plan much.

1657
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:55,340
ASSE: We'll just take it step by step.

1658
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:57,260
ASSE: Because we don't want
to rush anything.

1659
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:00,060
ASSE: Because love takes time.

1660
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:04,460
CHERRY: I truly want to thank everyone
in the house, all the 11 of you.

1661
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:05,914
CHERRY: I feel that everyone is like

1662
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:10,540
CHERRY: helping each other. Even if we
played competitive games and activities,

1663
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:14,140
CHERRY: we made it feel, okay,
like turning around and getting,

1664
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:17,540
CHERRY: They call it like getting
a new home or something like that.

1665
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,906
TIME: Continue.

1666
01:35:23,578 --> 01:35:25,020
TOD: Thank you, thank you.

1667
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:34,842
JUNSU: No, no.

1668
01:35:35,002 --> 01:35:36,205
TOD: Can I have one shell, please?

1669
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,660
SUNNY: But honestly,
I want to thank everyone

1670
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:49,274
SUNNY: for opening your hearts
to each other

1671
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:52,180
SUNNY: without setting limits
to what love can be.

1672
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:56,940
TIME: I just want to thank everyone
for making me happy today.

1673
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,140
NAMNUNG: Love you.

1674
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:01,180
MATHEUS: I just wish them all the best
for the future.

1675
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,418
JOY: I want to thank all my friends.

1676
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,700
JUNSU: I love everyone.

1677
01:36:06,074 --> 01:36:07,214
(Heartfelt thanks to the 12 companions
for exploring the spectrum of love)

1678
01:36:07,214 --> 01:36:07,930
(with your "courage and sincerity".)

1679
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:10,810
(Heartfelt thanks to the artists who listen
to every "sincerity" and embrace it warmly.)

1680
01:36:11,226 --> 01:36:13,530
(Heartfelt thanks to all our "X"
for making every heart beat as one.)

1681
01:36:13,882 --> 01:36:16,922
(May every brave heart
find sparkle in its own story.)
