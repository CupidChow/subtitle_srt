165
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:53,952
(Endless love journey)

166
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:55,072
(Hidden traces)

167
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,104
(Maze of identities)
MARIO: The atmosphere is romantic.

168
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,048
CANDIDATE: I came to play...

169
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:05,248
(Join a journey) - RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, they're
holding hands. - MARIO: I got goosebumps.

170
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,864
(Into Boundless Romance)
TIMETHAI: Oh, I've got goosebumps.

171
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,864
CRIS: They won't let us see
anyone's face, right?

172
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,384
RUSAMEEKAE: You said
you couldn't see faces, but I did.

173
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:13,624
CRIS: What did you see?

174
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,704
RUSAMEEKAE: Everyone has a great figure.

175
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,184
RUSAMEEKAE: Arm muscles.

176
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:20,919
RUSAMEEKAE: They're
definitely attractive.

177
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:22,724
CRIS: Of course, look at their figures.

178
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:25,264
RUSAMEEKAE: This show is good.

179
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,984
RUSAMEEKAE: I just saw something.
Did anyone see?

180
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:28,024
MARIO: What?

181
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,624
RUSAMEEKAE: The guys kissed.

182
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,792
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm excited.
I can't wait any longer.

183
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,562
MARIO: I'm excited. I wonder
what will happen.

184
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:38,168
CRIS: I'm starting to swoon.

185
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:41,384
RUSAMEEKAE: I have to say, in this show,
there is a rule. It is...

186
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:48,864
RUSAMEEKAE: There will be no disclosure
of the candidates' sexuality.

187
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:50,104
CRIS: It's kind of...

188
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:50,984
RUSAMEEKAE: It's like
they all came together.

189
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:55,624
RUSAMEEKAE: But not allowed to say who
likes women and who likes men, or whatever.

190
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:56,864
(Hiding the sexual orientation)
RUSAMEEKAE: It's not allowed to tell it.

191
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,400
CRIS: So it's like open relationship?

192
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,464
RUSAMEEKAE: Open.

193
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:03,504
JANEYEH: So, we have to guess it.
Like, we have to sense it, or like

194
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:05,784
(Observing)
JANEYEH: using our instincts.

195
00:09:05,784 --> 00:09:06,544
TIMETHAI: It's not
that we have to guess.

196
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,184
TIMETHAI: It's them who have to guess
on their own.

197
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:09,824
(Guessing)
JANEYEH: Can we help guess it?

198
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:11,944
RUSAMEEKAE: TIMETHAI,
we also have to guess it.

199
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,144
JANEYEH: We have to watch and guess it.

200
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,144
RUSAMEEKAE: The gaydar is...

201
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:16,664
RUSAMEEKAE: Your gaydar
is not broken, right, MARIO?

202
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:17,944
MARIO: Not broken.

203
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,024
(Gaydar is ready)

204
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,584
RUSAMEEKAE: Because
we need to use a gaydar.

205
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:22,224
(Gaydar, Gaydar)
RUSAMEEKAE: Use every kind of skills.

206
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:25,864
RUSAMEEKAE: I will use the skills from
when I worked at Suvarnabhumi Airport.

207
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:27,384
MARIO: Huh? Really?

208
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:28,184
TIMETHAI: How is that related?

209
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:31,624
RUSAMEEKAE: Skills
for sniffing out tourists.

210
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:33,464
RUSAMEEKAE: So, that's my gaydar.

211
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:34,424
MARIO: Isn't that a cat?

212
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,664
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, MARIO, I wasn't joking.

213
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:37,464
MARIO: I'm sorry.

214
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:38,344
RUSAMEEKAE: I shouldn't have said that.

215
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,344
RUSAMEEKAE: It requires skills, CRIS.
Use a gaydar.

216
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,184
CRIS: Wait, tell me.

217
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,984
CRIS: When you walk into a party,

218
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,864
CRIS: and the entire room
is packed with people,

219
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:54,344
CRIS: can your gaydar detect if someone
shares your sexual orientation?

220
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,584
(Checking gaydar quality)

221
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,864
RUSAMEEKAE: When I want to check,
I go for the drunkest person,

222
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:00,384
RUSAMEEKAE: because that person
might have the least consciousness.

223
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:02,544
CRIS: Take it seriously.
I need practical advice.

224
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,624
MARIO: Seriously, RUSAMEEKAE.

225
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:05,984
RUSAMEEKAE: Seriously?

226
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:07,904
RUSAMEEKAE: You know I don't know
the answer to that.

227
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,704
TIMETHAI: But what if it's a woman?

228
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,544
(Seriously?)

229
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:14,624
MARIO: No way!

230
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:15,424
CRIS: It's a woman.

231
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,248
(What now, RUSAMEEKAE?)

232
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:21,584
RUSAMEEKAE: I will lock her
in the bathroom!

233
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:24,359
MARIO: Lock her?

234
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,584
RUSAMEEKAE: Honestly,
it's not like I think I'm good-looking.

235
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:29,264
RUSAMEEKAE: But when I'm hanging out...

236
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:30,224
TIMETHAI: You are good-looking.

237
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:32,144
RUSAMEEKAE: When I go to bars,
I never go home alone.

238
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,344
(Never go home alone)

239
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,624
CRIS: The answer is no answer.

240
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:38,592
(The answer is no answer)

241
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,664
RUSAMEEKAE: Well, there is, CRIS.

242
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:43,144
(Sexy) RUSAMEEKAE: I love
the backless style when hanging out.

243
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:43,944
RUSAMEEKAE: Dressing revealingly.

244
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:48,304
RUSAMEEKAE: Someone would love
touching my back.

245
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,904
RUSAMEEKAE: And I'll wake up
and find my wallet gone.

246
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,024
TIMETHAI: That's a pickpocket.

247
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:58,224
(Gaydar doesn't work) RUSAMEEKAE:
It's hard to tell these days.

248
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:58,824
- MARIO: Hard to tell.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

249
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,664
CRIS: But the point is, LOVE(X)

250
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:05,024
CRIS: made us five LOVE(X)PERTs,

251
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:06,864
CRIS: and they sent a quiz to us.

252
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,344
(Quiz)

253
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:11,704
(Psychological test)
CRIS: It's nothing but psychological stuff.

254
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,184
MARIO: Okay.

255
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:12,944
CRIS: About ten questions.

256
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,224
RUSAMEEKAE: The questions are like this.

257
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:19,296
(Example)
RUSAMEEKAE: Imagine you wake up

258
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:22,272
RUSAMEEKAE: next to the person you love,

259
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:24,624
RUSAMEEKAE: sunlight streaming down.

260
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:28,264
RUSAMEEKAE: In that moment
of pure happiness, what gender

261
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:30,544
RUSAMEEKAE: would be
that person in your mind?

262
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:34,064
CRIS: My answer is anything.

263
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,784
CRIS: I mean in that moment
of pure happiness,

264
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,168
CRIS: it could be male or female.

265
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:42,304
- CRIS: It doesn't say we hooked up last night.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Right.

266
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:46,984
RUSAMEEKAE: I answered anyone as long as
I don't wake up and see a monk.

267
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,785
(Proud)
TIMETHAI: You're done, bro.

268
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:51,264
MARIO: Wow.

269
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,064
MARIO: That's sinful.

270
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:55,064
RUSAMEEKAE: It's not like sleeping with
a monk. I mean chanting for my funeral.

271
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:56,504
RUSAMEEKAE: I wouldn't take that.

272
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:57,904
- CRIS: Death! You mean death.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Like...

273
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,704
RUSAMEEKAE: Like funeral chants.
Don't chant to me.

274
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,336
(Not dead yet!)

275
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:06,224
(Results out) CRIS: You got
your results next to you.

276

RUSAMEEKAE: Mine's Wave Blue.

280
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,472
(Wave Blue: Your sexuality is fluid, ever-shifting like the tide)
RUSAMEEKAE: Mine is Wave Blue. Fluid.

281
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,824
RUSAMEEKAE: Compared to others,
your instincts are sharper and deeper.

282
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,600
(Ready to hunt)

283
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,064
RUSAMEEKAE: Told you I worked
at Suvarnabhumi Airport.

284
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:27,648
(Former job)

285
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:29,984
RUSAMEEKAE: What about you, MARIO?

286
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,304
TIMETHAI: Please say it for me, MARIO.
We're the same.

287
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:35,784
(Same here) MARIO: Same as mine.
It's an alternative path

288
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:38,984
MARIO: in the world of love.
A warm, classic one like a rose.

289
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:40,224
JANEYEH: Wow.

290
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:43,424
RUSAMEEKAE: Why isn't MARIO bisexual?

291
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:47,091
TIMETHAI: Waiting for it.

292
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:48,128

293
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:49,760
(Unhappy)

294

MARIO: Wait! Let's redo the quiz!

295
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:54,064
MARIO: People change over time!

296
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:56,320

(Expecting)

299

(Sprout Green)
CRIS: Sprout Green.

300
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,984
CRIS: I've got bisexuality.

301
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,160
- MARIO: Coming.
- JANEYEH: Wow.

302
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:09,824
(Sprout Green: In your world, bisexuality means two paths)
CRIS: You are playful, humorous, and brave.

303
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:12,184
(of love and romance, shining like a vibrant green)
CRIS: You are playful, humorous, and brave.

304
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:16,984

blooming in awaited spring.

305
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,504
MARIO: Oh, wow.

306
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:20,024

(Wondering)

309
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:27,024
JANEYEH: Cyber Silver color.

310
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,694
(Cyber Silver: Queer. Beneath that polished chrome lies a core)
JANEYEH: It says you might look calm and composed,

311
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,064
(that defies definition. You are the future, now)
JANEYEH: or maybe not at all.

312
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:38,224
(Scan here to test)
CRIS: If you want to try,

313
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:41,696
CRIS: you can take this quiz.
Feel free to give it a try.

314
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,104
CRIS: See what your result will be.

315
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:48,624
RUSAMEEKAE: But honestly,
coming to a show like this.

316
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,704
RUSAMEEKAE: Joining a show like LOVE(X),

317
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,904
RUSAMEEKAE: there's one thing
I want to mention to the viewers

318
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:55,464
RUSAMEEKAE: about the changes
regarding gender diversity

319
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:58,904
RUSAMEEKAE: happening in Thailand.
That is, marriage equality.

320
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,224
RUSAMEEKAE: It's all set now.
We'll be seeing many couples,

321
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:05,264

industry and outside of it.

322
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:08,944
RUSAMEEKAE: People from all walks of life
are joining hands and getting married.

323
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:10,704

in our country, right?

324
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:11,944
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, it's been passed
in our country.

325
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,224
MARIO: Yes.

326
