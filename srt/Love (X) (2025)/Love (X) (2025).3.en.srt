NAMNUNG: But it looks really new.

6
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,266
TOD: Whatever we do is not wrong

7
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:11,066
TOD: at this moment,
because we know nothing.

8
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:11,866
TOD: Just do it first.

9
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,600
NAMNUNG: Right.

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,633
NAMNUNG: They didn't tell us,
so that means we're not wrong.

11
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:16,416

MATHEUS: Where's the trash?

21
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,933

TIME: Once we're here,
I feel like time flies.

30
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,266
NAMNUNG: But...

31
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,233
NAMNUNG: At first, I was afraid
there'd be nothing to do.

32
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,304
NAMNUNG: But it turned out
to go by so fast.

33
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,184
TIME: Yes, I understand.

34
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,312
NAMNUNG: But when I arrived,
it felt kind of disappointing.

35
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:24,000
NAMNUNG: Made such a cool entrance,
but no one was there to see.

36
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:25,888
NAMNUNG: You get it?

37
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:30,033
TIME: There was no one to welcome you.

38
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,033
- TIME: We had to welcome ourselves.
- NAMNUNG: Yeah, welcome ourselves.

39
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,766
TIME: Welcome ourselves. Yes.

40
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,033
TIME: But the last one...

41
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:42,500
TIME: The last one is curious
about how others came in.

42
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:51,133
TIME: If I arrive first,

43
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,192
TIME: I get to watch

44
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:53,966
TIME: everyone arrive

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,933
TIME: and how they greet each other.

46
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,433
TIME: Would they talk to me?
Stuff like that.

47
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:03,584
NAMNUNG: I get it.

48
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:07,616
TIME: But you're not
disappointed now, right?

49
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,100
NAMNUNG: But actually,
once I arrived here, I felt

50
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,992
NAMNUNG: that everyone
would make a decision very soon.

51
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:23,700
NAMNUNG: Each person, you know?

52
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,566
TIME: We only have 12 days.

53
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,933
TIME: It'll go very fast.

54
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:29,200
NAMNUNG: That's a whole 12 days.

55
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,566
TIME: It'll go by fast.

56
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:38,633
NAMNUNG: It's hard to explain,
but you could tell

57
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,800
NAMNUNG: who's checking out who
from the start.

58
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,266

59
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:44,352
NAMNUNG: I can tell.

60
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:48,256
NAMNUNG: Some people.

61
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:51,488
TIME: Some you can tell, but...

62
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,408
- NAMNUNG: Yes, some are obvious.
- TIME: There are those

63
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:55,500
TIME: who you can't tell at all.

64
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:57,728
NAMNUNG: So...

65
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,666
NAMNUNG: A bit disappointed, you know?

66
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,824
NAMNUNG: But it's okay.

67
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:02,866
NAMNUNG: It's the first day.

68
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,448

72
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:22,000
TIME: Okay.

73
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,352
TIME: NAMNUNG is someone
who's hard to read.

74
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:34,848
TIME: After talking,
it's still complicated.

75
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:37,152
TIME: What does she think?

76
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:41,900
TIME: That makes it hard to see
if she's interested in me.

77
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:45,100
JUNSU: You gonna check it out.

78

TOD: What is that?

178
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,616
TOD: It's not the entrance to Modern 1.

179
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:17,856
TIME: It leads to Modern 2 and 3,
but ours is Modern 1.

180
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:18,848
TOD: Oh, okay.

181
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:22,966

182
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,400
(Destiny)
TOD: That's good.

183

TOD: Go ahead.

184
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:26,866
TIME: Yes.

185
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:29,800
TIME: Left or right?

186
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:31,233
TOD: You choose first.

187
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:32,029
TIME: Okay.

188
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,344
TOD: Go ahead.

189
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:34,880
TIME: Turns out I'm the younger one.

190
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,584
TOD: Haha.

191
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,166
TOD: I guess.

192
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,500
TOD: TIME, which bed do you want?

193
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:39,466
TIME: What?

194
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:40,100
(Closing the door)
TOD: Which bed?

195
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,833
TIME: I'll take this bed.

196
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:41,984
TOD: Okay.

197
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,824
(Closing the door)

198
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,813
TOD: Okay, what should we write?

199
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,856
(Spectrum letter)
TIME: Who are we writing to?

200
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:53,833
TOD: Who will you write it for?
TIME, who will you write it for?

201
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:54,866
TIME: Okay.

202
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,000
- TOD: I know that.
- TIME: No.

203
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,133
TIME: I don't think you know.
I've changed my mind.

204
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:00,800
TOD: It's just the first day.

205
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,472
TOD: Have you changed your mind?

206
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,533
TIME: Can I ask something? Has anyone
given you a good first impression?

207
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,416
TIME: Is there anyone who makes you
want to know more about them?

208
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:17,666
TOD: We can say...

209
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,720
TOD: Can we say that?

210
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:21,266
(Thinking)

211
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,968
TOD: But I...
I trust the first impression.

212
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:26,400
TOD: First impression

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,264
TOD: is everything.

214
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,380
TIME: Yes, I feel the same.

215
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,704
TOD: How about you, TIME?
Your first impression.

216
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,271
TIME: When I walked in,

217
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,856
TIME: I observed NAMNUNG.
She's close to my type.

218
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,433
TIME: The closest one.

219
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,600
TIME: And SUNNY.

220
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,376
TIME: But it's probably
because we walked together.

221
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,456
TIME: So it just feels

222
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,736
TIME: a little familiar.

223
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,752
TOD: Oh, the combo of seeing her
up close and meeting first.

224
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:07,360
TOD: Can't believe
we aren't allowed to use our phones.

225
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:11,266
- TIME: Wow, totally forgot that.
- TOD: It's like a social detox.

226
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,700
TIME: I actually like it.

227
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,064
TIME: Because this will enable us

228
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:16,928
TIME: to focus more on ourselves.

229
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,464
TOD: Be with the person in front of you.

230
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,744
TOD: Without needing to tap the screen.

231
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,600
(Live in the present)
TIME: Yes, live in the present.

232
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,512
TOD: Sometimes we do it unconsciously.

233
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,533
TOD: Even if we do meet someone,

234
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,552
TOD: we may just focus on our phone.

235
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:28,281
TIME: Yes.

236
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:29,966
TIME: We're best friends, right?

237
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,700
(Best friends)
TIME: We are best friends.

238
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:39,386
TIME: On the third day,
we should go on a date.

239
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,900
(It is settled)
TOD: Okay.

240
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,533
TOD: Alright.

241
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:45,533
TOD: Alright.

242
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:46,976
TIME: Okay.

243
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,512
TIME: That date...

244
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,766
TIME: The most enjoyable date.

245
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,966
TOD: Okay. That's true.

246
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,687
TOD: Sure, I have to go.

247
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:58,433
TOD: Let's go.

248
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:01,433
MILL: But normally,

249
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:02,166
MILL: I stay up late.

250
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,653
- JOY: Who?
- MILL: MILL.

251
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,792
MILL: Until two or three.

252
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,366
MILL: There are nights
I'm still awake at four.

253
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:08,736
(Shocked)
JOY: Really?

254
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,833
MILL: Yeah.

255
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,766
MILL: I think

256
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,200
MILL: the time before bed

257
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,368
MILL: is when I get to be with myself.

258
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,088
MILL: Truly alone,

259
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:19,776
MILL: without anyone bothering me.

260
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:20,896
MILL: So,

261
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,208
MILL: I want to use that moment

262
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:23,866
MILL: for a long time.

263
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:25,824
MILL: Just browsing aimlessly.

264
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,232
JOY: I'm addicted to listening
to ghost stories.

265
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:34,048
MILL: Oh, really? I couldn't bear that.

266
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,424
JOY: Just like...

267
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:38,048
- JOY: I love ghost stories.
- MILL: I can't handle it at all.

268
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,800
MILL: I only watch clips.

269
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,266
MILL: Like, those that feature

270
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,066
MILL: male couples.

271
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,400
JOY: Huh?

272
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,933
MILL: I like opening mystery boxes,
stuff like that.

273
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,840
MILL: But seriously, I feel like

274
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:49,792
MILL: it goes by really fast.

275
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:50,533
JOY: It's time, right?

276
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,392
MILL: Yes.

277
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:53,933
MILL: I think our house

278
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:54,700
MILL: must be a house

279
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:55,333
MILL: that's funny.

280
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,568
MILL: That house probably has
a more mature vibe.

281
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,700
JOY: But it's funny.

282
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,566
JOY: That TIME

283
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,720
JOY: is funny.

284
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:05,664
MILL: The first time I saw TOD,

285
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:06,866
MILL: he reminded me of a celebrity.

286
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,500
MILL: I thought,

287
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:09,966
MILL: "Is he a host?"

288
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:11,233
MILL: When he walked closer,

289
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:12,900
MILL: he wasn't.
But his face is celeb-alike

290
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,400
MILL: very much.

291
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:15,433
MILL: So I thought,

292
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,568
MILL: "Isn't it?" No, it's not.

293
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:19,264
JOY: I was going

294
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:21,920
JOY: to tease the guys next door,
but it's raining.

295
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,966
MILL: Hmm.

296
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,488
MILL: I really want
to know about X-Land.

297
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:32,948
MILL: Where is it?

298
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:35,966
MILL: I wonder if we'll get
to go to X-Land.
