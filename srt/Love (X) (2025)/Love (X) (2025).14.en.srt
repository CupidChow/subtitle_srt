4
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,560
JANEYEH: What is this?

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,056

CRIS: So what?

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,656
JANEYEH: Who?

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, and how do they shower?

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,200
(Probably you) - NAMNUNG: Which girl are you
interested in? - SUNNY: Probably you.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,208
(Shy)
RUSAMEEKAE: They're blushing!

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,120
(Shipped until they become real)
CRIS: I didn't think it would be real.

15

(Eye contact)
SUNNY: What's the sexiest part of my body?

16
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:14,240
NAMNUNG: Your eyes.

17
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:15,560
TIMETHAI: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,200

between NAMNUNG and I.

00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:30,016

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,800
(CRIS, LOVE(X)PERT) RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY, NAMNUNG,
and TIME, which you viewers also see for these three,

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,720
RUSAMEEKAE: things aren't
quite settled yet.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,680
JANEYEH: Yes.

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,320

RUSAMEEKAE: Cat and dog.

31

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,840

there will be competition.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,800

(Waiting)
RUSAMEEKAE: And finally, who'll go to X-Land?

39
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:23,440
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to know,
let's watch together.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,040
CRIS: Starting with a game
is also tough.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,360

CHERRY: And I haven't started
anything yet.

to take someone I'm interested in.

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
(Looks to the right)
JANEYEH: Oh, who is he looking at?

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,760
CRIS: Who was TOD looking at like this?

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,440

(Next, let TOD and KONG
choose partners first.)

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,856
KONG: We have to separate, right?

64
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:02,640
(Asks for confirmation)
TOD: Yes.

65
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,320
KONG: If answered honestly,
I'm disappointed.

66
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:09,024
KONG: I would really love to play
every game with TOD, if possible.

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,520
JANEYEH: Oh!

68
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360

74

(KONG chooses NAMNUNG)
KONG: NAMNUNG.

75
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,960

from partnering TOD.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,024
- JANEYEH: Strategic, huh?
- CRIS: TOD.

77
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,440

so much about?

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,760

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
CRIS: Oh, I feel sorry for MILL.

91
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,360
(Hug) TOD: I have to choose
TIME as a partner anyway.

93
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:22,320
TOD: Not just to win the game.

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,576

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,840

ALL: Hey!

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,272

CRIS: Holding like this is okay. No need to hold like that!

131
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:19,904
JANEYEH: It has to be...
Like this, interlaced fingers like this.

132

137
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,080
- JANEYEH: "What is this?"
- CRIS: She's confused now.

138
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,480

'What? What's going on?'

139
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:46,160
(Looks)
RUSAMEEKAE: Shy.

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,840

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,832
- TIMETHAI: Ah! Hold tight so it won't slip.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, they have to grip it.

142

(Noses touching)

143

he's about to faint.

- JANEYEH: Ow!
- TIMETHAI: Wait, wait!

150
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:40,280
JANEYEH: Ow! Aren't they too close?

151
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,072
(Snuggling close)

152
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:48,520

161
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,080
TIMETHAI: "What is this?"

162
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
(Looks)
JANEYEH: Oh wow, oh wow!

163
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,080
JANEYEH: Kissed on the cheek!

164
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,800

167
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Stunned silence!

168
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,632
NAMNUNG: There's something
between those two, you know?

169
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,680
RUSAMEEKAE: It's not just you
thinking that alone, sweetie.

170
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,520
JANEYEH: Everyone in the world
thinks the same, sweetie.

171
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,440
JUNSU: Faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster!

172
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,960
CRIS: Ow! I'm going crazy!

173
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:43,008
(Countdown)

174
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,272
MILL: Yay! Good job! Good job!

175
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,960
JANEYEH: Interlacing fingers again.

176
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,640
(Gently taps)
JANEYEH: Grabbed his butt again.

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,960
(Please welcome the next pair.)

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,400
JANEYEH: Go SUNNY! Go for it!

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
TIME: You got this.

180
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,650
(JUNSU, FRAME are here too)

181
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,216
(Holding hands firmly)

182
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:26,464
(Reaching out)

183
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:28,720
(Holds hands)
RUSAMEEKAE: Haha!

184
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,600
(Unable to hide his feeling)

185
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,920
CRIS: JUNSU is so cute!

186
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,640
MILL: JUNSU's getting excited now!

187
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,400
CHERRY: Keep fighting!

188
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,920
(If you're ready...)

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,880
CHERRY: You got this, FRAME.

190
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,240
(Start!)

191
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,024
(Dodging)

192
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,088
MILL: Dancing! Dancing!

193
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:49,840
CHERRY: For real!

194
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:52,954
(On the dance floor)

195
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:54,640
(Two "dancers")

196
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,000
(They lost in "their own world")
RUSAMEEKAE: Not thinking about the game.

197
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,816
TOD: Started from the very beginning.

198
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,512
MILL: Like... like dancing?
Dancing! Dancing!

199
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:02,560
(Embracing)

200
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
CRIS: JUNSU is cute.

201
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,320
JANEYEH: He looks so happy.

202
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,760
- CRIS: Wait, wait!
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oops, oops!

203
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:15,520
(Tight hug)

204
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,176
(Light stomping)

205
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,192
(Getting closer)

206
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:21,536
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh wow!

207
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:24,832
(Even closer)

208
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:25,800
JANEYEH: Oh my god!

209
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,632
(Grabs)

210
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:43,104
(Scoring)

211
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:43,920
MILL: Got it, run fast!

212
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,720
(Countdown: 3)
CHERRY: Fast, fast, FRAME, faster!

213
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:45,760
(Countdown: 2)
TIME: Got it! Got it!

214
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,160
(Countdown 1)

215
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,240
CHERRY: Good job!

216
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG, smile a bit, dear.

217
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
(Next, please welcome the next pair.)

218
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,680
KONG: NAMNUNG is also someone
who's so serious about playing games.

219
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,920
KONG: She has determination and
mindfulness when playing games.

220
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,480
NAMNUNG: Yes.

221
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,320
NAMNUNG: I hope I can get to X-Land.

222
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,648
(If you're ready...)

223
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,400
(Start!)

224
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,994
(Starts first)

225
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:26,480
(Speeds up)
JANEYEH: Whoa, charged out so fast.

226
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,720
(Sprinting past)
RUSAMEEKAE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

227
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,840
(Speeds up)
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, so fast!

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,040
(Making the first move)
CRIS: They're playing so seriously!

229
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
(Getting closer)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh! MATHEUS has to crouch down.

230
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,920
JANEYEH: Any minute now, his legs
are going to give out.

231
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:41,344
(Steps forward confidently)

232
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,384
(A lightning-fast lead)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops! This pair is so fast!

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,256
MILL: MATHEUS has
a very strong desire to win.

234
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:52,320
(Using MATHEUS's strength alone) MILL: Pure power,
he carried me on his legs, walking like this.

235
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,120
CRIS: Good job, MATHEUS!

236
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Really fighting for it!

237
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,240
NAMNUNG: Okay, stay calm.

238
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:57,536
(Got 3 roses already)
CANDIDATE: Fight!

239
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,520
MILL: Slowly... yes, yes.

240
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

241
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,400
CRIS: Oops! Faster!

242
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,481
(Countdown)

243
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:13,056
JUNSU: Good job! Good job!

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
TOD: You did well!

245
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:15,920
KONG: Really?

246
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,720
TOD: Good job! Good job!

247
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:19,328
(MATHEUS/MILL 6 roses)
- MATHEUS: So easy. - MILL: Yeah, yeah.

248
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:22,496
(First round: TIME/TOD 8 roses, MATHEUS/MILL 6 roses, KONG/NAMNUNG 6 roses,
JUNSU/FRAME 6 roses, JOY/SUNNY 5 roses, ASSE/CHERRY 2 roses)

249
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:26,480
(We are now entering the second round
of the competition.)

250
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,040
CRIS: There's more?

251
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, there is.

252
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,360
TIMETHAI: Whoa.

253
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Ouch.

254
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,880
(This is everyone's last chance
to earn a spot for X-Land.)

255
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
JANEYEH: SUNNY's losing hope,
she looks dazed.

256
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,360
(Round 1 winners) (The winning teams from
the previous round get first pick for partners.)

257
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,920
(The others can form pairs freely.)

258
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,840
(But you cannot pair with
the same partner as the previous round.)

259
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,560
RUSAMEEKAE: They all need new partners.

260
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,640
(Now, the previous round's
top-ranked team)

261
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,880
(TOD and TIME step up to choose first.)

262
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,584
(TIME and TOD chooses first)

263
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,280
CRIS: I'm so afraid
TIME will pick SUNNY.

264
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,640
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME will definitely
pick NAMNUNG.

265
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,440
TOD: You choose first.

266
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:12,120
(Who will TIME choose as partner?)

267
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,056
RUSAMEEKAE: Is it NAMNUNG?

268
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh no, this is intense!

269
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,920
CRIS: SUNNY.

270
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,760
TIME: SUNNY.

271
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,640
TIME: SUNNY.

272
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,440
CRIS: See?

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,800
CRIS: See?

274
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
TIMETHAI: It had to be this way.

275
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,840
JANEYEH: Hmm, lots of
unhappy faces here.

276
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,480
JANEYEH: Forced smiles everywhere.

277
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,160
JANEYEH: This is so intense.

278
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
CRIS: Nah, but he couldn't choose
NAMNUNG anyway.

279
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,920
CRIS: They just can't work together.

280
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,560
TIMETHAI: It's too awkward,
they haven't even talked.

281
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,440
TOD: NAMNUNG.

282
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,000
CRIS: Ooh!

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,040
JANEYEH: Oh, my God!

284
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
TIMETHAI: Oh, what was that?

285
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,304
TIMETHAI: Perfect match.

286
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
JANEYEH: Got goosebumps!

287
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:57,320
JANEYEH: KONG looks so sad.

288
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Four-way heartbreak.

289
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
KONG: MILL.

290
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:02,920
(KONG and MILL chose each other)

291
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,520
JUNSU: Me and...

292
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,256
JOY: Okay.

293
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:05,360
(Self-paired)
JUNSU: It's not easy.

294
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,600
CRIS: ASSE and JUNSU?

295
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,288
(FRAME and CHERRY self-paired)

296
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
(MATHEUS and JOY self-paired)
JOY: It's okay, we're still partners.

297
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
(Game rules:)

298
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:16,360
(Two players per team.)

299
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,200
(One does sit-ups and passes a rose
by mouth to their partner.)

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,920
(The partner can only use their mouth
to receive the rose.)

301
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,160
(When time is up, the number of roses
transferred becomes the team's score.)

302
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,304
JUNSU: So beautiful.

303
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,760
NAMNUNG: To spend more time with
the one I like, I'll give it my all.

304
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,560
KONG: Wanna try?

305
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,440
MILL: You want to? Let's go.

306
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:51,320
(KONG and MILL enter the arena)

307
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,840
KONG: I've been leading in
both games so far.

308
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,280
KONG: So I think...
yeah, I have a chance.

309
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,280
KONG: There's a good percentage that
it'll be me going to X-Land with TOD.

310
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
JANEYEH: You've been there before.

311
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,120
TIMETHAI: Yeah.

312
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
(Looks)
MILL: Last chance. Keep fighting!

313
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,080
(MATHEUS and JOY enter the arena)
- NAMNUNG: MATHEUS, fight! - TOD: MATHEUS, fight!

314
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,840
MATHEUS: And it was the truth,
I was indeed the best one.

315
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
MATHEUS: And I really,
really want to win.

316
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,360
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS has always
wanted to win.

317
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,264
(CHERRY and FRAME enter the arena)
KONG: Keep fighting!

318
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,984
JUNSU: Let's go!

319
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:22,912
(ASSE and JUNSU enter the arena)

320
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,536
RUSAMEEKAE: Everyone's dead serious
about winning this round.

321
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:26,440
- JANEYEH: True.
- TIMETHAI: True.

322
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
RUSAMEEKAE: This game is nerve-wracking.

323
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:29,952
(3,)

324
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:32,576
(2,)

325
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
(1.)

326
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,840
CRIS: Wow, SUNNY's shaking
her head wildly!

327
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,960
- RUSAMEEKAE: Ow!
- JANEYEH: Oh my god!

328
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,560
CRIS: Oh my god!

329
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,880
JANEYEH: Hey hey!

330
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,240
CRIS: SUNNY!

331
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,800
JANEYEH: Ouch, ouch!

332
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:00,832
JANEYEH: Whoa!

333
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:01,760
TIMETHAI: There's so much stem left!

334
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,560
CRIS: The other side,
two meters of stem left!

335
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:06,840
JANEYEH: Whoa!

336

aiming for the flower!

(Glances sideways)

338
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,800

Bending all the way down.

346
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:34,176

CRIS: MATHEUS is just too much.

347

RUSAMEEKAE: Ooh.

348
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,080
CRIS: Can do so?

super stressed, girl.

RUSAMEEKAE: So, who won second place?

379
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:51,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't let it be TIME.
I don't want any love triangle drama.

TIMETHAI: Even with a broken arm!

387
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,512
CRIS: With a broken arm,
he goes easy on them.

388
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,080
TIME: If MATHEUS takes you,

389
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,424

390
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,800

to go to X-Land, things like this?

if he wants to risk it.

choosing her.

JOY likes him?

RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

425
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,920

he'd probably pick JOY.

living together, you still don't know?

my shoes and throwing them.

It'd be weird if he chose TIME, right?

495

in the same room anymore.

498

are you going all out?

499

in that suit, you look amazing!

(Turns away to smile)

504
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,320
CRIS: Stop buttering him up, TIME.

505
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,000
TIMETHAI: He's praising
his outfit again.

506
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
CRIS: Yeah, he's been praising
his pants since day one.

507
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:11,808
TIMETHAI: Yeah.

508
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:16,224
(Hesitates)

509
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:19,520
TIME: Excited for you, yay!

510
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,320
TIME: I'm happy for you.

511
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,160
TIMETHAI: Please don't.

512
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:21,984
RUSAMEEKAE: Please don't.

513
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,368
TIME: If you meet SUNNY...

514
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,160
JANEYEH: Ouch!

515
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,216
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, why mention SUNNY?

516
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:34,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Ouch, what's going on
with TOD?

517
00:23:38,912 --> 00:23:39,968
TOD: Should I stop by and tell her?

518
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:43,392
TOD: 'TIME misses you'? No?

519
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:46,688
TIME: No.

520
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,312
CRIS: I feel sorry for TOD.

521
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,720
TIME: Just take good care of her for me.

522
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,984
TIME: Just take good care of her for me.

523
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,248
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, how does TOD feel
about it then?

524
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,000
JANEYEH: I feel so sorry for TOD,
I feel like crying for him.

525
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,320
JANEYEH: That hurts.

526
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,800
JANEYEH: It makes him not dare
to speak up when TIME talks like that.

527
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,320
CRIS: Wouldn't it be better if you go
together and take care by yourself?

528
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:09,400
CRIS: I feel sorry for TOD.

529
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,600
TOD: We'll go then.

530
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,840
TOD: We'll go then.

531
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,200
CRIS: "We'll go then."

532
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm excited.

533
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:31,560
TIME: Next round.

534
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:32,640
CRIS: What?

535
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:34,464
TIME: Next round.

536
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,720
JANEYEH: "Next round?"
He's rejecting him?

537
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,160
TOD: You've got to go.

538
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,680
TOD: For sure.

539
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,880
CRIS: When TOD says "we'll go,"
he might mean this round.

540
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
- CRIS: But he puts it off to next time.
- JANEYEH: Yeah.

541
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,720
TIME: You are so sweet.

542
00:24:58,848 --> 00:24:59,744
TIME: So amazing.

543
00:25:01,408 --> 00:25:03,104
CRIS: TIME still keeps buttering him up.

544
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,768
CRIS: I really feel for TOD.

545
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,560
TIME: It's time.

546
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,088
(Looks up)

547
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,992
TOD: See you.

548
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,296
TOD: See you.

549
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,768
TIME: Bye-bye.

550
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:38,960
- TOD: I'll hurry back, I'll hurry back.
- TIME: Okay.

551
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,680
TIME: No need to rush.

552
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,320
TIME: No need to rush.

553
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:44,640
- TOD: Oh wow.
- TIME: Bye-bye.

554
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,544
(Turns to look)

555
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:55,680
CRIS: Oh, TOD, I feel sorry for him.

556
00:25:57,992 --> 00:25:59,554
JANEYEH: Oh man, so sad.

557
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,320
JANEYEH: I feel like crying.
Oh, I'm so bummed out.

558
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,008
CRIS: "Please take care of SUNNY for me."

559
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
JANEYEH: That's really harsh talk.

560
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,872
TIMETHAI: But it seems NAMNUNG can tell
who TOD likes.

561
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,600
CRIS: Yes.

562
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,560
RUSAMEEKAE: It seems like everyone
probably sees it.

563
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
JANEYEH: Except the person involved.

564
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,080
CRIS: I just feel sorry for TOD,
that's all.

565
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,032
JANEYEH: It's sad.

566
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:27,232
CRIS: No need to cry.
It's not our business.

567
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,248
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, it's not
our business. Yeah, let's start over.

568
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,912
RUSAMEEKAE: One, two, three,
alright, alright, alright.

569
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, it's not our business.

570
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,984
- RUSAMEEKAE: Why should we be sad?
- JANEYEH: Yeah.

571
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Should we go see
who TOD will choose to go to X-Land?

572
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,640
CRIS: Oops, here comes X-Land.

573
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:49,400
RUSAMEEKAE: The Godfather of Shanghai.

574
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,800
CRIS: Wow, TOD is really handsome.

575
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:54,624
TOD: Wow.

576
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,464
(Who will actually show up?)
CRIS: What now?

577
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,728
CRIS: Who's actually going to show up?

578
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:19,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey, hey!

579
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,496
CRIS: So exciting!
Did he already ask someone?

580
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow what?

581
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,640
- TIMETHAI: Oh!
- JANEYEH: Who is it?

582
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,776
CRIS: So beautiful.

583
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,960
CRIS: Whoa!

584
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:34,048
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG!

585
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,864
NAMNUNG: TOD.

586
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:38,752
TIMETHAI: It's TOD again.

587
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:40,032
TOD: Hello.

588
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,392
TOD: Let's go to X-Land together.

589
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,312
TOD: Let's go to X-Land together.

590
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:47,104
NAMNUNG: Me?

591
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,064
JANEYEH: She's so shocked!

592
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:50,208
(Offering rose)

593
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:51,560
(Accepting rose)

594
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

595
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:54,816
RUSAMEEKAE: Well,
going with NAMNUNG is fine too.

596
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,400
JANEYEH: He'd probably be disappointed.
It's not easy for him to go to X-Land.

597
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,464
(Holding hand)

598
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
NAMNUNG: I expected it.

599
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:09,344
TOD: Really?

600
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:10,240
NAMNUNG: Yes.

601
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,296
- NAMNUNG: Wow!
- TOD: Wow. Please.

602
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

603
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,336
TOD: Please have a seat.

604
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:19,320
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

605
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:20,263
TOD: Yes.

606
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,408
NAMNUNG: Okay.

607
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,520
TOD: Okay. Let's get started then.

608
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,952
TOD: Excuse me.

609
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,200
TOD: Would you like salmon?

610
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,160
NAMNUNG: Garlic bread.

611
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,440
CRIS: Here we go again.

612
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,400
RUSAMEEKAE: The manager again.

613
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,344
NAMNUNG: Shall we cheers?

614
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:34,624
TOD: Cheers.

615
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:36,192
- TOD: Cheers.
- NAMNUNG: Cheers.

616
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,448
TOD: Hmm.

617
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:41,800
NAMNUNG: Why did you choose me?

618
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,616
(Looking)
TIMETHAI: It's starting.

619
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey, hey, hey!

620
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:48,400
(Leaning back)

621
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,248
JANEYEH: He's leaning back.

622
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:51,960
(Rubbing)
JANEYEH: So much to say on his mind.

623
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:54,400
NAMNUNG: When did it start?

624
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:57,240
CRIS: Well, the first day, obviously.

625
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:01,792
(Twirling)

626
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,240
TOD: If you paid attention,

627
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,224
TOD: it really wasn't that hard to tell.

628
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,720
CRIS: She's stunned now. Confused.

629
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,000
TOD: Who do I stay close to?
Or who am I particularly interested in?

630
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,240
TOD: Or does it all seem similar?

631
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,560
RUSAMEEKAE: How?

632
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,480
NAMNUNG: Well, thinking back, it...

633
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:22,528
NAMNUNG: It makes sense.

634
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,200
TOD: But you didn't expect it to be...

635
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,944
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

636
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:29,408
NAMNUNG: I feel that...

637
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:34,560
NAMNUNG: Someone around your age
probably wouldn't...

638
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,344
(Scratching) - TIMETHAI: Scratching.
- RUSAMEEKAE: She's being stressed now.

639
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:39,960
(Staring)
RUSAMEEKAE: Probably wouldn't what? Come on.

640
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:42,280
NAMNUNG: Well, you probably wouldn't

641
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:45,040
NAMNUNG: be interested in
someone younger.

642
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,360
- TOD: Hmm, because you're the youngest?
- NAMNUNG: I'm twenty, yeah.

643
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,000
TOD: Hmm.

644
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,240
NAMNUNG: So I never thought you would...

645
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:55,872
RUSAMEEKAE: Didn't think
he'd be interested in a woman.

646
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:03,328
TOD: And who do you think
I'm actually interested in?

647
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,864
(Asks)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh wow!

648
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:05,632
NAMNUNG: TIME.

649
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:06,304
(Losing to the voices in her head)

650
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,864
NAMNUNG: TIME.

651
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,080
JANEYEH: He's gonna choke on his drink!

652
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,048
JANEYEH: Excellent, NAMNUNG!

653
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
(Drinking water)
JANEYEH: He's drinking water now.

654
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,440
TOD: Why do you think it's TIME?

655
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:23,168
(Staring)
TIMETHAI: Are you sure you want her to tell?

656
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,824
JANEYEH: Oh wow, everyone knows, TOD.

657
00:30:26,336 --> 00:30:28,064
RUSAMEEKAE: Now, he's being stressed.

658
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,568
NAMNUNG: Not sure. Maybe because

659
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:38,496
NAMNUNG: you're roommates,
I can sense the compatibility?

660
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:39,360
JANEYEH: Wow.

661
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
TOD: Ah.

662
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,824
CRIS: He's surprised.

663
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,224
JANEYEH: Filming their feet.

664
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,528
TOD: Not sure.

665
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:49,720
TIMETHAI: But he didn't deny it!

666
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:50,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my!

667
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:53,200
NAMNUNG: Not sure?

668
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,008
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG knows!

669
00:30:56,128 --> 00:30:59,360
TIMETHAI: If he reveals it right now,
people will know. That can't happen.

670
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
TIMETHAI: If NAMNUNG tells others,
it'll ruin everything.

671
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:08,000
TIMETHAI: If he were actually a straight
guy, he would've denied it already.

672
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,280
TIMETHAI: He'd say,
'Are you crazy? No way!'

673
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,176
JANEYEH: He didn't deny.

674
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:10,840
TIMETHAI: He didn't deny.

675
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
TIMETHAI: He just said, 'not sure.'

676
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Or it shows that
TOD trusts NAMNUNG, I guess.

677
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:16,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Well, today
they're just talking.

678
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,320
CRIS: By NAMNUNG's history of going
to X-Land, she worked so hard to get here,

679
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,032
CRIS: but only to just be there and talk.

680
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:25,200
TIMETHAI: Uh-huh.

681
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:27,744
CRIS: She's never gone with someone
she actually has feelings for!

682
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,952
- RUSAMEEKAE: That's right.
- TIMETHAI: She's only been chosen.

683
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,280
CRIS: She's only been chosen.

684
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Just now,
we were watching TOD and NAMNUNG's side.

685
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:37,600
- RUSAMEEKAE: There's another couple.
- CRIS: MATHEUS.

686
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,560
RUSAMEEKAE: So let's go see
who MATHEUS will choose.

687
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Even with a broken arm,
he's still so hot.

688
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,640
(Who will MATHEUS invite on a date?)
CRIS: It's gotta be SUNNY. Who else?

689
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh!

690
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,880
TIMETHAI: Looking at the outfit,
you can probably guess.

691
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,080
TIMETHAI: Is this an MV?

692
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,400
CRIS: Look at that, wow!

693
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,160
JANEYEH: Girl,
you look absolutely stunning.

694
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,840
CRIS: So beautiful.

695
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
MATHEUS: I wanna, actually,
give you the rose

696
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,840
MATHEUS: and ask if you wanna come
with me to X-Land?

697
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
SUNNY: Okay. Thank you.

698
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
(Accepting rose)
MATHEUS: For your first time.

699
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,280
JANEYEH: Wow.

700
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,840
SUNNY: Okay.

701
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,160
CRIS: So beautiful.

702
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:16,745
SUNNY: Hello.

703
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,880
MATHEUS: Welcome.

704
00:32:24,012 --> 00:32:25,237
MATHEUS: Official to X-Land.

705
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:27,320
SUNNY: Thank you.

706
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,968
MATHEUS: Let me help you.

707
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:28,864
SUNNY: Thank you.

708
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:29,671
MATHEUS: Wow.

709
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,260
JANEYEH: That was such a moment!

710
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,021
MATHEUS: Careful, it's quite slippery.

711
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,480
MATHEUS: Our dinner. Set?

712
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:41,776
SUNNY: Yes.

713
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,680
MATHEUS: Wow.

714
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,560
(Pulling out the chair)
SUNNY: Thank you.

715
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,960
CRIS: Oops!

716
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,080
RUSAMEEKAE: I knew it.

717
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,560
TIMETHAI: What the hell, bro?

718
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,880
CRIS: If they gather like a big pot,
watch out, the two guys might faint.

719
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,040
(This is a massive headache)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, that hurts.

720
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,840
TIMETHAI: Is it a double date?

721
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,360
TOD: Hmm.

722
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,120
TOD: Wow, can we say hello?

723
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,976
NAMNUNG: Hello!

724
00:33:06,976 --> 00:33:08,233
TOD: Hello!

725
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,200
CRIS: They're turning
to look at each other.

726
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,720
NAMNUNG: Would you join us?

727
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:13,495
CRIS: NAMNUNG!

728
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:14,440
CRIS: Hey, look at that.

729
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,440
JANEYEH: It's closed.

730
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:16,760
CRIS: She's enjoying it.

731
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,200
CRIS: It's NAMNUNG and SUNNY for me.

732
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:21,760
(Glances)

733
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,160
JANEYEH: She's taking care of him.

734
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,838
MATHEUS: Thanks.

735
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,280
MATHEUS: You take first.

736
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,840
RUSAMEEKAE: I really want to brush
MATHEUS's hair right now.

737
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,480
MATHEUS: To be honest, I...

738
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,800
MATHEUS: I told you I like to win.

739
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
MATHEUS: So do you, right?

740
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,520
SUNNY: Yes.

741
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,200
MATHEUS: I mean

742
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,920
MATHEUS: I want to
go to X-Land for sure, like

743
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,760
MATHEUS: at least once.

744
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,160
MATHEUS: But honestly,
I did not expect

745
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,680
MATHEUS: I have the opportunity to go
like a second chance.

746
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,280
SUNNY: Yeah.

747
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,680
SUNNY: You said you were gonna
defend your title.

748
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
- SUNNY: And you did.
- MATHEUS: I said.

749
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,080
MATHEUS: That's true.

750
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,760
MATHEUS: If you mean what I said,
"I'm gonna be an expert on X-Land."

751
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,600
SUNNY: So why did you choose
to invite me this time?

752
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,400
(Asking directly) JANEYEH: Straight to the point,
no beating around the bush.

753
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,400
(Smiling)

754
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,240
MATHEUS: Honestly, you were always like,
you know...

755
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,040
(Moving)
JANEYEH: Ooh.

756
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:11,328
(Glances)

757
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,600
MATHEUS: Top one.

758
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,280
('You're always the first in my heart.')
JANEYEH: Oh wow, top one?

759
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:17,960
('You're always first in my heart.')

760
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,640
SUNNY: Really?

761
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,400
JANEYEH: SUNNY doesn't seem shy at all.

762
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,480
MATHEUS: Like I would say,
one day after the accident

763
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,960
MATHEUS: when we did the game
in the water, you know...

764
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,760
MATHEUS: Like the kissing game we did.

765
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,240
MATHEUS: This was maybe like a risk
a bit too much.

766
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,960
MATHEUS: It was just like
one day after the accident.

767
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,040
MATHEUS: And I put those underwater.

768
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

769
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,680
JANEYEH: Oh, sparks flew there.

770
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,080
TIMETHAI: One kiss
and it's a long journey.

771
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,760
MATHEUS: I think the doctor
should never see that.

772
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,080
MATHEUS: He'd probably be
very mad at me.

773
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,800
MATHEUS: But, um, I don't regret it.

774
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,960
('I don't regret it.')

775
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh,
look at him getting all smooth!

776
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,189
MATHEUS: You probably know why.

777
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,360
(Making eye contact)
JANEYEH: Sending intense eye contact.

778
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,080
SUNNY: For me, it was just a strategy.

779
00:35:15,456 --> 00:35:17,480
SUNNY: For me, it was just a strategy.

780
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,280
(Just a strategy)
- CRIS: End of story. - RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my god.

781
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,560
SUNNY: The first day
when I landed on the island,

782
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,640
SUNNY: I was like, I wanna be
best friends with this person.

783
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,080
('I want to be a friend with this person.')
JANEYEH: Oh my god.

784
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,880
CRIS: Total friendzone.
End of story. Boom!

785
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,040
TIMETHAI: That hurts.

786
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,000
- SUNNY: Best friends with this person.
- MATHEUS: Okay.

787
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,200
MATHEUS: Okay, let's celebrate today,
by the way.

788
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my god.

789
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,800
CRIS: Well, MATHEUS got friend-zoned
so hard.

790
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,480
RUSAMEEKAE: She was like, 'When I first came
to the island and saw this person...'

791
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,640
CRIS: 'I wanna be your best friends.'

792
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,680
TIMETHAI: That's harsh.

793
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,720
RUSAMEEKAE: We've seen
SUNNY date TIME before.

794
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:10,080
RUSAMEEKAE: We've seen SUNNY
with another style, and she was like...

795
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,800
TIMETHAI: Twisting and turning.

796
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,168
RUSAMEEKAE: But today,
when she got asked out, she was like...

797
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:17,560
JANEYEH: Staring blankly
and then just eating.

798
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,944
RUSAMEEKAE: The first table
became siblings.

799
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,224
RUSAMEEKAE: The second one
became best friends.

800
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,088
CRIS: But!

801
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:21,840
JANEYEH: But!

802
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,976
CRIS: Between these two tables.

803
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:23,904
JANEYEH: Maybe.

804
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:24,640
CRIS: Maybe.

805
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,560
CRIS: There's nothing going on.
They're just roommates, aren't they?

806
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:29,344
RUSAMEEKAE: Just roommates or not?

807
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:30,560
RUSAMEEKAE: I don't know.

808
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,720
RUSAMEEKAE: But what I know is...

809
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's keep watching.

810
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:37,350
TOD: Wow.

811
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,520
TOD: How many partners have you had?

812
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops!

813
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,080
NAMNUNG: Seriously?

814
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,480
CRIS: Seriously?

815
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,120
TOD: Hey, we can ask anything!

816
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:48,448
RUSAMEEKAE: Is this how friends ask?

817
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:49,160
CRIS: Yes, friends.

818
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,128
NAMNUNG: Take a guess.

819
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,880
TOD: Twenty years old?

820
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,480
TOD: I think...

821
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,840
CRIS: Two or three.

822
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,600
RUSAMEEKAE: 'I've had twenty.'

823
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,240
CRIS: That's too much!

824
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,880
TOD: Two?

825
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,720
CRIS: TOD thinks just like me.

826
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,160
- TOD: Really?
- NAMNUNG: Two.

827
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,720
NAMNUNG: How about you, TOD?

828
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,920
(Glances)
JANEYEH: That's correct. Ask him back.

829
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, it's your turn, TOD.

830
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,000
CRIS: Eight!

831
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,640
TOD: How many partners have I had?

832
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,000
TOD: Five. Four or five.

833
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:30,097
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh wow!

834
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,640
TOD: Let's just say
the last one lasted ten years.

835
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,080
CRIS: Ten years?

836
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,880
(Asking)
NAMNUNG: Was that person a woman?

837
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,720
TIMETHAI: Right on point.

838
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,120
JANEYEH: Why so intense, NAMNUNG?

839
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,400
TOD: Was that person a woman?

840
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
(Twiddling his fingers)
CRIS: Hard to answer.

841
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,200
JANEYEH: Very hard!

842
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:01,792
(Staring)

843
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:07,520
(Smiling)
JANEYEH: Don't lie, TOD.

844
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,560
(Asking)
MATHEUS: Are you bisexual?

845
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
CRIS: Are you bisexual?

846
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,120
JANEYEH: Straight to that question?

847
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:19,600
CRIS: So exciting!

848
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Come on!

849
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
TOD: Can I say it?

850
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:27,080
RUSAMEEKAE: If next week...

851
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,256
TOD: That person was a man.

852
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,880
TOD: That person was a man.

853
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,436
LOVE(X)PERT: Damn.

854
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,240
NAMNUNG: Exactly.

855
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,600
(Sexual orientation may change over time)
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD is fluid.

856
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,720
SUNNY: I'm bisexual.

857
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,400
MATHEUS: Okay.

858
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,280
MATHEUS: Okay.

859
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,200
MATHEUS: Okay.

860
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,296
CRIS: That's not surprising.

861
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,096
RUSAMEEKAE: Okay.

862
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,680
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS has brought
a bisexual date twice.

863
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,880
CRIS: I'm so nervous
for SUNNY and NAMNUNG today.

864
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,800
CRIS: Bisexual meets bisexual.

865
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:05,000
JANEYEH: Iconic!

866
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,720
CRIS: Let's applaud.

867
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,720
SUNNY: Could you guess
who I would have chosen?

868
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,560
SUNNY: If I want today.

869
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:16,331
(Asking)
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, my God.

870
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:19,200
CRIS: Why hurt
MATHEUS's feelings like this?

871
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,208
SUNNY: You can guess.

872
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:23,240
TIMETHAI: So harsh.

873
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:27,590
MATHEUS: I mean you could... You're...

874
00:39:27,872 --> 00:39:28,928
(Stunned)

875
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,760
CRIS: Poor MATHEUS.

876
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,320
JANEYEH: She gives no hope at all.

877
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,720
MATHEUS: I don't know, NAMNUNG, maybe?

878
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,395
SUNNY: Yeah,
the most popular person here.

879
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,000
CRIS: SUNNY really seems
to choose NAMNUNG!

880
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,400
MATHEUS: Oh, really?

881
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,922
MATHEUS: Okay.

882
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:54,848
MATHEUS: Cool. I see.

883
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,080
(Looking) TIMETHAI:
MATHEUS is looking. Oh, done.

884
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,621
TIMETHAI: Goddamn! Oh, shit!

885
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,632
CRIS: X-Land is chaotic today.

886
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:09,520
NAMNUNG: That's another thing
making me feel like...

887
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,320
NAMNUNG: I think of you that way.

888
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,760
TOD: I see.

889
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,000
TOD: That's why you
don't feel anything for me.

890
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,952
- TIMETHAI: Goddamn!
- LOVE(X)PERT: It's over.

891
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:25,486
MATHEUS: I totally... I totally agree.

892
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,040
CRIS: Both got rejected hard.

893
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,000
CRIS: So tired.

894
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,600
JANEYEH: What is it?

895
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,040
RUSAMEEKAE: My blood pressure's rising.

896
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,760
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD is fluid.

897
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,360
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY
and NAMNUNG are bisexual.

898
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,360
CRIS: MATHEUS said he's straight.

899
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Everything's clear now.

900
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,736
RUSAMEEKAE: But now
what we need to analyze is...

901
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,080
RUSAMEEKAE: How will
this dating game play out?

902
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,080
TIMETHAI: But all the guys got rejected.

903
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,000
TIMETHAI: Bro-zoned and friend-zoned.

904
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,520
CRIS: Totally bro-zoned
and friend-zoned.

905
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,640
RUSAMEEKAE: If it were up to me,

906
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,280
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG and SUNNY
could go into the tub right now.

907
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,040
RUSAMEEKAE: As for TOD,

908
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,600
RUSAMEEKAE: might as well
stay there with MATHEUS.

909
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,240
JANEYEH: Give it a try.

910
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,040
CRIS: Give it a try.

911
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,480
(Full support)
CRIS: Give it a try.

912
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,720
TIMETHAI: No!

913
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Go ahead
and touch each other!

914
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see what happens.

915
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Because this is our X-Land.

916
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,976
RUSAMEEKAE: There are
no rules here anyway.

917
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:15,456
CRIS: Yes.

918
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:18,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see
how the four of them will date.

919
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,280
TOD: So, change clothes?

920
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,000
SUNNY: Oh, yeah!

921
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,040
CRIS: All four of them?

922
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,280
CRIS: That's brutal.

923
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:26,976
(Looking)

924
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:30,764
MATHEUS: It's the mattress
of the... Of the...

925
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:32,294
(Sitting beside)
MATHEUS: Of the exercise, you know, like?

926
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,960
SUNNY: Oh, yes.

927
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,000
TIMETHAI: How are they supposed
to sleep?

928
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,840
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS
once dated NAMNUNG too.

929
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,720
CRIS: It was a total mess.

930
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:44,684
JANEYEH: Just like this.

931
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:46,244
MATHEUS: Done.

932
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,919
MATHEUS: So...

933
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,440

(Pillow game)
CRIS: Here we go.

938
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,600
SUNNY: Do I have to read this aloud
for everyone?

939
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,000
NAMNUNG: Yeah.

940
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,640

do you think is the sexiest?

941
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
JANEYEH: NAMNUNG!

942
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,200
CRIS: NAMNUNG and SUNNY. I'm blushing.

943
00:42:12,224 --> 00:42:15,280
MATHEUS: Which part of you is sexiest?

944
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,480
MATHEUS: You have to stand up. Quickly.

945
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:18,000

946
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,760

950
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,120
MATHEUS: Honestly, your smile
is definitely unique.

951
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,680
MATHEUS: Because it's like you smile
even when you're like not smiling.

952
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,480
MATHEUS: Right?

953

is the most fun here.

972
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,120

973
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,256

(Mwah)

1017
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,840
TIMETHAI: Wait a minute.

1018
00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:42,731
CRIS: You only get to watch. Sorry.

1019
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,040
RUSAMEEKAE: They're like,
"Why am I even here?"

1020
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,040
CRIS: It's not about TOD, but TIMETHAI.

1021
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,640
TIMETHAI: Wait a minute.

1022
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,920
TOD: Lying like that all night?

1023
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,000
SUNNY: I didn't get it.

1024
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah, she didn't get it.

1025
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,360
CRIS: Slide down immediately.

1026
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:07,168
(Pulling into hug)

1027
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,160

TIMETHAI: Why?

1030
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,080
(Smiling)

1031
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,200
RUSAMEEKAE: The guys
can just go lie on the floor.

1032
00:46:23,393 --> 00:46:24,384
(Snuggling close)

1033
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,200
RUSAMEEKAE: I feel for them.

1034
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Like, "Why am I even here?"

1035
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,120
TIMETHAI: Wait.

1036
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:52,512
(Squeezing)

1037
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:54,816

CRIS: Look at TOD.

1039
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Exciting.

1040
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Really exciting.

1041
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:07,456
(Afraid to look, Ah)

1042
00:47:10,144 --> 00:47:11,178
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

1043
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,320
CRIS: What's wrong, MATHEUS?

1044
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,640
JANEYEH: The guys are just
standing there confused.

1045
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,120
TIMETHAI: The guys
are just standing there...

1046
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,040
RUSAMEEKAE: They're used to it.

1047
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,840
CRIS: They're used to it.

1048
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:21,435
(Savoring)

1049
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Aren't they supposed
to show only one pose?

1050
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,000
TIMETHAI: EP? Which EP?

1051
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,016
(Serious)

CRIS: About 50 minutes.

1054
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:30,880
(Writing down every detail)

1055
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,240
CRIS: Is that the highlight
for yourself?

1056
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,640
CRIS: Your favorite highlight.

1057
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,360
CANDIDATE: Taking a bath.

1058
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,400

RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, how do they bathe?

1060
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Guys with guys,
girls with girls?

1061
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,648
(Turning to look)

1062
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,080
JANEYEH: She just swallowed hard again.

1063
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,400
RUSAMEEKAE: How?

1064
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,160
TIMETHAI: MATHEUS just tell TOD,
"Help me bathe. My hand hurts."

1065
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,760
(Glancing at SUNNY)
TIMETHAI: Hey.

1066
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:53,600

(Locking eyes)

1069
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,320
JANEYEH: MATHEUS looks totally fed up.

1070
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,672
(Giving a signal)

1071
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,840
(Standing side by side)
CRIS: Are they telepathically communicating?

1072
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,160
(Turning head)
CRIS: NAMNUNG! Hey!

1073
00:48:13,888 --> 00:48:14,752
(Exchanging meaningful looks)

1074
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
CRIS: Of course.

1075
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:22,432
SUNNY: Then let's shower
in separate rooms.

1076
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,000
RUSAMEEKAE: There are two tubs.

1077
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,400
TIMETHAI: Are you kicking them out?

1078
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,688
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, no!

1079
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:29,024
NAMNUNG: So, are you going
to shower upstairs

1080
00:48:29,888 --> 00:48:31,072
NAMNUNG: or downstairs?

1081
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:32,544
(Asking)

1082
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,200
MATHEUS: But I need to remove my makeup.

1083
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,040
MATHEUS: First move.

1084
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:41,312
SUNNY: Are your things downstairs?

1085
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,200
(Asking)
RUSAMEEKAE: That's so savage!

1086
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,360
JANEYEH: He's confused.

1087
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:50,304
SUNNY: Your things are already downstairs.
So... Maybe he is going to help out.

1088
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,480
- RUSAMEEKAE: That's so savage!
- CRIS: That's so savage!

1089
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,120
CRIS: So your stuff is downstairs?
Can you move it up?

1090
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,640
- CRIS: Get out of here!
- JANEYEH: Get out of here!

1091

So... Maybe he is going to help out.

1093
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:05,184
(Repeating)

1094
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,960
TIMETHAI: This is the chosen one,
not the winner.

1095
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,960
TIMETHAI: She's planning everything.

1096
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,680
MATHEUS: Okay.

1097
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,432
(Giving in)

1098
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,360
(Smiling)

TOD: Let's go.

1105
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:28,560
(Guys walking out)
CRIS: TOD was like, "Let's go."

1106
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:30,528
NAMNUNG: To be continued.

1107

(Smiling)

together now.

00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:46,880
(Putting arm around shoulder)

1111
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,760
RUSAMEEKAE: The guys are confused.

1112
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,920
TIMETHAI: The guys are like,
"Do we really have to bathe together?"

1113
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:53,520
- MATHEUS: It's a win-win too.
- TOD: Huh?

1114
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,120

1115
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,640
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm so into
SUNNY and NAMNUNG.

1116
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,640
RUSAMEEKAE: But another part of me...

1117
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,760
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm also trying
to support MATHEUS and TOD.

1118

(Smiling secretly)

1137
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,400

Why is it even there?

1138
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,840
CRIS: This couple is adorable.

1139
00:51:55,232 --> 00:51:56,800
TIMETHAI: Can you
make the water clearer?

1140
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:00,224
(Staring)
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

1141
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,952
TIMETHAI: That captivating gaze.

1142
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:06,368
NAMNUNG: Should I take it off?

1143
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,440
CRIS: Way too intense.

1144
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,120
JANEYEH: Don't look at me like that.

1145
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,480
RUSAMEEKAE: She looks shy
the whole time.

1146
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,720

1148
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,104

you're interested in?

1149
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,560
(Asking)
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, she's testing her.

1150
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,672
CRIS: She's too scared to say it.

1151
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,240
CRIS: You can't answer.
You'll lose a roommate.

1152
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,720
JANEYEH: Answer "You."

1153
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,784

so manly right now.

from the beginning wasn't wasted.

(Moving closer)

1161
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,800

1162
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,160
JANEYEH: Where did the divider go?

1163
00:53:32,736 --> 00:53:34,752
NAMNUNG: Can I ask you something?

1164
00:53:34,816 --> 00:53:35,872

00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,160
SUNNY: What?

1167
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,992
RUSAMEEKAE: Can I kiss?

1168
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:45,760
(Too shy to look)

1169
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,600
TOD: Knock, ladies.

1170
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,440
TOD: Excuse me.

1171
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,800

TOD: Are you done?

1182
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,768
SUNNY: Just chilling in the tub.

1183
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,440

like a villa manager.

1184
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,040
TOD: So, bathing?

1185
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,096
CRIS: Oh, TOD!

1186
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,120
CRIS: TOD, get out, please.

1187
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,760
SUNNY: We saw the bath bomb
and we just had to play.

1188
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,560
NAMNUNG: Yes.

1189
00:54:25,824 --> 00:54:27,280
NAMNUNG: It smells good.

1190
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,320
CRIS: TOD, just go out. Go find TIME.

1191
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,080
(Dazed)

1192
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,720
CRIS: SUNNY is confused too.

1193
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,720
CRIS: She's confused now.

1194
00:54:40,256 --> 00:54:41,984
(Switches sides)

1195
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,584
(Looking at TOD)
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm confused right now.

1196
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,200
TIMETHAI: Step outside for a bit, TOD.

1197
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,440
JANEYEH: Please, I'm begging you.

1198
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:54,624
(Crinkling)

1199
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:57,248
SUNNY: Can I have my towel?

1200
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,240
TOD: Sure thing.

1201
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,640
(Leaving now)

1202
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,720
TIMETHAI: But my towel
is at the first villa.

1203
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,920
(The farther, the better)
TIMETHAI: TOD, go out first.

1204
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,440
(Making eye contact)
JANEYEH: Oh, wow.

1205
00:55:07,616 --> 00:55:12,512
(Thrilled all over again)

1206
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,400
TOD: Here.

1207
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,560
JANEYEH: Here.

1208
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:18,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, no.

1209
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,160
CRIS: Ouch, TOD!

1210
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,880
TIMETHAI: You walked so fast.

1211
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Hotel waiter, huh?

1212
00:55:34,016 --> 00:55:34,848
(Very fast)

1213
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,760
CRIS: I feel bad for NAMNUNG.

1214
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,840
JANEYEH: She looks upset.

1215
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:51,040
SUNNY: I'll change my clothes.

1216
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:53,160
TOD: Okay.

1217
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,304
(Look over)

1218
00:55:54,304 --> 00:55:56,352
(Signals)

1219
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,800
(Smiling) TIMETHAI:
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.

1220
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,800
JANEYEH: TOD.

1221
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:06,976
TOD: You go take a shower first.

1222
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,720
NAMNUNG: Yes.

1223
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,280
TOD: Okay.

1224
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,400
NAMNUNG: I should
probably shower with SUNNY.

1225
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,840
TOD: Oh, I'll step out,
so SUNNY can come in.

1226
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,008
CRIS: You should've left ages ago, TOD.
Why are you leaving now?

1227
00:56:22,656 --> 00:56:24,120
JANEYEH: Go call SUNNY back.

1228
00:56:30,752 --> 00:56:31,800
JANEYEH: SUNNY, come back.

1229
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,520
CRIS: She's back. Oh, she's back.

1230
00:56:38,848 --> 00:56:40,480
NAMNUNG: Bisexual.

1231
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,960
TIMETHAI: Bisexual.

1232
00:56:44,096 --> 00:56:45,560
CRIS: Testing the water.

1233
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,440
JANEYEH: What is it?

1234
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,448
TIMETHAI: Here it comes.

1235
00:57:02,368 --> 00:57:02,880
SUNNY: You?

1236
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:09,920
NAMNUNG: Me too.

1237
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,784
(Bisexual)
TIMETHAI: Same.

1238
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,760
SUNNY: Are you serious?

1239
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Right now, both of them
have confessed to being bisexual.

1240
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,424
RUSAMEEKAE: So the chance
of them matching...

1241
00:57:19,424 --> 00:57:20,256
CRIS: Very high.

1242
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,520
NAMNUNG: Yeah. You know...

1243
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,840
CRIS: What?

1244
00:57:28,192 --> 00:57:31,456
NAMNUNG: What about the first game?

1245
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,080
CRIS: Oh.

1246
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,960
RUSAMEEKAE: The first kiss
she gave SUNNY on the first day.

1247
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:44,576
RUSAMEEKAE: Will there be a second kiss?

1248
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,368
SUNNY: I thought it was JOY.

1249
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:51,648
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, my God.

1250
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:53,952
(Shaking head)

1251
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,840
TIMETHAI: The truth is revealed.

1252
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,240
SUNNY: You?

1253
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,064
CRIS: You?

1254
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,600
JANEYEH: Yes. Say it.

1255
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,416
RUSAMEEKAE: Come on.

1256
00:58:05,088 --> 00:58:05,824
NAMNUNG: Yes.

1257
00:58:08,704 --> 00:58:09,504
SUNNY: Really?

1258
00:58:13,248 --> 00:58:14,912
SUNNY: When MATHEUS offered,
you refused.

1259
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,800
SUNNY: Why?

1260
00:58:18,464 --> 00:58:19,776
NAMNUNG: Why not?

1261
00:58:21,024 --> 00:58:22,080
CRIS: Why not?

1262
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:25,680
SUNNY: Why did you...

1263
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:28,480
SUNNY: Why was I your first impression?

1264
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:30,272
(Watching)
SUNNY: Right.

1265
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:37,472
NAMNUNG: You were
a good first impression.

1266
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

1267
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,184
NAMNUNG: You're just
kinda like... different.

1268
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,360
NAMNUNG: You're the most different
among all the women.

1269
00:58:53,248 --> 00:58:56,840
NAMNUNG: You're the most different
among all the women.

1270
00:58:57,568 --> 00:59:01,024
("You're different")

1271
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:03,360
(Blushing)
JANEYEH: She's blushing.

1272
00:59:08,064 --> 00:59:08,928
LOVE(X)PERT: Wonderful.

1273
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,048
TIMETHAI: Top one.

1274
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:11,560
RUSAMEEKAE: The game flipped.

1275
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:12,864
CRIS: Both are each other's top one.

1276
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,760
CRIS: All the guys are swooning.

1277
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,560
JANEYEH: Swooning.

1278
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,440
CRIS: The whole crew is swooning.

1279
00:59:19,424 --> 00:59:20,672
SUNNY: Oh, this is so confusing.

1280
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,440
SUNNY: I need to think.

1281
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,280
TIMETHAI: The winners
of this game are Cupid.

1282
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,400
TIMETHAI: Those two guys are Cupid.

1283
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,120
JANEYEH: Thank you so much, TOD.

1284
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,000
TIMETHAI: I'll pat his shoulder
and say thank you.

1285
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,920
CRIS: Try it, MATHEUS.

1286
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Opening up.

1287
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,640
(Sharing the same bed) RUSAMEEKAE:
NAMNUNG is sleeping with SUNNY.

1288
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,144
CRIS: NAMNUNG is sleeping with SUNNY.

1289
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,080
CRIS: And where do the guys sleep?
On the floor.

1290
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,640
(Lying on sofa)

1291
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,760
CRIS: TOD sleeps on the sofa.

1292
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,520
CRIS: Where is MATHEUS?

1293
01:00:06,784 --> 01:00:08,360
CRIS: MATHEUS sleeps on the other bed.

1294
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

1295
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,360
CRIS: So intense.

1296
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,240
RUSAMEEKAE: So intense.

1297
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,240
CRIS: So intense.

1298
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,800
TIMETHAI: Even though they won,
they got kicked out to sleep elsewhere.

1299
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,360
CRIS: Right.

1300
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Game flipped.
Everything changed completely.

1301
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,840
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD and MATHEUS are pretty much
pushed out of this game on X-Land.

1302
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,600
TIMETHAI: They won.

1303
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Even though
they are the winners...

1304
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,880
CRIS: But it's still good
that we found out the truth.

1305
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,880
CRIS: Their feelings.

1306
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,480
JANEYEH: Right.

1307
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's analyze each pair.

1308
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,720
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD and NAMNUNG,
the current situation is...

1309
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,400
(Just bro)
TIMETHAI: Bro zone.

1310
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,080
CRIS: Bro zone.

1311
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Bro zone.

1312
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,760
RUSAMEEKAE: What about
MATHEUS and SUNNY?

1313
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,400
(Just friends)
TIMETHAI: Friend zone.

1314
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,720
JANEYEH: Best friends.

1315
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,744
RUSAMEEKAE: Then SUNNY and NAMNUNG?

1316
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,920
CRIS: That's awesome.

1317
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,280
JANEYEH: It's starting to change now.

1318
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,120
TIMETHAI: There's something going on.

1319
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,320
RUSAMEEKAE: And right now,
a huge question has popped up.

1320
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,360
RUSAMEEKAE: If SUNNY and NAMNUNG
get together...

1321
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,560
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME will have
a big question mark.

1322
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,800
CRIS: Then TIME has
to compete against NAMNUNG.

1323
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,560
TIMETHAI: Time becomes
a rival to NAMNUNG...

1324
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,520
TIMETHAI: From liking each other
to suddenly competing.

1325
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,360
CRIS: Yeah, exactly.

1326
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,040
CRIS: It's a real love triangle
because TIME...

1327
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,040
CRIS: It's not like he has
no feelings for NAMNUNG at all.

1328
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,480
CRIS: He feels something for her too.

1329
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,120
RUSAMEEKAE: While things
are heating up at the villa,

1330
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,600
RUSAMEEKAE: how is it gonna end up?

1331
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's take a look.

1332
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,717
CRIS: Oh, morning comes.

1333
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,040
TIMETHAI: Writing a sad song
for yourself?

1334
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,216
RUSAMEEKAE: Because there's no one
TIME likes left in the villa right now.

1335
01:01:45,312 --> 01:01:45,856
CRIS: Exactly.

1336
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,640
(Looking outside the door)

1337
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,920
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY, TOD, NAMNUNG,
none of them are here.

1338
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,040
TIMETHAI: Yeah, all three are gone.

1339
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:03,640
RUSAMEEKAE: All gone.

1340
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,608
TIMETHAI: His roommate
is not here either.

1341
01:02:04,608 --> 01:02:05,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Alone.

1342
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:06,528
TIMETHAI: So lonely.

1343
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,904
RUSAMEEKAE: It feels like all
the important people have been stolen away.

1344
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:16,480
CRIS: Right.

1345
01:02:16,768 --> 01:02:17,952
CRIS: I kind of feel sorry for him too.

1346
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:24,192
CRIS: They're back.

1347
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,544
CRIS: You don't have to
pretend to be all lovey-dovey.

1348
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:33,824
MATHEUS: Welcome back to X-Villa.

1349
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:35,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Did NAMNUNG
come with a bodyguard?

1350
01:02:36,448 --> 01:02:37,952
MATHEUS: That's
a good Thai building, then.

1351
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,816
(Turning to look)

1352
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:44,576
(Looking)

1353
01:02:44,576 --> 01:02:45,560

1354
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,960
CRIS: JUNSU is at it again.

1355
01:02:47,072 --> 01:02:47,968
(Searching)

1356
01:02:48,128 --> 01:02:48,832
CRIS: KONG.

1357
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,040
(Looking toward TIME)

1358
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,872
JANEYEH: JUNSU is laughing.

1359
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:00,960
(Watching)

1360
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:03,840
(Touching her waist)

1361
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,688
CRIS: Why? Why does he have to wrap
his arm around her waist like this?

1362
01:03:10,688 --> 01:03:12,192
MATHEUS: Hello.

1363
01:03:12,576 --> 01:03:13,160
JUNSU: Married.

1364
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,880
TIMETHAI: The truth is,
what these guys don't know...

1365
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,600
JANEYEH: You guys have no idea.

1366
01:03:27,232 --> 01:03:29,600
MILL: Don't be sad.

1367
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:32,480
MILL: Just calm down. Come on.

1368
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,880
TIMETHAI: Man, you won't be upset
if you know the truth.

1369
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,800
TIMETHAI: These two over here
are the ones who should be upset.

1370
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,080
TOD: What are you guys doing?

1371
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,624
JUNSU: Share. Share your experience.

1372
01:03:48,544 --> 01:03:49,376
(Go toward TIME)

1373
01:03:49,376 --> 01:03:50,976
(Looking) RUSAMEEKAE:
TOD naturally has to go to his friend.

1374
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,368
TIME: Have a seat.

1375
01:03:54,368 --> 01:03:56,000
TOD: You have a seat.

1376
01:03:58,144 --> 01:03:59,360
JANEYEH: Hey.

1377
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,304
(Sitting next to TOD) JANEYEH:
I thought he was going to sit on his lap.

1378
01:04:02,304 --> 01:04:02,976
(Looking)

1379
01:04:05,856 --> 01:04:06,976
(Looking)

1380
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,984
(SUNNY is sitting with NAMNUNG)

1381
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:14,400
(Sitting next to SUNNY)

1382
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,600
RUSAMEEKAE: So many
suspicious things here.

1383
01:04:18,752 --> 01:04:20,160
JUNSU: How was yesterday?

1384
01:04:20,352 --> 01:04:21,440
CHERRY: How did it go?

1385
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,320
KONG: Was it fun?

1386
01:04:23,808 --> 01:04:25,472
TIME: Tell us.

1387
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:26,848
CRIS: It's hard to explain.

1388
01:04:26,848 --> 01:04:28,768
CRIS: What are they supposed to say?

1389
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,120
RUSAMEEKAE: It's not something
you should talk about.

1390
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,128
CRIS: It can't be put into words.

1391
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,552
NAMNUNG: It was like
the four of us went on a trip.

1392
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,200
FRAME: You met?

1393
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,120
SUNNY: Yes.

1394
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,640
TIME: Oh, really?

1395
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,376
- NAMNUNG: Yes.
- KONG: You had dinner together?

1396
01:04:45,376 --> 01:04:46,400
KONG: You had dinner together?

1397
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,720
TIMETHAI: Don't be jealous yet.

1398
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,760
SUNNY: We ate separately. After we finished,
I walked over to their table.

1399
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,056
NAMNUNG: So we ended up
doing activities together.

1400
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:59,104
TIME: And did you all sleep together?
All four of you?

1401
01:04:59,104 --> 01:04:59,808
(Asking right away)

1402
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:00,960
(Asking right away)
CRIS: He's asking right away.

1403
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,480
CRIS: Because he's been there.
He's been there.

1404
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

1405
01:05:09,184 --> 01:05:10,464
NAMNUNG: Um...

1406
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:13,056
(Looking)
NAMNUNG: No.

1407
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,600
TIME: Slept separately?

1408
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,032
TIME: There were two bedrooms?

1409
01:05:16,032 --> 01:05:17,088
TOD: Yes.

1410
01:05:17,824 --> 01:05:20,448
(Looking)
RUSAMEEKAE: A lot of questions, TIME.

1411
01:05:22,272 --> 01:05:24,896
RUSAMEEKAE: But TIME
doesn't know who slept with whom.

1412
01:05:27,904 --> 01:05:28,768
NAMNUNG: He slept alone.

1413
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:31,840
CRIS: He slept alone.

1414
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,520
KONG: Who did you sleep with?

1415
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,816
(Asking SUNNY)
CRIS: Hey, KONG.

1416
01:05:34,816 --> 01:05:35,480
(Looking)
CRIS: KONG.

1417
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,736
RUSAMEEKAE: The troublemaker.

1418
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,880
KONG: Who did you sleep with?

1419
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,720
SUNNY: I slept with NAMNUNG.

1420
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,848
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, TIME.

1421
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,720
KONG: Oh, really?

1422
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,360
CRIS: You don't know yet.

1423
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,816
JANEYEH: You don't know yet.

1424
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:52,000
JANEYEH: Don't smile yet.

1425
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,440
NAMNUNG: TOD was sleeping on the sofa.

1426
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,360
- TOD: I was sleeping on the sofa.
- MATHEUS: Yeah, the sofa.

1427
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,840
- KONG: Really?
- FRAME: Why?

1428
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,008
RUSAMEEKAE: Come on, KONG.
Don't present to be curious.

1429
01:06:04,896 --> 01:06:05,472
(Leaning)

1430
01:06:05,472 --> 01:06:07,920
CRIS: Wait, why is TIME leaning on TOD?

1431
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:09,531
(Leaning)

1432
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,320
JOY: My lord.

1433
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,632
(Looking)

1434
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:14,720
TIME: What?

1435
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,192
TIME: What?

1436
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,112
JOY: No, why does TIME
seem to miss TOD a lot?

1437
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:23,440
RUSAMEEKAE: You must meet JOY.

1438
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,024
CRIS: Yes, JOY is awesome.

1439
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:26,760
JOY: Why does TIME
seem to miss TOD so much?

1440
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,920
TIME: Yes. Don't laugh.

1441
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,960
- TIMETHAI: Hey!
- JANEYEH: Hey!

1442
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:31,200
TIMETHAI: Acting like a puppy?

1443
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,920
CRIS: He's always been a puppy.
No need to act.

1444
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,160
(Pretending to ask) NAMNUNG:
TIME, are you still trying to steal from me?

1445
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,480
CRIS: That's harsh.

1446
01:06:43,808 --> 01:06:45,240
TIMETHAI: The only one
who knows the truth is TOD.

1447
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,560
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG knows.

1448
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,848
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, that's awkward.

1449
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:55,960
CRIS: It's so awkward.

1450
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,184
RUSAMEEKAE: So awkward.

1451
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,312
TOD: Okay, I'll change my clothes
and be right back.

1452
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:02,976
(Looking)

1453
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:03,776
JUNSU: Bye-bye.

1454
01:07:03,904 --> 01:07:06,272

JOY: Bye-bye.

1457
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,704
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, KONG.

1458
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,800
MILL: Alright, you can be yourself now.

1459
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,496
TIME: Okay. Let's play a game.

1460
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:19,392
TIME: Let's play a game.

1461
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:22,368
TIME: Let's play a game.

1462
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,216
JANEYEH: That's bad, TIME.

1463
01:07:25,216 --> 01:07:26,120
TIMETHAI: That's bad.

1464
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,960
CRIS: Not looking good, TIME.

1465
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,160
TIME: Okay. Let's play a game.

1466
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,040
TIME: I'll be back soon.

1467
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,672
JUNSU: Take your time.

1468
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,080
TIME: I'll talk to TOD.

1469
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,032
- TIME: I'll talk to TOD.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

1470
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,240
(Whispers)
JANEYEH: He says, "Ask for me too."

1471
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,416
CRIS: He's going to investigate him.

1472
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,600
SUNNY: Here, this one.

1473
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,896
SUNNY: Close the door first.

1474
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,680
SUNNY: Otherwise,
people outside will see.

1475
01:08:04,192 --> 01:08:05,888
(Woke up)
TOD: Already split up?

1476
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,040
TIME: So, how was yesterday?

1477
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, TIME.

1478
01:08:11,904 --> 01:08:16,640
TOD: Just general conversation.

1479
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,800
TOD: Nothing much,
maybe just some questions like...

1480
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,176
(Nodding)

1481
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,888
TIME: Then...

1482
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:32,512
TIME: Then the other two
you're interested in.

1483
01:08:32,864 --> 01:08:33,760
TIME: Are you still...

1484
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,320
TIMETHAI: Man, don't poke the bear.

1485
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,720
(Smiling)
TOD: I haven't told them yet.

1486
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:49,696
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh!

1487
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,160
TIME: What are you going to do
with the other two?

1488
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,160
TIME: Not talking?

1489
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,560
(Lying face down) TIMETHAI:
You ask too much. You'll get it soon.

1490
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,856
(Looking)

1491
01:09:02,714 --> 01:09:03,605
RUSAMEEKAE: It's awkward.

1492
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,872
CRIS: He might be bisexual.
How do you know?

1493
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
(Running his finger along his lips)
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, anything can happen.

1494
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,000
SUNNY: Hello.

1495
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:14,816
(Looking toward the door)

1496
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:16,760
CRIS: Who's interrupting?

1497
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,784
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1498
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,600
TIME: What did you say?

1499
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,760
TOD: She's coming.

1500
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,160
CRIS: NAMNUNG?

1501
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Who's coming?

1502
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,680
SUNNY: Can I come in?

1503
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,608
TOD: Sure.

1504
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:30,944
(Looking)

1505
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,160
CRIS: So brutal.

1506
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,280
CRIS: So brutal.

1507
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,440
SUNNY: Do you miss me?

1508
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,040
CRIS: This is so brutal.

1509
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,480
(Turning back)
TOD: We'll talk later.

1510
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,528
TIME: Can you tell me first?

1511
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,120
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD just walked away.

1512
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,352
(Walking into the bathroom)
CRIS: Oh, poor TOD.

1513
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:01,728
(Eye contact)

1514
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,840
SUNNY: How are you?

1515
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,640
TIME: I'm fine.

1516
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:10,080
(Comes closer)
SUNNY: I don't believe it.

1517
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,416
JANEYEH: So dramatic.

1518
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,360
TIME: I'm fine.

1519
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,520
SUNNY: I don't believe it.

1520
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:15,560
(Comes closer)
TIME: Why not?

1521
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,800
SUNNY: KONG said that...

1522
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,920
SUNNY: You were just sitting there,
totally zoned out.

1523
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,144
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG.

1524
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:23,072
JANEYEH: That little troublemaker.

1525
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,696
SUNNY: Why so quiet?

1526
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,320
(Curious)

1527
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:40,233
TIME: Let's go outside.

1528
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,416
RUSAMEEKAE: Is it because of TOD?
He wants to chat with her privately.

1529
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,840
JANEYEH: Oh, right.

1530
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,944
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD will come out
and see that they are gone.

1531
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,344
TIME: Okay, let me share my feelings.

1532
01:10:57,472 --> 01:10:58,176
SUNNY: Sure.

1533
01:10:59,328 --> 01:11:01,720
TIME: Well...

1534
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,240
JANEYEH: What?

1535
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,744
SUNNY: You were sad yesterday, right?

1536
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:12,583
(Asking first)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh?

1537
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,920
TIME: Yesterday...

1538
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,112
TIME: What's really sad is...

1539
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,032
TIME: When we counted the scores,

1540
01:11:20,032 --> 01:11:21,000
TIME: I thought to myself.

1541
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,920
TIME: Okay.

1542
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,328
TIME: I didn't win.

1543
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,440
TIME: And it's just like we didn't see
each other two nights in a row.

1544
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,592
- TIME: The other day,
- SUNNY: Hmm.

1545
01:11:30,784 --> 01:11:32,416
- TIME: we were in different houses, right?
- SUNNY: We were in different houses.

1546
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:33,824
TIME: And you were away yesterday.

1547
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,200
TIME: And TOD wasn't around either.

1548
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,576
TIME: I just felt...

1549
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,240
TIME: I didn't know

1550
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,864
TIME: how to handle it.

1551
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,720
TIMETHAI: Friends were all gone.

1552
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,520
TIME: It's just...

1553
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,800
TIME: So many thoughts flooded my mind.

1554
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,944
TIME: So I sat and wrote.

1555
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:51,560
TIME: I played guitar.

1556
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,608
TIME: I did push-ups.

1557
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,200
(Laughing)
TIME: I didn't know what else to do.

1558
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,752
TIME: Uh...

1559
01:12:00,704 --> 01:12:01,600
TIME: It's not that I feel...

1560
01:12:02,112 --> 01:12:04,288
TIME: I was just shocked
by my own feelings. Like...

1561
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,112
TIME: Why do I miss this person so much?

1562
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,080
TIME: We only met a few days ago.

1563
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,080
SUNNY: I miss you too.

1564
01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:16,360
CRIS: But SUNNY looks
interested in TIME too.

1565
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,880
- TIMETHAI: Yes, she came
to meet him first. - CRIS: Yes.

1566
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,320
SUNNY: I miss you too.

1567
01:12:20,928 --> 01:12:22,688
(Laughing)

1568
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,680
TIMETHAI: Oh, no.

1569
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,016
TIMETHAI: He's dead.

1570
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,896
TIMETHAI: Sweetness overload.

1571
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,232
TIME: Oh, really?

1572
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,248
SUNNY: Yeah.

1573
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,680
TIME: Interesting.

1574
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,160
SUNNY: Interesting what?

1575
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,784
- SUNNY: That I said it?
- TIME: Yeah.

1576
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:44,160
TIME: Can't believe
you said that out loud.

1577
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:46,432
(Looking)

1578
01:12:46,656 --> 01:12:47,920
SUNNY: I'm blushing at myself.

1579
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,864
TIME: Can you say it again?

1580
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:49,376
SUNNY: No.

1581
01:12:49,376 --> 01:12:49,960
TIME: Can you say it again?

1582
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,752
SUNNY: No.

1583
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,256
TIME: What a shame.

1584
01:12:56,256 --> 01:12:57,952
TIME: I lost by just one point.

1585
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,880
SUNNY: There's at least one more round.

1586
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,240
SUNNY: I think...

1587
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,448
TIME: Another thing.

1588
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,064
TIME: I also want...

1589
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,752
TIME: to talk with NAMNUNG.

1590
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:13,568
SUNNY: Yeah.

1591
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,280
TIME: But not in a...

1592
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,680
TIME: "I like you" kind of way.

1593
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,160
TIME: It's that initial interest I had.

1594
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,280
TIME: It hasn't disappeared.

1595
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,200
SUNNY: I get it. That's fine.

1596
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,432
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe he wants to
talk to NAMNUNG to clear things out.

1597
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,408
TIME: I just want to tell her, okay...

1598
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,160
TIME: How I felt from day one,

1599
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,184
TIME: and how it's changed now.

1600
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,104
TIME: I understand.

1601
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,000
CRIS: But I think
TIME is doing the right thing.

1602
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,840
CRIS: Obviously, he likes SUNNY.

1603
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,160
CRIS: And they like each other, right?

1604
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,680
CRIS: But he wants to tell...

1605
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,160
CRIS: SUNNY honestly
that he has to talk to NAMNUNG

1606
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,800
CRIS: to clear things up.

1607
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Just tell her he'll talk
to NAMNUNG. No sneaking around.

1608
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,232
CRIS: Exactly.

1609
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:06,944
SUNNY: But...

1610
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,752
SUNNY: I feel confused now.

1611
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,896
JANEYEH: What?

1612
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,320
TIME: For what?

1613
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,120
SUNNY: I don't know. I feel like...

1614
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,840
SUNNY: Suddenly,

1615
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,080
SUNNY: there's also this spark
between me and NAMNUNG.

1616
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,560
TIMETHAI: He doesn't know
whether to celebrate or cry.

1617
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,128
CRIS: Mind blown.

1618
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,176
JANEYEH: Confused, right?

1619
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,440
TIMETHAI: Totally zoned out.

1620
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,008
- CRIS: Zoned out.
- TIMETHAI: Completely zoned out.

1621
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:43,904
JANEYEH: Absolutely wild.

1622
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,920
CRIS: Oh, I feel bad for TOD.

1623
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,304
JANEYEH: Everyone's heartbroken.

1624
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:03,520
TIMETHAI: The heartbreak clubhouse.

1625
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,984
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

1626
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,480
JANEYEH: SUNNY's awesome.

1627
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,040
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm wondering if
when SUNNY said "spark with NAMNUNG",

1628
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,472
RUSAMEEKAE: was that sarcasm?

1629
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:18,368
JANEYEH: I don't think so.

1630
01:15:18,368 --> 01:15:18,944
CRIS: No.

1631
01:15:18,944 --> 01:15:20,000
CRIS: Honestly, everything feels...

1632
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,048
TIMETHAI: But I think the atmosphere's good.
They're both being honest.

1633
01:15:22,048 --> 01:15:23,960
TIMETHAI: They're not holding back.

1634
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,464
JANEYEH: SUNNY's confusion is real.
Those feelings are real.

1635
01:15:26,464 --> 01:15:28,480
RUSAMEEKAE:
If it were me, I'd feel sulky.

1636
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,384
RUSAMEEKAE: I'd just say "Okay",
and then say, "Oh, I like NAMNUNG too."

1637
01:15:32,384 --> 01:15:34,336
CRIS: Playing mind games is exhausting.

1638
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,440
JANEYEH: SUNNY doesn't seem like
that kind of person.

1639
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,160
JANEYEH: She looks straightforward.
I mean she says what she feels.

1640
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,280
TIMETHAI: But that "I miss you too."

1641
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,616
TIMETHAI: That really killed me.

1642
01:15:43,616 --> 01:15:44,512
(Defeated by honesty)
TIMETHAI: I'm dead.

1643
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,960
RUSAMEEKAE: On this show,
it's impossible to predict anything.

1644
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Even the four of us
sitting right here.

1645
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,880
RUSAMEEKAE: We can't predict
anything at all.

1646
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,360
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to know,
just tune in and watch along with us.

1647
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Saturday
at 6 PM Beijing Time, only on WeTV...

1648
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,752
ALL: Borderless Love,

1649

ALL: LOVE(X).

1650
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,920
RUSAMEEKAE: We have to go for today.

1651
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,376
RUSAMEEKAE: Goodbye.

1652
01:16:09,376 --> 01:16:10,560
TIMETHAI: Goodbye.

1653
01:16:13,344 --> 01:16:18,515
(Want to meet singles?

1654
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,464

to chat with them on the livestream.)

1655
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:27,600
(Preview) (Today, we have a special activity:
the LOVE(X) Prom King & Queen Contest.)

1656
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,648
(Please feel free to pair up
to prepare a performance together.)

1657
01:16:31,648 --> 01:16:33,664
- FRAME: Can we do a trio?
- KONG: Yeah.

1658
01:16:33,664 --> 01:16:34,920
CHERRY: Sure, I'll teach you.

1659
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,080
JANEYEH: He looks like a sad puppy.

1660
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,120
RUSAMEEKAE: This is so sad.

1661
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,720
NAMNUNG: If I don't do something now,
I'll regret it later.

1662
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,600
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME probably hopes
to be chosen too.

1663
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,040
SUNNY: Someone keeps staring at us

1664
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,240
CANDIDATE: Someone keeps staring.

1665
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,272
LOVE(X)PERT: TIME's staring.

1666
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,400
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG.

1667
01:16:53,536 --> 01:16:58,240
NAMNUNG: If I could turn back time,
I'd go back to the first day we met.

1668
01:17:02,688 --> 01:17:03,648
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow!

1669
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:04,928
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

1670
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:06,480
NAMNUNG: What is this nonsense?

1671
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,760
TIME: Stop acting!

1672
01:17:08,576 --> 01:17:11,400
TIME: Such a drama queen,
aren't you, SUNNY?

1673
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,040
CRIS: SUNNY looks shocked.

1674
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,088
TIME: I feel like I've hurt you.

1675
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:19,072
JANEYEH: Oh, maybe about that acting.

1676
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:20,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Sorry, but he did it.

1677
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,800
TIMETHAI: Calm down.

1678
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,968
SUNNY: You can't blame anyone.
These are everyone's true feelings.

1679
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:29,632
CRIS: You're number one.

1680
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,600
TIME: No.

1681
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,512
SUNNY: Hello.

1682
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,160
NAMNUNG: Everyone's in pair.
I don't know where to go.

1683
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,008
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, my God.

1684
01:17:39,008 --> 01:17:40,192
JOY: TIME's crying.

1685
01:17:40,192 --> 01:17:41,200
TOD: Really?

1686
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,720
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow,
I feel so sorry for him.

1687
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,760
JANEYEH: I won't scold you. Sorry.

1688
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,880
JANEYEH: TOD, it's your turn.

1689
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,800
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD.

1690
