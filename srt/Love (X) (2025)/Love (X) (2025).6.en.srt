00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey, hey.

353
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,536
RUSAMEEKAE: What about SUNNY?

354
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,640
JANEYEH: TOD.

355
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:49,664
(All in one bite)

356
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,128
(Looking)

357
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,280
RUSAMEEKAE: It feels tense,
doesn't it, JANEYEH?

358
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,808
RUSAMEEKAE: The atmosphere
is tense right now.

359
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,688
RUSAMEEKAE: Or maybe
the brownie isn't good?

360
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:07,616
JANEYEH: Could be.

361
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:09,504
TIMETHAI: It might be stuck in the teeth
and don't want talk now.

362
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:12,864
(Tasting)

363
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:15,712
(Looking)

364
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
FRAME: Want to wipe your mouth?

365
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,720
FRAME: It's messy.

366
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:24,280
(Leaning her face forward)

367
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,376
JANEYEH: Oh wow.

368
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,776
JANEYEH: Wow.

369
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:33,696
CRIS: Everyone is so talented.

370
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,392
CRIS: Everyone is so amazing.
I don't get it.

371
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,600
JANEYEH: Usually,
you'd just wipe it yourself, right?

372
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,432
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

373
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,888
JANEYEH: Too cute.

374
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,560
JANEYEH: He's confused. ASSE is confused.

375
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,008
(Purses lips)

376
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,920
CHERRY: Here, right?

377
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,040
FRAME: Yes.

378
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,944
FRAME: Just a bit more.

379
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,880
JANEYEH: Hey.

380
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

381
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,240
TIMETHAI: Wow.

382
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:05,088
CRIS: ASSE might faint now.

383
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
FRAME: It's tasty, right?

384
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,720
JANEYEH: Wow, the look.

385
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,040
TIMETHAI: "Wow, is this even possible?"

386
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,960
FRAME: But I don't know
who I'll be sharing a room with tonight.

387
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,160
CHERRY: My room still has an empty bed.

388
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,840
JANEYEH: She collapsed.

389
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,640
RUSAMEEKAE: CHERRY's never
said anything like this.

390
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,560
JANEYEH: Yes.

391
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,680
CHERRY: My room still has an empty bed.

392
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:45,184
(Laugh)

393
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,840
TIME: Okay.

394
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,360
JANEYEH: ASSE is getting confused now.

395
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,960
FRAME: Have those two gone to X-Land?

396
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,984
CHERRY: Oh, yeah.

397
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,160
(Look)

398
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,960
MILL: Hey.

399
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,600
TIMETHAI: No one knew at all.

400
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,288
SUNNY: Yeah, I just noticed.

401
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,592
CRIS: Not everyone is back yet.

402
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,640
MILL: I just noticed that...

403
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:10,080
FRAME: Oh, no one knows either, right?

404
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
TOD: Yeah, true.

405
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,400
TIME: So they chose each other?

406
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,976
CANDIDATE: Hey.

407
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:16,880
SUNNY: Oh, yeah.

408
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,960
TIME: They went by themselves.

409
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
CRIS: Oh, did they just realize it?

410
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:22,920
RUSAMEEKAE: They were too busy
getting excited about FRAME.

411
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,840
TIME: It's fine.
I didn't want to go anyway.

412
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:28,128
JANEYEH: Hey.

413
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
MILL: Oh?

414
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,280
SUNNY: What's this called, sour grapes?

415
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,080
CRIS: But he actually wanted to go, right?

416
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

417
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,440
CRIS: I like her a lot, FRAME.

418
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,984
RUSAMEEKAE: Will FRAME's arrival
affect the relationships?

419
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,120
JANEYEH: It's going to shake things up.

420
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,360
CRIS: It's all a mess. I'm telling you.

421
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Who do you think
was the quietest today?

422
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,960
TIMETHAI: GOONG. GOONG was quiet.

423
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,920
CRIS: GOONG disappeared.

424
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,280
CRIS: GOONG disappeared.

425
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,560
JANEYEH: FRAME could be his type.

426
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,408
RUSAMEEKAE: Has anyone
ever thought that FRAME

427
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,720
RUSAMEEKAE: might have a liking for girls?
At the wiping moment?

428
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,240
JANEYEH: I think there's a chance.

429
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
TIMETHAI: I think she can be too.

430
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,872
RUSAMEEKAE: It feels like TIME and SUNNY

431
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,720
RUSAMEEKAE: are looking at FRAME,
wondering if FRAME is into both.

432
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,784
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe she likes both.

433
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,680
TIMETHAI: Liking both
means everything is possible.

434
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Actually,
is CHERRY enjoying FRAME or what?

435
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,680
RUSAMEEKAE: But I'm pretty sure about ASSE.

436
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,280
CRIS: He's confused.

437
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, he is. And since FRAME
came in, CHERRY wasn't there.

438
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,824
RUSAMEEKAE: His eyes
were shining with excitement.

439
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:35,136
RUSAMEEKAE: And when CHERRY came in,
it started having like...

440
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:37,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Could it be a love triangle
among these three?

441
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,144
CRIS: Wow.

442
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:39,328
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's go watch.

443
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,712
CANDIDATE: Go.

444
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:44,832
CANDIDATE: Go home.

445
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:45,840
CANDIDATE: Together.

446
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,648
CHERRY: Do you want to stay
with me? I stay alone.

447
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:48,576
FRAME: Sure.

448
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,720
- RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?
- JANEYEH: Huh?

449
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Who asked?

450
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,720
CRIS: CHERRY.

451
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,320
JUNSU: Go.

452
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,200
FRAME: I'll go?

453
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,880
JUNSU: Yeah, go first.

454
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:56,832
ASSE: Okay.

455
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:58,360
- JUNSU: Goodnight
- ASSE: Bye-bye.

456
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,168
CHERRY: Boost, boost.

457
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,880
- CHERRY: I'll show you the room.
- FRAME: Okay.

458
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,552
FRAME: Here?

459
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,704
CHERRY: Yes.

460
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,280
FRAME: Are you lonely sleeping alone?

461
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,688
CHERRY: A little. Actually, very lonely.

462
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,192
- RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.
- JANEYEH: Wow.

463
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:14,200
CHERRY: How is it? Are you excited?

464
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,320
FRAME: I'm excited.
It feels kind of new and different.

465
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,400
CHERRY: Tomorrow's game
should be more fun and intense.

466
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
FRAME: Because there are more people?

467
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,400
CHERRY: Yes, there's one more woman.

468
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,592
JANEYEH: Then they gave
each other sweet smiles.

469
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:31,640
RUSAMEEKAE: What is that?

470
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,560
CHERRY: But our faces are quite similar.

471
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,280
FRAME: Yeah, I guess our eyes.

472
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,120
- FRAME: Just try covering this part.
- CHERRY: Yes.

473
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,600
- CHERRY: I was thinking we look alike.
- FRAME: If you cover this part.

474
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,360
FRAME: Really.

475
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,160
FRAME: Like twins?

476
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,400
CHERRY: Yes.

477
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,920
CHERRY: If I only see your eyes...

478
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,520
CHERRY: If I only see your eyes,

479
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,088
CHERRY: you're me.

480
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,104
JANEYEH: Oh! They look
at each other like that.

481
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,680
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm confused.

482
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,760
CRIS: Confused. I'm confused.

483
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Isn't CHERRY
being subtle, right, JANEYEH?

484
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,120
RUSAMEEKAE: I don't know. I can't tell.

485
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,760
JANEYEH: She's flirting.

486
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,040
CRIS: I'm excited. I'm blushing now.

487
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,320
CRIS: But these two get along well.
They could fall for each other.

488
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,800
CRIS: They really get along.
They're fierce yet quiet.

489
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
TIMETHAI: It still looks normal to me.

490
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,520
CRIS: Oh, Koh Samui is beautiful.

491
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,440
NAMNUNG: We are back.

492
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,944

TOD: Wow.

502
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,640

CRIS: They're holding hands.

506
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,960
JANEYEH: That's wonderful.

507
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,040
CRIS: Wonderful.

508
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,704
TOD: Wow.

509
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:54,176
JANEYEH: Look at how he "wow."

510
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:56,544
- CRIS: It's a fake "wow," TOD.
- RUSAMEEKAE: That's...

511
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:58,720

512

513
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,440

TIME: Happy honeymoon, right?

516
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:08,160
MATHEUS: Very good.

517
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,008
SUNNY: You're still
wearing the same outfit.

518
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,800
CRIS: She's like,
"Hey, it's okay, friends."

519
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,800
TIME: When they walked in,

520
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,640
TIME: there's something in their eyes.

521
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,120
TIME: It's not like MATHEUS.

522
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,720
TIME: Seems like MATHEUS is happier.

523
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,880
TIME: Happy honeymoon.

524
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,280

525
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:32,960
CRIS: Oh!

526
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,600
JANEYEH: Oh!

527
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:37,024
(Nod)

528
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,392
CRIS: What can they say?
They can only nod.

529
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
MATHEUS: How was your night?

530
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,240
CRIS: Get your inhaler ready.
You'll see Master FRAME.

531
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,992
RUSAMEEKAE: And what if
MATHEUS sees FRAME?

532
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,824
NAMNUNG: Oh, wait!

533
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,800
JANEYEH: Shocked.

534
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,800
MATHEUS: Newcomer?

535
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,400
NAMNUNG: So you're new.

536
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,760
FRAME: My name is FRAME.

537
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,000
FRAME: You're...

538
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:02,920
MATHEUS: FRAME.

539
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,776
MATHEUS: I'm MATHEUS.

540
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:04,280
NAMNUNG: MATHEUS.

541
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,040
NAMNUNG: I'm NAMNUNG.

542
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Did anyone notice NAMNUNG?

543
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,080
JANEYEH: She's looking a bit concerned.

544
00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:10,120
FRAME: MATHEUS.

545
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,640
FRAME: NAMNUNG.

546
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,000
CRIS: FRAME is so beautiful.

547
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,880
MATHEUS: Okay.

548
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,160
NAMNUNG: At first, I didn't notice.

549
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,600
NAMNUNG: From her appearance,

550
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,440
NAMNUNG: skin, face,

551
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,920
NAMNUNG: and hair,

552
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,840
NAMNUNG: she looks good.

553
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,280
NAMNUNG: But I don't know her
that well yet.

554
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,400
NAMNUNG: Yes,
I can't decide anything yet.

555
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Many things happened, right?

556
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,320
CRIS: But her face looked very tense.

557
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,240
CRIS: It's like "Who are you?"

558
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,392
JANEYEH: Yes, very tense.

559
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,792
JANEYEH: "I was gone one night.
Where did you come from?" That feeling.

560
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:38,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Right.

561
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,200
RUSAMEEKAE: We don't know
what's in NAMNUNG's mind.

562
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,120
RUSAMEEKAE: We don't know
if she's happy with the date or not.

563
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,240
CRIS: Maybe she wanted to talk to TOD

564
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,480
CRIS: or TIME, maybe?
Something like that.

565
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Exactly.

566
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,160
CRIS: But now the game has changed.

567
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:50,760
CANDIDATE: There's nothing else, right?

568
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,720
CANDIDATE: That's all?

569
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,000
CANDIDATE: Should we go
into the air-conditioned room?

570
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
CANDIDATE: Yes, it's hot here.

571
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't tell me
he is going to jump in the water.

572
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:03,000
RUSAMEEKAE: He's heartbreaking. Won't the show
be one candidate short? That leaves only 11?

573
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,440
JANEYEH: He looks sad.

574
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,880
JANEYEH: Is he waiting to talk?

575
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,640
TIME: What's up?

576
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,160
NAMNUNG: Just changed clothes.

577
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Here we go.

578
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,680
RUSAMEEKAE: He's looking for her.

579
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,080
NAMNUNG: Last night,

580
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,040
NAMNUNG: I didn't get
to sleep until 3 AM.

581
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,480
TIME: 3 AM?

582
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,720
NAMNUNG: Sort of.

583
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
TIME: Why didn't you choose me yesterday?

584
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,776
JANEYEH: Wow.

585
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
CRIS: Straight to the point. I like it.

586
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,160
NAMNUNG: If I were in the middle
of you two, it wouldn't feel right.

587
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,600
TIME: So, initially,
you intended to choose me?

588
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:26,496
(Nod)

589
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,680
TIME: Really?

590
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,240
NAMNUNG: Otherwise,
I wouldn't stand there hesitating.

591
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,064
TIME: I didn't see you at all.
When did you come?

592
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,248
NAMNUNG: I didn't go in,
but I peeked a little.

593
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:46,880
TIME: Oh.

594
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,920
TIME: Okay.

595
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:50,432
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

596
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,680
TIME: Initially,
I was hoping I'd get to go.

597
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,840
NAMNUNG: But...

598
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,600
NAMNUNG: I thought
you were interested in SUNNY.

599
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,640
JANEYEH: Oh.

600
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,512
CRIS: Oh, my God.

601
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,192
NAMNUNG: I thought
you were interested in SUNNY.

602
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:17,600
JANEYEH: Wow.

603
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:18,960
JANEYEH: She just said it.

604
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,080
JANEYEH: How will TIME answer?

605
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,560
TIME: Can't we be interested
in more than one person?

606
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,600
- RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.
- JANEYEH: Wow.

607
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,824
TIME: We just arrived.

608
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
NAMNUNG: It can be like that.

609
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,400
JANEYEH: Oh.

610
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,144
NAMNUNG: Because that's how it is.

611
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,776
NAMNUNG: I don't want to block others.

612
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:36,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

613
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
JANEYEH: This pair is very fierce.

614
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,680
NAMNUNG: And he

615
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,608
NAMNUNG: asked me first.

616
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

617
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,856
CRIS: Oh, she's good at this too.
Understand?

618
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,488
CRIS: Baby, I'm so sorry.

619
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:53,400
JANEYEH: Yes. He was the one
who asked me first.

620
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,000
RUSAMEEKAE: I feel like I'm going to
have a heart attack from this stress.

621
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,120
TIME: I understand.

622
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

623
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,472
CRIS: Understand?
This person is on another level.

624
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,760
TIME: We just arrived.
We can't block anyone.

625
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,280
TIME: We have to open up to everyone.

626
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,360
TIME: But if you're asking
about the first impression...

627
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,840
TIME: It's clear to me
that I like you two.

628
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,240
- JANEYEH: Wow.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

629
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,976
RUSAMEEKAE: Then what is
the point of saying that?

630
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:23,960
TIMETHAI: Just stay still.

631
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
TIME: It's clear to me
that I like you two.

632
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

633
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,240
JANEYEH: They seem incredibly sulky.

634
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
RUSAMEEKAE: They're
not showing it, though.

635
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,560
TIME: But whether we can get along
is something we'll have to see.

636
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,480
TIME: Let's see.

637
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,760
TIME: According to your own feelings,
if you like someone...

638
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,904
NAMNUNG: Then just go with that.

639
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,680
TIME: Yes.

640
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,824
JANEYEH: Oh, wow.

641
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Is there a chance
of a breakup?

642
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,560
TIMETHAI: It's just this period.
I think it'll soon be forgotten.

643
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Will you speak?
If it were you, would you say it? CRIS.

644
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,848
- TIMETHAI: I'd ask how it is.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

645
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:33,200
TIMETHAI: But if you do this,
it's like you're giving in.

646
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Right?

647
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,040
TIMETHAI: It's happened already.

648
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,960
TIMETHAI: Everyone has
their own reasons and thoughts.

649
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
TIMETHAI: There's no point
in sitting and talking about it.

650
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
CRIS: If I were NAMNUNG,
I'd walk over and clear things up.

651
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,560
CRIS: Will TIME really change
his mind and like someone else?

652
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,320
CRIS: Then I'd know
he never really liked me from the start.

653
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Can we say that this is
about protecting each other's feelings?

654
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,800
RUSAMEEKAE: It's about being clear
so we don't hurt each other.

655
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,600
TIMETHAI: That could be.

656
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,416
RUSAMEEKAE: But just now
there was such a statement.

657
00:26:56,736 --> 00:27:01,792
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME said to NAMNUNG,
"Can't we be interested in more than one person?"

658
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:05,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Can we get to know
many people at the same time?

659
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Until we finally choose one
and say, "Hey, this is the one."

660
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,360
CRIS: I feel that if I find out
that the guy I'm chatting with

661
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,184
CRIS: is also chatting
with someone else in the same way,

662
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:19,424
CRIS: I would feel like
I've been pushed into a competition.

663
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

664
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,168
CRIS: Really, an important point

665
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:26,720
CRIS: is that if you truly like me,
it means you like me individually.

666
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,840
CRIS: So why would you want
to talk with someone else?

667
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Then we don't need
to be in a position of competing

668
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,320
RUSAMEEKAE: and do everything
so that he'll like us.

669
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,160
JANEYEH: The moment I know
I'm not the only one, it's over.

670
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,760
CRIS: See?

671
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,320
- JANEYEH: I'd stop talking.
- CRIS: I'm like this too.

672
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,680
TIMETHAI: You shouldn't let them know.

673
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,200
TIMETHAI: Once they find out, they'll react
like this. We shouldn't let them know.

674
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,000
CRIS: So, the way you men solve problems

675
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:53,536
CRIS: is not by concentrating
on one person,

676
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:55,456
CRIS: but by preventing the other person from
knowing that you're talking to multiple people?

677
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,912
(I'm done)

678
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,072
(Found a card)

679
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,200
- RUSAMEEKAE: Eh.
- CRIS: Eh.

680
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:07,520
MATHEUS: What?

681
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:09,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Everyone got it.

682
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,560
NAMNUNG: To let everyone
get to know FRAME,

683
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,440
NAMNUNG: the new candidate...

684
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,216
MILL: Today is a special day
for her date.

685
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,656
(Special privilege to go on a date with FRAME)
MILL: Only one of you

686
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,120
MILL: will get the privilege
to date her.

687
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,520
- ASSE: In ten minutes...
- JUNSU: In ten minutes...

688
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,600
(The first to send a date invite will get to date FRAME)
TIME: The first to send a date invite...

689
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,280

CRIS: and the other person
don't know the language.

754

both of them.

really likes FRAME.

FRAME went to ask. It's not the same.

JANEYEH: It's not the same.

RUSAMEEKAE: It's not the same.

794
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,600
TIMETHAI: Maybe she just wanted
to bring her roommate.

795
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,520
JANEYEH: Really?
But I don't see it that way.

JANEYEH: I think she likes her.

wouldn't she have chosen someone else?

JANEYEH: There are so many people,
She has many options to date.

RUSAMEEKAE: Why choose CHERRY?

801

TIMETHAI: But the purpose is
to get to know each other better.

802
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,480
TIMETHAI: Aren't they already well-acquainted
since they're roommates?

803
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,720
JANEYEH: She wants to get
to know her even better.

CRIS: She wants to go on
an adventure, dear.

805

'a moment where it's just the two of us.'

806

TIMETHAI: It's more about what
they're going to do.

FRAME: so I feel like...

862
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,520
FRAME: maybe if we go
and do an activity outside,

864

CHERRY: Hmm.

866

there's an elephant, that's all.

868

bathe the elephant?

friend vibes.

Whether they end up liking each other

876

that's still adorable.

RUSAMEEKAE: I thought
it was the last episode.

1256
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,560

the series is about to end, huh?

1257

feels relaxing. I'm glad we got to chat more, haha.)

1282
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,968

or flirting.

1283
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,280

1284
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:49,880

looking at you or for you.

1287
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,120
- RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.
- JANEYEH: Wow.

1288
00:53:10,784 --> 00:53:12,640

1290
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,440

we wrote the same thing.

1291
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,280
TIMETHAI: This chat is fun.

1292
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,480
RUSAMEEKAE: And TIME should
know by now that it's SUNNY.

1293

Found it.

1294
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,728
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

1295
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:34,336
RUSAMEEKAE: Next time, shall we go together?
No matter what, I'll play the game to win.

1296
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:39,760
- RUSAMEEKAE: So I can choose you, and you won't have the chance to choose others, in case you win.
- CRIS: "In case you win."

1297
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,440
JANEYEH: She's just saying it,
just in case.

1298
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,000
CRIS: Just saying.

1299
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,080
CRIS: The first sentence
is like apologizing and flirting.

1300
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,616
CRIS: This is also like a master.

1301
00:53:47,616 --> 00:53:49,480

1304
00:53:53,504 --> 00:53:55,264
(Let me explain)- TIMETHAI: Probably not everyone.
- JANEYEH: Casanova, such a casanova.

1305
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:57,728
TIMETHAI: Because I'm not like that.

1306
00:53:57,728 --> 00:53:59,136
(Let me go.)

1307
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,432
CRIS: There was no expression just now.

1308
00:54:02,976 --> 00:54:04,256
(Impatient)

1309
00:54:05,696 --> 00:54:06,688
(JUNSU received one letter.)

1310
00:54:07,296 --> 00:54:09,792

CRIS: TOD wrote to FRAME too.

1319
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,776
TIMETHAI: Maybe he greeted the newcomer?

1320
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,840
CRIS: Whoa, whoa!

1321
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,960

(Allowed to get married) CRIS: After the show ends,
they might have a wedding, an engagement.

1333
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,080
RUSAMEEKAE: But do you know
what's happening now?

1334
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,040
CRIS: What else?

1335
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,920

1345

00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,480
(The rules of the game:)

1365
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,232
(Press your face against the fruit)
(Each team has two to three members.)

1366
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,360
(Everyone must be blindfolded)

1367
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,080
(and use their cheeks
to touch the same piece of fruit.)

1368
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,760
CRIS: Every game on this show...

1369
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,640
(They have)

1370
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,680
(90 seconds)
(90 seconds to guess what fruit it is.)

1371
00:56:21,536 --> 00:56:22,240
(So excited.)

1372
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,240
JANEYEH: Who came up with this game?

1373
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,600
CRIS: It means if you wanna smell it,
your mouths have to be really close.

1374
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,240
TIMETHAI: Just suck it up a bit
so we can win.

1375
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,064
(Wanna see this)

1376
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,000
(The team that guesses the most fruits
correctly will get the most shell coins.)

1377
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,520
CRIS: Who to be paired with?

1378
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,720
(Rainbow rope of fate)
(Before the game starts,)

1379
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,400
(Rainbow rope of fate)
(everyone will be paired up by the rope of destiny.)

1380
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,400
(They'll all be divided
into four teams.)

1381
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,880
(Everyone takes one end
of a rope from the box.)

1382
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,760
(Whoever's holding the same rope
will be on the same team.)

1383
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,960
CRIS: Even if you want to be with someone,
you won't end up with them.

1384
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,040
RUSAMEEKAE: It's random.

1385
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,880
JANEYEH:
Who's going to be paired up with who?

1386
00:56:54,752 --> 00:56:55,776
(Excitedly clutching pillow)

1387
00:56:57,728 --> 00:57:00,192
(Excited)

1388
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,328
MATHEUS: So warm.

1389
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,320
(Look)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, JUNSU.

1390
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
FRAME: I'm excited.

1391
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,160
FRAME: Are you excited?

1392
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,584
(Pull)

1393
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,720
ALL: 3, 2, 1.

1394
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,640
ALL: Wow! Who is it?

1395
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Who is it?

1396
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?
Who's paired with who?

1397
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,360
(Paired together)
CRIS: CHERRY and MILL.

1398
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,680
JUNSU: ASSE.

1399
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,720
JUNSU: The boys.

1400
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,720
TIMETHAI: JUNSU is with ASSE,
the roommates.

1401
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,640
JUNSU: And...

1402
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,080
JUNSU: Me.

1403
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,320
ASSE: We're on the same team.

1404
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:43,456
(Paired up as a team)

1405
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:47,648
(Look)

1406
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:49,248
(Sneaks a glance)

1407
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,040
(Look)
CRIS: What's this?

1408
00:57:56,672 --> 00:57:57,280
(Look)

1409
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
RUSAMEEKAE: And where did FRAME go?

1410
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,000
CRIS: Who is TOD with?

1411
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,200
JANEYEH: Oh no.

1412
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,128
(Look)
CANDIDATE: ASSE.

1413
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:07,136
(Paired up)

1414
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:08,920
(What's this?)
CRIS: Oh no!

1415
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:09,960
CRIS: Oh no!

1416
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,840
(Look)
JANEYEH: Oh dear!

1417
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,040
(Watches them go)
SUNNY: That team is perfect.

1418
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,320
SUNNY: They're all about
the same size and height.

1419
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
CRIS: Oh my God!

1420
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,000
(Look)

1421
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,520
TIMETHAI: Oh my God!

1422
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,160
TIME: We have to win.

1423
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,800
TIME: Okay. Okay.!

1424
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,800
FRAME: Okay.

1425
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,240
CRIS: Roommates together again.

1426
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,280
CRIS: These two are roommates too.

1427
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,040
TIMETHAI: Yeah, it's like both teams
are two-two roommates

1428
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,824
(Look)

1429
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,560
NAMNUNG: Oh, MATHEUS.

1430
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,400
RUSAMEEKAE:
MATHEUS is back with NAMNUNG.

1431
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:36,920
RUSAMEEKAE: And JOY.

1432
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,600
(Paired together) MATHEUS: Three people.
Together, together.

1433
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,480
MATHEUS: Three people is okay.

1434
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,800
MILL: Oh, they got three people.

1435
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,000
CHERRY: Two people should be better.

1436
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,400
MILL: Yeah, it'll probably be easier.

1437
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,440
CHERRY: Easier.

1438
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,800
JUNSU: Three, three, two, three.

1439
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,920
ASSE: Yeah.

1440
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,920
(Since MATHEUS is injured,)

1441
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,232
(he can choose whether
to compete himself)

1442
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:59,040
(or have someone else
play in his place.)

1443
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,640
CRIS: Oh.

1444
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,480
(The coins won by MATHEUS's representative
will all belong to MATHEUS.)

1445
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,560
(Look)
CRIS: Whoa.

1446
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:09,312
(Turn to look)

1447
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:12,864
(Purse lips)

1448
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,760
MATHEUS: I wanna play.

1449
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,800
(MATHEUS decides to play)

1450
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,600
(Matheus chooses to play)
MATHEUS: I wanna play.

1451
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,520
(Arm in arm)RUSAMEEKAE: But I think
MATHEUS wants to play because of NAMNUNG.

1452
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,760
JANEYEH: Really? But hasn't he already changed?
Hasn't MATHEUS moved on?

1453
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,800
CRIS: Didn't MATHEUS
send a letter to SUNNY?

1454
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,320
RUSAMEEKAE: But he does care.
It's like he doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

1455
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,520
NAMNUNG: Like this?

1456
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,760
NAMNUNG: Move like this.

1457
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,120
JOY: Can I move?

1458
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,120
MATHEUS: Can I remove this?

1459
00:59:49,568 --> 00:59:51,584
(Help me remove it)

1460
00:59:52,768 --> 00:59:53,654
(Looking)

1461
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,520
(Looking)
RUSAMEEKAE: Look, look.

1462
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,680
NAMNUNG: Like this one.

1463
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,960
MATHEUS: Yeah, open, open.

1464
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,880
(Looking)
CRIS: SUNNY.

1465
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,320
SUNNY: Is it wet?

1466
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,680
MATHEUS: I'm gonna remove it,

1467
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,720
MATHEUS: so I can be more flexible.

1468
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,056
(Help)

1469
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:12,920
(Crossing arms)

1470
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,760
ALL: Oh!

1471
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,480
RUSAMEEKAE: What happened to TIME?

1472
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,040
JANEYEH: TIME is not satisfied
with this.

1473
01:00:17,984 --> 01:00:19,104
(Crossing arms)

1474
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,280
CRIS: MATHEUS is suddenly hot.
I'm so confused.

1475
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,680
JANEYEH: And why are so many people
helping him like that?

1476
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,920
CRIS: But even TOD is confused.
Everyone is swarming around MATHEUS.

1477
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,640
MATHEUS: Yes.

1478
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,560
CRIS: What are they all fussing over?

1479
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,280
RUSAMEEKAE: It's that let me
be the one to take care of him.

1480
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,600
CRIS: Or maybe
he doesn't think anything of it.

1481
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,928
(Passing)

1482
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,640
(Looking)
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey, it hurts.

1483
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,800
CRIS: It hurts.

1484
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,400
MATHEUS: Thank you.

1485
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,280
MATHEUS: I can do this like this.

1486
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,760
TIME: That's cute.

1487
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,160
TIME: That's cute.

1488
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,400
RUSAMEEKAE: He's just trying to
cover up how shy he is.

1489
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,440
JANEYEH: He's so shy
he doesn't know what to do.

1490
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,600
(Next, we'll play
the cheek-to-fruit guessing game.)

1491
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,720
(There will be two rounds.)

1492
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,360
(In the first round, the three-person team
goes against the two-person team.)

1493
01:01:14,944 --> 01:01:17,184
(Round 1: TIME, TOD and FRAME
VS MILL and CHERRY)

1494
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,160
MILL: Bend down, quick.

1495
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,280
CHERRY: Okay, okay.

1496
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,560
MILL: Lock your arms.

1497
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,400
CHERRY: Okay, lock our arms.

1498
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,680
TIME: What if I kiss you?

1499
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,520
TIME: What if I kiss you?

1500
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,160
JANEYEH: What?

1501
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,440
TIMETHAI: What kind of question is that?

1502
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops!

1503
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,520
JANEYEH: She's looking at TOD.

1504
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:34,720
(Kiss)

1505
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:36,448
(Ah)

1506
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,840
(The straight guy can't stand it)
TIMETHAI: They're starting. Don't. No.

1507
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:40,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Call MARIO for me.

1508
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,600
(I want to tell him)

1509
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,640
(I want to tell him)
RUSAMEEKAE: I want to tell MARIO.

1510
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,440
TIMETHAI: There's a problem, MARIO.

1511
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,840
TIMETHAI: They're about to kiss.

1512
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,488
(Surprised)

1513
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,720
(Glancing)
JANEYEH: FRAME is confused.

1514
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,760
(Backing up)
FRAME: Here you go!

1515
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,560
TIME: Move, make some room.

1516
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:54,960
FRAME: Okay, got it.

1517
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,760
- TIME: Move aside.
- FRAME: Okay.

1518
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,520
(Each team chooses one assistant)

1519
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,880
(to bring the fruit up to their cheeks.)

1520
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,920
(Speaking confidently)
CHERRY: ASSE.

1521
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,280
- CHERRY: ASSE.
- MILL: We choose ASSE.

1522
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,360
RUSAMEEKAE: So fast.

1523
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,520
CRIS: They trust him the most.

1524
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,320
(Looking)
CRIS: Oh!

1525
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,880
ASSE: Yes.

1526
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:22,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Who's that?

1527
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,360
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY.

1528
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,480
TOD: NAMNUNG.

1529
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:30,960
CRIS: NAMNUNG.

1530
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:32,240
(Looking)

1531
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,376
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops!

1703
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,840
(the timer will keep running.)

1704
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,080
JANEYEH: Oh wow.

1705
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,306
CRIS: The game is intense.
SUNNY says let's start now.

1706
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,200
NAMNUNG: I'm good at this.

1707
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Is she saying that
to anyone in particular?

1708
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:14,920
RUSAMEEKAE: She's saying it to TIME.

1709
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,560
RUSAMEEKAE: The result
is in our hands now.

1710
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,520
RUSAMEEKAE: The first pair
lasted three hours.

1711
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,872
(Turning into a mermaid)

1712
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,360
(Before the game starts,)

1713
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,720
(everyone has to re-pair again.)

1714
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Pairing up again.

1715
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,480
(Everyone picks one fruit string.)

1716
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,000
(Whoever gets the same fruit type
will be on the same team.)

1717
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,560
- MATHEUS: Okay
- TIME: Uh...

1718
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:40,760
(Completely stressed)

1719
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,560
TIMETHAI: TIME and TOD, TIME and TOD.

1720
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,768
(Taking a deep breath)

1721
01:09:45,984 --> 01:09:46,592
(Looking)

1722
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,120
CRIS: Who is SUNNY looking at?
Who is she looking at?

1723
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,080
TIMETHAI: SUNNY says anyone's fine.

1724
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,560
NAMNUNG: Amen.

1725
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,960
MATHEUS: Amen.

1726
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,200
NAMNUNG: I can pair with a woman.

1727
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,600
NAMNUNG: Or with any of the guys.

1728
01:10:00,032 --> 01:10:00,760
(Looking)

1729
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,400
NAMNUNG: Maybe SUNNY?

1730
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,840
(Glancing over)
NAMNUNG: Maybe TIME, or MATHEUS or...

1731
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,680
RUSAMEEKAE: They're waging war.

1732
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,640
TIMETHAI: A psychological war.

1733
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,048
(Looking)

1734
01:10:10,476 --> 01:10:11,936
(Looking)

1735
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,040
(Turning to look)
CRIS: Did she end up looking at JUNSU?

1736
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,080
FRAME: The first name that
popped into my head was JUNSU.

1737
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,560
FRAME: Because I feel like
I'm close with him.

1738
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,840
RUSAMEEKAE: First name, JUNSU.

1739
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,280
FRAME: If I were paired with a woman,
I wouldn't be shy.

1740
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,120
FRAME: I'd probably pick CHERRY,
because we're close.

1741
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,160
(Blessing)
JUNSU: Amen.

1742
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,600
CRIS: Hey, isn't that cute?

1743
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,800
JUNSU: Amen.

1744
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,480
(Trying not to laugh)

1745
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,600
(If you're ready...)

1746
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm stressed.

1747
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,200
ALL: Three, two,

1748
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,400
ALL: one.

1749

the underwater kissing game)

1750
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,120
JANEYEH: Next episode.

1751
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,120
CRIS: They're cutting it off here?

1752
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God!

1753
01:11:04,228 --> 01:11:05,640
(Currently in X-Land)

1754
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,520
RUSAMEEKAE: X-Land.

1755
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,440
JANEYEH: Hey, hey, hey!

1756
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,080
CRIS: Hey, there's a new guy.

1757
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,720
CRIS: Right?

1758
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,120
CRIS: A new guy has arrived.

1759
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,080

01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,240
CANDIDATE: Can I see your muscles?

1767
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,880
CANDIDATE: It's so captivating.

1768
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,960
CANDIDATE: You saw him, right?

1769
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,000

1770
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:38,920
CANDIDATE: So handsome.

1771
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,320
(Shifting his body)

1772
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,520
JANEYEH: Oh my God.

1773
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't tell me
they're ending it here.

1774
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,720
(Who's the mysterious newcomer?)
TIMETHAI: Go on, cut it.

1775
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Wait, let me complain first.

1776
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:47,880
(It's me)
CRIS: Listen up!

1777
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,240
CRIS: You guys are sinful.

1778
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,680
CRIS: After this, you all have to
go to the temple.

1779
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,680
CRIS: You have to make merit,

1780
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,040
(Make merit)
CRIS: You should pray.

1781
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,160
CRIS: It's not just me cursing you,
and the whole world is cursing you.

1782
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,240
RUSAMEEKAE: That's right.

1783
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Will the underwater kissing game
turn out sweet or totally chaotic?

1784
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,040
RUSAMEEKAE: And how will the arrival of
a new cast member

1785
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,080
RUSAMEEKAE: change these relationships?
You'll have to wait and see.

1786
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:16,040

1788
01:12:21,152 --> 01:12:23,360

Bye!

(It's fallen)
LOVE(X)PERT: It fell down.

1799
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,360
CRIS: The fruit fell a while ago, right?

1800
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:53,312
(Lift legs)

1801
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:56,800
(Look away)
TIMETHAI: What the hell?

1802
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,160

01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,680

01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,465
CRIS: Is he the new guy?

to choose two roommates at X-Land)

1807
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,480

no one ever gets that privilege.

1808
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,880

1809
