7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
SUNNY: What flavor is it?

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,080
KONG: Seafood, Grilled Prawn.

9
00:00:58,848 --> 00:00:59,960
SUNNY: Never tried it.

NAMNUNG: TOD's asleep now.

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,640
SUNNY: How long have you been single?

12
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:27,800
(Been single for a while?
Smiles)

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600

TIME: Oh, I was shocked too this morning.

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,400
KONG: I've been single for ages,
since sophomore year.

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,600
KONG: I get crushes easily,
but I rarely fall in love.

20

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800

KONG: Hmm.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,080
SUNNY: Oh, I forgot to tell you,
in this house,

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,800
SUNNY: actually, we may look nice,

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,560
SUNNY: but you can't trust anyone.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,040
KONG: Really?

28
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:01,248

30

31
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:06,960
NAMNUNG: TIME.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840

NAMNUNG: TIME, TIME...

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
NAMNUNG: Don't badmouth TOD.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,960
TIME: Why have I become this type?

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,760
SUNNY: Yeah, that's just how he is.

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,880
NAMNUNG: TOD is just so adorable.

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,280
TIME: Probably the kindest of all.

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,040
TIME: He's so cute

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
TIME: when he's asleep.

41
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,184
(Smiles)

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,280
TIME: I just want to hug him.

43
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:41,088
(Lunch break)

44
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,984
(Looking)

45
00:02:57,402 --> 00:03:02,496
(Eyes fixed on him)

46
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:05,728
(Laughs)

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
TIME: I just want to hug him.

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,400
NAMNUNG: Ugh, I can't eat a thing.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,000
SUNNY: So, the three of us
are competing for TOD, right?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,960
TIME: We don't have to compete.

51
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:28,200
NAMNUNG: TOD won't pay attention
to me anymore.

52
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,280
SUNNY: Let's share.

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,640
(Open relationship)
SUNNY: Yeah, an open relationship.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,880
TIME: So, how is it?

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,400
SUNNY: Well, I think it's easy
if both people communicate.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,560
SUNNY: You have to trust that
the other person will tell everything.

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,800
SUNNY: And we must tell everything too.

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,040
SUNNY: Because it's ultimately
human need, isn't it?

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,960
SUNNY: But when he does something
with someone, I want to know.

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,480
SUNNY: To be like, oh, if he keeps
doing this many times already,

61
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,000
SUNNY: we'll lose our feelings for him
because he has them with someone else.

62
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:06,120
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,872
SUNNY: So I said you can do whatever,
just change people every time.

64
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:12,448
(Looking)

65
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:14,600
(Averting eyes)

66
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:15,456
SUNNY: It was my idea.

67
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,400
(Looking)
SUNNY: Am I stupid?

68
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:23,520
(Picks at food)

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,520
NAMNUNG: I feel like if you hang around
many people at the same time like this.

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,200
NAMNUNG: I feel that...

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,640
NAMNUNG: It might be an option
that seems normal like this.

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,600
NAMNUNG: But for me, I feel like...

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,320
KONG: It's better one person at a time.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
NAMNUNG: Yeah.

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
TIME: Try with this person first.

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
NAMNUNG: Otherwise, I might feel
confused, I don't know.

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,520
SUNNY: But you can compare.

78
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:51,880
NAMNUNG: Right.

79
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,920
NAMNUNG: So, I try one person
at a time and move on if it's not right.

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
TIME: Yeah.

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,520
SUNNY: But here, no time
for one at a time.

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
SUNNY: How many days left? Eight days.

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,200
NAMNUNG: It's not like
I'm interested in everyone.

84
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:06,944
(Making eye contact)

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,000
TIME: It's hard to be
interested in literally everyone.

86
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
NAMNUNG: Ni hao.

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,080
TIME: What are you doing?

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,400
TOD: Ni hao.

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,200
TOD: Huh?

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,440
TOD: Nothing.

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
NAMNUNG: TOD.

97

TOD: Not at all.

98
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,920
TOD: Not weird.

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,400
NAMNUNG: Yeah, this outfit makes me
look like a kid.

100
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,600

NAMNUNG: Nobody stopped me.

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800

TOD: POJAMAN SAWANGWONG.

105
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,200
NAMNUNG: Yeah, feel like a Kumarn.
[*A Thai luck-bringing ghost child]

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,760
TOD: Not a Kumarn, POJAMAN.

107
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
TOD: Do you know POJAMAN?

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,200
NAMNUNG: I don't know.

109
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,080
(Stands up)
TOD: POJAMAN is a heroine in old dramas.

110
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,812
- NAMNUNG: Can I?
- TOD: Yes, yes.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,864
NAMNUNG: Let me borrow it.

112
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:25,800
TOD: Go ahead.

113
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,592

TIME: Come on in.

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,720
SUNNY: Why don't you
take off your shoes?

118
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,960
TIME: I'm too lazy to take them off.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,080
TIME: Do you want to go sit outside?

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,320
SUNNY: Sure.

121
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:00,640

TIME: Are you having fun?

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
SUNNY: Wanna roll around with me?

124
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,720
(Laughs)

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,720
TIME: No, I don't want to play games
with you anymore, SUNNY.

126
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,160
SUNNY: Why not?

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,200
TIME: You make me lose.

128
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,600
SUNNY: Well, you never won anyway.

129
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,040
SUNNY: Yeah, when did you win?

130

TOD: Done.

134

NAMNUNG: Playing the kid role,
like a big baby.

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
TOD: A cute little kid.

136
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,000
NAMNUNG: Super cute.

137
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,640
NAMNUNG: But the personality
isn't that cute.

138
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,072
(Opens and looks)

139
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,792

141
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
SUNNY: Do you like playing games?

142
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,240
TIME: How do you know?

143
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,360
SUNNY: I don't know, I just feel like
you might play.

144
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:08,000
SUNNY: It's just a habit to play around.

145
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,320
TIME: Hmm, I'll tell you later.

146
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,520
TOD: 3 2...

147
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:23,755
TOD: Hey, this is cute.

148
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160

(Stand up)

150
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,096
NAMNUNG: I was about to head out,
but I didn't want to ruin the moment...

151
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,008
NAMNUNG: Outside.

152
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:35,600
TOD: Ah.

153
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,200
NAMNUNG: I'm gonna open the door.

154
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
TOD: It gets harder every day.

155
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:44,832

TOD: Let me see.

162
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,224
(Laughs)

163
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,440

(Turns to look)
TOD: Ouch.

165
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,656

167

interested now?

168
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,640
(Asks)

169
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,816

TIME: Two.

173
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,400
SUNNY: Two.

174
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,360
SUNNY: But not equally interested in
everyone, just interested in a way like...

175
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,640
SUNNY: Interested.

176
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,520
