(This program is intended for mature audiences.

2
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Welcome to Thailand's
new-style dating reality show,

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,792
RUSAMEEKAE: boundless romance,

4
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,160
- ALL: LOVE(X)!
- MARIO: Dum, dum.

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
(RUSAMEEKAE, LOVE(X)PERT)
RUSAMEEKAE: Today's the first day of filming!

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,440
(JANEYEH, LOVE(X)PERT)
RUSAMEEKAE: How does it feel to see people flirt?

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,040
(MARIO, LOVE(X)PERT SPECIAL)
MARIO: Excited! Can't wait to see what happens.

8
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,800
(CRIS, LOVE(X)PERT) (Excited)
CRIS: I'm stoked to see it. So excited.

9
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,160
(TIMETHAI, LOVE(X)PERT)
TIMETHAI: I usually look away in moments like this.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,360
JANEYEH: Really? You don't like that?

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,648
RUSAMEEKAE: I'll capture it,
why look away? Just join them.

12
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:13,800
RUSAMEEKAE: I'll kiss too! Bring it on.

13
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:16,101
(Old-fashioned person)
- RUSAMEEKAE: I'm in! - TIMETHAI: Haha.

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Our show has the X symbol,
so let me ask you...

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
RUSAMEEKAE: What does X mean
to each of you?

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,400
MARIO: For me, X means mystery.
We never know...

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,080
(X = Mystery) MARIO: No one shared
preferences, it's all a mystery.

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,904
TIMETHAI: X is variable.
Love could manifest in unexpected ways!

19
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,560
TIMETHAI: Love doesn't care
about labels.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,912
JANEYEH: Seriously, as a serious person,
'X' is beyond right and wrong.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,400
CRIS: My X is a multiplier.

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,280
CRIS: It's about one person's formula
for love, mixing with another's.

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,152
RUSAMEEKAE: So CRIS sees X
as intersection points where

24
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,800
RUSAMEEKAE: relationships
and attractions overlap!

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,960
CRIS: These overlaps might be messy,
but that's how we grow.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,880
RUSAMEEKAE: But here's the thing,
brilliant answers everyone.

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Now picture this: Singles
gathering at Koh Samui.

28
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:12,320
RUSAMEEKAE: They'll live together
at X Villa for 12 days.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,568
RUSAMEEKAE: Their mission is to discover
love with infinite possibilities!

30
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:23,760
RUSAMEEKAE: A beautiful, mysterious love
story, as changing as the Samui sea.

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,359
JANEYEH: Wow.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,120

MARIO: Goosebumps!

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,616

NAMNUNG: Love is Love.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
NAMNUNG: It all depends
on who that person is.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,920
MARIO: Cute.

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,160
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG, my baby!

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,080
NAMNUNG: Not about wealth or status

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,640
NAMNUNG: or picture-perfect looks.

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,120

shows interest in me,

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,000
ASSE: will I like the person?

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
TOD: My name's TOD.

60
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,976

that's unusual.

151

in that way.

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,832
MILL: So cute.

345
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:54,000
SUNNY: Look.

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Well, she came
in sizzling hot.

347
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:56,925
SUNNY: Oh, wow.

348
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,520
JANEYEH: They're wow-ing.

349
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,400
TIME: Okay. After you.

350
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,920
SUNNY: Thank you.

351
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,384
TOD: Wow.

352
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:05,930
ALL: Hello.

353
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,760
NAMNUNG: Welcome.

354
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,200
NAMNUNG: You're late.
You guys came late.

355
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,640
TOD: The party's closed. It's over.

356
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,840
TIME: Then I'll go home.

357
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
- NAMNUNG: Could you introduce yourselves?
- TOD: Introduce...

358
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
SUNNY: I'm SUNNY.

359
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,480
- MATHEUS: SUNNY.
- ALL: SUNNY!

360
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,960
SUNNY: Yeah, SUNNY.

361
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,760
SUNNY: Like the weather.

362
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,280
MATHEUS: She's like wearing a red dress,

363
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,520
MATHEUS: caught my eyes the most.

364
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,320
CRIS: What to do?

365
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,720
NAMNUNG: I feel

366
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,000
NAMNUNG: she made a great
first impression and seems interesting.

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
TIME: I'm TIME.

368
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,240
- TOD: TIME.
- TIME: TIME.

369
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,840
TOD: I feel like he's adorable.

370
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,760
JANEYEH: Aww.

371
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:49,120
NAMNUNG: Approachable appearance,
you know what I mean?

372
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,960
JUNSU: My name is Tom Yum Goong.

373
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,880
(Playful)
RUSAMEEKAE: He's playful.

374
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,360
TIME: Can you make it shorter?

375
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,440
JUNSU: Goong.
[*It means shrimps in Thai]

376
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,440
SUNNY: Just call you SHRIMP.

377
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,760
TIME: Then, you're "Goong". Okay, okay.

378
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,000
TOD: Let's go sit inside instead.

379
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
TOD: Go ahead, after you.

380
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,320
CRIS: The homeowner.

381
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Touring the resort.

382
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,480
TIME: Can I get some water?

383
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,640
TOD: We're finished it. I'll...

384
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:16,680
NAMNUNG: But we should refill it.

385
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,920
TOD: I'll get you a refill.

386
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,120
(Service from the homeowner)
MARIO: TOD is taking care of everything.

387
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:23,456
(Service from the homeowner again)

388
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,600
CRIS: NAMNUNG's starting.

389
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,640
CRIS: NAMNUNG's starting.

390
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,680
TIME: They have a...

391
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,920
NAMNUNG: Want to tour around.

392
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,760
CRIS: Want a tour.

393
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,848
MARIO: Want a tour.

394
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:40,064
RUSAMEEKAE: She uses the word "tour."

395
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,160
RUSAMEEKAE: What kind of tour, dear?

396
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,320
RUSAMEEKAE: You came first,
didn't you, NAMNUNG?

397
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
NAMNUNG: Inside maybe?

398
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,760
TIME: Over here?

399
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:58,720
TOD: I think we need to carry them over
since it's far.

400
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,480
TOD: Never mind.

401
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,280
TIME: Are there more?

402
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,840
TOD: Only alcohol left.

403
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,120
TIME: This shirt looks great.

404
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,760
TOD: Thank you.

405
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,280
TOD: Thank you.

406
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:06,240
TIMETHAI: Hey, bro.

407
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,280
CRIS: TIME, how come? It's like this.

408
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,840
TIMETHAI: He keeps looking all over.

409
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,360
MARIO: He compliments the shirt
but eyes the pants.

410
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,688
TIMETHAI: Checking from head to toe.

411
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe genuinely appreciating
the whole look.

412
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,960
MARIO: Saving that as one point.

413
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,360
CRIS: Let's keep that noted.

414
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,160
CRIS: Watch this. Watch closely.

415
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,680
TIMETHAI: No way.

416
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,040
MARIO: He didn't compliment NAMNUNG's
outfit though it's full of holes too.

417
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
TIME: I'll follow later.

418
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
JANEYEH: Those two have gone
into the house.

419
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
MILL: Those two have gone
into the house.

420
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:36,960
ASSE: Thank you.

421
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,040
SUNNY: They probably went to get water.

422
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,440
CRIS: SUNNY is sizing things up.

423
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,920
MARIO: A Brazilian boy.

424
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
CRIS: TOD is wondering where NAMNUNG is.

425
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
JANEYEH: He looks keen on her.

426
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,056
NAMNUNG: Two more.

427
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
- TIME: Let's go.
- NAMNUNG: Okay.

428
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
NAMNUNG: Why are you happy?

429
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,184
TIME: You don't need
my help then, do you?

430
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,160
NAMNUNG: I do.

431
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,640
MARIO: What was that little pout
just now?

432
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,840
CRIS: That NAMNUNG girl...

433
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:22,560
CRIS: No, no. I'll carry them myself.

434
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,360
JANEYEH: I can hold them.

435
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,600
(Playful teasing)
NAMNUNG: Stop it.

436
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,560
TIMETHAI: This one seems quite skilled.

437
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,880
NAMNUNG: I'm naturally playful.

438
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,120
NAMNUNG: And he's the type of person

439
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,280
NAMNUNG: who matches my energy.

440
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,360
NAMNUNG: That's why it feels fun.

441
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,360
TIME: Water for you.

442
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,880
TOD: Wow, thank you.

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,920
TOD: Super efficient service.

444
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,720
NAMNUNG: So ungentlemanly!

445
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,280
- JUNSU: Ungentlemanly, you say?
- LOVE(X)PERT: Look!

446
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,152
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS can't stop
staring at SUNNY.

447
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,200
TIME: That's just how we are.
It's a relationship of...

448
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
TIME: Neither would stand down.

449
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:14,760
TIME: We are playful. I enjoy that.

450
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,840
CRIS: NAMNUNG's got a rival now.

451
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,576
SUNNY: I'm impressed by several people.

452
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,720
SUNNY: Ultimately, I'll talk
to everyone today.

453
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,256
SUNNY: I'll try chatting with them all.

454
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,880
RUSAMEEKAE: That's how it should be.

455
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,920
CRIS: SUNNY slays.

456
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,800
CRIS: I really like that SUNNY girl.

457
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,280
ALL: Iconic.

458
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,000
JANEYEH: Queen.

459
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,440
CRIS: She slays.

460
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,840
CRIS: Let's share the people
who have left a deep impression on you.

461
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,560
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY.

462
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,640
TIMETHAI: SUNNY.

463
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,088
JANEYEH: I pick SUNNY too.

464
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,016
CRIS: If you were on the show,
who would you approach first?

465
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,056
MARIO: Maybe NAMNUNG. She's friendly.

466
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,976
CRIS: Because they're sizzling.
Sizzling in different ways.

467
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Fiery passion, gentle soul.

468
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,040
TIMETHAI: I'll root for TIME
since we share the same name.

469
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Excuse me.
Was there no show-related reason at all?

470
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,960
TIMETHAI: Well, he seems playful.

471
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.
- TIMETHAI: He looks like a funny guy.

472
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:19,760
MARIO: He and NAMNUNG
have some playful interactions.

473
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,720
RUSAMEEKAE: How about JUNJI?
Did she make an impression?

474
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,760
MARIO: Of course, she did.

475
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
TIMETHAI: I think she's not in the show.

476
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,440
MARIO: She's not.

477
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,128
RUSAMEEKAE: Just asking.

478
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,160
MARIO: Oh, okay.

479
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,080
CRIS: But for me, I'm rooting for TOD.

480
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,360
CRIS: TOD tries to please everyone,
a true social butterfly.

481
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,280
MARIO: TOD was so close
to picking them up.

482
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
TIMETHAI: But don't people
usually overlook guys like him?

483
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,352
RUSAMEEKAE: Everyone sees TOD
as a staff member.

484
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:46,560
CRIS: No, some girls like that, too.

485
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,080
RUSAMEEKAE: What about JUNSU?

486
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
MARIO: JUNSU's hard to read.
I'm not sure about him.

487
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,080
TIMETHAI: I think he's got something.
He looks like a teaser.

488
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,560
RUSAMEEKAE: I've been observing
and I feel like MILL's into ASSE.

489
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
JANEYEH: Yeah, she said she adores him.

490
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,000
TIMETHAI: She adores him.

491
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,760
MARIO: What about CHERRY?

492
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,600
JANEYEH: She still looks shy.
She might need more time.

493
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Then there's JOY.

494
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,200
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY doesn't
enjoy the guys much.

495
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,400
JANEYEH: Right.

496
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,920
MARIO: It feels like she prefers women.

497
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,440
RUSAMEEKAE: She seems
interested in MILL.

498
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,840
CRIS: I notice she's smiling
while observing.

499
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,120
CRIS: She might be strategic.
Now that first night's over,

500
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,560
CRIS: do they have
more activities the next day?

501
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Getting curious?

502
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:28,880
CRIS: Yes.

503
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's find out together.

504
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,280
(Welcome to LOVE(X).)

505
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,360
(This is a boundless romantic journey,)

506
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,880
(filled with uncertainties)

507
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,760
(Over the next 12 days,)

508
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,800
(bring your courage and sincerity)

509
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,160
(to seize precious love.)

510
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,840
(Here, you're far
from the chaos of everyday life.)

511
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,960
(No phones. No money.)

512
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,400
(All daily necessities,)

513
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,280

against each other.

1055
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,960
MARIO: Hands intertwined like that.

1056
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,960
MARIO: No, that won't work.

1058
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,512
NAMNUNG: Maybe you should get closer?

1059
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
CHERRY: Oh! I can't pull out!

1060
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,400

1067
00:44:55,232 --> 00:44:56,840
MARIO: The button!

1068
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,160
JANEYEH: Oh, my God!

1069
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,472
MARIO: What's she gonna do?

1070
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:04,064
CANDIDATE: Whoa, Whoa!

1071
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,800
(Leaning back) MARIO: It would be
hilarious if she bit the button off.

1072
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:12,832
(Blushing)
CHERRY: Ha ha.

CHERRY: I feel like that was
such an adorable moment.

1095
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,760
ASSE: We had to hold hands.

1096
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,800
ASSE: Then I realized how close
we were standing.

1097
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,640
ASSE: I felt something special
between us

1098
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,320

1099
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,400

RUSAMEEKAE: How was it?

1104
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,968
RUSAMEEKAE: Who impressed you the most?

1105
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:33,600
(Who impressed you the most?)

1106
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,840
TIMETHAI: Based on shell coins,
SUNNY stood out.

1107
00:46:38,624 --> 00:46:39,104
RUSAMEEKAE: Wait a sec.

1108
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:42,976
- MARIO: She's only got two shell coins!
- RUSAMEEKAE: The lowest score!

1109
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,440
(Right)
CRIS: It's about the style!

1110
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,640
CRIS: She said kissing you
would be easier.

1111
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,560
SUNNY: Kissing you'd be easier.

1112
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:49,720
(The true game master)

1113
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,800
(Making an excuse) TIMETHAI: She intended.
She knew she was good at it.

1114
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,248
TIMETHAI: But she didn't want
to show it.

1115
00:46:53,248 --> 00:46:54,200
(Make sense)

1116
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,928
(Nodding)
JANEYEH: But actually, I like SUNNY too,

1117
00:46:56,928 --> 00:46:57,880
JANEYEH: because I love her flair.
What an impressive!

1118
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,600
(Love it!)

1119
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,880
(Adding)
TIMETHAI: But I also like TIME. He's got skills.

1120
00:47:01,204 --> 00:47:02,000
(How?)

1121
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,920
TIMETHAI: He wanted to choose TOD,
but chose SUNNY instead.

1122
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe he wanted to show off
for TOD?

1123
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,240
RUSAMEEKAE: 'Look how strong I am.'

1124
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,120
TIMETHAI: That he's ripped?

1125
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,600
MARIO: Like flirting with TOD?

1126
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,456
CRIS: But the person who impressed me
the most is...

1127
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:16,280
(Who?)

1128
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,080
CRIS: JOY.

1129
00:47:17,664 --> 00:47:19,760
CRIS: I'm not talking about romance
or anything,

1130
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,280
CRIS: but I like that she doesn't leave
her friends behind.

1131
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:23,200
(She's caring)

1132
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,000
CRIS: Remember when I mentioned earlier?

1133
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
CRIS: CHERRY wasn't picked,
and ASSE wasn't either.

1134
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,176
CRIS: I didn't know there'd be
a final game.

1135
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,360
CRIS: Yet, JOY chose CHERRY
so she wouldn't feel left out.

1136
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:35,380
JOY: CHERRY.

1137
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,920
MARIO: JOY seems really thoughtful,
doesn't she?

1138
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,128
RUSAMEEKAE: Thoughtful JOY.

1139
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,320
JANEYEH: Thoughtful JOY.

1140
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Thoughtful JOY.

1141
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,320
CRIS: Haha! Thoughtful JOY.

1142
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,800
RUSAMEEKAE: How are you so good at reading
people? Let's go play cards sometime.

1143
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Who's being most obvious
though?

1144
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,840
JANEYEH: MILL.

1145
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Right?

1146
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,600
JANEYEH: Super obvious.

1147
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,560
MARIO: MILL's got it bad.

1148
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,960
RUSAMEEKAE: She's the most obvious
we've seen all day.

1149
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,160
JANEYEH: Eyes don't lie.

1150
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,600
RUSAMEEKAE: It's just a game though.

1151
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,000
RUSAMEEKAE: We can't tell
if it's hard or easy.

1152
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,416
RUSAMEEKAE: You'll get to try it.

1153
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,400
CRIS: Really?

1154
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,680
(Eager)
RUSAMEEKAE: Let me demonstrate.

1155
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,200
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm playing as two players.

1156
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,080
RUSAMEEKAE: One, two...

1157
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:12,896
(Stuck)

1158
00:48:12,896 --> 00:48:14,272
(Try hard)

1159
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:17,024
(Body stuck)

1160
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:17,920
RUSAMEEKAE: I can't play!

1161
00:48:18,003 --> 00:48:20,520
(Body stuck)

1162
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,160
RUSAMEEKAE: How about you, CRIS?
You and JANEYEH?

1163
00:48:22,387 --> 00:48:23,744
(Me and JANEYEH)

1164
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,080
(Watching)
JANEYEH: I gotta try!

1165
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,000
- RUSAMEEKAE: See?
- JANEYEH: Being petite helps!

1166
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:41,504
- RUSAMEEKAE: Right.
- JANEYEH: It works!

1167
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:46,848
TIMETHAI: What're you doing?

1168
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,880
CRIS: Bring the shells.

1169
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,672
CRIS: Bring the shells.

1170
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:49,400
(Don't understand romance)

1171
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,200
CRIS: Bring the shells.

1172
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:51,920
(No warmth)

1173
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,840
CRIS: You, you get this one.

1174
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
(Worry about cleanliness)
JANEYEH: Will my teeth fall out?

1175
00:48:54,227 --> 00:48:54,816
(Worry about teeth)

1176
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,120
RUSAMEEKAE: You've got one minute.

1177
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's go!

1178
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,048
TIMETHAI: You've got it, sis.

1179
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:11,923
MARIO: Wow, that's tough.

1180
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,320
CRIS: This is tough.

1181
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Is it difficult?

1182
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:21,280
(Can't pull out)

1183
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,080
(Still struggling)
RUSAMEEKAE: There you go!

1184
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:22,976
MARIO: CRIS!

1185
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:25,824
(Fell off)

1186
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,200
JANEYEH: My veneers!

1187
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,568
CRIS: Hula hoop's broken.

1188
00:49:33,568 --> 00:49:34,944
(Completely broken)

1189
00:49:34,944 --> 00:49:36,288
CRIS: Hula hoop's broken.

1190
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,920
RUSAMEEKAE: But I want to know
how it feels.

1191
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,840
RUSAMEEKAE: What's it like being
so close together?

1192
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,360
(In unison) - CRIS: SUNNY's being weird.
- JANEYEH: SUNNY's being weird.

1193
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,800
CRIS: Now that I've played the game
myself,

1194
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,576
CRIS: I realized I didn't have to
lean in that much.

1195
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,400
CRIS: I just knew SUNNY was going to
kiss her.

1196
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,720
CRIS: SUNNY wasn't after shells at all.

1197
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,600
JANEYEH: Yeah,
you can aim for the shell.

1198
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,160
JANEYEH: You can aim for the shell.

1199
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Really?

1200
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,800
TIMETHAI: I could tell even back then
that she wasn't aiming for the shell.

1201
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:56,520
RUSAMEEKAE: So, you guys have seen us
play the shell coin competition now.

1202
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,720
RUSAMEEKAE: It was super fun, right?

1203
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Next up,

1204
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,200
RUSAMEEKAE: we've got something
even more exciting!

1205
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,080
MARIO: There's more, KAE?

1206
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Of course.

1207
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,280
RUSAMEEKAE: If you're ready,
let's watch!

1208
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,640
TIMETHAI: Let's watch then.

1209
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,080
(After the previous challenge ended,)

1210
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,960
(we believe you've grown closer
through this experience.)

1211
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,080
(Now)

1212
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,200
(everyone will blindfold themselves
and take turns removing blindfolds.)

1213
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:20,440
(Choose someone you like.)

1214
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,296
(Then leave a kiss mark on them.)

1215
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,400
JANEYEH: This is too intense!

1216
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,784
(Blue lipstick for men, red for women)
(After kissing,)

1217
00:50:31,008 --> 00:50:32,640
(men must use blue lipstick)

1218
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,264
(to leave your kiss mark.)

1219
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:37,480
(Women leave red kiss mark.)

1220
00:50:39,731 --> 00:50:40,840
(Who will SUNNY choose?)

1221
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,000
MARIO: Oh! SUNNY!

1222
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,200
(Who will SUNNY choose?)

1223
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,520
TIMETHAI: Look at how she walks!

1224
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,400
SUNNY: There's something about TIME
that makes me want to play game.

1225
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,784
SUNNY: I know he's...

1226
00:51:02,784 --> 00:51:04,440
SUNNY: someone who flirts around too.

1227
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,640
SUNNY: He's the type who charmingly
flirts with everyone.

1228
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Do you think TIME knows?

1229
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,800
TIMETHAI: Judging by height?

1230
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,480
JANEYEH: Maybe he can feel it...
through lip softness?

1231
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:21,400
(Who will NAMNUNG choose?)

1232
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,480
MARIO: NAMNUNG looks nervous.

1233
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,040
CRIS: NAMNUNG?

1234
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,560
(Who will NAMNUNG choose?)

1235
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,520
CRIS: Is it TOD?

1236
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,400
MARIO: Come on!

1237
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:04,928
(Will NAMNUNG choose TIME?)

1238
00:52:05,024 --> 00:52:06,336
CRIS: Oh, my God!

1239
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,920
CRIS: It's TOD, isn't it?

1240
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,240
JANEYEH: Where are you going?

1241
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:20,352
CRIS: Hey!

1242
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:23,400
JANEYEH: Total game changer!

1243
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,680
NAMNUNG: SUNNY's really cute.

1244
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,200
NAMNUNG: She has beautiful skin.

1245
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,216
NAMNUNG: I really like her skin.

1246
00:52:41,216 --> 00:52:44,200
NAMNUNG: So I snuck a kiss there.

1247
00:52:44,736 --> 00:52:45,792
MARIO: She likes her skin?

1248
00:52:46,932 --> 00:52:50,720
(Will TIME choose SUNNY?)

1249
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,520
TIMETHAI: Here we go.

1250
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,360
MARIO: He's going to NAMNUNG.

1251
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:08,608
TIME: I chose NAMNUNG because...

1252
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:13,920
TIME: of her playful personality
and looks.

1253
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,600
CRIS: JOY chose MILL.

1254
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,920
CRIS: She's totally the type
for people who like girls.

1255
00:53:36,704 --> 00:53:37,760
JOY: I chose MILL.

1256
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,152
JOY: My first impression of her
really stuck with me.

1257
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,104
CRIS: When she walked in, right?

1258
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,400
- MARIO: That beach entrance.
- CRIS: Remember when...

1259
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,520
MARIO: She was impressed
by her beach entrance, CRIS.

1260
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,608
JANEYEH: No guessing needed
for this choice.

1261
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,080
MILL: I left my kiss for ASSE.

1262
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,824
MILL: Overall, he seems to match
my type best.

1263
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,200
JANEYEH: JOY's sad now.

1264
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,424
CHERRY: I left my kiss for ASSE
because I'm most impressed by him.

1265
00:54:09,344 --> 00:54:10,720
MARIO: CHERRY chose ASSE too.

1266
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,840
JANEYEH: Whoa, ASSE's popular!

1267
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,976
CRIS: CHERRY!

1268
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,376
JANEYEH: She's smiling.

1269
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,168
CRIS: Here comes JUNSU.

1270
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:28,736
(Will JUNSU choose MATHEUS?)

1271
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:31,840
JANEYEH: What's he doing?

1272
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,760
MARIO: What are you doing, JUNSU?

1273
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:35,480
MARIO: Hey!

1274
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,632
TIMETHAI: Told ya.
JUNSU is the troublemaker now.

1275
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,680
MARIO: Seriously, JUNSU?

1276
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,800
- TIMETHAI: He's just like me!
- MARIO: JUNSU!

1277
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,320
MARIO: We don't play like that, JUNSU.

1278
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,240
MARIO: JUNSU!
Oh my, he's poking everyone!

1279
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,200
TIMETHAI: He's just like me!

1280
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,200
JUNSU: JOY is straightforward.

1281
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,840
JUNSU: I think she's genuinely
interested in me.

1282
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Pretty JOY.

1283
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,296
JANEYEH: He likes direct people.

1284
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,976
CRIS: SUNNY! SUNNY!

1285
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,280
JANEYEH: TOD's the hardest to read.

1286
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,000
CRIS: TOD will definitely
choose NAMNUNG, won't he?

1287
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,040
TIMETHAI: I guess TIME.

1288
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,280
JANEYEH: TOD's the hardest to guess.

1289
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:45,728
TOD: It's still NAMNUNG.

1290
00:55:45,728 --> 00:55:50,200
TOD: I chose NAMNUNG
because I feel comfortable with her.

1291
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,400
RUSAMEEKAE: He chose NAMNUNG.

1292
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:55,328
(Selection completed)

1293
00:55:55,443 --> 00:55:58,080
(CHERRY chose ASSE. MILL chose ASSE)

1294
00:55:58,195 --> 00:56:00,736
(MATHEUS chose SUNNY.
NAMNUNG chose SUNNY)

1295
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:03,648
(SUNNY chose TIME)

1296
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,600
RUSAMEEKAE: He wasn't chosen.

1297
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,480
MATHEUS: I don't get any.

1298
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,752
(No one chose MATHEUS and JUNSU)
TIMETHAI: MATHEUS got none either.

1299
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,240
MATHEUS: I don't get it at all.

1300
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,016
JUNSU: I don't get any.

1301
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:11,584
MATHEUS: I don't get it at all
this game.

1302
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,008
(TIME chose NAMNUNG. TOD chose NAMNUNG)

1303
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:16,200
(Nobody chose TOD)

1304
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,480
MARIO: No one chose TOD either.

1305
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,144
CRIS: See, TOD? Told you
being the homeowner doesn't help.

1306
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,520
CRIS: ASSE's totally quiet.

1307
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,400
RUSAMEEKAE: He's quiet,
but he's popular.

1308
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,824
ASSE: I got kissed twice.

1309
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,232
ASSE: One was probably CHERRY.

1310
00:56:35,232 --> 00:56:38,848
ASSE: I'm not sure about the second one.

1311
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,000
SUNNY: There's one from a guy,
one from a girl.

1312
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,080
(MATHEUS and NAMNUNG chose SUNNY.)
SUNNY: The female one...

1313
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,560
SUNNY: I think it's from CHERRY.

1314
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
SUNNY: The male one... I'm not sure.

1315
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,200
SUNNY: Maybe MATHEUS or TIME?

1316
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,560
SUNNY: But I'll guess MATHEUS.

1317
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,000
SUNNY: Because TIME...

1318
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,920
SUNNY: was also charming NAMNUNG.

1319
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,824
SUNNY: So he probably went for her.

1320
00:56:57,824 --> 00:56:59,960
SUNNY: Since two guys kissed NAMNUNG.

1321
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:03,552
(TIME and TOD chose NAMNUNG)
NAMNUNG: I got two marks.

1322
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,480
NAMNUNG: The first mark was gentle.

1323
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:10,000
NAMNUNG: He held my hand first.

1324
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,216
NAMNUNG: Then he kissed
and left the mark softly.

1325
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,080
NAMNUNG: I don't know
whose mark this is.

1326
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,120
NAMNUNG: This one made me blush.

1327
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,600
NAMNUNG: This one felt normal.

1328
00:57:20,064 --> 00:57:21,200
NAMNUNG: No kiss or anything.

1329
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,656
NAMNUNG: Just a quick mark.

1330
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,800
MARIO: TOD might've been rough.

1331
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,200
MARIO: Scratched too hard.

1332
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,400
MARIO: NAMNUNG didn't like it.

1333
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,520
TIME: I only got one kiss.

1334
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,584
TIME: If I had to guess...

1335
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,240
TIME: It's tough.

1336
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,200
TIME: Let's say SUNNY then.

1337
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Ooh! Correct guess!

1338
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,720
CRIS: Which kiss game pair
did you like most?

1339
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Honestly...

1340
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,960
RUSAMEEKAE: I was rooting for NAMNUNG
and SUNNY the most.

1341
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:56,320
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm so curious about
what'll happen next.

1342
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,400
RUSAMEEKAE: What's going on?

1343
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,560
CRIS: What if SUNNY and NAMNUNG
get together?

1344
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,088
CRIS: How would
a straight man like you feel?

1345
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:02,600
CRIS: Would you feel excited or...

1346
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,960
MARIO: I'd say...
'Wow, that's unexpected.'

1347
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,880
JANEYEH: It's totally 'Wow.'

1348
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,400
CRIS: It's 'Wow.'

1349
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,120
RUSAMEEKAE: If MARIO and TIMETHAI
end up together, I'd 'Wow' too.

1350
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,800
RUSAMEEKAE: I'd get excited.

1351
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,800
MARIO: Just like NAMNUNG and SUNNY.

1352
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Who're you rooting for,
JANEYEH?

1353
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,720
JANEYEH: I'm lowkey
rooting for JOY and MILL.

1354
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,304
TIMETHAI: Since you're playing
this kind of series, right?

1355
00:58:26,304 --> 00:58:27,008
JANEYEH: They're cute.

1356
00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:28,320
TIMETHAI: That's how it goes.

1357
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,320
JANEYEH: I mean...

1358
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,560
JANEYEH: Their caring moments are cute.
JOY's so clear about her feelings.

1359
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,360
JANEYEH: Seems like it.

1360
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:40,608
RUSAMEEKAE: Right!
JOY wears her heart on her sleeve.

1361
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,280
CRIS: I am rooting for the underdogs.

1362
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:43,776
MARIO: Which pair?

1363
00:58:43,776 --> 00:58:44,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1364
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,560
CRIS: ASSE and CHERRY.

1365
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:50,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Like CRIS said.
The quiet pair.

1366
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,968
CRIS: ASSE suddenly became popular.

1367
00:58:51,968 --> 00:58:54,816
MARIO: Super popular.
Everyone chose ASSE.

1368
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,400
CRIS: But I have this sudden feeling...
You don't need to air this.

1369
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,216
CRIS: Why do I feel TOD and CHERRY
will end up together?

1370
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:08,352
JANEYEH: Maybe...

1371
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Really?

1372
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,880
CRIS: Just a random thought, no reason.

1373
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,120
RUSAMEEKAE: It's complicated.
It's unpredictable.

1374
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:16,800
CRIS: It's unpredictable.

1375
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Because there's complexity.

CRIS: Translate again.

1538
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,480
TIME: It's okay for me.

1539
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,680
NAMNUNG: You don't have to eat it.

1540
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,800
TIMETHAI: Eyes never off.

1541
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,840
CRIS: Aww, so cute.

1542
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:45,184
(Likes it.)

1543
01:05:47,296 --> 01:05:48,160
TIME: Okay for me.

1544
01:05:55,232 --> 01:05:56,240
SUNNY: Not eating this one.

1545
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:57,960
TIME: Want this instead?

1546
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,784
SUNNY: Yeah, I'll take that.

1547
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,520
MARIO: Okay, what about MATHEUS then?

1548
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,400
TIME: Not yet, not yet.

1549
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:15,480
TIME: You've got to eat a lot.
And eat Protein, too

1550
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,576
RUSAMEEKAE:
TIME turns to SUNNY now. Uh-oh.

1551
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,720
CRIS: Awkward. Confusing.

1552
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,160
TOD: Do you want to eat this?

1553
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,520
NAMNUNG: I don't like pad thai.

1554
01:06:37,216 --> 01:06:40,000
SUNNY: This one?
Isn't this Pad Mee Korat?

1555
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:43,280
(Happy)

1556
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,760
TIME: Hang on a sec.

1557
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,240
TOD: No, Pad Mee Korat
is usually more orange, right?

1558
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,320
CRIS:
These two actually look good together.

1559
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,608
JANEYEH: They are kinda cute.

1560
01:06:53,696 --> 01:06:55,040
SUNNY: You don't like it?

1561
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Uh-oh.

1562
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,160
MARIO: TOD is chewing all stiff.

1563
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,320
CRIS: MATHEUS isn't saying anything.

1564
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,400
JANEYEH: This table's so awkward.

1565
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,080
CRIS: All the strong personalities
are at this house.

1566
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,680
TIMETHAI: Everyone else is just eating.
Where's MATHEUS?

1567
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,960
(Here he is!)
MARIO: MATHEUS's here! He's inside.

1568
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,320
TIMETHAI: Eating under the table?

1569
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,760
CRIS: But MATHEUS really
doesn't get any spotlight, huh.

1570
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,560
RUSAMEEKAE: At the dining table...

1571
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,920
RUSAMEEKAE: If it were me,
I'd flip the whole table.

1572
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,080
MARIO: Flip the table?

1573
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,072
(Can't take it) RUSAMEEKAE: Flip it.
I've got a hot temper.

1574
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:30,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Writing spectrum letters...

1575
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Writing spectrum letters...

1576
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:33,520
RUSAMEEKAE:Everyone can write a letter
without revealing who they are.

1577
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,200
RUSAMEEKAE:
Everyone can write one anonymous letter,

1578
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,200
(Mailbox)
RUSAMEEKAE: but only to one person.

1579
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,160
(Anonymous confessions)
RUSAMEEKAE: Then everyone will go to

1580
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:46,560
(Anonymous confessions) RUSAMEEKAE: their own message box
to read the letters they've received. But they'll only see the contents.

1581
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,224
RUSAMEEKAE: As I've said,
they won't know who sent it.

1582
01:07:48,224 --> 01:07:49,024
JANEYEH: Savage.

1583
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,120
CRIS: Super savage.

1584
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,040
RUSAMEEKAE: You want to know now, right?
Who's going to send a letter to whom?

1585
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,000
JANEYEH: We really want to know.

1586
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,696
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's do it.

1587
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,896
JUNSU: So I'm gonna write down the name

1588
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,336
JUNSU: first, and then

1589
01:07:58,336 --> 01:07:59,680
JUNSU: reason why, right?

1590
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,448
ASSE: Yeah. You write the name,
and then just kind of explain it.

1591
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,880
TIMETHAI: Writing in Korean.

1592
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,704
JOY: Are we supposed to write
our true feelings?

1593
01:08:08,704 --> 01:08:09,632
MILL: Yes.

1594
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,160
MILL: Oof, this is hard.

1595
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,176
TIME: Who am I going to write to?

1596
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,776
TOD: Who are you going to write to?

1597
01:08:15,776 --> 01:08:17,088
TOD: Who are you writing to, TIME?

1598
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,760
TIME: Because honestly,
I want to get to know everyone.

1599
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,072
TIME: I'm impressed by

1600
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,280
TIME: two people right now.

1601
01:08:26,432 --> 01:08:29,240
TIME: Actually it's three,
but let's just say two.

1602
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,920
TIME: Really, there are a lot of people.

1603
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,520
CANDIDATE: Yeah,
but we can only write to one.

1604
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:33,760
CRIS: Can't tell at all.

1605
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,920
CRIS: I really can't tell at all.

1606
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,400
SUNNY: How many people
are you into right now?

1607
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,320
NAMNUNG: Two.

1608
01:08:37,396 --> 01:08:38,301
JANEYEH: Two?

1609
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,800
SUNNY: Two.

1610
01:08:40,256 --> 01:08:42,640
NAMNUNG: I think so. Maybe three.

1611
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,160
- JANEYEH: Maybe three?
- RUSAMEEKAE: Three?

1612
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,016
MARIO: More confusing now.

1613
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,920
RUSAMEEKAE:
The crew is really good at this, huh.

1614
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Just let them write it down
but you only see a tiny bit of the writing

1615
01:08:58,528 --> 01:08:59,872
CRIS: TOD's veins are popping.

1616
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,000
TIME: Done.

1617
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,680
TOD: Same here.

1618
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,816
TOD: Yours is so long.

1619
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,600
TIME: It's so hard to choose.

1620
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my god.

1621
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,504
RUSAMEEKAE: Now go drop it
into the mailbox of the person you like.

1622
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
CANDIDATE: So exciting, right?

1623
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,552
CANDIDATE: Mysterious.

1624
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,232
CANDIDATE: Oh, this one is our mailbox.

1625
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,784
- JANEYEH: That's brutal.
- CRIS: So brutal.

1626
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,480
MARIO: I wonder who wrote this.

1627
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,320
CRIS: We, here in the studio and the people at home,
we do know who sent what to whom.

1628
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,112
CRIS: But the people in the show
have no idea.

1629
01:09:45,152 --> 01:09:46,680
CRIS: MILL! MILL!

1630
01:09:48,228 --> 01:09:50,208
(A letter)

1631
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,128
RUSAMEEKAE: Who wrote to MILL?

1632
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:02,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Today when you were walking over, you were really, really cute.
You're the kind of girl who's so cute I never get tired of looking at you.

1633
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,568
RUSAMEEKAE: You talk so well.
I secretly hope you'll like me too.

1634
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,480
RUSAMEEKAE: And I hope you like girls.

1635
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,600
MARIO: JOY, one hundred percent.

1636
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,400
JANEYEH: JOY?

1637
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:12,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Someone wrote to JOY.

1638
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,600
RUSAMEEKAE: When you smile, it's really beautiful.
I'm very interested in you.

1639
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,240
CRIS: JUNSU! Pretty JOY.

1640
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,584
RUSAMEEKAE: This one's an easy guess.

1641
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,560
CRIS: Who wrote to JUNSU?

1642
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,304
CRIS: Welcome to Koh Samui.
You're very handsome as always.

1643
01:10:26,304 --> 01:10:29,696
CRIS: Enjoy your time here
and good luck with your LOVE(X).

1644
01:10:29,696 --> 01:10:31,160
CRIS: MATHEUS!

1645
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Seriously?

1646
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,280
CRIS: MATHEUS. MATHEUS said this back
when he first came on the show, remember?

1647
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,920
CRIS: He said they already knew each other.

1648
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,400
MARIO: They knew each other before?

1649
01:10:38,496 --> 01:10:42,240
CRIS: So he slipped in that line
"You're very handsome as always."

1650
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,064
MARIO: "As always."

1651
01:10:44,064 --> 01:10:45,920
JANEYEH: Oh my God!

1652
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,400
MARIO: Calm down, KAE! Take it easy.

1653
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,840
RUSAMEEKAE: What's wrong with my gaydar?

1654
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,080
MARIO: Your gaydar's broken.

1655
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,920
CRIS: JUNSU's shocked too, look.

1656
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,520
RUSAMEEKAE: CHERRY! Who wrote to CHERRY?

1657
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,680
CRIS: ASSE! ASSE!

1658
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,000
MARIO: ASSE is not ordinary at all.

1659
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,200
RUSAMEEKAE:
I wonder if CHERRY will figure it out.

1660
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,640
JANEYEH: I think she will.

1661
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,160
RUSAMEEKAE: I like your smile because it's bright
and full of positive energy. Keep smiling a lot, okay?

1662
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,288
MARIO: Whoa, CHERRY.

1663
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:17,800
CRIS: So happy. ASSE can't read Thai.

1664
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,880
MARIO: Oh no.
What did they write to ASSE?

1665
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,480
(2 letters)
RUSAMEEKAE: Ooh! Two letters!

1666
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,096
RUSAMEEKAE: Today you did really well.
Keep fighting tomorrow. Nice to meet you!

1667
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,080
MARIO: MILL.

1668
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:29,920
RUSAMEEKAE: MILL!

1669
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,280
JANEYEH: The eggs were delicious.

1670
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Make them more often.

1671
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,760
MARIO: Well, kept eating just now.

1672
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,192
CRIS: TOD!

1673
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,840
RUSAMEEKAE:
I really liked your dress today.

1674
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:43,296
RUSAMEEKAE: Looking forward to seeing
what good memories we can make together.

1675
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,480
JANEYEH: TIME really has changed.

1676
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,880
CRIS: So who did SUNNY
and NAMNUNG write to?

1677
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Ooh, now I really want to know.
Let's keep watching.

1678
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,000
TIME: Oh.

1679
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:53,320
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME, what's wrong?

1680
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,280
CRIS: How many?

1681
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,840
(2 letters)
CRIS: Two letters!

1682
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,080
CRIS: TIME really stood out today too.

1683
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,040
JANEYEH: So charming.

1684
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,640
MARIO: TIME is basically today's MVP.

1685
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,240
RUSAMEEKAE: You're so playful. I want to see
how well our teasing would match if we got closer.

1686
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,280
RUSAMEEKAE: If my Thai is wrong,
don't laugh at me, haha.

1687
01:12:12,576 --> 01:12:13,680
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY!

1688
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,720
MARIO: The handwriting is cute.

1689
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,800
CRIS: Everything is good. That red outfit.

1690
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,360
RUSAMEEKAE: I think the other one
is from NAMNUNG.

1691
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,360
RUSAMEEKAE: I just want to tell you
how happy I am to have met you.

1692
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,920
RUSAMEEKAE: I feel so much more at ease now.
I'm not expecting anything from what happens after this

1693
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,280
RUSAMEEKAE: just that we can be a source of comfort for each other.
Though I might be hoping a little bit.

1694
01:12:34,912 --> 01:12:35,744
RUSAMEEKAE: What's this?

1695
01:12:35,744 --> 01:12:37,280
TIMETHAI:
That bracket was placed perfectly.

1696
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,600
JANEYEH: Hoping a little bit.

1697
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,320
CRIS: That NAMNUNG...
Should we clap?

1698
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,800
CRIS: She's liked him
since that very first glance.

1699
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,680
CRIS: MATHEUS is opening his drawer.

1700
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,120
(Re-reading the rules)

1701
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,720
CRIS: MATHEUS didn't get one?
That's sad.

1702
01:13:20,736 --> 01:13:21,760
(No letter)
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD didn't get one?

1703
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:25,966
CRIS: That hurts.

1704
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:27,149
JANEYEH: Why though?

1705
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,408
CRIS: I actually feel worse for TOD,
you know?

1706
01:13:30,336 --> 01:13:31,616
CRIS: Because TOD really tried.

1707
01:13:31,744 --> 01:13:32,520
TIMETHAI: True.

1708
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,224
CRIS: Ouch.

1709
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,520
CRIS: I feel so bad.

1710
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,920
TOD: Nobody likes me.

1711
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:09,480
TOD: I started thinking maybe

1712
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,160
TOD: I did something wrong today
without realizing it.

1713
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,040
TOD: So I feel like
maybe they don't like me.

1714
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,440
RUSAMEEKAE:
The vibe is totally different now.

1715
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,256
TIME: Oh, I'm going crazy.

1716
01:14:25,312 --> 01:14:28,200
TOD: This is the hard part.

1717
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,184
TOD: Normally, what kind of person are you?
Like, if you send something to someone

1718
01:14:33,184 --> 01:14:35,552
TOD: and they don't react at all,
do you change your target?

1719
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:40,992
TIME: It's that phase where you're trying,
really trying and putting effort in...

1720
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:43,240
TIME: But if there's absolutely
no reaction...

1721
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,080
TOD: Then better to change targets.

1722
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:48,120
TIME: Put your energy into people
who give energy back to you.

1723
01:14:48,512 --> 01:14:52,760
TOD: For me personally,
I like to rely on a sense of comfort.

1724
01:14:53,248 --> 01:14:56,320
TOD: If someone makes me feel at ease,
they're the one.

1725
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,400
TOD: Things will just flow on their own.

1726
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,520
TIME: True.

1727
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,160
TOD: But will we find that in here?
And if we don't, then what?

1728
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,840
TIME: In that case,
we'll have to go on a date together,

1729
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,880
TIMETHAI: TIME, that's so smooth.

1730
01:15:10,624 --> 01:15:12,640
TOD: Let's give it a try.

1731
01:15:15,072 --> 01:15:16,832
TOD: Because once we go on a date,
we'll get to know more about each other.

1732
01:15:16,832 --> 01:15:17,472
TOD: Yes.

1733
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:18,432
TOD: We'll know more.

1734
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:18,960
TIME: Exactly.

1735
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:22,600
TOD: Sure, let's try.
There are still many days left.

1736
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,520
CRIS: And MATHEUS's in his room alone
with no one to talk to.

1737
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,952
RUSAMEEKAE: That's cruel.

1738
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,240
CRIS: Heart shattered.

1739
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,120
TIMETHAI: But I love that scene with the two guys
in the same room liking the same girl.

1740
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,200
MARIO: That scene is really something.

1741
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,120
TIMETHAI: It's so cool.

1742
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,560
RUSAMEEKAE: So TOD wrote to...

1743
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,440
JANEYEH: NAMNUNG.

1744
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,160
RUSAMEEKAE: And NAMNUNG wrote to TIME.

1745
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,640
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME wrote to SUNNY,
and SUNNY wrote to TIME.

1746
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,240
TIMETHAI: So TIME got
two top-tier girls at once.

1747
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,432
MARIO: And there's only one person
I'm worried about, which is TOD.

1748
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:05,376
MARIO: He ate so many eggs
but nobody sent him anything.

1749
01:16:05,472 --> 01:16:06,240
(So sad)

1750
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,616
JANEYEH: Poor TOD.

1751
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,840
CRIS: I feel bad for TOD.
He took care of everyone.

1752
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

1753
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,000
MARIO: Can we call TOD to comfort him?

1754
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,120
CRIS: Save TOD, right?

1755
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,000
MARIO: If I were TOD,
I'd be calling the boat already.

1756
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,360
RUSAMEEKAE: No, that's not sad enough.

1757
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Swim back.

1758
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,400
RUSAMEEKAE:
Cry in the middle of the sea.

1759
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,568
RUSAMEEKAE:
And then swim all the way back.

1760
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,640
MARIO:
I'm afraid he wouldn't even make it.

1761
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,960
TIMETHAI: Yeah, I'd be scared
he'd vanish halfway.

1762
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:29,920
CRIS: Crying while swimming?

1763
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,584
RUSAMEEKAE: Yep. Crying while swimming.

1764
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,920
MARIO: Stay strong, TOD.

1765
01:16:33,978 --> 01:16:34,880
RUSAMEEKAE: That's right.

1766
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,080
TIMETHAI: But I'm rooting for TIME.
Team TIME.

1767
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,680
CRIS: TIME with who?
Who are you shipping TIME with?

1768
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,680
TIMETHAI: I'm rooting for both of them.

1769
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,408
(Cheering them equally)

1770
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,760
JANEYEH: I love this. I really like what MATHEUS did, right?
He switched, didn't he?

1771
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,480
CRIS: MATHEUS chose JUN.
That's a surprise.

1772
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,640
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm feeling so uneasy now.

1773
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,120
TIMETHAI: You're gonna go home
and not be able to sleep again.

1774
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, can't sleep.
It's stressful.

1775
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Does anyone have MATHEUS's number?
I want to talk to him.

1776
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,120
MARIO: MATHEUS, what did you say?

1777
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:58,075
(Are you really gonna call?)
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

1778
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,960
RUSAMEEKAE: And what about JOY?
Who did JOY write to?

1779
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,000
MARIO: JOY wrote to MILL.

1780
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,040
CRIS: Not surprised.

1781
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,440
JANEYEH: It was love at first sight.

1782
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,040
CRIS: But the ones who really succeeded

1783
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,272
CRIS: who wrote to each other
without knowing are...

1784
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,320
RUSAMEEKAE: ASSE and...

1785
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:11,920
CRIS: CHERRY.

1786
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,360
RUSAMEEKAE: CHERRY.

1787
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,320
CRIS: Quiet with quiet.

1788
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,120
TIMETHAI: And that's all thanks to the game.
The game basically matched them.

1789
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Exactly.

1790
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,280
CRIS: We don't know if they'll last, though.
Things might still change.

1791
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,464
RUSAMEEKAE: True, but that's okay.

1792
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,680
RUSAMEEKAE: The game isn't over yet.

1793
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:30,600
RUSAMEEKAE: So that was day one of their stay
at LOVE(X), wrapped up perfectly.

1794
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,120
RUSAMEEKAE: But that's not all.
Before we say goodbye...

1795
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,304
(Not done yet?)

1796
01:17:34,304 --> 01:17:37,160
RUSAMEEKAE: There's a little surprise.
Just a small teaser.

1797
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,960
(The mysterious boundless territory,
X-Land.)

1798
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,160
CRIS: This is X-Land.

1799
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,160
(It will open for the first time tonight.)

1800
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,512
(A space for limitless conversation)

1801
01:17:48,512 --> 01:17:50,208
(and super private, special time.)

1802
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,280
TIMETHAI: And it's only day two.

1803
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,040
(All the men will take off their shirts,
put on a tie)

1804
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,600
(and stand behind a screen.)

1805
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,720
(Ladies, please choose your partner)

1806
01:18:08,224 --> 01:18:11,120
(to compete for a chance
to enter X-Land.)

1807
01:18:22,138 --> 01:18:25,696
(Who's going to end up with whom?)

1808
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,440
(Want to see it now)
JANEYEH: Oh, I want to see it already.

1809
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,240
JANEYEH: Now I won't be able to sleep.

1810
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,280
CRIS: Really want to know in this necktie game
who ends up with who, but I just now caught a glimpse of it...

1811
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:35,840
MARIO: That's it?

1812
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,240
CRIS: Wait, the teaser's already over?
We only get that much? That is so cruel.

1813
01:18:38,368 --> 01:18:39,264
JANEYEH: So cruel.

1814
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,040
CRIS: But I did see
the word X-Land flash by.

1815
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:48,672
RUSAMEEKAE: X-Land is a boundless,
mysterious, super special dating zone.

1816
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:56,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Because in X-Land,
dear CRIS, whoever goes in can reveal

1817
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,800
RUSAMEEKAE: their true preferences.

1818
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:05,160
RUSAMEEKAE: As soon as we go in, anyone could be anything,
deer, monkey, gib, gibbon, elephant, giraffe.

1819
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,600
RUSAMEEKAE: You can let it all show.

1820
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,776
TIMETHAI: I'm crazy.

1821
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,360
MARIO: No. That's not it.

1822
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,440
MARIO: That's not it.

1823
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,000
RUSAMEEKAE: I mean your tastes.

1824
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,360
MARIO: Your tastes.

1825
01:19:15,776 --> 01:19:21,216
RUSAMEEKAE: You get to spend ultra-private,
super romantic time together, with zero distractions.

1826
01:19:21,216 --> 01:19:24,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Staying close all night long.
And most importantly...

1827
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,360
MARIO: Wow, that's exciting.

1828
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:31,136
RUSAMEEKAE: You have to complete
tough challenges to fight for this precious chance.

1829
01:19:31,136 --> 01:19:36,608
RUSAMEEKAE: Because each time,
only a handful of people can go.

1830
01:19:36,608 --> 01:19:42,656
RUSAMEEKAE: So let's see who will be the first to
earn the right to invite someone on a date in X-Land

1831
01:19:42,656 --> 01:19:46,560
RUSAMEEKAE: and who that heartfelt invitation
will be sent to.

1832
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,520
RUSAMEEKAE: And all the answers
will be revealed next week.

1833
01:19:53,082 --> 01:19:57,383
RUSAMEEKAE: So please stay tuned for

1834
01:19:57,383 --> 01:19:59,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Thailand's
very first borderless love reality show.

1835
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,600
ALL: LOVE(X)! Dum, dum.

1836
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:06,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Every Saturday
at 5 p.m. on WeTV.

1837
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:11,240
RUSAMEEKAE: See you again next time.
For now, we're signing off. Goodbye!

1838
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,960
ALL: Goodbye!

1839
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,400
(Preview)
(The mysterious, boundless X-Land)

1840
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,000
(will be opened
for the first time tonight.)

1841
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,040
MARIO: I'd love to go. I'd love to.

1842
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,560
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to go,
you must win, TIME.

1843
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,800
MARIO: TOD.

1844
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,440
CANDIDATE: I think we are the best duo.

1845
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,840
JANEYEH: They were holding hands tightly.

1846
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,880
JANEYEH: Who's gonna win?

1847
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,880
CRIS: Is it TOD?

1848
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,640
(Preview)
(The team with the fastest time is...)

1849
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,440
CRIS: No way!

1850
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,760
RUSAMEEKAE: My nose is about to bleed.

1851
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,680
TIMETHAI: The water sound
is really clear.

1852
01:20:57,466 --> 01:20:59,232
ALL: Wow.

1853
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,200
MARIO: And leg massaging.

1854
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,600
CRIS: I feel faint.

1855
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,000
CRIS: Can I have an inhaler?

1856
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,760
TIMETHAI: Where's my top camera, bro?

1857
