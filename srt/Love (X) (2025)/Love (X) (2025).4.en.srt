JANEYEH: They just kissed?

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,040
SUNNY: Letting me kiss you
would be easier than this.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,280
ALL: Hey!

18
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:07,840

beautiful women?

21

(There, you will find)

37
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,920

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,480
JANEYEH: Superb, superb!

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,520

RUSAMEEKAE: I love how SUNNY's
so open about everything.

50
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,888
(Now, we'd like to ask all the men)

51
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,584
(to gather on the beach)

52
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,128

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,960
(All the men will take off their shirts,
put on a necktie)

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,520
(and stand behind a paper screen)

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,960
(The women will choose a man
by pulling their ties)

62
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,760
JANEYEH: That's a big wow.

63
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
JANEYEH: I'm so stunned.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
TIMETHAI: No wonder
they got up to work out.

65
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,240
TIME: What, what did you say?

66
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,344
TOD: Okay.

CRIS: Look at everyone's body.

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
CRIS: Doing push-ups
as soon as they woke up.

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,720
JANEYEH: Wow!

72
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:43,634

73
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:45,224

TOD: Help me out.

77
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,161
JANEYEH: Hey! Is he being shy?

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

79
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:57,632
CRIS: TOD's making his move.

80
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,296
TIMETHAI: Is this how
he's finding a new target?

81
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,307
JANEYEH: Yes, haha.

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,536
(Observing)

83
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,040
(Glance)

84
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,920
- JANEYEH: Oh
- CRIS: Oh my.

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,384
MARIO: And why is TOD blushing?

86
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,056
JANEYEH: What's with the lip-biting?

87
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:13,989
(Biting lips)
MARIO: TOD.

88
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:16,384
CRIS: Help, JUNSU's in on it too.

89
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:17,472
JANEYEH: He's in too.

90
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,793
RUSAMEEKAE: Why won't anyone
help MATHEUS with the tie?

91
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,136
TIMETHAI: And what's
with all this vibe?

92
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

93
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,560
TOD: Oh my god.

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
MATHEUS: Very handsome.

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,240
(Tying it while complimenting)
TOD: Oh, very handsome.

96
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
MARIO: Hey, something's off!

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I feel uneasy.
I can't even breathe.

98
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:38,016
(Handsome)

99
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,296

100
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,006
- JUNSU: Thank you.
- TOD: Thank you.

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,440
MARIO: Hey, something's off!

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,080
RUSAMEEKAE: What do you mean, MARIO?

103
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
MARIO: They're tying ties for each other
and complimenting each other.

104
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Guys don't tell each other
they're handsome?

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
TIMETHAI: Guys don't call
each other handsome.

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,760
MARIO: I've never complimented
my guy friend like that.

107
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,760
- CRIS: Yeah, straight guys don't do that.
- MARIO: Nope.

108
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:56,819

ALL: LOVE(X)! Dum, dum.

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,152
RUSAMEEKAE: It's a game because

114
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,240
RUSAMEEKAE: whoever wins gets to travel
to the world of X-Land.

115
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
(They're all expecting this big event)
ALL: Woohoo!

116
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
MARIO: I've got goosebumps.

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
MARIO: I've got goosebumps.

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,840

119
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:22,787
- RUSAMEEKAE: you want to see it.
- MARIO: Exactly, goosebumps.

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,720
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to watch,
we won't show you.

121
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:26,680
- RUSAMEEKAE: No.
- MARIO: Come on, let us watch.

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to watch,
then let's watch it together.

123
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,144
(I can't wait)

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,328
TOD: Okay.

125
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:31,778
MATHEUS: This way?

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,480

MATHEUS: You're sexy.

131
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,360
CRIS: MATHEUS just keeps peeking.

132
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:51,800
CRIS: He's looking down again.

133
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,440
TIMETHAI: Checking everyone's six-pack.

134
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,400
JANEYEH: Hey, did it just jerk?

135
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:00,480
(The muscular guys are ready to go,
and who will the girls choose?)

136
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,120
CRIS: Thailand is awesome, right?
It's like anything goes here.

137
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:09,040

00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:14,480
RUSAMEEKAE: I have to focus. I have to watch the show,
pay attention to all the details.

140
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:15,424
(Staring until my eyes hurt)

141
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see
which guy our girls will pick.

142
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,360
CHERRY: Oh, wow.

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,984

145
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,600
SUNNY: Can I have a bite?

146
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:33,440
JANEYEH: Wow.

147
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360

you're tired?

148
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
SUNNY: Hello.

149
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,158
(Now we're going to
start the competition)

150
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:49,146
(for a chance to go on a date on X-Land.)

151
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,318
(Before we begin,)

152
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:52,480
(I'd like all the girls)

153
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,173
(to choose one guy
you want to pair up with.)

154
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:58,788
(Pull his necktie, and pull him
out from behind the screen,)

155
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:02,800
(and he'll be
your partner for this game.)

156
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
JANEYEH: That is awesome.

157
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,680
SUNNY: If we want to go to X-Land,
we've got to pick the buffest guy.

158
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,200

159
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,360
JOY: I already know who the one
in the middle is. Pretty sure it's him.

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
(Ladies, please choose your partner)

161
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:28,200
(to compete for a spot in X-Land.)

162
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,640
TIMETHAI: Choose for yourselves.

163
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,456
(Making eye contact)

164
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Come on, choose.

165
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,840
MARIO: NAMNUNG looks stressed.

166
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:37,544
JANEYEH: She can't decide.

167
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,120
JOY: I'll just go first then.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,880
JOY: I'll just go first then.

169
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,680
(May I go first?)
MARIO: Hey.

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,320
JANEYEH: That is so cool.

171
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,840
JANEYEH: So cool.

172
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,520
RUSAMEEKAE: She's up first.

173
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
CRIS: Pretty JOY, of course.

174
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,480
- JANEYEH: Pretty JOY.
- CRIS: "Okay, I'm going."

175
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,760
CHERRY: Alright, okay.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
TIMETHAI: If you're slow, you miss out.

177
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:01,308
JOY: Which one?

178
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,415
JOY: Locked in.

179
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:04,760
(Choosing the one standing in the middle)

180
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,000
- JOY: Do I pull him out?
- CHERRY: Pull!

181
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,296
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, it's stuck.

182
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,128
CRIS: Who is that?

183
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,640
CRIS: JUN, it's JUN.

184
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,600
(Suddenly collapsed)
CRIS: Hey, JUN.

185
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,880
JANEYEH: Pretty JOY, obviously.

186
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
TIMETHAI: Pretty JOY.

187
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:30,880
(Amused)

188
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,360
JOY: Honestly, I already
had a feeling it was JUNSU.

189
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,000
JOY: JUNSU is someone
who really tries hard.

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,720
JOY: If there's a game to play,
he'd be a great match for me.

191
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,400
JOY: Yes.

192
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah.

193
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,400
JANEYEH: She's not backing down.

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah.

195
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,520
JANEYEH: She's fighting for it.

196
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Here we go.
Is someone gonna cut her off? Better run.

197
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,200
(Hurry and run) - RUSAMEEKAE: Will she cut her off?
- MARIO: Hey, hey.

198
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
NAMNUNG: Hi.

199
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:03,392
CRIS: NAMNUNG is so cute.

200
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,208
(Observing)

201
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,345
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

202
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:08,040
JANEYEH: SUNNY.

203
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,984
CRIS: "That one's tempting too."
SUNNY is so special, right?

204
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,109
SUNNY: That one's tempting too.

205
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

206
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,840
MILL: Hello.

207
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
MILL: I don't even know who it is.

208
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,680
CHERRY: Well, of course
Cherry would get that one.

209
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

210
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,864
LOVE(X)PERT: CHERRY and ASSE, huh.

211
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:30,074
(Smiling)

212
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,840

213
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,280
(Necklace) - JANEYEH: She recognized the necklace.

214
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,120
CHERRY: I feel like
I'm the most comfortable with him.

215
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
CHERRY: I want to play the game with him
like on the first day.

216
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
CHERRY: I think we could
be really good partners.

217
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,040
(Looking)
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow.

218
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,400

220
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,024
CRIS: Here comes SUNNY.

221
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
TIMETHAI: SUNNY's probably got this.

222
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:52,043
JANEYEH: SUNNY might have chosen right.

223
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,520
SUNNY: I already knew it was TOD.

224
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,360
SUNNY: TOD has the best figure in the house.
No argument there, everyone knows.

225
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
SUNNY: His body is miles
better than everyone else's.

226
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:01,617
JANEYEH: Miles!

227
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:02,935
- CRIS: Miles!
- RUSAMEEKAE: Miles!

228
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,256

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,200
TOD: Let's do this.

230
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,854
SUNNY: Let's go.

231
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:06,848
SUNNY: Of course I will.

232
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,520
NAMNUNG: I'm confused now.

233
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,200
NAMNUNG: Just judging from the body,
I knew it was MATHEUS.

234
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
NAMNUNG: He's also someone
I'm interested in.

235
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,160
MILL: Hello.

236
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,320
MILL: I don't even know who it is.

237
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,080
RUSAMEEKAE: All so confusing.

238
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:29,339
(Secretly observing)

239
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
NAMNUNG: Oh, pink one.

240
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,880
- TIME: TIME: How is it?
- MILL: Good.

241
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,680
TIME: Ready to win?

242
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
TIME: We have to win.

243
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
TIME: We've got to win.

244
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,760
MILL: I'll fight to the death.

245
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,880
MILL: When I went to pull,
I honestly didn't know who it was.

246
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,840
MILL: TIME said he's very competitive.

247
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,440
MILL: I feel good that he likes competing too
and also wants to win.

248
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,520
RUSAMEEKAE: But they're choosing
to compete in the game, right?

249
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,880
TIME: It was a surprise, like, whoa...

250
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
TIME: Is it MILL?

251
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,960
TIME: But if you ask me honestly,

252
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,080
TIME: I wanted it to be SUNNY

253
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
TIME: or NAMNUNG.

254
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,160
MARIO: Wow.

255
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:01,334

TIME: Let's go, let's go.

257
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:05,440
(Looking)

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,280
NAMNUNG: We're not paired up today.

259
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:10,403
CANDIDATE: Yes.

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,080
CRIS: MATHEUS's so confused.
Did you see him keep sending her looks?

261
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,680
(The competition to win
entry into X-Land this round is...)

262
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,240
(Holding hands)
(Every member must hold hands with their partner)

263
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,016
(and run across the floating mats on the water
as fast as possible to the beach)

264
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:31,120
(Running to the beach)

265
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,960
(Then the two must work together
to take a block of ice out of a tub.)

266
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:41,040
(Inside the ice block is a golden key)
(Then melt the ice together to get the key out)

267
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,472
(without using any tools
or any kind of force.)

268
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:48,640
(The team with the fastest time wins)

269
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
(and will get the right
to go to X-Land this round.)

270
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,384
JANEYEH: That's awesome.

271
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:53,248
SUNNY: Let's hope we get lucky.

272
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:58,720
(The race across the floating mats
will be split into two heats.)

273
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,040

in a bridal carry,)

274
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,760
(Start) (Finish) - LOVE(X)PERT: Wow.
- (and then run to the finish line.)

(The first two teams to reach
the finish will compete first.)

276
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,640
(The remaining three teams
will race afterward.)

277
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,184
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh no.

278
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,320
- MILL: Oh no, I feel so guilty.
- TIME: It's okay.

279
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,280
CRIS: Whoever's with JUNSU
is going to lose.

280
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,880
JOY: Can you handle 52 kilos?

281
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:27,641
JOY: I'm fat.

282
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,120
JUNSU: Fat? Okay.

283
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,760
SUNNY: What's the bridal carry again?

284
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,600
- SUNNY: Like this?
- TOD: The bridal carry is...

285
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
TOD: Like, how exactly?

286
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,040
TOD: Like, how exactly?

287
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
MARIO: TOD looks pretty relaxed.

288
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,760
CRIS: Relaxed.

289
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,280
TIME: Save your energy.

290
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,301
TIME: Save your energy.

291
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:49,786
TIME: Not yet.

292
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,920
SUNNY: Practice, practice.

293
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,160
CRIS: MATHEUS always looks confused.

294
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,440
(Now all men pick up their partners.)

295
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,040

296

- SUNNY: No, no.
- TOD: Okay.

385
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,280

He's going to mess up.

386
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,680
TIMETHAI: Yeah, TOD, relax.

387

SUNNY: We look like the team

389

and the most athletic girl.

390
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,320

392
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,520

walking on those float pads.

CRIS: And the three who lost are like...

523
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,022

shoving each other?

525
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,360

We cannot give up.

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,040
JANEYEH: Wow.

530
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:02,272
TIME: Just don't get hurt, okay?

531

TIME: As I said, I'm the kind of person

532
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
TIME: who has to win.

533
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,360

you've got to win, TIME.

(Round two)

540
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,240

it gets a bit crowded.

541
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,520
(Very crowded)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, it's getting tougher.

546
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,920
JANEYEH: Wow.

547
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,320

556
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:53,688

whoever starts first gets to go.

558
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,440
(Slipped) TIMETHAI: They just started.
The others haven't moved yet.

559

566
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,640

and let the others go first.

JUNSU: MATHEUS.

593
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,648
JUNSU: Why?

594
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,200

(TIME and MILL reached the ice point)
CRIS: Inside.

TIME: Again.

600
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,218
TOD: My god.

601
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,760
(Walking with concern) CRIS: TOD,
don't be a hero. That's not your team.

602
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,880
MARIO: CRIS, why stop TOD like that?

603
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,160
CRIS: TOD, go back. That's not your team.

604
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,264

to have their own moment.

612
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,360
CRIS: They don't care
about anything anymore.

613
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,280
TIMETHAI: They're in their own world.
They don't care about the game anymore.

They are just the two of them. It's okay.

621
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:46,336

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow!

684
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,840
(MATHEUS and NAMNUNG ranked first in the second round)
(which are...)

685
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
JANEYEH: Oops, who's going to win?

686
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,760
CRIS: Is it TOD?

687
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,000
(NAMNUNG and MATHEUS)

688
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:05,951
CRIS: Hey, seriously?

689
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,968
(NAMNUNG and MATHEUS)

690
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:08,928
TOD: Huh?

691
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,080
CRIS: I'm confused now.

692
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:16,880
(MATHEUS and NAMNUNG made it
in 2:35 min and earned a date at X-Land)

693
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,336
RUSAMEEKAE: Happy, happy!

694
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,160
CRIS: They broke the ice so quickly.

695
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,440
(Congratulations)

696
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,840
(to both contestants who won)

697
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,600
(the very first invitation to X-Land.)

698
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,976
(Congratulations to the two winners)

699
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Congratulations.

700
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,600
(Additionally, every candidate)

701
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
(will receive a number of shell coins)

702
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,560
(according to their rankings
in the competition)

703
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:44,942
(MATHEUS and NAMNUNG 2:35 min 20 shell coins, TIME and MILL 2:56 min
15 shell coins, TOD and SUNNY 3:05 min 10 shell coins)

704
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,912
(JUNSU and JOY 3:29 min 5 shell coins,
ASSE and CHERRY 3:46 min 0 shell coins)

705
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,920
MARIO: I feel sorry for TOD again.

706
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,600
(Don't feel sorry yet)
RUSAMEEKAE: No, MARIO, you should feel sorry for SUNNY.

707
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:55,264
RUSAMEEKAE: He left SUNNY in the sand.

708
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:57,312
(Lost the game and fell too)

709
00:30:58,257 --> 00:30:58,480
(Feel sorry for SUNNY)

710
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,280
(After returning to the villa,)

711
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,824
(both of you)

712
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:03,400
(will have an hour)

713
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,160
(to invite the person you like.)

714
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,352
JANEYEH: Oops, who is he looking at?

715
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,920
(The person being invited cannot refuse)

716
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,264
JANEYEH: Oh, that's harsh.

717
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,280
CRIS: Not being able to refuse is harsh.

718
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,800
TIME: I wouldn't refuse anyway.

719
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
RUSAMEEKAE: He's sending signals.

720
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,280
- JUNSU: So you guys can choose, right?
- NAMNUNG: Yes.

721
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,160
NAMNUNG: It's going to be like... yeah.

722
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,360
- JUNSU: Two people?
- MATHEUS: Maybe you're the lucky one.

723
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,600
- JUNSU: Two people?
- MATHEUS: Maybe you're the lucky one.

724
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:37,760
(There's excitement)

725
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,488
JANEYEH: Maybe you're the lucky one?

726
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,560
RUSAMEEKAE: It might be you, JUNSU.

727
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,040
MATHEUS: Maybe you're the lucky one.

728
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:46,688
(Korean-style respect)

729
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,600
MATHEUS is confused now.

730
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
- JUNSU: Very handsome, very pretty.
- MATHEUS: Kiss too.

731
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:56,210
RUSAMEEKAE: JANEYEH, who do you think?

732
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:58,816
JANEYEH: I think MATHEUS chose JUNSU.

733
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:06,880
JANEYEH: They secretly liked each other two years
ago and now they're meeting again.

734
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,640
RUSAMEEKAE: And who will NAMNUNG choose?

735
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
TIMETHAI: NAMNUNG will choose SUNNY.

736
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:13,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Okay, okay.

737
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,880
RUSAMEEKAE: How about you, MARIO?

738
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,920
MARIO: NAMNUNG and SUNNY.

739
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,240
- RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG and SUNNY.
- JANEYEH: Enough already.

740
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,656
(Those who walk the same path)
CRIS: These straight guys.

741
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,720
TIMETHAI: I don't want to know.
I just want to see.

742
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,840
CRIS: Haha.

743
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Do you want to know
who's going to choose whom?

744
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:27,328
MARIO: Something about MATHEUS.

745
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Because right now,

746
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,600
RUSAMEEKAE: both winners are about to
invite dates to X-Land for the first time.

747
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,968
RUSAMEEKAE: But the question is,

748
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,520
RUSAMEEKAE: who will they choose to go
to this mysterious and boundless land?

749
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's guess
who they're going to choose.

750
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,464
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's continue watching.

751
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:52,096
(CHA JING, Modern Chinese Tea,
Craft-Blended)

752
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Relax a bit.

753
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,360
CANDIDATE: How deep is it?

754
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,200
CANDIDATE: Wow, it's quite deep.

755
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,920
CHERRY: ASSE, come down here.

756
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,520
CRIS: This pair is so cute.
I can't take it.

757
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,560
TIMETHAI: They don't care
about anything now.

758
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
CRIS: Yes, they don't have to compete.
They can just leave the game.

759
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,272
JUNSU: Happy Songkran!

760
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,480
JUNSU: Don't push me.

761
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,720
CRIS: JOY and JUNSU
look like friends, right?

762
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,640
JANEYEH: They really look like friends.

763
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
CRIS: SUNNY is number one!

764
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,680
TIMETHAI: SUNNY is definitely the best.

765
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,240
(Just kidding)
TIME: Special talent.

766
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm rooting for MATHEUS.

767
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,200
NAMNUNG: It's a dolphin.

768
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,000
TOD: Who wants to headbutt?
Anyone up for it?

769
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,920
TIME: NAMNUNG.

770
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I feel sorry for TOD.

771
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,528
CRIS: I feel sorry for TOD.

772
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Well, it's always her.

773
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,720
CRIS: Yeah, it's always her.

774
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,280
MARIO: SUNNY's hair is all tangled up.
Who's gonna fix it?

775
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,264
(Secretly observing)

776
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,504
TIME: You wanna get it out?

777
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,560
TIME: Let me see.

778
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:24,960
SUNNY: I don't really trust you.

779
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,600
TIME: Why not?

780
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,000
TIMETHAI: He walks this way.

781
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,960
CRIS: TIME came to take it out.

782
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,520
SUNNY: Did you wait to sabotage me?

783
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,440
TIME: I'd never.

784
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,200
CRIS: Oh my god.

785
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,144
JANEYEH: I'd never.

786
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,424
TIMETHAI: I'd never.

787
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,800
JANEYEH: Never.

788
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,664
TIME: It doesn't hurt, right?

789
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:42,336
SUNNY: It doesn't.

790
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,520
JANEYEH: Hey, someone's angry!

791
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Uh-oh.

792
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,096
SUNNY: Is it not out yet?

793
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:58,782
TIME: It's so close.

794
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,480
CRIS: She's stressed now.

795
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,680
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS's safe. He already
has someone in mind.

796
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,320
CRIS: She's stressed. Now that TIME
goes with SUNNY. who will she choose?

797
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,000
JANEYEH: Right, she's unsure
who to pick now.

798
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,006
TIME: Okay.

799
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:13,728
SUNNY: How many strands have I got out?

800
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:15,200
TIME: Do you trust me now?

801
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,160
SUNNY: Yes, I trust you now.

802
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,520
JANEYEH: She's sulking now.

803
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,160
TIMETHAI: Oh, she goes out.

804
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,320
LOVE(X)PERT: She's thinking.

805
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,920
NAMNUNG: I'm leaving.

806
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,440
NAMNUNG: Aren't you going to get ready?

807
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,480
NAMNUNG: Aren't you coming up?
I haven't chosen yet.

808
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,760
CANDIDATE: Then hurry up and choose.

809
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,992
NAMNUNG: Oh, why would I tell others?

810
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:43,360
(Walks away)
JANEYEH: Aha!

811
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,080
CRIS: He's looking at her.

812
00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:53,056
(Watching closely)

813
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,400
TIME: It's okay. You don't have to go.
I'll go instead.

814
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,720
TIME: I'll go instead.

815
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:01,160
(Who will NAMNUNG and MATHEUS choose?)

816
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,528
JANEYEH: Who will they choose?

817
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,520
CRIS: SUNNY or TIME?

818
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,080
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME will definitely follow.

819
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
TIMETHAI: But there's a chance he might
mess with these two by choosing one.

820
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,000
TIMETHAI: Yeah, they can choose two.

821
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,480
CRIS: Right.

822
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,320
TIMETHAI: He could choose one
or the other.

823
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,600
CRIS: But with TIME, it seems like
a smooth and happy choice.

824
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,760
TIMETHAI: Hmm.

825
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,520
CRIS: But if it's SUNNY, oh wow.

826
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,920
CRIS: Wow, just like that.

827
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

828
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

829
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,480
CRIS: He's here for CHERRY?

830
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,000
ASSE: JUNSU.

831
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:36,992
(JUNSU's taking a shower without closing the door)
(RUSAMEEKAE: Excited)

832
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,040
JANEYEH: He forgot to close the door.

833
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,760
RUSAMEEKAE: JUNSU took a shower,
but forgot to close the door.

834
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:41,536
(What is RUSAMEEKAE doing?)

835
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,040
(I feel like diving into the screen.)

836
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,040
- TIMETHAI: You can't see it. It's not 3D.
- MARIO: RUSAMEEKAE, that's all you can see.

837
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:52,704
(Oh, really? I can't see.)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, really? I wanna see it.

838
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,104
TIMETHAI: They showered so quickly.

839
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:57,056
- RUSAMEEKAE: They're in the same room.
- TIMETHAI: They're in the same room.

840
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:57,883
CRIS: It's stressful.

841
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,440
SUNNY: My hair looks like
a lion's mane now.

842
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,320
(Get up and help.)

843
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,280
RUSAMEEKAE: This pair is in the clear.

844
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,800
NAMNUNG: But you look good
in half-up hairstyle.

845
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,120
TIMETHAI: Oops, did she pull too hard?

846
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,320
CRIS: Not yet, not yet.

847
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,712
TIME: But that's a lot of pressure.

848
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,496
TIME: The person who chooses
feels immense pressure.

849
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,600
JANEYEH: Everyone's dressed up.

850
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:22,304
RUSAMEEKAE: They gotta look good.

851
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,040
TIME: It's either you or me.

852
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,280
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME hopes he'll be chosen.

853
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,040
TOD: We've got...

854
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,440
TIME: We've got a good chance.

855
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,400
TOD: Oh.

856
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,240
TOD: I'm not sure.

857
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,640
TIME: But I want to know

858
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,080
TIME: who MATHEUS will choose.

859
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,040
RUSAMEEKAE: I want to know too.

860
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,800
TIMETHAI: He wants to know
just like we want to know.

861
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,920
TIME: Who will MATHEUS choose?

862
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
TOD: TIME,
who do you think he'll choose?

863
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,640
TIME: I didn't see anyone go talk to...

864
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
TOD: I think

865
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,232
TOD: it could be MILL.

866
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,760
TIME: Hmm, possible.

867
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,784
- CRIS: Interesting, MILL?
- TIMETHAI: Really?

868
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,560
TIME: Wasn't there a moment
when he chose MILL?

869
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:14,600
TIME: Wasn't there a moment
when he chose MILL?

870
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:16,192
(The first competition)
MATHEUS: MILL.

871
00:38:16,192 --> 00:38:16,716
MILL: Okay.

872
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,080
TIME: Oh, yes.

873
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,320
JOY: But I guess

874
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
JOY: JUNSU must be into girls.

875
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,480
JOY: Oops, no.

876
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,560
JOY: He must be into...

877
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:29,760
JOY: Boys.

878
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,560
JOY: Boys.

879
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

880
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,152
TIMETHAI: Isn't JUNSU
just messing around?

881
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,840
CRIS: I think JUNSU has bisexuality.

882
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,120
JANEYEH: I think so too.

883
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,448
CRIS: But JUNSU and JOY being together
feels more like friends.

884
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,760
(Like friends)
CRIS: It's comfortable like a safe zone.

885
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,792
RUSAMEEKAE: But JOY
might have a strong sense.

886
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,240
TIMETHAI: Women have better sense,
so she probably knows.

887
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,240
MARIO: Right, mine doesn't move at all.

888
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:56,320
MILL: I'm thinking the same thing.

889
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,360
MILL: As for the women...

890
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,400
MILL: Among the women,
there's probably...

891
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,960
MILL: one, I guess.

892
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,752
CRIS: It's this one.

893
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,800
MILL: It's tough.

894
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,560
ASSE: You want to go on a date?

895
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,160
JUNSU: Choose me.
I want to go on a date.

896
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,680
JUNSU: I want to go to X-Land.

897
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,080
(Not satisfied)

898
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,512
TIMETHAI: Hey, hey, hey!

899
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,240
(Fixing up)
MARIO: Wait, wait, stay calm, MATHEUS.

900
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,214
(Still not satisfied)

901
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, so handsome.

902
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, so handsome.

903
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,520
(Hide it)
JANEYEH: Pattern clash.

904
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Good. This one's not bad.

905
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,320
LOVE(X)PERT: He's serious
about looking good.

906
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:58,440
(Look left and right)

907
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,792
MATHEUS: I look very very very hot.

908
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:04,078
JANEYEH: Very hot.

909
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,120
MARIO: Hey.

910
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,360
- TIMETHAI: Hey.
- CRIS: Whose room is this?

911
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,400
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

912
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

913
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,960
NAMNUNG: Yeah.

914
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,920
(Knocking on SUNNY and NAMNUNG's room)
LOVE(X)PERT: Here we go, here we go.

915
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,240
MATHEUS: Hello.

916
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,280
MATHEUS: How are you?

917
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,480
NAMNUNG: I'm good.

918
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,680
MATHEUS: Wow.

919
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:31,840
SUNNY: Hello.

920
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,920
(Is MATHEUS going to choose SUNNY?)
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow, which one is it?

921
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,040
LOVE(X)PERT: SUNNY.

922
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,600
LOVE(X)PERT: I really like SUNNY.

923
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,880
MATHEUS: She is wearing a red dress.

924
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,040
MATHEUS: She caught my eye the most.

925
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,840
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow.

926
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:43,680
(Or is it NAMNUNG?)

927
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,480
LOVE(X)PERT: NAMNUNG.

928
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, it's exciting.

929
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,240
- MATHEUS: I'm just looking around.
- JANEYEH: Where?

930
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:55,616
(SUNNY goes into the bathroom)
SUNNY: Okay.

931
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:59,949
- MATHEUS: Then...
- NAMNUNG: And?

932
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm excited.

933
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,520
(Asking NAMNUNG to talk outside)
MATHEUS: So, you wanna come outside?

934
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,480
MATHEUS: You wanna come outside? Or?

935
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,520
NAMNUNG: Me?

936
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:12,032
LOVE(X)PERT: You wanna come outside?

937
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

938
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,560
LOVE(X)PERT: It's just like
a scene from a music video.

939
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,560
- MATHEUS: You wanna go?
- NAMNUNG: Okay.

940
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,320
MATHEUS: Okay, sure.

941
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,240
MATHEUS: We'll be right back.

942
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
- MATHEUS: Okay.
- SUNNY: Okay, come knock.

943
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,480
MATHEUS: It's a bit windy, though. So...

944
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,320
MATHEUS: Yeah...

945
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,360
MATHEUS: Actually,
I wanted to ask you officially

946
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
MATHEUS: if you would like...

947
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,200
MATHEUS: You know...

948
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,000
CRIS: MATHEUS chose NAMNUNG.

949
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:49,120
MATHEUS: Would you like
to have dinner together?

950
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,680
NAMNUNG: What?

951
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,760
(Say it again)
JANEYEH: Oh, look at her timing.

952
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,432
NAMNUNG: What?

953
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:57,440
MATHEUS: Would you like
to have dinner together?

954
00:41:58,598 --> 00:41:59,648
LOVE(X)PERT: Man, let's go.

955
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,480
NAMNUNG: Sure.

956
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,880
NAMNUNG: Sure.

957
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:03,968
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh my God.

958
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,040
MATHEUS: Let's go, okay.

959
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,712
(MATHEUS chooses NAMNUNG)
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

960
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:09,800
MATHEUS: Okay.

961
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, he's made a choice.
He's chosen NAMNUNG.

962
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,800
MARIO: But NAMNUNG could choose
someone else too.

963
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,320
RUSAMEEKAE: I think three of them
will go, just like I said.

964
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:16,256
(Trust me, it's not wrong)

965
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,640
TIMETHAI: I don't know,
but I want to see.

966
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,160
(I want to see. I like it.)

967
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,120
MATHEUS: Alright, see you.

968
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,432
(It's time for NAMNUNG to decide)

969
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,240
CRIS: It's time for NAMNUNG to decide.

970
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,712
(Walks closer to look)
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow, hey.

971
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,040
JANEYEH: That's awesome.

972
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,880
TIMETHAI: The tub's not big enough.

973
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:44,200
(Stop)

974
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,000
LOVE(X)PERT: She's stressed.

975
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,480
TIMETHAI: She's freaked out.
She won't even smile.

976
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Because you can't refuse it.

977
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,960
CRIS: Wasn't she going
to pick TIME at first?

978
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,791
- TIME: I can help.
- NAMNUNG: Sure, sure, sure.

979
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,280
TOD: Calm down.

980
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,240
TIMETHAI: And they're in the same room.
The other will know.

981
00:43:13,626 --> 00:43:16,992
(Look the other way)

982
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,120
CRIS: Look the other way?
Where to? SUNNY?

983
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,080
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY?

984
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,000
CRIS: Or it's MATHEUS.

985
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,120
(Turn around)
RUSAMEEKAE: He sees.

986
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,864
MARIO: Wow, then it's better not to come
if you'll just turn back.

987
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,584
JANEYEH: So awesome.

988
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,640
NAMNUNG: I just feel that,
right now, he...

989
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,920
NAMNUNG: He's interested
in someone else.

990
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,720
NAMNUNG: Okay, then let's try...

991
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,400
NAMNUNG: talking with someone who...

992
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,320
NAMNUNG: is interested in me.

993
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,120
NAMNUNG: Maybe that'll help me
make a better decision.

994
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:04,484
RUSAMEEKAE: Who is it?

995
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
TIMETHAI: I feel bad for TIME.

996
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:09,408
(Walk back)

997
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:10,120
(Choose SUNNY?)

998
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, SUNNY?

999
00:44:12,288 --> 00:44:13,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

1000
00:44:13,472 --> 00:44:15,040
- RUSAMEEKAE: I guessed it right.
- MARIO: Hey!

1001
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:16,640
(Or MATHEUS?)

1002
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,440
MARIO: Wow.

1003
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,480
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh my God.

1004
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:26,320
(Knock, knock)

1005
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,160
LOVE(X)PERT: SUNNY?

1006
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,280
- CRIS: Plot twist! Game-changer!
- RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1007
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

1008
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,560
JANEYEH: I've got goosebumps.

1009
00:44:39,648 --> 00:44:40,192
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1010
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:41,169
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

1011
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,040
NAMNUNG: I've decided that it's just...

1012
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,840
NAMNUNG: the two of us.

1013
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,880
- RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.
- TIMETHAI: Ouch.

1014
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,240
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh!

1015
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,600
LOVE(X)PERT: Aw, so sweet.

1016
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:56,544
(NAMNUNG chose MATHEUS)

1017
00:44:58,106 --> 00:45:00,564
MATHEUS: Okay, alright.

1018
00:45:02,272 --> 00:45:04,120
- MATHEUS: Just you and me?
- NAMNUNG: Yeah.

1019
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,440
MATHEUS: Okay. Much appreciated.

1020
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,912
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

1021
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,017
LOVE(X)PERT: These two
really fit well together.

1022
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,880
(Eye contact)
LOVE(X)PERT: Hey, wow.

1023
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:16,970
MATHEUS: I'll see you later.

1024
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,432
NAMNUNG: See you.

1025
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,520
MATHEUS: See you.

1026
00:45:26,906 --> 00:45:28,288
(Happy)

1027
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,640
LOVE(X)PERT: MATHEUS
isn't done with dressing up.

1028
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,280
LOVE(X)PERT: It's funny
to go with this outfit.

1029
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:38,208
(Hot)

1030
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:40,672
(So shy)
JANEYEH: Yeah, hot.

1031
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:43,404
TIMETHAI: Come on, man! Let's go!

1032
00:45:44,154 --> 00:45:44,935
TIMETHAI: Man, let's go.

1033
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,828
RUSAMEEKAE: Why did NAMNUNG
end up inviting MATHEUS?

1034
00:45:47,898 --> 00:45:49,400
(Why did NAMNUNG
end up inviting MATHEUS?)

1035
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,680
MARIO: I think MATHEUS
opened his heart to NAMNUNG first.

1036
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,080
(Strongly agree)
JANEYEH: Yes.

1037
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,680
JANEYEH: She wants to try opening up
to someone who likes her first.

1038
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,840
(Agree)
MARIO: That's fair.

1039
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,560
- JANEYEH: I think NAMNUNG's upset to see TIME talking to SUNNY.
- CRIS: SUNNY.

1040
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,480
RUSAMEEKAE: But even if she's upset,
she has to realize that...

1041
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,880
RUSAMEEKAE: If she doesn't choose him,

1042
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,640
(If TIME get to stay with SUNNY for this, what will you do?)
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME will be with SUNNY without her, right?

1043
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,064
CRIS: We have to have our pride, right?
He didn't choose me. Why should I choose him?

1044
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,592
(I don't care)
CRIS: He doesn't care, and I'm this pretty.

1045
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:19,676
(Agree)
JANEYEH: Yes.

1046
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,920
TIMETHAI: But choosing anyone seems like
starting a war, whether it's SUNNY, TIME or TOD.

1047
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,840
(Headache)

1048
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,600
CRIS: If I were NAMNUNG,

1049
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,000
CRIS: I'd choose someone else
who isn't SUNNY, TIME, TOD.

1050
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,200
(Make a bold move)
TIMETHAI: So you won't feel guilty.

1051
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,760
CRIS: You could choose JUNSU.

1052
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,960
CRIS: Just go the funny way.

1053
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,280
JANEYEH: Just enjoy it.

1054
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,080
CRIS: Just enjoy it.

1055
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,440
(If choosing anyone is the same...)

1056
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,520
MARIO: just choose TOD.

1057
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,680
MARIO: Just support TOD.

1058
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,080
(His feeling hasn't changed)

1059
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,240
(Wait)
TIMETHAI: No, if you choose TOD...

1060
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:50,520
(TOD)
CRIS: It would hurt him again.

1061
00:46:50,656 --> 00:46:52,080
JANEYEH: You're giving him hope.

1062
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:54,304
(Getting ganged up on!)

1063
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:57,472
(X-Land)

1064
00:46:57,888 --> 00:47:00,320
- RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.
- JANEYEH: So beautiful.

1065
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:06,560
- MARIO: Hey, there's a leg massage.
- JANEYEH: Hey, hey.

1066
00:47:09,984 --> 00:47:11,520
JANEYEH: A lot of things just happened.

1067
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,928
RUSAMEEKAE: Could that have happened
behind the scenes?

1068
00:47:17,946 --> 00:47:19,450
(MATHEUS arrives)

1069
00:47:32,096 --> 00:47:33,632
TIMETHAI: Oh, it looks so delicious.

1070
00:47:33,632 --> 00:47:34,831
JANEYEH: Someone's hungry now.

1071
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:47,866
(Waiting)

1072
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:51,040
MARIO: Where is NAMNUNG?

1073
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,920
(Smile)
JANEYEH: Wow.

1074
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,632
CRIS: So cute. Very beautiful.

1075
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,240
MATHEUS: Welcome.

1076
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,720
NAMNUNG: Hello.

1077
00:48:14,464 --> 00:48:16,000
MATHEUS: Come, come.

1078
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,880
NAMNUNG: I'm good.

1079
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,560
MATHEUS: Look.

1080
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,080
MATHEUS: How beautiful.

1081
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,520
NAMNUNG: I'm glad it's just
the two of us, not three.

1082
00:48:27,552 --> 00:48:28,120
MATHEUS: Yeah.

1083
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,560
MATHEUS: Please.

1084
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,440
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

1085
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,320
(Take care)
JANEYEH: You got the scene.

1086
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,200
MATHEUS: Alright?

1087
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,080
MATHEUS: We have a nice view.

1088
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,480
- MATHEUS: Well, it's a bit dark, but
- NAMNUNG: Yeah.

1089
00:48:43,322 --> 00:48:45,024
(Looking)

1090
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,432
MATHEUS: Cheers.

1091
00:48:46,432 --> 00:48:48,040
MATHEUS: This is just water but...

1092
00:48:48,448 --> 00:48:49,880
- NAMNUNG: Cheers.
- MATHEUS: Cheers.

1093
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,640
RUSAMEEKAE: But it's fine.
Let's see how it goes.

1094
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,560
MATHEUS: We are allowed to talk
about anything, apparently.

1095
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:58,934
NAMNUNG: Yeah.

1096
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,080
MATHEUS: So like we can literally

1097
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,808
MATHEUS: bomb each other questions.

1098
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:05,760
MATHEUS: No boundaries.

1099
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,876
RUSAMEEKAE: You can ask anything
with no boundaries.

1100
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,000
NAMNUNG: Why did you choose me?

1101
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,552
- RUSAMEEKAE: Here she comes.
- TIMETHAI: Here she comes.

1102
00:49:12,064 --> 00:49:15,136
JANEYEH: Amazing, you got it.

1103
00:49:15,136 --> 00:49:17,728
- TIMETHAI: So smooth.
- JANEYEH: So good at playing game.

1104
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:20,880
- TIMETHAI: If he can't keep up, done.
- CRIS: If it was you?

1105
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:23,008
(Fine, I give up)
- CRIS: Done. - TIMETHAI: I'm dead.

1106
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,280
NAMNUNG: Why did you choose me?

1107
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,864
(Ask first)

1108
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,448
MATHEUS: In the first place,

1109
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,600
MATHEUS: well, I chose you because
I know like

1110
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,240
MATHEUS: you have something
sparkle in your eyes.

1111
00:49:37,504 --> 00:49:38,440
(Your eyes are sparkling)

1112
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,680
CRIS: Your eyes are sparkling.

1113
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,992
MATHEUS: During the teamwork
on the water,

1114
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,840
MATHEUS: it was like
we can support each other to exercise.

1115
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,240
MATHEUS: It's definitely it.
So I wanted to know you better.

1116
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,264
(I wanted to know you better)

1117
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:04,560
NAMNUNG: That's how I feel too.

1118
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,632
(The same feeling)

1119
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,184
MATHEUS: Right?

1120
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:11,912
CRIS: So beautiful.

1121
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:12,832
RUSAMEEKAE: Very beautiful.

1122
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:15,712
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm blushing.

1123
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:22,640
MATHEUS: You look very mature.

1124
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,880
MATHEUS: So you must be...

1125
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,480
MATHEUS: Let's say like 20?

1126
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,368
MATHEUS: 23.

1127
00:50:31,008 --> 00:50:32,704
- JANEYEH: You guys don't know the age?
- TIMETHAI: You guys don't know the age?

1128
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:33,536
(20 years old)
NAMNUNG: 20.

1129
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:36,846
- JANEYEH: So young.
- TIMETHAI: Oh, bro.

1130
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,600
MATHEUS: Okay.

1131
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,744
(24 years old)
MATHEUS: So 4 years difference.

1132
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,264
- CRIS: 24?
- RUSAMEEKAE: He is older.

1133
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,920
NAMNUNG: What do you do for work?

1134
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,024
MATHEUS: What do I work?

1135
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,320
MATHEUS: I work for my family business.

1136
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,072
NAMNUNG: Oh yeah?

1137
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:01,440
MATHEUS: Which is based in Europe.

1138
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:01,824
JANEYEH: Wow.

1139
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:03,960
MATHEUS: Mainly in Europe,

1140
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,336
MATHEUS: but also
a new division in Asia,

1141
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,000
MATHEUS: which is a real estate

1142
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,160
MATHEUS: and finance private equity.

1143
00:51:12,576 --> 00:51:14,752
JANEYEH: Oh, her eyes are sparkling now.

1144
00:51:15,211 --> 00:51:16,928
(Tapping fingers)

1145
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:23,392
(Looking)
TIMETHAI: Started to change her mind.

1146
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:26,464
NAMNUNG: So, what are you doing
in Thailand?

1147
00:51:26,772 --> 00:51:27,813
JANEYEH: There it is.

1148
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,200
JANEYEH: Her eyes literally changed.

1149
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,064
MATHEUS: I chose Bangkok.
It's a good hub.

1150
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:35,520
MATHEUS: Because I'm pretty flexible
to go to any country.

1151
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,440
MATHEUS: To have a meeting like
Singapore or Shanghai.

1152
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,208
(Nods)
JANEYEH: Wow, very international.

1153
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:45,184
RUSAMEEKAE: He got a nice profile.

1154
00:51:45,184 --> 00:51:46,120
JANEYEH: Okay.

1155
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,392
MATHEUS: I guess you are

1156
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:52,864
MATHEUS: straight?

1157
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:55,776
JANEYEH: Oh, I guess you are straight.

1158
00:51:57,792 --> 00:52:00,240
- MATHEUS: Or bisexual?
- JANEYEH: Why're you asking that?

1159
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:01,537
NAMNUNG: Yeah.

1160
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,560
NAMNUNG: Bisexual.

1161
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,328
(Bisexual)
NAMNUNG: Bisexual.

1162
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,640
- JANEYEH: Oh.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

1163
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,376
TIMETHAI: Hey.

1164
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:06,867
MATHEUS: Bisexual. Oh, wow.

1165
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:10,336
TIMETHAI: Wow, so stressed
that he pressed his hands.

1166
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,496
- CRIS: I really like this generation.
- JANEYEH: Amazing.

1167
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,600
NAMNUNG: Actually I'm bisexual

1168
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,376
NAMNUNG: because I dated a girl once.

1169
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,008
JANEYEH: Oh.

1170
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:24,735
MATHEUS: Okay.

1171
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,200
MATHEUS: Maybe you're still looking,

1172
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,800
MATHEUS: discovering yourself.

1173
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,600
NAMNUNG: Are you bisexual?

1174
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:38,944
- JANEYEH: Nice, I'm curious too.
- TIMETHAI: Asking what I want to know.

1175
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,680
MATHEUS: No, I'm not.

1176
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,120
MATHEUS: I'm...

1177
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,976
CRIS: Straight?

1178
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:43,840
NAMNUNG: Straight?

1179
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,416
JANEYEH: What?

1180
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,680

What are you waiting for?

1324
01:01:25,658 --> 01:01:26,897

01:02:49,472 --> 01:02:51,720
TIMETHAI: You can really hear it.

1344
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,104
RUSAMEEKAE: I think he's excited too.

1345
01:03:03,616 --> 01:03:06,496
RUSAMEEKAE: But NAMNUNG
looks more in control.

1346
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,496
MATHEUS: I can see that green
is definitely your favorite color.

1347
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:22,080
NAMNUNG: Not like

1348
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,520
NAMNUNG: But green is my good color.

1349
01:03:27,008 --> 01:03:31,520
NAMNUNG:
But my actual favorite color is...

1350
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,560
NAMNUNG: Guess.

1351
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,120
TIMETHAI: But I like green now.

1352
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,864
MATHEUS: Red?

1353
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:42,600
NAMNUNG: Yeah.

1354
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,368
NAMNUNG: See.

1355
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,984
NAMNUNG: And my toes are also...

1356
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,768
(Lifting up)

1357
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:10,610
(Pull)

1358
01:04:11,937 --> 01:04:13,472
JANEYEH: Oh my God!

1359
01:04:14,372 --> 01:04:16,800
(Pull)

1360
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:17,728
JANEYEH: Crazy.

1361
01:04:23,328 --> 01:04:24,288
CRIS: Oops.

1362
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:25,400
JANEYEH: They're playing
with their toes now.

1363
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:26,320
CRIS: Holding the foot.

1364
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,032
- NAMNUNG: Same color.
- MATHEUS: It's beautiful.

1365
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,880
NAMNUNG: Thank you.

1366
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,200
TIMETHAI: The guy looks so nervous.

1367
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,680
TIMETHAI: Seems like the girl
is controlling the game.

1368
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:41,984
RUSAMEEKAE: The guy looks stiff.

1369
01:04:43,584 --> 01:04:45,344
CRIS: Oops, massaging the foot too.

1370
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:56,416
NAMNUNG: Do you want that wine?

1371
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,984
NAMNUNG: This glass is mine,
that one is yours.

1372
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,080
MATHEUS: Officially.

1373
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,904
- NAMNUNG: Officially. Cheers.
- MATHEUS: Cheers.

1374
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,520
JANEYEH: It's getting hot, isn't it?

1375
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,320
- TIMETHAI: Sweating.
- JANEYEH: Sweating a lot.

1376
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,928
MATHEUS: Tomorrow we have the next game.

1377
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,264
NAMNUNG: If you win,

1378
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,816
NAMNUNG: are you going to take me again?

1379
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:34,144
(Good question)

1380
01:05:34,144 --> 01:05:35,040
TIMETHAI: Wow, those questions.

1381
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,200
- CRIS: The question.
- MARIO: Oh, oh.

1382
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,808
CRIS: NAMNUNG, bravo.

1383
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,632
TIMETHAI: No way.
Is she really 20 years old?

1384
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,960
TIMETHAI: Did she come from a past life?

1385
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,920
(We're not the same)
MARIO: I was still playing toys at 20.

1386
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Haha.

1387
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:49,440
NAMNUNG: If you win,

1388
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:52,800
NAMNUNG: are you going to take me again?

1389
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,080
MATHEUS: Second round?

1390
01:06:03,808 --> 01:06:05,216
JANEYEH: What's going on here?

1391
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:09,344
(Wow wow wow)

1392
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,088
MARIO: Wow, still no answer.

1393
01:06:17,984 --> 01:06:19,000
TIMETHAI: Can't answer anymore.

1394
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,160
CRIS: The gesture.

1395
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,616
(Choose you)
MATHEUS: Choose you.

1396
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,080
MATHEUS: Choose you.

1397
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,488
MATHEUS: You chose me on the very first,

1398
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,120
MATHEUS: you know...
when I was sitting behind you.

1399
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Is this considered
as an agreement?

1400
01:06:39,264 --> 01:06:40,160
CRIS: Sort of.

1401
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:46,576
MARIO: Whoa, whoa!

1402
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,128
JANEYEH: Wow.

1403
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:53,792
MARIO: Pinch the calf.

1404
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,200
- MARIO: Hey.
- JANEYEH: Hey.

1405
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,520
MARIO: Pinching the calf means teasing.

1406
01:07:03,712 --> 01:07:05,400
MARIO: Wow, playing roses.

1407
01:07:16,096 --> 01:07:17,824
NAMNUNG: You're so funny.

1408
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:23,200
MARIO: Here we go.
He is serious now.

1409
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:25,472
TIMETHAI: Live my life for me please.

1410
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

1411
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,240
TIMETHAI: Proud of MATHEUS now.

1412
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,840
(So serious)
MARIO: Even asked him to live your life.

1413
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,120
TIMETHAI: Come on, just let me do that.

1414
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,160
(I'll leave it to you.)

1415
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,040
MARIO: At first, it seemed like
they didn't get along.

1416
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:41,960
MARIO: But later on, it fits so well.

1417
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,000
- TIMETHAI: Yeah.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

1418
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,544
JANEYEH: During dinner,
they looked very awkward.

1419
01:07:44,544 --> 01:07:47,680
JANEYEH: But after NAMNUNG asked

1420
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,576
JANEYEH: if he is straight

1421
01:07:48,576 --> 01:07:49,604
JANEYEH: or if he is bisexual,

1422
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:52,064
JANEYEH: and he said he's straight,
it's literally changed.

1423
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,540
RUSAMEEKAE: But don't jump
to conclusions yet.

1424
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,392
RUSAMEEKAE: We don't know
what's going to happen.

1425
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,784
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to know MATHEUS
can be entrusted with life or not,

1426
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,064
RUSAMEEKAE: let's go and see.

1427
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:01,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's continue to imagine.

1428
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,216
MARIO: Hey, hey, hey!

1429
01:08:10,368 --> 01:08:11,328
MARIO: Hey!

1430
01:08:13,888 --> 01:08:14,840
RUSAMEEKAE: There's a surprise.

1431
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,360
CRIS: What surprise now?

1432
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,736
JANEYEH: Ready, ready, ready, oh.

1433
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,248
RUSAMEEKAE: He's breathing so hard.

1434
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,368
JANEYEH: He's scratching his head.

1435
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,920
TIMETHAI: She's still so beautiful,
isn't she?

1436
01:08:30,048 --> 01:08:31,000
(Eye contact)
JANEYEH: So beautiful, right?

1437
01:08:33,632 --> 01:08:35,520
MATHEUS: You're so... 'Wow'.

1438
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:39,328
TIMETHAI: Oh, my God.

1439
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:43,136
(Shake it)

1440
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,120
TIMETHAI: Hey, hey, hey!

1441
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:48,280
JANEYEH: What's this about?

1442
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm shocked.
I thought he's gonna...

1443
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:55,232
(Cover)

1444
01:08:57,856 --> 01:08:58,688
MATHEUS: Okay.

1445
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,432
NAMNUNG: There's another game.

1446
01:09:02,432 --> 01:09:04,000
RUSAMEEKAE: The game isn't over yet.

1447
01:09:05,632 --> 01:09:06,784
(Look)

1448
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,152
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oops, he's laughing. What's going on?
- NAMNUNG: Isn't it a bit too much?

1449
01:09:14,368 --> 01:09:18,592
MATHEUS: Face to face,
forehead to forehead.

1450
01:09:19,136 --> 01:09:21,728
RUSAMEEKAE: Forehead to forehead.

1451
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,640
MATHEUS: And hold the position
for 30 seconds.

1452
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,808
- CRIS: Who could stand it for 30 seconds?
- RUSAMEEKAE: Right.

1453
01:09:31,808 --> 01:09:34,048
(Pillow game)
(Lie facing each other, hold foreheads together for 30 seconds.)

1454
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,808
TIMETHAI: Wow.

1455
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,480
MARIO: Oh, not sitting? Laying down?

1456
01:09:37,504 --> 01:09:38,520
JANEYEH: Yeah, laying down.

1457
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:40,960
- NAMNUNG: 30 seconds?
- MATHEUS: 30 seconds.

1458
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,312
JANEYEH: Wow.

1459
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,360
JANEYEH: Oh, pursing lips.

1460
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,200
CRIS: Forehead for 30 seconds.

1461
01:09:55,648 --> 01:09:57,504
(Hug)
MARIO: Oh, hold on.

1462
01:09:57,696 --> 01:09:59,200
(Hug)
MARIO: Oh, hold on.

1463
01:10:04,064 --> 01:10:05,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Forehead to forehead.

1464
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,280
JANEYEH: This is it.

1465
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,120
CRIS: Come on.

1466
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:16,352
(Scratch)
TIMETHAI: Oh.

1467
01:10:16,352 --> 01:10:17,440
JANEYEH: Wow.

1468
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't close your eyes!

1469
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,160
JANEYEH: Make it worth it!

1470
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,840
TIMETHAI: Oh, 30 seconds.

1471
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:30,144
TIMETHAI: Go for it, man!

1472
01:10:30,752 --> 01:10:32,224
(Tap)

1473
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,960
CRIS: The guy doesn't get it.
How can we go in first?

1474
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:38,560
TIMETHAI: Do it for the team, bro!

1475
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,440
NAMNUNG: 30 seconds!

1476
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,432
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

1477
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,856
NAMNUNG: It's been longer than that!

1478
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,776
MARIO: They're getting shy now.

1479
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,920
(Whisper in the ear)- JANEYEH: Oops.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1480
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,280
(Whisper in the ear)
JANEYEH: They're whispering.

1481
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,600
TIMETHAI: What did she say?

1482
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,880
NAMNUNG: You smell good.

1483
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,680
MATHEUS: Sorry.

1484
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,768
MATHEUS: You blew an air into my ear.

1485
01:11:30,144 --> 01:11:31,872
(Laugh)

1486
01:11:32,256 --> 01:11:33,920
NAMNUNG: I haven't said anything yet.

1487
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,680
NAMNUNG: Come here.

1488
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,920
MARIO: They're getting shy now.

1489
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,640
CRIS: They're really cute.

1490
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,920
MATHEUS: You have to draw something.

1491
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,304
MATHEUS: Dangerous.

1492
01:12:04,096 --> 01:12:08,928
(Wait! Not yet.) TIMETHAI: Hey, can't leave
the room right now. Hey, hey!

1493
01:12:09,152 --> 01:12:11,648
MATHEUS: Okay, turn off the lights.

1494
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,240
MATHEUS: Okay, turn off the lights.

1495
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,640
(Not enough) TIMETHAI: You're backing
out of the room. Hey!

1496
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,200
- MARIO: The lights are off.
- TIMETHAI: Hey, hey!

1497
01:12:16,672 --> 01:12:18,208
TIMETHAI: You can't leave the room
right now!

1498
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,696
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.
- MARIO: Whoo!

1499
01:12:21,696 --> 01:12:23,168
TIMETHAI: Where's my top camera, bro?

1500
01:12:28,672 --> 01:12:30,208
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, what a crazy game.

1501
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,616
RUSAMEEKAE: This is wonderful.
I want to go back to living like this.

1502
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,352
RUSAMEEKAE: Make a rough prediction
on the outcome of this couple's date.

1503
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,000
RUSAMEEKAE: How is it?
Do they click or not?

1504
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,080
JANEYEH: Totally captivated.

1505
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,400
(Agreeing) TIMETHAI: The guy is probably
falling for it right now.

1506
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,760
TIMETHAI: From my experience, he might
have liked this kind of thing before.

1507
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,288
MARIO: This is a soft version.

1508
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,840
TIMETHAI: Or is it a woman
who likes men like this?

1509
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,480
CRIS: It needs to be a bit more manly,
I think?

1510
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,680
CRIS: Yes, no matter
how strong a woman is,

1511
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,160
CRIS: the person
who can win her hearts

1512
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,360
CRIS: has to be

1513
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:06,816
CRIS: captivated!

1514
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:12,256
(Another perspective) MARIO: It seems like
they haven't had the chance to talk openly.

1515
01:13:12,256 --> 01:13:14,336
MARIO: It might be too fast too,
and he...

1516
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:19,648
MARIO: Everything happened so quickly.
He might be shy, right?

1517
01:13:19,648 --> 01:13:24,400
(Don't rush) MARIO: It might require
opening up first, having a chat.

1518
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,160
TIMETHAI: He's 24.
At 24, I was still clueless.

1519
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:32,896
RUSAMEEKAE: We just watched at X-Land
and saw everything that happened.

1520
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,400
- RUSAMEEKAE: The villa.
- CRIS: I want to know.

1521
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,304
- RUSAMEEKAE: The villa is still the same as always.
- CRIS: It's a mess, I'd say.

1522
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,736
MARIO: But maybe the villa is even
crazier than X-Land, could it be?

1523
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, because I believe
the audience want to watch too.

1524
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,880
RUSAMEEKAE: So, let's head back
to the villa now.

1525
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,160
CRIS: SUNNY and TIME.

1526
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,000
JANEYEH: Yeah.

1527
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,080
TIMETHAI: And what about TOD?

1528
01:13:56,096 --> 01:13:57,880
CRIS: The food here looks delicious,
to be honest.

1529
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,008
MARIO: Are you hungry, CRIS?

1530
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,400
LOVE(X)PERT: Here they come.

1531
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,320
TIME: Why is there a table and chairs
for everyone?

1532
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,880
JUNSU: Where is MATHEUS?

1533
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,280
TIME: F4, the four guys.

1534
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,800
JUNSU: Why are there five people?

1535
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,880
TIME: Yes, I'm wondering.

1536
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,320
JUNSU: Isn't NAMNUNG with MATHEUS?

1537
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,600
- CRIS: JUNSU's cute.
- JANEYEH: JUNSU remembers.

1538
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,040

1539
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,680
JUNSU: Or new... new people?

1540
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1541
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,280
- TOD: Someone new
- TIME: Oh, someone new.

1542
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,560
TOD: Is there someone new coming in?

1543
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,840
JANEYEH: Is there someone new?

1544
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:41,920
TIME: Only one person.

1545
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,224
CRIS: A new character?

1546
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,800

- MARIO: Hey!

1547
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,400
CRIS: That's crazy.

1548
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,040
ASSE: Long hair.

1549
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,560

TIMETHAI: Hey!

1555
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,880
TIME: It might be SUNNY.

1556
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,880
CRIS: It's not SUNNY.

1557
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:09,880

JANEYEH: Hey, can you not do this?

1575
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,992
CRIS: So harsh, really harsh.

1576
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,480

and now, this won't be shown either?
