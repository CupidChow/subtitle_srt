you want to go to X-Land with the most?

TIME: Okay, let me explain.

162
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,368
TIME: The reason I chose NAMNUNG is...

163
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,560
TIME: Because I feel like I don't need
to go to X-Land with you, SUNNY.

164

166

TIME: they're very clear.

167
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,488
TIME: I think X-Land is for those who

168
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
TIME: might not be sure if they like
the person. As for me.

169
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,872
TIME: That I went there yesterday made
me realize that it's...

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,192
TIME: It's not about where we go,
it's about who we go with.

171
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,008

it's about who we go with."

172
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,120
SUNNY: But the person you want to
go with is not me anyway.

173
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:27,168
CRIS: Done.

174
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:31,264
TIME: Did you listen to what I speak?

175
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,376
- SUNNY: I am listening.
- TIME: No.

176
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,128
RUSAMEEKAE: The answer's not clear.

177
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,200
JANEYEH: Yeah, the answer's not clear.

178
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,408
SUNNY: You said it depends on
the person you go with.

179
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:42,912
TIME: No, I mean, okay.

180
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,600
TIME: The reason I chose NAMNUNG

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,720
TIME: is that a part of me may be into
her, just wanna see if I like her.

182
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,840
SUNNY: Uh-huh.

183
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:56,720
TIME: But now, I don't have to
go to X-Land with you.

184
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,200
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oh?
- CRIS: Oh?

185
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:00,896
TIME: Because I know
I fall for you, SUNNY.

186
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:01,760
ALL: Huh?

187
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,320
CRIS: Coach, did you secretly teach
him this or what?

188
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,832
TIME: Because I know
I fall for you, SUNNY.

189
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:06,480
(Nod)

190
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,000
CRIS: Oh.

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh!

192
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,512
TIME: Is it clear now?

193
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,184
SUNNY: Yes.

194
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,952
TIME: Okay.

195
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:12,560
CRIS: She may not believe this right away,
but she probably enjoys the date.

196
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,000
TIME: Yesterday was the first day
I got to a hundred coins.

197
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,688
TIME: So, yeah, I get to go on a date
or something like that.

198
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,200
TIME: I've been clear all along,
you've never truly believed me.

199
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
SUNNY: I don't know.

200
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,216
TIME: Are you serious?

201
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,008
SUNNY: Yeah.

202
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,080
PEANUT: Here's my view.

203
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,120
(Bottled up)
PEANUT: Yesterday's question had 'wanna go.'

204
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,920
PEANUT: So why he didn't answer 'SUNNY'
from the start?

205
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,104
PEANUT: If he's always clear, then
he had to choose SUNNY.

206
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:43,320
JANEYEH: Yes, he's clear, but he also
wants to try it with NAMNUNG.

207
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,160
JANEYEH: So it's like...

208
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,680
CRIS: He's telling SUNNY that
he doesn't have to go with her,

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,760
CRIS: because he's sure he likes SUNNY.

210
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
RUSAMEEKAE: But there's one question
I want to know.

211
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Would SUNNY believe him?

212
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,720
(Quick response)
JANEYEH: No.

213
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Hahaha.

214
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,512
RUSAMEEKAE: "No"... she's like "No."

215
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:58,112
(Didn't accept love until losing it)

216
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,008
(Thinking)

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,760
JANEYEH: Wow.

218
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:06,656
CRIS: Oh.

219
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,080
JANEYEH: Whoa, timing.

220
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,800
JANEYEH: What's the point of
moving the shoulders?

221
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:16,360
(Thinking)

222
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
TIME: So yesterday...

223
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
TIME: I sat and thought to myself...

224
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,240
TIME: It's been five days now.

225
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,848
TIME: We haven't really talked at all.
We've hardly talked to each other.

226
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,720
TIME: And I am just...

227
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,040
TIME: shocked that...

228
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
TIME: How do I feel so much like this?

229
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
CRIS: Oh.

230
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,120
TIME: Even if we haven't talked much
or spent much time together.

231
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,360
SUNNY: Yeah.

232
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,160
TIME: The reason I didn't talk to you
these past days is...

233
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,232
TIME: If I'm being honest,
if I could choose,

234
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,336
TIME: I would talk to you
all day and night.

235
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:59,840
TIME: But as I said, I don't want others
to feel like we're being tied down.

236
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:04,560
TIME: That's why I chose
to keep my distance.

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,080
TIME: This is intentional.

238
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
TIME: If I could choose,
I'd always be by your side.

239
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
RUSAMEEKAE: He doesn't want
to act possessive.

240
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Taking the car like this.

241
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,200
CRIS: Jot it down.

242
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,424
PEANUT: Just a few sweet words
and you have lost it, CRIS.

243
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,640
CRIS: Yeah, right, it's a mess.

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,560
TIME: Let's do it this way.

245
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,080
TIME: Let's go on a date first.

246
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,880
TIME: And then,

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,960
TIME: maybe for two or three days,

248
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,080
TIME: feel free to talk
with other people.

249
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,440
TIME: Try dating, try anything.

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,920
TIME: And after that,

251
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:41,408
TIME: if you still have feelings for me,

252
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,104
TIME: just come and tell me.

253
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,200
TIME: Okay?

254
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,760
SUNNY: I think our thoughts
are very similar.

255
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:51,264
JANEYEH: She's just like this too.

256
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,760
(Smiling)

257
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,120
TIME: What I've wanted to do
for a long time is

258
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
TIME: just sit and talk with you.

259
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,320
TIME: We don't need anything else.

260
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,560
TIME: No X-Land, no hotel,

261
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,848
TIME: no delicious food.

262
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:12,960
TIME: Just us, sitting somewhere

263
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,040
TIME: and talking.

264
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:15,616
TIME: That's enough to make me happy.

265
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,840
TIME: I've wanted to do this
for a long time.

266
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,528
SUNNY: I like it this way.

267
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,544
SUNNY: I like it this way.

268
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,368
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

269
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,000
JANEYEH: What is this?

270
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:29,792
TIME: I don't know what else
you see from me.

271
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:34,112
SUNNY: I believe you now,
believe you now, believe you now.

272
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
CRIS: I've never seen TIME blush,
yeah, it's nice.

273
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,040
CRIS: I believe him now,
really believe him.

274
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,120
JANEYEH: No, I wouldn't believe him.

275
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,000
CRIS: Or am I easily fooled by men?

276
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
CRIS: Because if this happens,
I'm gonna be a mess.

277
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,680
RUSAMEEKAE: This is Samui.

278
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,544
TIME: Let's go. Can you make it?

279
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,840
TIME: I'll pull you up.

280
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
JANEYEH: Whoa.

281
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,720
JANEYEH: Arm in arm.

282
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,480
JANEYEH: Wow.

283
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,888
SUNNY: Wow. What is it?

284
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,824
(Stargazing Cliff)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I've been there.

285
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,880
RUSAMEEKAE: And it's romantic too.

286
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,048
JANEYEH: A date that costs
a hundred shell coins.

287
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,520
TIME: Oh my god.

288
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,000
TIME: Oh my god, this is so perfect.

289
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,920
TIME: Can I shout?

290
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
TIME: Is this the sea?

291
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,840
SUNNY: I think so.

292
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,328
TIME: This is literally
what I've wanted.

293
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:41,720
- SUNNY: Really?
- TIME: Yeah.

294
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,384
TIME: I just sit with you and just talk.

295
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,880
CRIS: Suddenly, it gets so sweet.

296
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,800
JANEYEH: Beautiful.

297
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,280
- RUSAMEEKAE: Ooh, ooh.
- JANEYEH: Ooh, ooh, grab hair.

298
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
TIME: I'm about to eat.

299
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,480
TIME: Wanna try?

300
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,920
TIME: Here.

301
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,680
CRIS: Hey.

302
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,280
JANEYEH: Hey.

303
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,080
TIMETHAI: What tea is this?

304
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops, what tea is this?

305
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Looks very drinkable.

306
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,680
(Feeding)
CRIS: Oops.

307
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

308
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
JANEYEH: Yum yum.

309
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,688
- TIME: Is it sweet?
- SUNNY: No fruit for me?

310
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
CRIS: She's so cute.

311
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:28,480
TIME: For myself.

312
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:31,520
(Shy)

313
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
CRIS: It's mischievous in a way
I don't quite understand.

314
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,640
TIME: Do you think I'm that kind.

315
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,840
SUNNY: Well, sometimes I want to
think you're kind.

316
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,440
(Feeding fruit)

317
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,240
(Feeding fruit)
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

318
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,424
JANEYEH: There's some teasing.

319
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,040
PEANUT: Wicked.

320
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
SUNNY: Wow, what a character!

321
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
CRIS: He's cute.

322
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

323
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,280
CRIS: I've never seen
this version of TIME.

324
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,720
TIME: Delicious, want some more.

325
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,720
SUNNY: No more.

326
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,032
CRIS: See? Can you handle it?

327
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,160
TIME: Over the past games, you were
probably the athletic type.

328
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,840
SUNNY: Yeah, I'm an athlete. Yeah.

329
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,960
SUNNY: But no, I just don't like losing.

330
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
SUNNY: I want to win.

331
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,720
CRIS: See?

332
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,640
CRIS: Love to play, love playing games.

333
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,440
JANEYEH: Super awesome.

334
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,440
TIME: Yes.

335
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,480
SUNNY: But today, being with you,
probably distracted, so I didn't win.

336
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,400
TIME: This is like...

337
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,880
TIME: You know it's our first game?

338
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,960
TIME: It's the first game we played
together, and you just lost focus.

339
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,432
SUNNY: What?

340
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,360
TIME: You're not, like...

341
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,960
TIME: What were you thinking?

342
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,920
TIME: You didn't really focus.

343
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,280
SUNNY: I don't know, lost in your eyes.

344
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,400
(Lost in your eyes)
SUNNY: Lost in your eyes.

345
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,120
CRIS: How are you doing, TIME? Are you okay?
Can you handle meeting the tough one?

346
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,320
JANEYEH: Jot it down.

347
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,520
(A lot to learn)
PEANUT: Can't think of things like that.

348
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,880
CRIS: How does it feel as a man,
messed up yet?

349
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,840
TIMETHAI: Oh.

350
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,440
SUNNY: No, honestly.

351
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,040
SUNNY: I was looking in your eyes.

352
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
SUNNY: You didn't look back.

353
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,880
SUNNY: That's your problem.

354
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,168
TIME: Yes, I wanna win.

355
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,480
SUNNY: I want to win, but...

356
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:24,000
TIME: I just thought, hey,
we have to win, win.

357
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,440
SUNNY: Yes.

358
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,936
(Looking into the eyes)
JANEYEH: Oh.

359
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:32,576
CRIS: It's over.

360
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,960
TIMETHAI: Let's go, tiger.
Let's go, let's go.

361
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:44,080
CRIS: Never seen TIME being shy like this.

362
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,120
TIMETHAI: Playing with fingers now.

363
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,080
TIME: Thank you.

364
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,440
SUNNY: For what?

365
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,920
TIME: Just want to thank you
for making me feel this way.

366
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,744
(Thank you for making me feel this way)

367
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:00,480
JANEYEH: Wow.

368
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,640
TIME: I haven't felt like this
in a long time.

369
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,520
SUNNY: Really?

370
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,120
TIME: Thank you.

371
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:10,840
(Impressed)

372
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
JANEYEH: Lost to this style, huh?

373
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,992
(Looking)

374
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,840
TIME: Crazy.

375
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,760
SUNNY: Yeah.

376
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,560
TIME: Once we get here and look back
at day one, it all makes sense, right?

377
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,360
(Eye contact)
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah.

378
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,464
JANEYEH: Wow.

379
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:38,894
SUNNY: Yeah.

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,664
(Smiling)

381
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,560
CRIS: I understand you now, TIME.

382
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,280
TIMETHAI: He's not good with words,
but he loves wholeheartedly.

383
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:51,648
CRIS: For all the drama I caused,
in the previous episode,

384
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:54,208
CRIS: by calling him out. TIME's fans
have every right to come for me now.

385
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,288
(Misjudged)
CRIS: Now, it's like I give in. Okay.

386
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,472
JANEYEH: At first, we didn't get him.

387
00:16:57,472 --> 00:16:59,232
(Get it now) - JANEYEH: I get it now.
- CRIS: I get it now.

388
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:02,200
RUSAMEEKAE: But in the end, we watched...
So, we knew all along that TIME was...

389
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,584
RUSAMEEKAE: He is... Indeed, he is...

390
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,480
RUSAMEEKAE: He is sincere.

391
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,376
RUSAMEEKAE: He's warm.

392
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,528
CRIS: Really?

393
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,616
JANEYEH: Really?

394
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:09,760
CRIS: Really.

395
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,720
CRIS: Really.

396
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,200
TIMETHAI: Turned back. The tire blew.

397
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:13,472
TIMETHAI: The tire blew.

398
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:17,472
TIME: Yeah.

399
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:20,448
TIME: Stars.

400
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,952
SUNNY: Are there?

401
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,960
TIME: There are some.

402
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,440
- CRIS: Stars.
- JANEYEH: Stars.

403
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,592
TIME: Come here.

404
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:30,080
CRIS: Well.

405
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,296
(Oh, boy)
CRIS: Oops!

406
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:33,568
CRIS: You.

407
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,800
PEANUT: Sneaky.

408
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,760
TIME: Over there.

409
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,600
TIME: One.

410
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,280
TIME: See it?

411
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:43,424
(Moving closer)

412
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,408
SUNNY: Where? I see three.

413
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,040
CRIS: Close up.

414
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,152
TIMETHAI: Let's go.

415
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,040
TIME: Over there.

416
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,456
- SUNNY: Yeah, I see that one.
- TIME: One.

417
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:52,386
TIME: Two.

418
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,528
CRIS: Wow!

419
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,800
SUNNY: See it. I see it.

420
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:03,552
TIME: 3.

421
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,760
TIME: 4.

422
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
TIME: 5.

423
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,760
TIME: 6.

424
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,920
TIME: 7.

425
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:22,240
JANEYEH: Oh.

426
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:26,840
SUNNY: There are eight stars over there.

427
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,880
PEANUT: Just sniffed sneakily.

428
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,968
TIME: You should move over there.

429
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:33,021
SUNNY: Wait a minute.

430
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,168
SUNNY: Oh, what?

431
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,432
TIME: No, I didn't talk about it.
Just move over there.

432
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
CRIS: Oh!

433
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,208
- JANEYEH: So intense.
- CRIS: So intense.

434
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:54,144
CRIS: MVP SUNNY. You're fabulous.

435
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,960
RUSAMEEKAE: No, the heart trembles.

436
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,168
(What will you do?)

437
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:05,856
CRIS: What happened!

438
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,960
TIME: I can control myself.

439
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,656
TIME: But I don't know

440
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:11,232
TIME: if you can.

441
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:12,256
SUNNY: I can.

442
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,080
CRIS: Too intense.

443
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
TIMETHAI: I don't wanna control, bro.

444
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,872
TIMETHAI: Just go.

445
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,160
(No need to control)
TIMETHAI: I don't want to control anything.

446
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:19,488
(Restraint)
CRIS: Control.

447
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:20,544
(Restraint)
CRIS: Control.

448
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
SUNNY: Very good.

449
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,920
CRIS: The guy said he can't take it
and moved aside first.

450
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,194
TIME: No worry.

451
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:37,960
(Hands clasped together)

452
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,288
- JANEYEH: Wow!
- PEANUT: Yo, man.

453
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:44,128
PEANUT: Look at SUNNY's gaze.

454
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:47,200
RUSAMEEKAE: But cute, right?
Chemistry works well, right?

455
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,872
RUSAMEEKAE: I really want to jump
into the TV right now.

456
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:54,287
TIME: Okay, you keep doing this, though.

457
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,648
SUNNY: Doing what?

458
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:56,520
SUNNY: Self-control.

459
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,184
TIME: Okay.

460
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,712
PEANUT: Self-control.

461
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,440
- JANEYEH: Oh!
- PEANUT: Oh, she's caressing his hand.

462
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,000
CRIS: Very good, SUNNY.

463
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,680
TIME: The lights
are really beautiful, right?

464
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,120
SUNNY: You're distracting yourself,
aren't you?

465
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,880
JANEYEH: Just change the topic.

466
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,448
RUSAMEEKAE: See? He's trying
to control himself.

467
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:21,957
TIME: What's tomorrow gonna be like?

468
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,416
SUNNY: X-Land.

469
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:24,928
SUNNY: For sure.

470
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:27,400
TIME: No, actually, let's go.

471
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,696
TIMETHAI: Let's go.

472
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,320
SUNNY: You want to do something
under the blanket, don't you?

473
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:36,384
JANEYEH: Oh my god!

474
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,536
RUSAMEEKAE: She's on another level.

475
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,256
JANEYEH: She's over the top.

476
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,440
SUNNY: You want to do something
under the blanket, don't you?

477
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:48,480
TIME: Can I?

478
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,056
RUSAMEEKAE: That's SUNNY.

479
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,288
SUNNY: No, I think, we have like...

480
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,512
SUNNY: Too many cameras.

481
00:20:58,512 --> 00:20:59,008
TIME: Yeah.

482
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,520
SUNNY: I've said it's dangerous.
I mentioned it many times.

483
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,920
TIME: Dangerous.

484
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,584
RUSAMEEKAE: Dangerous.

485
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,976
CRIS: SUNNY is no joke either!
She's flammable.

486
00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:13,600
CRIS: High voltage as well.

487
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:15,104
JANEYEH: Wow.

488
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,600
TIMETHAI: They're like fire
and gasoline right now.

489
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
JANEYEH: Totally.

490
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,448
CRIS: The chemistry
between TIME and SUNNY is great.

491
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,536
RUSAMEEKAE: They're onto each other.

492
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,560
JANEYEH: Totally.

493
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,456
RUSAMEEKAE: Are you curious to see
what will happen between TIME and SUNNY?

494
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:36,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Find out after the break.

495
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,792
CRIS: Oh, no!

496
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,584
TIMETHAI: Hold on!

497
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:42,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Just kidding.
Let's go see what happens.

498
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,888
CRIS: Oh, Koh Samui is so beautiful.

499
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,400
SUNNY: You're kinda cute.

500
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:51,616
JANEYEH: Oh, my.

501
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,568
JANEYEH: "You're kinda cute."

502
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,792
RUSAMEEKAE: Move forward, and then...

503
00:21:58,048 --> 00:21:59,008
JANEYEH: Have to tilt a bit.

504
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:05,120
SUNNY: I want to know about NITHI.

505
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,400
- JANEYEH: Hey!
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

506
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,320
RUSAMEEKAE: His name is NITHI, TIME.

507
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:11,232
CRIS: Oh.

508
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,064
TIME: Okay, I was born in Thailand,
in Khon Kaen.

509
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,496
TIME: But I moved to America
since childhood.

510
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,840
- TIME: One or two years old.
- SUNNY: Is it Texas?

511
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:20,610
TIME: Yeah.

512
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:26,848
TIME: My parents separated,
so I moved back to live with Mom.

513
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,400
TIME: From grade school
to a long while. Yeah.

514
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:35,160
TIME: It was a one-bedroom apartment.

515
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,800
TIME: Mom was in the bedroom.
I was crashing on the living room floor.

516
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,200
SUNNY: Uh-huh.

517
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,800
CRIS: Uh-huh.

518
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:43,392
TIME: I continued living with Mom.

519
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,256
TIME: And after that,
I graduated in 2019.

520
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,320
SUNNY: Yeah.

521
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,064
TIME: I got a good job.

522
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,120
TIME: It was the first time that Mom
and I had money to spend like that.

523
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
TIME: I took Mom traveling
here and there.

524
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,096
TIME: Ate at fine restaurants for the first time.
The first time in life having that kind of moment.

525
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:07,648
TIME: And every Friday
had to hang out with Mom.

526
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,600
SUNNY: I can tell
you really love your mom.

527
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:11,328
TIME: Yeah, I really love my Mom.

528
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:12,896
JANEYEH: Oh.

529
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,248
TIME: I'm getting emotional.

530
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:18,528
SUNNY: Oh, it's okay.

531
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,344
SUNNY: No, I'm so...

532
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,560
SUNNY: grateful that

533
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,680
SUNNY: you're telling me your story.

534
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,480
TIME: Okay, give me a second.

535
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:32,400
CRIS: Talking deeply like this
with someone else.

536
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,040
CRIS: Feels more intimate
than making out or anything for me.

537
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,536
JANEYEH: That's true.

538
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,120
TIME: I worked for about a year,
from 2019 to around April 2020.

539
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,960
TIME: Mom got cancer.

540
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,456
JANEYEH: Oh, my God!

541
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,376
TIME: End-stage cancer.

542
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,648
TIME: And at that time it was like...

543
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,880
TIME: Yeah, I couldn't believe
it was happening to me.

544
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,920
TIME: It was...

545
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:27,968
TIME: 'Cause it was definitely
the hardest time

546
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:28,720
TIME: in my life.

547
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,800
JANEYEH: Oh, I feel for him.

548
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:31,880
CRIS: That's too much.

549
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,920
TIME: I thought that it would be fine.
It would pass eventually.

550
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:43,760
TIME: At that time, Mom couldn't breathe
on her own and had to be intubated.

551
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,864
TIME: And the way we communicated
was Mom would write, and I would respond.

552
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,760
TIME: It was the first time Mom said,

553
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,800
TIME: "Is it this bad?"

554
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:00,060
JANEYEH: Oh, dear.

555
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:05,800
TIME: And I had to be strong all the time
because I didn't want Mom to feel...

556
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,160
SUNNY: Uh-huh.

557
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,080
CRIS: That's so sad.

558
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:13,480
TIME: I just wanted Mom to feel
there's still hope.

559
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,560
TIME: I told Mom, "It would be fine."

560
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,984
TIME: "We just had to go back to living
as usual, and it would pass eventually."

561
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:28,120
TIME: The second day.

562
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,545
TIME: Thanks.

563
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:31,680
TIME: It's passed.

564
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,424
TIME: When it reached the third day.

565
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,216
TIME: Around 8 or 9 PM,
I went outside for a little while.

566
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:51,080
TIME: I was spending time by myself
and the nurse came to me.

567
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,280
TIME: She told me to stay with Mom
since her heartbeat was slowing down.

568
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,728
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, dear.

569
00:25:58,387 --> 00:25:59,395
JANEYEH: Oh, dear.

570
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,288
TIME: That sentence.

571
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,512
TIME: I never thought
I would hear that sentence.

572
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,120
TIME: I went into the room.

573
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
TIME: I told Mom that,

574
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,056
TIME: "I'm sorry about the past
where I might have made mistakes."

575
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:28,468
TIME: "I haven't been
a particularly good child or anything."

576
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:34,560
TIME: "And thank you
for raising me all this time."

577
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:37,568
TIME: And that...

578
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,720
TIME: "I will keep going."

579
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,480
TIME: After that, she passed away.

580
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,720
CRIS: Oh, my God.

581
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:57,760
SUNNY: Sorry.

582
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:00,320
SUNNY: So she's proud of you now.

583
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,496
RUSAMEEKAE: He's
a gentle-hearted person.

584
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,584
RUSAMEEKAE: He's very delicate.

585
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,280
RUSAMEEKAE: I think he probably wants
SUNNY to know his true self.

586
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,968
RUSAMEEKAE: It takes a certain level
of trust to open up about stuff like this.

587
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,536
JANEYEH: Yeah, he's very strong.

588
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,352
SUNNY: Thank you
for sharing your story with me.

589
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,960
TIME: It's been four years,
but I still miss her every single day.

590
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
CRIS: I feel for him.

591
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,400
RUSAMEEKAE: It's heartbroken.

592
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,408
TIME: Hmm... It's an important moment,

593
00:27:57,408 --> 00:28:02,112
TIME: because it taught me many things
and made me grow up really fast.

594
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,680
TIME: Since I have no siblings, it's just
Mom and I. When Mom passed away,

595
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:16,736
TIME: I felt like I had no purpose
in life, not knowing what to do or how.

596
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Heartbroken.

597
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,760
TIME: If you ask me

598
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,952
TIME: if it's gotten better nowadays,
yes, it has.

599
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,848
- TIME: Life is incredibly short.
- SUNNY: It's sad, isn't it?

600
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,528
TIME: Yes, so I will live life

601
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,720
TIME: to the fullest every day.
Always try to stay in the moment.

602
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:38,920
TIME: Because we never know
what tomorrow might bring, right?

603
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,416
CRIS: I understand him now.

604
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,472
JANEYEH: I understand now.

605
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:41,952
CRIS: See?

606
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:42,720
JANEYEH: Can you forgive me?

607
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,560
RUSAMEEKAE: He needs clarity.
He's cautious. That's why he likes SUNNY.

608
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,952
RUSAMEEKAE: This might be one reason why
he likes SUNNY. He's very meticulous.

609
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,440
PEANUT: I'm starting
to understand TIME better.

610
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,219
PEANUT: When you've been
through something difficult,

611
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:11,120
PEANUT: it changes you.
You learn to think before you act.

612
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,280
PEANUT: I understand now.

613
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,960
PEANUT: It's me who thinks little.

614
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,000
PEANUT: It's me who thinks little.

615
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,888
JANEYEH: Sorry, I think very little now.

616
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,920
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME might have that playboy vibe,
but he has a heart and a vulnerable side too.

617
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,520
PEANUT: Yes.

618
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,672
RUSAMEEKAE: Now, as for the women, seeing his
vulnerable side, is it okay? How do you feel?

619
00:29:28,672 --> 00:29:30,720
JANEYEH: It's okay.
It helps us understand him.

620
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,016
JANEYEH: What he's been through.

621
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,984
JANEYEH: And he opens up to us like this.
It means he must really like the listener.

622
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:42,000
JANEYEH: It's really great. It's personal.
He probably wouldn't sit and tell anyone.

623
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,120
TIMETHAI: This is the worst thing
in his life.

624
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,800
TIMETHAI: Not saying
just to make her like him.

625
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:48,346
TIMETHAI: He wants her to really feel
what he's been through.

626
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,680
TIMETHAI: If she truly wants to know,
he can tell her.

627
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,760
CRIS: Uh-huh, I see.

628
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,456
RUSAMEEKAE: We all agree that the relationship
between these two has grown.

629
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,560
RUSAMEEKAE: But what we don't know yet
is whether NAMNUNG knows.

630
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,360
JANEYEH: Oh, wow.

631
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,472
CRIS: This is really tough.

632
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,384
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's go see
what happened at home.

633
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:07,890
TIME: Goodnight.

634
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:08,537
SUNNY: Goodnight.

635
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,984
RUSAMEEKAE: Got back. Get back home.

636
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:19,232
(Sneaking) CRIS: Oh, my God.
TOD is fast asleep.

637
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:20,280
JANEYEH: Completely asleep.

638
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:24,864
SUNNY: NAMNUNG.

639
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:27,168
(NAMNUNG isn't here)

640
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:28,064
CRIS: NAMNUNG isn't here.

641
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:29,792
(NAMNUNG isn't here)

642
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,880
PEANUT: Oh.

643
00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:45,632
SUNNY: NAMNUNG.

644
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,192
SUNNY: NAMNUNG.

645
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:50,320
(Where did NAMNUNG go?)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, where did NAMNUNG go?

646
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:53,984
(3 hours ago)

647
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:54,784
CRIS: Three hours ago.

648
00:30:58,499 --> 00:30:59,850
NAMNUNG: She's not here.

649
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

650
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,320
KONG: Where did SUNNY go?

651
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,312
NAMNUNG: Where did they go?

652
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,600
NAMNUNG: Where did those two go?

653
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:07,456
TOD: No idea.

654
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:08,320
NAMNUNG: Okay.

655
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,240
KONG: Seems like they went outside.

656
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,952
MATHEUS: You like surprises.

657
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:15,264
NAMNUNG: Oh.

658
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,920
MATHEUS: I think they're having a date.

659
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,640
CRIS: Why is MATHEUS instigating?

660
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,416
NAMNUNG: Such a suspicion.

661
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,464
MATHEUS: It is. Because we know every...

662
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
MATHEUS: corner in this house.

663
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,160
MATHEUS: And you don't find them.

664
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,552
NAMNUNG: I don't know.

665
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,696
MATHEUS: Maybe they chose
to secret date tonight.

666
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:36,224
RUSAMEEKAE: That mischievous MATHEUS.

667
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:37,632
TIMETHAI: He turned into
a bad guy suddenly.

668
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:39,489
MATHEUS: Chose to secret date tonight.

669
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,396
MATHEUS: TIME and SUNNY.

670
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,424
CRIS: See?

671
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,850
JANEYEH: MATHEUS.

672
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,352
NAMNUNG: I don't know.

673
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,880
NAMNUNG: Okay. See you later.

674
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,880
MATHEUS: That's alright. Okay.

675
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,576
MATHEUS: See you.

676
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,320
RUSAMEEKAE: It hits her a little.

677
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,560
RUSAMEEKAE: She definitely feels it.

678
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:16,416
(Thinking)

679
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:40,032
(Staring blankly)

680
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:43,008
(Staring)

681
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,880
CRIS: She can't sleep,
just tossing and turning.

682
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,360
CRIS: Where is she going?

683
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh,
I'm worried. I'm excited.

684
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:21,184
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, dear.

685
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,384
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG must be disappointed
that TIME and SUNNY went on a date.

686
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Probably feels indescribable, right?
I mean, they're friends, so...

687
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,200
RUSAMEEKAE: There are three or four of them
involved. It feels like a love triangle, doesn't it?

688
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,960
JANEYEH: She's looking for NAMNUNG.

689
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:01,760
SUNNY: NAMNUNG.

690
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,960
SUNNY: NAMNUNG.

691
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,680
SUNNY: What are you doing sitting alone?

692
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,464
CRIS: She found her.

693
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,800
SUNNY: What are you doing sitting alone?

694
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
- NAMNUNG: What?
- SUNNY: What are you doing sitting alone?

695
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,480
NAMNUNG: Is it SUNNY?

696
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,080
(Is it SUNNY?)

697
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,032
(Where did you go?)
NAMNUNG: Where did you go?

698
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:34,272
(Is it SUNNY? Where did you go?)
SUNNY: We came on a secret mission.

699
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,640
JANEYEH: Feel sour.

700
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,000
NAMNUNG: I don't know where you went.

701
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,520
NAMNUNG: I came out and didn't see you.

702
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,440
NAMNUNG: So...

703
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,752
SUNNY: Where does everyone think we went?

704
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,080
NAMNUNG: Everyone
thinks you went to X-Land.

705
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,720
SUNNY: How could I go without anything?

706
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
SUNNY: I haven't won anything yet.

707
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:51,440
(Silent)
JANEYEH: Oh, she's not talking.

708
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,560
SUNNY: They must've gone nuts
because TIME just said he's going to X-Land with you.

709
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,800
PEANUT: One talks too much,
and the other doesn't talk.

710
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,960
PEANUT: Yeah, don't know how to say.

711
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,400
CRIS: Ugh, I'm so confused now.

712
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,640
RUSAMEEKAE: But SUNNY's still
not telling her about it.

713
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,680
CRIS: Yeah.

714
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
TIMETHAI: It's so awkward.

715
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,224
RUSAMEEKAE: She won't tell her
anything at all?

716
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,560
CRIS: What do you want her to say?
I mean, if you were in SUNNY?

717
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,736
CRIS: It's so awkward, really.

718
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,240
JANEYEH: It feels like
there's still something left unsaid.

719
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,504
TIMETHAI: She probably
doesn't know why or how to tell her.

720
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,256
RUSAMEEKAE: Right,
but I really feel bad for NAMNUNG.

721
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
RUSAMEEKAE: I feel like
she feels more deeply than her.

722
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:40,160
(Turns to look)

723
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:46,800
(Turns to look)
RUSAMEEKAE: I feel sorry for SUNNY.

724
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Can she even sleep?

725
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,840
CRIS: It's so complicated.
My head hurts.

726
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,360
CRIS: Waah.

727
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,987
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME wanted to
go to X-Land with NAMNUNG,

728
00:36:17,987 --> 00:36:21,856
RUSAMEEKAE: she didn't know
where they went, so how would she feel?

729
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,480
TIMETHAI: NAMNUNG has been
hit with a lot now.

730
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:25,320
CRIS: That's true, NAMNUNG has
been pursued by several people.

731
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,146
CRIS: Considering her personality,
if she's chill like SUNNY,

732
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:33,280
CRIS: She must've moved on by now.
But she's a serious person.

733
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,730
RUSAMEEKAE: It's already affecting her.

734
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,840
RUSAMEEKAE: They are sleeping in the same room.
Now what? Can they even sleep?

735
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,960
TIMETHAI: They'll sleep,
but not soundly.

736
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:42,680
CRIS: So difficult!

737
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:49,920
(X Villa, next morning)
JANEYEH: Next Morning.

738
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:52,608
(Modern Villa)

739
00:36:54,784 --> 00:36:55,360
(Staring)

740
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,880
SUNNY: Was this taken in his bedroom?

741
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,680
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

742
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,280
SUNNY: So cute.

743
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,720
LOVE(X)PERT: NAMNUNG is great.
She stays so calm.

744
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,880
SUNNY: Today, TOD's asking someone
out on a date, since he has a hundred.

745
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:10,304
(Staring)

746
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:13,376
(Silent)

747
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,520
SUNNY: TIME also likes you.

748
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,880
- RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?
- LOVE(X)PERT: Huh?

749
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
LOVE(X)PERT: That's straightforward.
TIME told SUNNY.

750
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,440
NAMNUNG: No, I just feel like I wasn't
interested in him from the beginning.

751
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,760
SUNNY: Ah.

752
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:31,040
(Standing up)

753
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:50,272
(Staring)

754
00:37:50,272 --> 00:37:51,776
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, she is looking at it.

755
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,720
LOVE(X)PERT: Where is she going?

756
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:05,536
LOVE(X)PERT: Oops.

757
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:06,784
NAMNUNG: Hello!

758
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,952
(Staring)
RUSAMEEKAE: She's here to see MATHEUS.

759
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,960
KONG: Hello.

760
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,520
KONG: How is it going?

761
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,160
KONG: Did you sleep well?

762
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,600
NAMNUNG: No, I didn't go back to sleep.

763
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:17,360
MATHEUS: Are you okay?

764
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,656
(Concerned) - JANEYEH: Hey!
- TIMETHAI: It's like he knows.

765
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,808
NAMNUNG: Hmm, I'm good.

766
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:21,920
JANEYEH: "I'm good." That's
a very high-pitched tone.

767
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:23,840
(Nodding)

768
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,242
NAMNUNG: I'm good.

769
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:27,440
(Pouting)

770
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,640
RUSAMEEKAE: He's so cute, right?

771
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
CRIS: He's so cute, huh?

772
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,000
NAMNUNG: Hello!

773
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,440
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh.

774
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Is NAMNUNG starting
to be interested in MATHEUS?

775
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,080
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG.

776
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:39,616
KONG: But...

777
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,200
(Getting to the point)
KONG: But TOD looks so calm.

778
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,160
CRIS: Hey! He's asking them for advice.

779
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,480
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG,
are you anxious or something?

780
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,840
KONG: I'm asking
if you can tell who TOD likes.

781
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,000
JANEYEH: Oh, oh.

782
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,240
- NAMNUNG: I can't tell.
- KONG: Really?

783
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,104
- NAMNUNG: I can't tell at all.
- KONG: I can't tell either.

784
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
- MATHEUS: I can't tell who he likes.
- NAMNUNG: What?

785
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,496
NAMNUNG: It's TOD, right?

786
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:55,511
MATHEUS: Yes.

787
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,632
(Smiling)

788
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,760
NAMNUNG: I knew the first time
I met him.

789
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,680
NAMNUNG: Just go meet him.

790
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,160
NAMNUNG: Just go meet him.

791
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,480
KONG: I'm not brave enough.

792
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,200
NAMNUNG: I'll take you.

793
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,040
JANEYEH: "I'll take you!"

794
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,680
KONG: I don't dare
to walk or talk like...

795
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,640
NAMNUNG: I'll take you later.

796
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,480
JANEYEH: That's awesome.

797
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
JANEYEH: Oh, they haven't talked since.

798
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, yeah.

799
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,440
KONG: Where are you going?

800
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,720
NAMNUNG: Going to see SUNNY.

801
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:19,520
KONG: Okay.

802
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,600
NAMNUNG: Then I will see TOD.

803
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
MATHEUS: Going for observation.

804
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,560
(Peeking)
KONG: Go and try to ask him.

805
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,000
(Peeking)
NAMNUNG: Sure, sure.

806
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,080
(Peeking)
JANEYEH: So cute.

807
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,400
KONG: Great, I'll wait for the answer.

808
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,440
NAMNUNG: Okay then.

809
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,920
CRIS: Why didn't you go, KONG?

810
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,320
RUSAMEEKAE: No, he's shy.

811
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,536
- NAMNUNG: TOD.
- TOD: Yes.

812
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,296
- NAMNUNG: Oh, you're here?
- TOD: Yeah.

813
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:40,960
(TOD came out alone)

814
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,720
(Searching)

815
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,000
NAMNUNG: I don't see anyone at all.

816
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,680
CRIS: Hey.

817
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,976
RUSAMEEKAE: "I don't see anyone at all."

818
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,680
CRIS: Is NAMNUNG
going to see TOD or TIME?

819
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,000
NAMNUNG: But,

820
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,560
- NAMNUNG: I secretly found out yesterday.
- TOD: Hmm.

821
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,760
NAMNUNG: I just wanted to ask...

822
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,280
TOD: Hmm.

823
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,680
NAMNUNG: So, do you
have feelings for KONG or not?

824
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,192
JANEYEH: Hey!

825
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,760
NAMNUNG: I don't know.

826
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,760
TOD: Not at all.

827
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

828
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,360
JANEYEH: Then why did
you make KONG have feelings, TOD?

829
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,992
CRIS: It's so frustrating.

830
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,360
NAMNUNG: But I can't tell who you like.

831
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,040
CRIS: He likes you, oh no.

832
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,560
TOD: Ah.

833
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,080
NAMNUNG: Since the beginning
until now, I can't tell.

834
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,960
TOD: Really?

835
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,800
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

836
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,520
TOD: Is it because
I'm not being clear with anyone?

837
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,160
NAMNUNG: Yeah,
you seem kind to everyone, you know?

838
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,640
RUSAMEEKAE: He's kind to everyone.

839
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
PEANUT: Yes.

840
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,080
NAMNUNG: I don't feel
that you like anyone in particular.

841
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
JANEYEH: I really want
to know who TOD likes.

842
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
NAMNUNG: Hmm.

843
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
NAMNUNG: But I can't read your mind.
I can't tell.

844
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,576
RUSAMEEKAE: Who do you like, TOD?
Please don't.

845
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,920
TIMETHAI: It's like a bomb.

846
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,256
TOD: It's not hard at all.

847
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,560
- JANEYEH: Oh!
- CRIS: Oh!

848
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,256
JANEYEH: I'm getting mad now.

849
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,960
TIMETHAI: Hey, I wonder if there
will be a twist.

850
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,920
JANEYEH: So, turns out TOD likes TIME.

851
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,840
CRIS: TIME, yeah.

852
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,376
TOD: It's not hard at all.

853
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:12,768
(Pointing)
JANEYEH: What is he pointing at?

854
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:18,120
- JANEYEH: Pointing towards TIME?
- TIMETHAI: Really?

855
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,600
CRIS: Pointing towards TIME
in that room.

856
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,280
TIMETHAI: Does that mean
she can tell it?

857
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,840
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG
knows that TOD is with TIME.

858
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:26,600
TOD: TIME.

859
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:29,327
NAMNUNG: Oh, too obvious.

860
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,720
RUSAMEEKAE: He's walking
like invisible?

861
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,520
CRIS: Yeah, invisible. If he doesn't
want to talk, he doesn't talk.

862
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,800
NAMNUNG: Who can't tell?
You'd have to be blind.

863
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:41,312
(Too blunt)
TIMETHAI: Oh!

864
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,800
CRIS: TIME, you can leave now.
Take TIME out first, it's too chaotic.

865
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,320
CRIS: Conversation is over.

866
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:54,368
(Picking up a pillow)
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

867
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,672
TIMETHAI: Oh wow!

868
00:41:58,752 --> 00:41:59,808
(Ignoring)
RUSAMEEKAE: Ooh, he doesn't talk at all.

869
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,800
CRIS: Is it over?

870
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,880
RUSAMEEKAE: That's it?

871
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Wait,
what did NAMNUNG get for KONG?

872
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,280
JANEYEH: Nothing.

873
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,400
JANEYEH: Oh, she only found out
that TOD doesn't have feelings for KONG.

874
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,720
CRIS: Just knows there's nothing.
He doesn't care about him.

875
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,200
RUSAMEEKAE: How will
she tell her friend now?

876
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,552
PEANUT: KONG,
I think MATHEUS is pretty good, though.

877
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,480
TOD: Why don't you talk?

878
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
TIME: It's not about
what you're thinking.

879
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,200
TOD: Yeah, then why don't you talk?

880
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,120
TIME: It's completely different story.
I feel like she...

881
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,400
TOD: What?

882
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,400
TOD: How so?

883
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,320
TIME: I don't know, really.

884
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,120
TIME: But I feel like
he's upset or something.

885
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,240
JANEYEH: Well, of course he's upset.

886
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,400
TOD: Because she has
expectations of you.

887
00:42:45,248 --> 00:42:46,200
TIME: I don't know.

888
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,480
JANEYEH: She has to be upset.

889
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,400
TIME: And...

890
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,234
TIME: But I already said it's okay.
I still kind of suspect her, right?

891
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:56,760
TIME: There was never a moment where I didn't say,
like, "No, I'm not interested", you know?

892
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,160
TOD: Yeah.

893
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,280
TIME: Yesterday, during the game, it was obvious,
right? I like these two people.

894
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,280
TOD: Yeah, hmm.

895
00:43:03,136 --> 00:43:04,864
TOD: I saw it.

896
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:10,200
TIME: So I'm just confused, what did I do wrong?
Or is it just because I took SUNNY on a date?

897
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,440
CRIS: But NAMNUNG was really indifferent.
Did he really do something that wrong?

898
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,760
CRIS: They're not even a couple.

899
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,936
TIMETHAI: Yeah, they've only known
each other for five days.

900
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:16,640
CRIS: Yeah.

901
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,920
TOD: Maybe it's like
you didn't ask her first.

902
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,160
TIME: It's kind of like
when she went to X-Land with MATHEUS, right?

903
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,800
CRIS: True, that's true.

904
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Exactly.

905
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,880
TOD: No, she didn't even get to choose.

906
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,920
TOD: She said she didn't choose MATHEUS.

907
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,880
TOD: MATHEUS chose her
and she didn't know how to refuse.

908
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,320
TOD: She had no choice to refuse.

909
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:43,872
(Lowering his head)
CRIS: It's a total mess.

910
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
TOD: It's because
she had expectations of you, TIME.

911
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,640
TOD: I can tell,
she liked you from the start.

912
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,240
JANEYEH: Then what about you,
TOD, who do you like?

913
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:03,040
(Avoiding eye contact)
TIMETHAI: Just play the guitar.

914
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,888
PEANUT: Playing dumb.

915
00:44:05,888 --> 00:44:06,880
JANEYEH: Don't act dumb.

916
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,920
TIME: Why? Weren't you going to
take her with you?

917
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,400
TIME: I mean, I know you like her.

918
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,488
TOD: And I know that you like her too.

919
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:24,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

920
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,840
TIMETHAI: So you just end up
liking each other instead, just kidding.

921
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,240
TOD: I understand why you did this,
because I have reasons to support it.

922
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh!

923
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,304
TIME: I want you to be happy.

924
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,600
TOD: And I want you
to be happy too, TIME

925
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,440
PEANUT: Then why don't we try dating?

926
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,400
JANEYEH: Then why...

927
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,120
CRIS: Then why don't we try dating?

928
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,032
- TIME: No, no. I'm already happy.
- TOD: No.

929
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,400
TIME: Hey!

930
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
TOD: You can just do
what you want to do.

931
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,288
(Do what you want)

932
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:03,160
TOD: I don't feel that way at all.

933
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,864
(Laughs and looks down.)

934
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,880
PEANUT: Why are you so sweet?

935
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,360
CRIS: Totally falling for TOD.

936
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,280
PEANUT: Falling for TOD.

937
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, TOD is so cute.

938
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,560
CRIS: Oh, TOD is adorable.

939
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
CRIS: Is the relationship
of TIME and TOD starting now?

940
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,960
TIMETHAI: Oh hey!

941
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,728
- CRIS: TIME is just too hot, and everyone's confused.
- JANEYEH: Too hot.

942
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:19,392
RUSAMEEKAE: Or maybe
TOD actually likes TIME?

943
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,320
JANEYEH: That's possible.

944
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,880
CRIS: But wait,
what was TOD's answer just now?

945
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,000
JANEYEH: Ever since with
GOONG and the fish, he just...

946
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,200
TIMETHAI: You mean when NAMNUNG asked
who TOD likes, right?

947
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,880
PEANUT: He didn't answer it at all,
and he just laugh awkwardly.

948
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,680
JANEYEH: And he's like...

949
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,456
(Forcing a smile)
JANEYEH: Smiling like this.

950
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,938
TIMETHAI: He just laugh, right?
And he didn't say anything.

951
00:45:38,938 --> 00:45:42,240
TIMETHAI: But if it were me, if someone asked
whether I liked my roommate, I'd be like "Hey".

952
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,400
JANEYEH: Yeah, it's like...

953
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,120
TIMETHAI: I'd be like "Hey".

954
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,960
JANEYEH: Like this, right?

955
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,712
TIMETHAI: Because earlier, at first,
TOD actually answered KONG's question.

956
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:49,920
- TIMETHAI: If he didn't like, he'd just say no.
- JANEYEH: Yeah, he would say "no".

957
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,000
TIMETHAI: He pointed at him this time.

958
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,920
TIMETHAI: Sigh...

959
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,280
CRIS: I'm getting a headache.

960
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,360
TIMETHAI: I really don't want to
overthink it.

961
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,280
CRIS: I'm getting a headache.

962
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,320
RUSAMEEKAE: So KONG likes TOD.

963
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,240
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD likes TIME.

964
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,480
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME likes SUNNY, right?

965
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,280
CRIS: NAMNUNG.

966
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,520
CRIS: Who does MATHEUS like now?

967
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,080
RUSAMEEKAE: All the relationships
are crisscrossed now.

968
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Crisscrossed so much
that I don't even know what to call it.

969
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,400
RUSAMEEKAE: I really want to know
how messy it's going to get.

970
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's keep watching.

971
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:20,960
(Today, we will be have the one-time
room switch of the LOVE(X)PERT)

972
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,616
CRIS: Room switch.

973
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:24,576
(Love X Villa exchange)

974
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:25,472
CRIS: Oh my God!

975
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,600
(Everyone must think carefully
before making their choice)

976
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,576
RUSAMEEKAE: How's this going to work?

977
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,296
(Modern Villa: 2 men, 4 women)
(Because your choice might)

978
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:40,520
(Thai Villa: 2 women, 4 men)
(change all the relationships in F Villa.)

979
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,400
CRIS: It's not random?
They actually have to choose?

980
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,080
JANEYEH: I've got goosebumps.

981
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,360
CRIS: TOD is shocked.

982
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:54,528
KONG: When I heard there was going
to be a house swap, my first reaction was

983
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:58,720
KONG: like, "will I get
to be with that person?"

984
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,120
TOD: I don't want to switch.

985
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,320
TOD: I already think
I can just keep sharing a room with TIME

986
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,160
JANEYEH: He doesn't want to switch.

987
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,080
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD keeps insisting
he wants to stay in the same room as TIME.

988
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Upset.

989
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,880
TIMETHAI: I'm not sure anymore.

990
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,128
(Thai Villa)
JUNSU: Why is that?

991
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,336
(Looks around)

992
00:47:22,336 --> 00:47:24,040
CRIS: ASSE has to be
in the same room as CHERRY, right?

993
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,680
MILL: And we're staying together, right?

994
00:47:26,336 --> 00:47:27,264
FRAME: Then what am I supposed to do?

995
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,360
CRIS: My girls...

996
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,696
FRAME: I feel like I don't want to switch.

997
00:47:33,696 --> 00:47:36,032
(Sad) FRAME: We all know each other already,
and we've gotten so close.

998
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,560
PEANUT: Choosing a room
or choosing a person?

999
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:38,960
RUSAMEEKAE: This is brutal,
I'm telling you.

1000
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,032
(The top six recipients
of the spectrum letters are JUNSU,)

1001
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,520
(MILL, ASSE, SUNNY, TIME, and CHERRY)

1002
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,560
(Go to the board to choose the room
you'd like to stay in)

1003
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,587
RUSAMEEKAE: Those six who got the most letters
get to pick their villa first,

1004
00:47:55,587 --> 00:47:59,776
RUSAMEEKAE: but no one knows
what everyone else has chosen.

1005
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,784
MILL: Whoa, there are so few girls.

1006
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,371
(Modern Villa: 2 men, 4 women) RUSAMEEKAE:
And on the other side, 2 men with 4 women,

1007
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:07,920
(Thai Villa: 2 women, 4 men)
RUSAMEEKAE: and 4 women with 2 men.

1008

RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my.

1009
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,920

suddenly happen that Thai Villa got only

1010
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,712
MILL: two women, and what about the four people
who have been together since the beginning.

and women is all off.

1028

sticking together.

actually get what they want?)

and then they reveal everything afterwards, right?

1034

who chose what, right?

pick the same place?

you have to step out first.

kind enough to match their friends up.

JUNSU: I don't want to.

1171
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,720
JUNSU: I really don't want to go.

1172
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,800
(Look to the right)
CRIS: It's because he wants to stay with FRAME.

1173
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,800
ASSE: Honestly, if I could, I'd want to stay with JUNSU.
And I don't want to be separated from CHERRY either.

1174
00:54:42,804 --> 00:54:45,152
(Look to the left...)

1175
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,840
JANEYEH: Everyone's in shock.

1176
00:54:50,432 --> 00:54:52,256
TOD: Who made the change?

1177
00:54:53,632 --> 00:54:54,640
(Looks)

1178
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,000
TOD: Who made the change?

1179
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,000
NAMNUNG: Girl!

1180
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,520
JANEYEH: Girl!

1181
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,280
CRIS: Girl!

1182
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,880
(Those who received the fewest spec letters,
the bottom six,)

1183
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,560
(were given the right to swap rooms.)

1184
00:55:08,032 --> 00:55:08,968
(Smiles)

1185
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,440
(And the results of the room swaps
are as follows.)

1186
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,080
JANEYEH: Who is it?

1187
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,840
(The first person to be moved is...)

1188
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,520
(CHERRY.)

1189
00:55:20,128 --> 00:55:21,473
(CHERRY has been switched to
Modern Villa)

1190
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,808
(They're pleased)

1191
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,520
CRIS: ASSE is happy.

1192
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,280
JOY: Honestly, at first,
I really wanted to stay with SUNNY.

1193
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,760
JOY: But...

1194
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,440
JOY: In my head, MILL popped up.

1195
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,560
JOY: MILL's words came back to me.
Don't stab me in the back, okay?

1196
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,600
JOY: Don't leave me behind.

1197
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,800
JOY: Okay.

1198
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,960
(Thai Villa)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh!

1199
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,440
JOY: Then, CHERRY. Okay.

1200
00:55:49,536 --> 00:55:50,432
(Modern Villa, CHERRY, Thai Villa, JOY)

1201
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:51,800
CRIS: So CHERRY and JOY are swapped.

1202
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,640
JANEYEH: Pretty JOY
is such a sweetheart, honestly.

1203
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,600
JOY: Otherwise FRAME wouldn't have anyone
keeping an eye on her.

1204
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:03,360
(Happy)

1205
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,360
JANEYEH: Don't be too happy yet.

1206
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,280
TIMETHAI: Yeah, don't get too happy.
You might be the next one who gets moved.

1207
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,480
JANEYEH: You'll only get to smile
for a little while.

1208
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,200
(The second person is...)

1209
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,640
CRIS: This is so intense.

1210
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,200
JANEYEH: My heart is beating so fast.

1211
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,432
(JUNSU.)

1212
00:56:22,432 --> 00:56:23,168
(JUNSU needs to move to Thai Villa)

1213
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,760
JANEYEH: Who would do that to him?

1214
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Who was it?

1215
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,160
FRAME: Goodbye.

1216
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,040
MATHEUS: Bye-bye.

1217
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,520
JOY: Oh my God, I was so shocked.

1218
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,440
JANEYEH: Whoever changed it, say it.

1219
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,320
JANEYEH: MATHEUS.

1220
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:46,920
(Smiles)
CRIS: MATHEUS.

1221
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,248
MATHEUS: I really want to
stay at Modern Villa.

1222
00:56:49,908 --> 00:56:55,040
MATHEUS: I'm willing to meet the other two girls
a bit more, because I haven't really talked to them.

1223
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,160
(Modern Villa, MATHEUS)

1224
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,280
(Modern Villa, MATHEUS, Thai Villa, JUNSU)
CRIS: The two girls he wants to get to know are...

1225
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,152
JANEYEH: NAMNUNG and SUNNY, right?

1226
00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:05,312
MATHEUS: Now it's just like, 2 guys
and 4 girls in the Modern Villa, so...

1227
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:12,560
MATHEUS: It's not a bad percentage
for girls.

1228
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,960
RUSAMEEKAE: And he just casually says,
Modern Villa has lots of pretty girls.

1229
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,000
PEANUT: I knew it, MATHEUS.

1230
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,360
RUSAMEEKAE:
And he split the couple up too.

1231
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,512
(Got it)
PEANUT: Got it.

1232
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,360
RUSAMEEKAE: JUNSU!

1233
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,400
JANEYEH: He's in shock.

1234
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,520
JANEYEH: He's crying already.

1235
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,120
CRIS: Oh, baby JUNSU, I'm so sorry.

1236
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,240
JUNSU: I really don't want to go.

1237
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,280
JUNSU: Yes, I want to stay
at the Modern Villa.

1238
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,640
JOY: ASSE is shocked. ASSE doesn't talk much,
and when he does, people don't understand him.

1239
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,320
JUNSU: Why?

1240
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,400
CRIS: Just wait and see.
MATHEUS might get switched too.

1241
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,880
TIMETHAI: Yeah, MATHEUS
might end up being swapped as well.

1242
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,400
CRIS: Yes.

1243
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,672
TOD: But he already made his choice.

1244
00:57:56,672 --> 00:57:58,280
TOD: If he doesn't want to move,
then let him have what he wants.

1245
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,800
TOD: Okay.

1246
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,640
(Thai Villa, TOD)

1247
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, TOD is a good guy.

1248
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,880
TOD: I'm happy,
because I get to stay with TIME.

1249
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,339
TOD: Because we already knew that,

1250
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:08,840
TOD: the way I placed my sticker,
I'd end up with TIME no matter what.

1251
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,920
TIMETHAI: TOD is staying with TIME.

1252
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,280
CRIS: Of course,
otherwise KONG would've been picked.

1253
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,960
(Thai Villa, KONG)
TIMETHAI: KONG's like, good, this is perfect.

1254
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,040
KONG: Because when I saw the list,
the person I like was in Thai Villa.

1255
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,680
KONG: So I wanted a chance

1256
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,400
KONG: to be in the same villa,
which might help us get to know each other more.

1257
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,712
(Final result of
Modern Villa vs Thai Villa choices)

1258
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,760
CRIS: I only feel bad for JUNSU.

1259
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,600
JANEYEH: He's the saddest one.

1260
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,600
NAMNUNG: Finally!

1261
00:58:45,472 --> 00:58:47,000
SUNNY: NAMNUNG's already happy that
she gets to stay with me.

1262
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,240
SUNNY: I don't have to move my stuff,
and I still get to be with NAMNUNG, so really happy.

1263
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,360
NAMNUNG: Oh my god!

1264
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,720
NAMNUNG:
I really do get to stay with SUNNY.

1265
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,720
NAMNUNG: I felt relieved.

1266
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
NAMNUNG: But at the same time,
there's this tiny bit of...

1267
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,880
PEANUT: There it is.

1268
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,760
CRIS: A tiny bit of sadness that
she's not with NAMNUNG.

1269
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,320
TIME: What I regret is that this is the first time
I won't be in the same house as SUNNY.

1270
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,920
TIME: We won't see each other
at all tonight.

1271
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,920
TIME: I didn't think I'd...

1272
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,760
TIME: miss her this much.

1273
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:18,640
JANEYEH: You already miss her.

1274
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,120
TIMETHAI: Calm down,
you haven't even gone to bed yet, man.

1275
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,040
RUSAMEEKAE: But it's like TIME said...
after the date, they tried living apart for a bit.

1276
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,800
RUSAMEEKAE: So now things
are kind of playing right into that.

1277
00:59:29,056 --> 00:59:30,200
(Looks around)

1278
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,000
CRIS: I feel sorry for JUNSU.

1279
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,680
(Next, we'll enter the competition
between the two villas.)

1280
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,960
CRIS: What, another game?

1281
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,880
(All teams will be divided according to the villa
they're staying in after the room swap.)

1282
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,680
(The villa that wins
will receive shell coin as a prize,)

1283
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:54,440
(and also a special reward:
a luxurious free dinner tonight.)

1284
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,320
(The other villa
will only get a simple meal.)

1285
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,840
TIMETHAI: With more women on that side,
can they even win?

1286
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,520
- JOY: GOONG!
- MILL: GOONG!

1287
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,880
JANEYEH: All the aces are over here.

1288
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,720
(The game this round is...)

1289
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,000
(Water Basketball.)

1290
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,360
(Water Basketball)

1291
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,360
(Sit on shoulders)
(One person must sit on the shoulders of another,)

1292
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,880
(then try to throw the ball through the hoop.
Each shot that goes in counts as 1 point.)

1293
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,360
(One ball in = 1 point)
JANEYEH: Every single game in this show is so hard.

1294
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,840
(The first team to reach 5 points wins)

1295
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,440
(and will receive
the designated number of shell-coins.)

1296
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:31,960
TOD: Let's pair up.

1297
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,800
MILL: Pair up.

1298
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,880
LOVE(X)PERT:
On that side they've only got two guys.

1299
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,080
CRIS: But MATHEUS...

1300
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,080
(MATHEUS arm injury)
CRIS: MATHEUS's arm...

1301
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,280
CHERRY: MATHEUS can't do it.

1302
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,080
FRAME: MATHEUS can't do it.

1303
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,640
JANEYEH: Oh no,
then how are the girls going to win?

1304
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,520
(Since one of the members
is from Modern Villa,)

1305
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,000
(MATHEUS is injured,)

1306
01:00:51,072 --> 01:00:52,320
(therefore)

1307
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,960
(MATHEUS can choose one man
from Thai Villa)

1308
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,160
(to join Team Modern Villa
for this round of the competition.)

1309
01:01:03,232 --> 01:01:04,512
(Press lips together...)

1310
01:01:07,392 --> 01:01:08,760
(Looks around)

1311
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,320
(Excited)
CRIS: JUNSU is asking if he can join.

1312
01:01:16,192 --> 01:01:17,120
(Walking past...)

1313
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,200
CRIS: It's definitely not you, KONG.
He walked straight past you.

1314
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,400
CRIS: Three people.

1315
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Who is it?

1316
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,160
PEANUT: Is it TOD?

1317
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Is it TOD?

1318
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,200
CRIS: JUNSU, bring JUNSU over.

1319
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,600
MATHEUS: TOD.

1320
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,600
CRIS: Well done, MATHEUS.

1321
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,480
CRIS: That's how we win.

1322
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,440
CRIS: That's how we win.

1323
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,440
MATHEUS: TOD.

1324
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,560
(TOD will compete for Modern Villa.)
TIMETHAI: They just took the star player from that team.

1325
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,296
MATHEUS: Sorry, guys.

1326
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,520
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG is just like...

1327
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Is MATHEUS okay in the head?

1328
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,120
TOD: Go over there.

1329
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,960
MATHEUS: Sorry, guys.

1330
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,160
TIMETHAI: So this side
has the advantage now, huh?

1331
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,840

1337
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,480

each other or what, this pair?

1338
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,520

1339
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,640

1345
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,640

of riding on TOD's shoulders. Missed the chance.

1346
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,720

like it is injured.

1435
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,040
TOD: My neck really hurts right now.

1436
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,760
CRIS: Yes, because the women
were moving around like this.

1437
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,880
JANEYEH: Look at them.

1438

1443
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,274
(I'm still holding on)

1444
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,280
(Modern Villa wins this round.)

1445
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,760
(The reward is a luxurious dinner.)

1446
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,480
(And each member
receives ten shell coins.)

1447

the water basketball?

1451
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,000
RUSAMEEKAE: This game was like
NAMNUNG and SUNNY

1452
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
RUSAMEEKAE: were fighting with TIME.

1453
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,320
RUSAMEEKAE: It was like NAMNUNG
competing with TIME.

1454
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,400
(Additional comment)TIMETHAI: But I feel like
NAMNUNG is SUNNY's roommate,

1455
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,080
TIMETHAI: so she knows
SUNNY really enjoys playing games.

1456
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,520
TIMETHAI: So, they win together.
When your friend is happy, you're happy.

1457
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,240
CRIS: Well, they're really cute.
I mean, they...

1458
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,240
CRIS: If that go beyond
friendship, that's also cute.

1459
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:30,480
RUSAMEEKAE: And TIME gets to be with TOD as usual,
but separated from both NAMNUNG and SUNNY.

1460
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,792
RUSAMEEKAE: What now?

1461
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:34,880
(Feeling worried for them)

1462
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Because it might be like...

1463
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,480
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS has more chances
to be close to SUNNY and NAMNUNG.

1464
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,520
RUSAMEEKAE: He's waiting for his chance.

1465
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,280
RUSAMEEKAE: I mean MATHEUS.

1466
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,272
TIMETHAI: He's a strategist.

1467
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Honestly,
it feels like it's all chaotic.

1468
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,200
RUSAMEEKAE: I'll just say it like this.

1469
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:51,232
RUSAMEEKAE: After this, it'll be the first night the CANDIDATES
will move to stay with a new group of friends.

1470
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:54,800
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see what will happen.

1471
01:08:57,056 --> 01:08:58,480

There are so many girls.

1478
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,480
(Hey, you're lucky again)
MATHEUS: No.

1479
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Look at
how MATHEUS enjoys it.

1480
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,680
CRIS: There are no other guys here,
only MATHEUS.

1481
01:09:14,688 --> 01:09:15,744

JANEYEH: Only drinking tea?

1485
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,720
CRIS: Too simple.

1486
01:09:24,096 --> 01:09:25,024
(Presenting)
TOD: Shall we play a game?

1487
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,336

1488
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,520
KONG: What game?

1489
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,640
TOD: If it points at someone...

1490
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,440
TOD: If they don't answer...

1491
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,160
TOD: Take a shot.

1492
01:09:35,762 --> 01:09:36,840
(Being cautious)

1493
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,400

1494
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,240

(TOD asks)
TOD: Umm.

1498
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,120
JOY: So, TOD, who do you want to ask?

1499
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,880
CRIS: TOD is playing
truth or dare himself?

1500
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,400
CRIS: Or TOD and MILL?

1501
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:55,904
TOD: I'll ask MILL.

1502
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:56,768
- JANEYEH: Oh my God.
- TIMETHAI: Oh my God.

1503
01:09:56,768 --> 01:09:57,760
PEANUT: He's really asking MILL.

1504
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,912
(TOD chooses MILL)
TOD: I'll ask MILL.

1505
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,080
JANEYEH: Again, really?

1506
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,280
JANEYEH: She's ready to cry.

1507
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,400
PEANUT: She's ready to cry.

1508
01:10:04,206 --> 01:10:05,760
(Listening)

1509
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,560
TOD: What's the type of person
you like, MILL?

1510
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,720
JANEYEH: Make it fair.

1511
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,600
CRIS: TOD really knows how to do it.

1512
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,728
(TOD is really on point)
JANEYEH: He does.

1513
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,680
RUSAMEEKAE: What type of person
do you like?

1514
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,520
(Interested)
JANEYEH: JOY wants to know.

1515
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,960
MILL: I like someone who...

1516
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1517
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,680
MILL: has clear facial features,
clear nose.

1518
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,080
CRIS: JOY fits the bill.

1519
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,640
MILL: Clear facial features, clear nose.

1520
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,480
MILL: Two-tone skin.

1521
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,160
JANEYEH: TOD fits the criteria too.

1522
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,280
TIMETHAI: TOD totally fits the criteria.

1523
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,040
JOY: Is he wearing a blue shirt?

1524
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,640
CRIS: JOY is too good.

1525
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,120
CRIS: I really like JOY.

1526
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,720
CHERRY: Is he wearing a blue shirt?

1527
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:48,960
(Looking at the shirt...)

1528
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,600
(Look again)
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY is managing things.

1529
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,800
TIMETHAI: JOY is managing things.

1530
01:10:52,453 --> 01:10:53,921
KONG: Ha ha.

1531
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,680
KONG: Is he eating salad too?

1532
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,600
TOD: What?

1533
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,608
TOD: Okay.

1534
01:11:01,569 --> 01:11:02,528
JUNSU: Eating?

1535
01:11:02,656 --> 01:11:03,620
(Smiling at each other)
JOY: Ha ha.

1536
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,600
(Smiling at each other)
CRIS: I really like JOY.

1537
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,160
TIMETHAI: Darn, bro.

1538
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:12,360
JUNSU: Then TOD.

1539
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,640
CRIS: He wants to ask TOD.

1540
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,920
PEANUT: He'd ask what TOD's type is.

1541
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,640
RUSAMEEKAE: It must be
"What kind of people do you like?"

1542
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,920
CRIS: Oops, MILL.

1543
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,680
RUSAMEEKAE: MILL seems to know?

1544
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,760
JUNSU: Interested...

1545
01:11:29,344 --> 01:11:30,208
JUNSU: How many people?

1546
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,600
CRIS: That's a harsh question.

1547
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,400
JANEYEH: What a next-level question.

1548
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,520
CRIS: Your question
is causing them trouble, JUNSU.

1549
01:11:38,592 --> 01:11:39,520
TOD: Three.

1550
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:41,479
JANEYEH: Oh wow, why so many?

1551
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,400
RUSAMEEKAE: If it's three people...

1552
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,680
JANEYEH: I think TIME is one of them.

1553
01:11:45,088 --> 01:11:46,080
TOD: Three.

1554
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,680
(Looking at TIME)
CRIS: Oops, did you just look at TIME?

1555
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,840
(Turned and looked)
CRIS: And then you looked at TIME?

1556
01:11:49,088 --> 01:11:50,080
TIME: Okay.

1557
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,560
RUSAMEEKAE: That's it.

1558
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,760
(Smile)
PEANUT: He's looking towards TIME.

1559
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:54,144
PEANUT: Boom.

1560
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,360
CRIS: MILL is blushing.

1561
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,840
KONG: Are all three people you like
here in this circle?

1562
01:12:02,998 --> 01:12:04,288
(Keeps asking...)

1563
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,600
JANEYEH: That's how you do it.

1564
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,240
JANEYEH: That's how you do it.

1565
01:12:11,968 --> 01:12:12,960
(Choose to drink)
CRIS: Go ahead, drink.

1566
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,840
CRIS: Great, TOD. Excellent.

1567
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,712
LOVE(X)PERT: No answer.

1568
01:12:15,712 --> 01:12:16,590
LOVE(X)PERT: No answer.

1569
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,792
CRIS: You don't really
need to know this.

1570
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:18,640
TIMETHAI: To be safe.

1571
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,760
CRIS: To be safe.

1572
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,320
TIME: Okay, maybe one, or two, or three

1573
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,480
TIME: are here.

1574
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,480
PEANUT:
Knowing the truth will chill you.

1575
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,880
JANEYEH: You're in for it, bro.

1576
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,720
TOD: That's correct.

1577
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,693
(Look)
CRIS: Oops, it's like...

1578
01:12:45,992 --> 01:12:46,907
CRIS: TOD.

1579
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,760
CRIS: TOD keeps looking at TIME.

1580
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,520
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG and MILL are like...

1581
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,680
RUSAMEEKAE: "Hmm, is it me?"

1582
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,440
TIME: I think it will be harder.

1583
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,080
(Smile)
JANEYEH: He just smiles.

1584
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,080
TIMETHAI: Such a sweet smile.

1585
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,000
TIMETHAI: Oh, boy.

1586
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,760
TIMETHAI: Boy, you'll find out soon.

1587
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,080
TIME: I can't guess
because there are three people.

1588
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,896
JANEYEH: It's you.

1589
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,840
RUSAMEEKAE:
And TIME doesn't even realize it.

1590
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,480
TIMETHAI: Tell him,
"You'll find out soon."

1591
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,360
TOD: Okay, ask someone else.

1592
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,400
TIME: Okay, okay.

1593
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,560
(Avoiding eye contact)
CRIS: Oh, he's blushing.

1594
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,720
JANEYEH: He's blushing.

1595
01:13:20,704 --> 01:13:21,640
(Twist the bottle...)

1596
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Twist the tea bottle.

1597
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,280
TIMETHAI: He's drinking tea.

1598
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, KONG.

1599
01:13:33,312 --> 01:13:34,200
JANEYEH: He's so red.

1600
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,136
TIMETHAI: So red.

1601
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,600
CRIS: Oops, my girl.

1602
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,960
PEANUT: Why don't you
wear a football shirt?

1603
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,096
JANEYEH: Just change sometimes.

1604
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,640
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG would say,
"what's up?"

1605
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,360
SUNNY: You think how many are
in this house and how many in that house?

1606
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,600
NAMNUNG: Three people.

1607
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,072
SUNNY: They're all in this house, right?

1608
01:14:01,431 --> 01:14:04,384
(Silence...)

1609
01:14:04,384 --> 01:14:05,312
SUNNY: MATHEUS and TIME.

1610
01:14:06,016 --> 01:14:06,944
NAMNUNG: Not TIME.

1611
01:14:09,088 --> 01:14:10,094
SUNNY: TOD.

1612
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:13,760
(No response...)

1613
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:15,649
SUNNY: Or it's me?

1614
01:14:16,597 --> 01:14:18,454
JANEYEH: It's you.

1615
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:19,587
CRIS: My girl.

1616
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,776
TIMETHAI: So, she can feel it?

1617
01:14:23,776 --> 01:14:24,760
NAMNUNG: Yes.

1618
01:14:26,784 --> 01:14:27,880
TIMETHAI: So sweet.

1619
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,440
CRIS: Yeah.

1620
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,880
JANEYEH: Once they return,
everything will change.

1621
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,040
CRIS: Who is lying there?

1622
01:14:39,648 --> 01:14:40,400
TIMETHAI: I see it.

1623
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,040
CRIS: I see it.

1624
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,040
PEANUT: I see a blue shirt.

1625
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:44,960
TOD: How about you, TIME?

1626
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,120
TOD: If you go to X-Land this time,
who would you go with?

1627
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:48,992
TOD: You think?

1628
01:14:49,178 --> 01:14:50,653
(Secretly asks)
LOVE(X)PERT: What? No way.

1629
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,080
TOD: I can guess.

1630
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,032
TIME: So...

1631
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,400
- TIME: Okay, let me tell you a bit.
- TOD: Okay.

1632
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,616
TIMETHAI: Wow.

1633
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:06,944
(Thinking)
TIME: Um...

1634
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,640
TIME: In the past 5 to 6 days,

1635
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,880
- TIME: I'll share my feelings in a timeline.
- TOD: Okay.

1636
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,256
TIME: On the first day,

1637
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,280
TIME: I sort of liked NAMNUNG,
not really like, I was interested.

1638
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,367
CRIS: Oh my God.

1639
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,800
(Spinning ring)
CRIS: That's intense.

1640
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,840
TIME: But when she went to X-Land,
I got the chance to talk to SUNNY.

1641
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,320
TIME: I felt better with SUNNY
than with NAMNUNG.

1642
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,600
JANEYEH: See? Gone for one night
and the game totally changed.

1643
01:15:37,696 --> 01:15:38,600
TOD: Wow.

1644
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,640
TIME: After that,

1645
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,360
TIME: I got to know SUNNY a lot more.

1646
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,640
TIME: I told SUNNY, hey,

1647
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,680
TIME: I feel like...

1648
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,160
TIME: My heart is racing.

1649
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,912
(Pause)
TOD: Uh...

1650
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,408
TIME: But...

1651
01:16:00,334 --> 01:16:00,880
(Move...)

1652
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,800
CRIS: His eyes are red.

1653
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,680
TIME: It's a feeling
I've never talked to NAMNUNG about.

1654
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,440
TIME: Because we've never talked before.

1655
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:10,499
TOD: Yes.

1656
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:15,757
(Sigh...)

1657
01:16:15,757 --> 01:16:17,024
JANEYEH: Oh, that's adorable.

1658
01:16:17,024 --> 01:16:18,560
CRIS: That's adorable.

1659
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,360
TOD: So it means
if you can go to X-Land,

1660
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:31,400
TOD: you should find a chance
to go with NAMNUNG to compare, right?

1661
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,680
TIME: That's the difficult part.

1662
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,720
TIME: If I ask one person to go,

1663
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,040
TIME: won't the other one feel bad?

1664
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,200
TOD: Definitely yes.

1665
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,192
PEANUT: I've got goosebumps.

1666
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,080
TIME: But if I ask the other one to go,

1667
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,280
TIME: will this person feel anything?

1668
01:16:53,344 --> 01:16:54,200
TOD: Certainly.

1669
01:16:56,197 --> 01:16:58,000
(Bite the lip...)

1670
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,400
CRIS: It's really tough, isn't it?

1671
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,520
CRIS: But I understand him.
It means going to X-Land...

1672
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,120
RUSAMEEKAE: It's the chance to be there
alone with the person you like.

1673
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:10,480
(Touch the ear...)

1674
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,400
CRIS: TOD, don't say it.

1675
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,520
CRIS: TOD, don't say it.

1676
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,120
TOD: Why is it so good?

1677
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,280
TOD: It's a shame. There should have
been stars. Hey, there's one.

1678
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,560
(Changing the topic)
PEANUT: TOD.

1679
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:26,760
CRIS: TOD.

1680
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
PEANUT: Is it true?

1681
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,320
JANEYEH: TOD.

1682
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,720
JANEYEH: He changed the topic.

1683
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,360
TIMETHAI: Is what we thought
since episode one true?

1684
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,440
TIMETHAI: TIME and TOD.

1685
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,320
JANEYEH: It's true.

1686
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,504
PEANUT: It seems to be true today.

1687
01:17:37,504 --> 01:17:38,383
TIME: Here.

1688
01:17:38,383 --> 01:17:39,591
TIME: There is...

1689
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,880
TIME: Two, three, four,

1690
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,552
TIME: five.

1691
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:55,582
JANEYEH: Whoa, not yet.

1692
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's just end it here.
We don't know if TOD's going to say something to TIME.

1693
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,280
CANDIDATE: On a clear night,
you might see lots of stars.

1694
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,016
CANDIDATE: Mm.

1695
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,800
JANEYEH: Too romantic.

1696
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Zoom out, drone. Come on.

1697
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,904
RUSAMEEKAE: Cut the sound.

1698
01:18:16,662 --> 01:18:17,800
(Can't handle the sadness...)

1699
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,784
JANEYEH: See?

1700
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,880
(Many emotions overwhelming)RUSAMEEKAE: I almost cried earlier.
It was so painful.

1701
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,080
TIMETHAI: That scene earlier was like
the first episode of TIME and TOD.

1702
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,360
TIMETHAI: I really want it to happen.

1703
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,800
CRIS: But in the first episode,

1704
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,360
CRIS: TIME was the one checking,
not TOD.

1705
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,320
JANEYEH: Yes.

1706
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,640
- TIMETHAI: He said "Your shirt is really nice."
- CRIS: Something like that.

1707
01:18:36,928 --> 01:18:37,880
TIME: Your shirt is really nice.

1708
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,240
TOD: Thank you.

1709
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,800
PEANUT: But TOD was showing signs.

1710
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,440
JANEYEH: He might be swayed.

1711
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,680
RUSAMEEKAE: And what if TOD says it?

1712
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,920
CRIS: No, but TOD must not say it.
Don't say it.

1713
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,243
TIMETHAI: They just met for 5 or 6 days.

1714
01:18:50,243 --> 01:18:53,000
TIMETHAI: Why should he hold back
his feelings just to spare someone else?

1715
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,040
JANEYEH: That's right.
He should just say it.

1716
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,480
TIMETHAI: Let's say he says it
on the last day,

1717
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,240
TIMETHAI: and TIME could change minds,
it's a total waste of time.

1718
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,400
CRIS: Let's go back
to the first scenario for all of us.

1719
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,600
CRIS: TOD and TIME,
then SUNNY and NAMNUNG. That's all.

1720
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,120
TIMETHAI: So it circles back
to that point?

1721
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,320
CRIS: It's the best solution, right?

1722
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,200
RUSAMEEKAE: That's it.

1723
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:11,920
CRIS: That's it.

1724
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,640
JANEYEH: There won't be problem at all.

1725
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,640
TIMETHAI: There won't be problem at all.

1726
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,920
TIMETHAI: And actually,
it's not really our problem.

1727
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,560
(Huh? Whose problem is this?)

1728
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:21,440
CRIS: But we still support TOD to reveal
on the last day because there's a lot to it.

1729
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,440
CRIS: What about other couples? Whoever you like,
you should support and cheer them on.

1730
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,160
CRIS: Same goes for those at home,
if you want to continue supporting them,

1731
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,328
CRIS: every Saturday,
see you on WeTV at 6 PM Beijing Time

1732
01:19:31,328 --> 01:19:32,320
CRIS: on

1733
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,952
ALL: Borderless Love,

1734
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,968
ALL: LOVE(X).

1735
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,728
CRIS: That's it for today.

1736
01:19:37,728 --> 01:19:38,752
CRIS: Ughhh.

1737
01:19:38,752 --> 01:19:39,584
CRIS: See you.

1738
01:19:39,904 --> 01:19:42,178
(Want to meet singles?)

1739
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:44,904
(Send love to your favorite singles)

1740
01:19:44,904 --> 01:19:48,879
(on the WeTV app,
to chat with them on the livestream.)

1741
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,040
(Preview)
(X-Land is going to open again today.)

1742
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,320
CANDIDATE: I'm not expecting
to go to X-Land myself.

1743
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,400
JANEYEH: What is this?

1744
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,600
TIME: I think I need to explain it.

1745
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,840
TIME: If I have the chance
to go on a date, I want to take...

1746
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,032
TOD: TIME.

1747
01:20:04,797 --> 01:20:05,240
(Start holding hands...)

1748
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,120
LOVE(X)PERT: Oops, wow!

1749
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,480
JANEYEH: Wow, what is this?

1750
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,496
JANEYEH: What is this?

1751
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,096
JANEYEH: Oh my!

1752
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Go, TOD. Go all the way.

1753
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,840
JANEYEH: Go, go.

1754
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,200
CRIS: Oops, it's X-Land.

1755
01:20:21,312 --> 01:20:22,240
CRIS: And then what?

1756
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,000
JANEYEH: Who is it?

1757
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,200
NAMNUNG: Why did you choose me?

1758
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,640
LOVE(X)PERT: So enjoying.

1759
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,232
SUNNY: The most
popular persons are here, all of them.

1760
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,400
CRIS: She really chose NAMNUNG.

1761
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,000
RUSAMEEKAE: How do they shower?

1762
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,960
NAMNUNG: But which woman do you think
you're interested in?

1763
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:38,985
SUNNY: Probably you.

1764
01:20:39,183 --> 01:20:39,936
(Probably it's you...)

1765
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:41,280
(Blushing...)

1766
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey, they're blushing.

1767
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,960
(Shipped until they became a real couple)
CRIS: But I didn't expect it to be real.

1768
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,480
(Eye contact)SUNNY: Which part of my body
do you think is the sexiest?

1769
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:51,141
NAMNUNG: Your eyes.

1770
01:20:53,695 --> 01:20:54,908
NAMNUNG: Your whole.

1771
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Soul-sucking.

1772
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:59,136
(Kiss, kiss...)

1773
01:21:02,059 --> 01:21:03,066
JANEYEH: Oh my God.

1774
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
CRIS: Four people?

1775
01:21:07,008 --> 01:21:08,320
(Who else is going to X-Land)
TIMETHAI: How do they sleep?
