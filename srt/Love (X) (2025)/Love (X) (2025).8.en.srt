NAMNUNG: I would love too, SUNNY.

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,160

(The new member has the privilege to pick
2 people to stay together in X-Land)

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
CRIS: Huh?

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,240

ALL: Wow.

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
JANEYEH: They're sleeping together.

TIMETHAI: The Fruit of Love game,
you barely need fruit, actually.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Do you want to see it?

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,520

CRIS: Let's start.

32
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:52,240

the underwater kissing competition)

34
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:02,520

either woman or man.

(Looking)

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,040
(Looking)
NAMNUNG: SUNNY? TIME? Or MATHEUS? Or...

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,280
RUSAMEEKAE: It's a war.

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
TIMETHAI: A mental war.

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,400
CRIS: Who thought of this fierce game?

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,120
ALL: Three.

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,200

RUSAMEEKAE: Who? Who's paired with whom?

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,360
CRIS: Who is FRAME paired with?

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
(Looking)
CRIS: Is it JUNSU?

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,160
JANEYEH: He must have great karma.

57
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,104
(Too excited to speak)

58
00:03:04,148 --> 00:03:05,560
(Laughing hard)

59
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,240

JUNSU: Can't believe it.

61
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:10,291

CRIS: Is TOD paired with ASSE?

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
RUSAMEEKAE: A guy meets a guy?

69

TOD: Oh, oh, my god.

70

(TOD paired with ASSE)
TOD: Okay, okay, okay.

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,320
TOD: Well, oh, my god.
I didn't expect it that

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,440
TOD: I'd be with ASSE.

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,560

JANEYEH: Absolutely intense.

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,680
CRIS: Wow, so intense.

83
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
(Thinking hard)
JANEYEH: A real headache.

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
JANEYEH: Holding her head.

85
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
CRIS: This is really tough.

86
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,640
(Going to her)

87

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,000
TIME: I can't believe that I'm paired
with NAMNUNG for the second game.

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
TIME: Super excited.

91
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,936
(SUNNY has no partner)
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oh. - TIMETHAI: SUNNY has no partner.

92
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,840

TIME: Can you dive?

94
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,920
NAMNUNG: Yes.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,720
TIME: How many seconds?

96
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,360
NAMNUNG: Don't know.

97
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,880
TIME: Don't have to bite it yet, do we?

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,696
NAMNUNG: You can just bite in.

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,440
TIME: Try it.

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
(Feeding)
RUSAMEEKAE: Aw.

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
TIME: Try it.

102
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,200
CRIS: Oh, SUNNY's still behind.

103
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
JANEYEH: So intense.

104
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:52,448
(Turning away)

105
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,584
(Escaping elsewhere)

106
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:57,680
CRIS: Aw, what's up
with JUNSU and FRAME?

107
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:02,520
FRAME: You can bite.

108
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Really feel for SUNNY.

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
CRIS: Feel sorry for SUNNY.

110
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,400
TIME: It's just a kiss.

111
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,040
SUNNY: Am I playing alone?

112
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:09,280
SUNNY: Am I playing alone?

113
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:12,240
(Turning face)
CRIS: She has no partner, what to do?

114
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,384

RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

118
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,960
RUSAMEEKAE: How's it going to go?

119
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
TIMETHAI: Practice eating first.

120
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,800

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,480
CRIS: JOY.

126
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,760
CRIS: JOY already likes SUNNY,
doesn't she?

127
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:45,984
- CRIS: Oh, JOY.
- JANEYEH: Huh?

128

NAMNUNG: Happy.

130
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
CRIS: Oops.

131
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
CRIS: TIME is like...

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
SUNNY: So fast.

133
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,800
CRIS: JOY helped her practice.
Way too sweet.

134
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,600
TIMETHAI: Though JOY just helped out,
maybe a bit too intense.

135
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
JANEYEH: Really.

136
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,397

140
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:30,760
SUNNY: Oh really?

141
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,000
SUNNY: Can you dive for long?

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,760
NAMNUNG: I'll try.

143
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,272

(SUNNY)

147
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
SUNNY: Yeah.

148
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,160
(You're the only one who pulled
the rope without a partner)

149
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
(Now you can choose someone
to be your partner)

150
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,200
(The chosen one will have a chance to
receive an additional round of rewards)

151
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320

MILL: Okay, I'll give in.

153
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,288
- TOD: Wow.
- MILL: Wow.

154
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,640
- SUNNY: Who wants to play twice?
- CANDIDATE: You can choose it.

155
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,728
(Looking to the right)
RUSAMEEKAE: Who wants to play twice?

156
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:04,160
CRIS: She has to choose, like, TIME.

157
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,120
TIMETHAI: Choose NAMNUNG.

158
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:06,320
(Looking)

159
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,880
RUSAMEEKAE: And JOY too.

160
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,376
MATHEUS: I'm a rescue swimmer.
Don't forget.

161
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:11,808
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops, advertising.

162
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,080
CRIS: Advertising.

163
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:15,800
SUNNY: But you're a rescue swimmer?

164
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,280
MATHEUS: Yeah. I'm like...

165
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,640
TIMETHAI: It comes down to fun
versus winning now.

166
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,640
CRIS: He's a rescue swimmer.

167
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,480
SUNNY: Bring it on.

168
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,104
SUNNY: Yeah, you.

169
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,880
- CRIS: Hey.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

170
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,560

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,120
- SUNNY: Come on.
- MATHEUS: Okay.

172
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:33,720
(Nodding)

173

184
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,000
- RUSAMEEKAE: See?

186
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,360
SUNNY: gonna float.

187
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,570
(Demonstrating)

188
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,040
(Looking)

193
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,088
SUNNY: Enough.

194
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,584
SUNNY: And then from there
we can just stay.

195
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,056
MATHEUS: It's easy, that's one.

196
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:17,640
SUNNY: Okay.

197
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,848

SUNNY, and MATHEUS.

199
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,680

JOY just rushed in.

200
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,880

JOY seems to want SUNNY too.

201
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
RUSAMEEKAE: A love pentagon.

202
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,624

kissing competition in pairs)

204
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,520

(First pair: SUNNY and MATHEUS)

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600

218
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,528
(Jump and hug)

00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,720
JANEYEH: Awww.

220
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,320

221
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,848

- RUSAMEEKAE: My dear.

222
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:23,488
CRIS: She's killing it.

223
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
- RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.
- TIMETHAI: Hey.

224
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,928
MATHEUS: Er...

225
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,800
MATHEUS: She kind of like jumped on me,
and you know, like it was super near.

226
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,640
MATHEUS: It was like the first time

227
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,720
MATHEUS: I have an intimate moment.

228
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,520
MATHEUS: So, I really enjoy it.

229
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,512
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, my god.

230
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,140

TIMETHAI: Wow.

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
JANEYEH: What's the fruit for, anyway?

233
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,782
TIMETHAI: Wow.

234
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
CRIS: Can't take it.

235
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
CANDIDATE: Wow.

236
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,360
JUNSU: It's like a TV series.

237
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
JANEYEH: Wow.

238
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:06,480
CRIS: Wow.

239
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:09,000
TIMETHAI: Oh, my god. This is crazy.

240
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,264
JANEYEH: Where's the fruit?

241
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,600
CRIS: Where's the fruit?
Where is your fruit?

242
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
RUSAMEEKAE: It's mouth-to-mouth now.

243
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,600
TIMETHAI: SUNNY's out of it,
she's passed out long ago.

244
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,080
TIME: Hey, it's been a while.

245
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:34,336
(Nodding)

246
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
JANEYEH: So insane.

247
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
JANEYEH: So insane.

248
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:46,784
(Looking)

249

SUNNY: You good?

250
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:47,760
MATHEUS: I'm good.

251
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:50,976
RUSAMEEKAE: But MATHEUS seems happy
when he's with SUNNY.

252
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:52,352
TIMETHAI: MVP here.

253
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,112
TIMETHAI: Since the first one,
it's been intense.

254
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:54,688
CRIS: Yes.

255
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,640
JANEYEH: Her face looks so bummed,
look at that.

256
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,560
NAMNUNG: It makes me realize that

257
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
NAMNUNG: my interests
are interested in each other.

258
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,304
JANEYEH: Oh.

259
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,424
NAMNUNG: I'm interested in TIME,
interested in SUNNY, and also MATHEUS.

260
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,960
NAMNUNG: Such a complicated situation.
Four now.

261
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
CRIS: Oh.

262
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh dear.

263
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,208
CRIS: It's kind of sad, isn't it?
That's insane.

264
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:18,944
JANEYEH: It's intense.

265
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,600
(Looking)

266
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,664

267
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,720
- CRIS: The best kiss ever?
- JANEYEH: What?

268
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,456
TIME: Shall we go?

269
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

270
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,960
JANEYEH: Yes, take it back.

271
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Fighting, fighting!

of fighting back.

(Looking)

274
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,448

CRIS: This pair.

277
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,080
JANEYEH: This pair.

278
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,400
JOY: Two minutes, just as TIME said.

279
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh wow, oh wow.

280
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,840
CRIS: Will they do the ultimate sexy
move before diving? Getting back, like...

281
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,600
(Hugging)

282
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,496
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, oh, oh.

CRIS: Hey, hey.

284

how to bring out the sass.

285
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Aw, really feel for SUNNY.

just like a series too.

TIME: Are you ready?

290
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
JANEYEH: Red nails.

291
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
JANEYEH: It's spicy.

292
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,560
CRIS: Where is the fruit again?

293
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
TIMETHAI: Just eat the fruit.

294
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
CRIS: Oh, my god.

296
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Aw, look, touching
anything. Are they secretly clicking?

297
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,680
CRIS: Everyone's feeling it,
everyone feels the same.

298
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,280

JANEYEH: Absolutely perfect.

302
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,360

- TIME: Is it okay?
- NAMNUNG: It's okay.

304
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
TIME: Okay, okay.

305
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,920
MATHEUS: We should start
without fruit.

306
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
MATHEUS: And like a real kiss,
it'll be even easier.

307
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:36,384
- SUNNY: I think so.
- MATHEUS: Right?

308
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,400

RUSAMEEKAE: Shipping them.

312
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,440

(Smell test)

321
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,760

323
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,016
JUNSU: I'm trying... I'm trying my best.

324
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,520
(Consoling)

325
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,080
JANEYEH: Telling him to keep calm.

326
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,240
JANEYEH: Keep calm, boy.

327
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,600

Little GOONG, keep fighting.

332
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:39,880
TIMETHAI: So dramatic.

333
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,840
MILL: Shy, if you enjoy it, it's JUNSU
and FRAME, they're cute. Good chemistry.

334
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,800
(Bite)
CRIS: Oh, hurry, JUNSU...

335
00:14:57,184 --> 00:14:58,400

337
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:03,616
(Beyond thrilled)

338
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,160
CRIS: JUNSU's probably dead by now.

339
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
CRIS: Is JUNSU still alive?

340
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
RUSAMEEKAE: It's satisfying.

341
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,840
CRIS: It's satisfying.

342
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,800
(Frown)
CRIS: Can't handle it anymore?

343
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,120
CRIS: See?

344
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,240
(JUNSU and FRAME hold for 7 seconds.)

- CRIS: Seven seconds, JUNSU.

346
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,120
JUNSU: I want to go home.

347
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,920

348
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,568

349

(Comforting)

FRAME: Take a rest.

351
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,040
- JUNSU: Not easy.
- TOD: Not easy.

352
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,744
(Next group, please.)

353
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
TIMETHAI: Oh, both of them?

354
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:10,501
MATHEUS: Cool down. Fighting.

355
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:12,025
JOY: We can just dive in now.
Want it or not?

356
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,440
RUSAMEEKAE: What? No need for the fruit?

357
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,712
JANEYEH: No need to hold it anymore.

358
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:17,000
CRIS: MATHEUS hits the jackpot.

359
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,400
CRIS: Plus, he gets shell coins too.

360
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,560
TIMETHAI: Yeah.

361
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,280
MILL: Then hold your breath.
Did you hold your breath yet?

362
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,600
CHERRY: Mm-hmm.

363
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,880
CRIS: CHERRY and MILL could be a thing.

364
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
CRIS: Oh.

365
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,120
JANEYEH: Wow.

366
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,520
CRIS: Wow.

367
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh... Oh, my God!

368
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,720
CRIS: How does ASSE feel?

369
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,160
(Coming up)
TIMETHAI: Hey.

370
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:01,664

(Pushing down)

373
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,600
TIMETHAI: What is this posture?

374
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,520
JANEYEH: What are you doing?

375
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,680
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY, it's not a real kiss.
JOY is pinning him down.

376
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,608
(Panic)

377
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:26,730
MATHEUS: You're okay?

378
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,120
(Worried)
JOY: Okay.

379
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,400

383
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,520
CRIS: It's TOD and ASSE now.

384
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,552
JOY: TIME is heartbroken.

385
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Why is TIME heartbroken?

386
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,080
CRIS: TIME's heartbroken,
because he's being teased about wanting TOD.

387
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,480
TIMETHAI: They like to play together.

388
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, really?

389
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe they're like brothers.

TOD: Okay.

394
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,160
TIMETHAI: Hey.

395
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
CRIS: Won't they use the fruit too?

396
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,080
(Tossed the fruit away)
JANEYEH: Oh, my God!

397
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,840

398
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,960

CRIS: Oh, my God.

401
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:12,492

(Eye contact)

403
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,240
CRIS: TOD!

404
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,800
TIMETHAI: Please don't look
into the eyes.

405
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,112
(Can't take it anymore)

406
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,080
JUNSU: Oh! Wow!

407
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,960

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,040
JANEYEH: Oh, my God.

412
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
MATHEUS: Ouch.

413
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,240
NAMNUNG: I never thought when those two
were together. There'd be such a vibe.

414
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,640
RUSAMEEKAE: The vibe which means...

415
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,360
CRIS: Chemistry.

416
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,200
(Lock with legs)

417
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,080
TIMETHAI: Here we go!

418
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,600
(Heart melting)

419
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,240
CRIS: Does one person
have to hold the other?

420
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,320
JANEYEH: TOD's acting weird.

421
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:24,320
(Positioning)

422
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:27,584
(Holding tightly)

423
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,080
CRIS: ASSE is confused.

424
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:31,296
(Holding tightly)

425
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,800

426
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
TIMETHAI: Wow.

427
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
CRIS: Wow, TOD.

428
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
TIME: Not yet.

429
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
TIME: Not yet.

430
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:10,624
(Fell off)

431
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,440
CRIS: The fruit fell a long time ago.

432
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:16,672
(Holding head)

433
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,560

434
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,640
- TIME: More!
- NAMNUNG: More!

435
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:26,848

00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,754
JANEYEH: Oh, my God!

437
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,320
CRIS: This is too much.

438
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
CRIS: I can't stand it.

439
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,031
MATHEUS: Very romantic.

440
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,869
CRIS: Too intense.

441
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:50,464
RUSAMEEKAE: So thrilled.

442
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:51,072
(On cloud nine)

443
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:52,640
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm on cloud nine.

444
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,760
JANEYEH: Too intense.

445
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,320
RUSAMEEKAE: What's happening, CRIS?

446
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:57,320
(Tears flowing)

447
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,880
(Tissue)
CRIS: Thank you.

448
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,880
CRIS: I can't stand it, JANEYEH. How is it?

449
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,440
CRIS: What's going on, TOD?

450
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,120
(What's going on, TOD?)
CRIS: What's going on, TOD?

451
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,840
(TOD and ASSE hold for 27 seconds.)

452
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,720
(27 seconds)

453
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,240
(Scores: MATHEUS, SUNNY: 42 sec; ASSE, TOD: 27 sec)
RUSAMEEKAE: Total scores.

454
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,520
(TIME, NAMNUNG: 26 sec; MATHEUS, JOY: 18 sec; CHERRY, MILL: 10 sec;
JUNSU, FRAME: 7 sec) RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY, MATHEUS. 42 seconds.

455
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,160
CRIS: Great.

456
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,240
TIMETHAI: Really want to win.

457
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,920
CRIS: JOY.

458
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Look, what a situation.

459
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,328
CRIS: It's a mess.

460
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,800
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG and TIME.

461
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,440
JANEYEH: Looks too tense.
So uncomfortable to watch.

462
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,560
TIMETHAI: Someone
has to give in a little bit.

463
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
- JANEYEH: Right.
- TIMETHAI: Yeah.

464
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,800
JANEYEH: Both are competing.

465
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Because
it's a love square, right?

466
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,800
RUSAMEEKAE: One, two, three, four.
It all connects, and feels like...

467
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,320
RUSAMEEKAE: There's some kind of energy.

468
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,000
CRIS: JOY chose SUNNY right from the start,
back when she didn't have a match.

469
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,360
RUSAMEEKAE: It's all chaos now. Don't know
who will end up loving whom, whatever happens.

470
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:04,920
(Dizzy)

471
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,432
RUSAMEEKAE: Or maybe the show

472
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,200
RUSAMEEKAE: will have a surprise?

473
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,000
CRIS: A newcomer now
would be a complete mess.

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,120
RUSAMEEKAE: But who knows,
anything can happen.

475
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Anything can happen
on this show, dear viewers.

476
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,680
RUSAMEEKAE: So let's continue
watching, shall we?

477
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,280
(Meanwhile, at X-Land)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

478
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
CRIS: Oops.

479
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,240
TIMETHAI: Wow.

480
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
RUSAMEEKAE: A newcomer has arrived.

481
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
CRIS: A newcomer just arrived.

482
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,960
JANEYEH: Wow.

483
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Is that a skirt or what?

484
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,760
TIMETHAI: Nope, it's not.

485
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,360
CRIS: Oh, he's a guy.

486
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Scout shoes.

487
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,480
CRIS: Wow.

488
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,680
CRIS: Whoa.

489
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,200
TIMETHAI: His nose is really sharp.

490
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,120
CRIS: His nose is really sharp.

491
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:07,760
(The new candidate will chat one-on-one with the five
handsome guys and choose one for a night at X-Land)

492
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,320
RUSAMEEKAE: The new candidate

493
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,520
RUSAMEEKAE: will get to talk
to all five guys.

494
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,720
CRIS: One at a time?

495
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,600
JANEYEH: I'm baffled.

496
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,080
RUSAMEEKAE: In the end, they have
to choose one candidate for a night at X-Land.

497
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,680
CRIS: Seriously?

498
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,440
TIMETHAI: You just flew in,
swooping right away?

499
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,160
JANEYEH: Really? Can't say 'No'?

500
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,360
RUSAMEEKAE: This show is tough.

501
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,440
CRIS: And who is he?

502
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,520
TIMETHAI: CEO.

503
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,560
CRIS: CEO.

504
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Is the show
allowed to do that?

505
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Suddenly, he doesn't have to
compete and just gets to choose a candidate.

506
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,280
TIMETHAI: Just flew in and swooped away.

507
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Swoop in
and instantly it's a date.

508
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Alright,
let's see who it'll be.

509
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,440
MATHEUS: This is actually X-Land?

510
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
MATHEUS: This is the way?

511
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,400
TIME: Yes, this is X-Land.

512
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
TOD: See?

513
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
TOD: See?

514
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:53,600
(Looking ahead)

515
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,400
TIME: Exciting?

TIMETHAI: Hello MARIO!

867
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:13,824
(super excited) RUSAMEEKAE: I'm so giddy
that I'm thinking like...

868
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,160
RUSAMEEKAE: No, it's only episode four.

869
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:17,480
JANEYEH: I'm sure there's something there.

870
00:40:17,536 --> 00:40:19,360
RUSAMEEKAE: I don't even want it to happen.

871
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,952
RUSAMEEKAE: But still...

872
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,040
JANEYEH: Target locked.

873
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,600
- CRIS: TOD is suitable
- JANEYEH: He's exactly the type in every way.

874
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,008
RUSAMEEKAE: From the very first episode,
the way we saw TOD has been different.

875
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,992
CRIS: I've never seen him
this bright before.

876
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:30,656
RUSAMEEKAE: But today we've
seen the real TOD.

877
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:31,648
TIMETHAI: He finally gets to shine.

878
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:32,672
RUSAMEEKAE: He's shining.

879
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:34,144
RUSAMEEKAE: He is charming.

880
00:40:34,144 --> 00:40:35,360
JANEYEH: Yeah, and he's got a way
with words too.

881
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,480
RUSAMEEKAE: So are we all sure

882
00:40:36,672 --> 00:40:39,136
RUSAMEEKAE: KONGPOP will

883
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,088
RUSAMEEKAE: definitely choose TOD?

884
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:47,320
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to know KONG's choice
in the end, listen carefully...

885
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:54,048
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's check out the one KONG
will invite to stay at X-Land together.

886
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,344
JUNSU: TOD, how are you doing?

887
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,680
CRIS: TOD, how are you doing?

888
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,344
TOD: Quite alright, good.

889
00:41:02,144 --> 00:41:03,480
(Really)

890
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,496
JUNSU: You were with that person, right?

891
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,584
TOD: Yeah.

892
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,560
- JUNSU: Conversation is too long.
- TOD: Oh.

893
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:13,152
- TOD: Really?
- TIME: Like for me, it's

894
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,624
TIME: you talked the longest with him.

895
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:15,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Eh?

896
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,872
TOD: Is that true?

897
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,360
TIME: Including all four of us.

898
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,464
TIME: All four of us.

899
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:19,584
TIME: It's still not as long.

900
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,800
JANEYEH: Oh!

901
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,472
TOD: Wow!

902
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,800
- ASSE: Really!
- MATHEUS: True!

903
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
JUNSU: Seriously, really.

904
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:26,624
CRIS: TOD's gotta be hopeful now, right?

905
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,720
(Next we'll announce
who gets to stay in X-Land.)

906
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's go.

907
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:44,192
JANEYEH: It's definitely TIME and TOD.

908
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:52,736
(Tense with anticipation) CRIS: If there's a plot twist
and he suddenly picks someone like ASSE, I'll cry.

909
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:56,352
(I can't accept this) RUSAMEEKAE: That's exactly
what I'm scared of, CRIS.

910
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:59,720
(Those who will stay
in X-Land this round)

911
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,664
RUSAMEEKAE: Please let it be
who we think.

912
00:42:03,008 --> 00:42:04,704
(There will be two people)

913
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,728
- CRIS: Uh-huh.
- JANEYEH: Uh-huh.

914
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,784
RUSAMEEKAE: Uh-huh.

915
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:08,544
CRIS: Seriously?

916
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:10,016
RUSAMEEKAE: See?

917
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,520
JANEYEH: There's always some twist.

918
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,480
CRIS: No one has such privilege,
and he just arrived.

919
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,904
TIMETHAI: That's what makes it chaotic.

920
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:16,544
CRIS: It's...

921
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
JUNSU: Huh?

922
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,240
(The first person is...)

923
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,592
(TOD)

924
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,712
TOD: Wow!

925
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,900
RUSAMEEKAE: That part is no surprise.
But why take a second person?

926
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,440
CRIS: Yeah, why drag another person in,
just to stress everyone out?

927
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,888
(And the second person is...)

928
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't you dare twist it!

929
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:39,920
(TIME)

930
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,112
CRIS: See, now it's messy.

931
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:44,736
RUSAMEEKAE: They brought three people
and now everyone's confused.

932
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,680
TIMETHAI: Just take the whole people
in the room, as roommates.

933
00:42:49,056 --> 00:42:52,064
(Let both of them go into X-Land.)

934
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:53,632
JUNSU: Good night.

935
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:55,584
CRIS: Hello.

936
00:42:55,904 --> 00:42:56,896
TOD: Wow!

937
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,832
- JUNSU: Bye, good night.
- ASSE: Bye-bye.

938
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,760
RUSAMEEKAE: Good night!
get back quickly, you three!

939
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,680
TOD: Bye!

940
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Wait, I really
can't stand it.

941
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:10,720
(Give me a moment)

942
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,712
CRIS: Gonna explode with emotions?

943
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,512
TIMETHAI: Keep it down.

944
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:17,480
JANEYEH: But I'm confused.

945
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:18,720
JANEYEH: Super confused.

946
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Okay then.

947
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,640
TIMETHAI: Keep it down,
and watch your language.

948
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,880
RUSAMEEKAE: I hardly even swore. Okay, sorry.

949
00:43:25,408 --> 00:43:27,648
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe TOD actually
does have matching chemistry with him.

950
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:29,480
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD will really open up here.

951
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:30,760
RUSAMEEKAE: But why take TIME?

952
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,640
- CRIS: Yeah
- RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe they don't want TIME to see.

953
00:43:32,928 --> 00:43:36,200
CRIS: And what if the three of them
are together, and the plot twists so that

954
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,584
CRIS: someone random
ends up left out alone.

955
00:43:43,328 --> 00:43:44,560
TIME: I still can't believe it.

956
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,112
- TOD: Wow, we're in X-Land now, oh my God.
- TIME: My God!

957
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:51,080
CRIS: Here we go.

958
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,256
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

959
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:01,320
TIMETHAI: Excited!

960
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,232
- LOVE(X)PERT: Oops
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oops

961
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,144
- TIME: Three, two, one.
- TOD: Three, two, one.

962
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
CRIS: Oops!

963
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops!

964
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:34,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Pretending to cover the face.

965
00:44:35,104 --> 00:44:36,064
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops!

966
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,536
JANEYEH: So sweet!

967
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:39,072
CRIS: Very sweet!

TOD: Wow!

969
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:44,192
TOD: Hello.

00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,320
KONG: Hello there.

973
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,296
CRIS: He really looks like
the owner's son too.

974
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:52,864
TIMETHAI: Yeah,
like the owner of this villa.

975
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:54,816

KONG: Since this morning,
or did you just skip lunch?

996
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:26,912
TOD: Because we were playing games.

997

TOD: At first I think I'm going to
like this person. But after I really get to talk to them,

1206
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,000
TOD: I end up liking that person more.

1207
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,634
(Look)

1208
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,560
CRIS: Look at his hand!

1209
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,800
CRIS: It's passing hands,
passing hands. Tap, tap.

1210
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:04,992
JANEYEH: That's great.

1211
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,072
JANEYEH: That's harsh!

1212
00:54:07,072 --> 00:54:08,192
CRIS: That's so harsh!

1213
00:54:11,104 --> 00:54:12,480
TIME: What are you trying to say?

1214
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:16,672
TOD: What are you trying to say?

1215
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:22,976
(Happy)

1216
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,552
(Eating fish)

1217
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,880
CRIS: Could you serve TIME?
Try serving TIME.

1218
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,600
(Stood up)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1219
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
(getting up)
JANEYEH: Hey.

1220
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,200
CRIS: Here it is!

1221
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,080
CRIS: See, he's serving TIME!

1222
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,720
(Fish)

1223
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:50,848
RUSAMEEKAE: Ouch!

1224
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my!
How would KONG feel then?

1225
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,280
CRIS: KONG has to fight for it.

1226
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,440
RUSAMEEKAE: It's total chaos now.

1227
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,304
CRIS: At first he thought he liked the meat dish,
but actually he likes the fish dish.

1228
00:55:10,304 --> 00:55:13,792
RUSAMEEKAE: Have you ever had
that experience where your taste changes?

1229
00:55:13,952 --> 00:55:16,320
TIMETHAI: Sometimes you just grab fish
and meat and eat them both together.

1230
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:19,616
RUSAMEEKAE: For me it's been clear
since the day I was born.

1231
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:23,168
RUSAMEEKAE: But there are lots of people
who might feel like, hey, I've got a girlfriend,

1232
00:55:23,168 --> 00:55:25,360
RUSAMEEKAE: and then when they grow up, boom,
their taste changes.

1233
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,720
RUSAMEEKAE: They get a boyfriend instead.
Or right now they like guys,

1234
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,072
RUSAMEEKAE: and when they grow up,
they change again and like women.

1235
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:35,440
JANEYEH: I feel like these days
things are more open, and some people, once they try it,

1236
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,256
JANEYEH: they're like, oh, it's not as bad as I thought.
They might just click. Some people fall for each other's personality.

1237
00:55:40,512 --> 00:55:42,120
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG, TIME,
and TOD's relationship.

1238
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,704
RUSAMEEKAE: Right now,
it's all confusing.

1239
00:55:44,832 --> 00:55:46,880
JANEYEH: But right now TIME and TOD
really look like they've got something going on.

1240
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,200
CRIS: Yeah, this round is TOD's.
Let KONG feel like he's gotta fight for TOD a bit.

1241
00:55:51,322 --> 00:55:51,840
CRIS: TOD, right?

1242
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,248
CRIS: TOD has become the hot one now.

1243
00:55:53,248 --> 00:55:54,144
RUSAMEEKAE: That's right.

1244
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:55,424
CRIS: He was what again, the waiter?

1245
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:57,408
TIMETHAI: He was staff.
Now he's the guest.

1246
00:55:57,408 --> 00:55:58,048
CRIS: Yeah.

1247
00:55:58,048 --> 00:56:02,336
RUSAMEEKAE: But honestly, anything can happen.
TIME is charming too.

1248
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:03,712
CRIS: Right.

1249
00:56:03,808 --> 00:56:06,560
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME isn't going back with them now.
He's staying at the villa.

1250
00:56:06,816 --> 00:56:11,776
RUSAMEEKAE: MATHEUS went back, but there's
some kind of vibe between NAMNUNG and SUNNY.

1251
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:15,264
CRIS: MATHEUS might shoot his shot
with SUNNY tonight.

1252
00:56:15,616 --> 00:56:18,624
RUSAMEEKAE: We don't know what's going
to happen, so let's stop guessing and just watch.

1253
00:56:18,688 --> 00:56:22,112
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see what happens
between NAMNUNG and SUNNY.

1254
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,400
SUNNY: Do you still think
TOD is your dad?

1255
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

1256
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:33,824
TIMETHAI: Oh wow!

1257
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,336
SUNNY: I've seen
a lot of your moments, you know.

1258
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,560
NAMNUNG: I don't know.
I just feel comfortable with him.

1259
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,680
NAMNUNG: You understand?

1260
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,760
SUNNY: Do you like MATHEUS?

1261
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,040
JANEYEH: Wow.

1262
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,192
TIMETHAI: Oh, oh, oh.

1263
00:56:57,472 --> 00:57:00,256
NAMNUNG: He might feel good about me,
or maybe not.

1264
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
NAMNUNG: Yeah.

1265
00:57:01,472 --> 00:57:02,976
NAMNUNG: We've both talked, like...

1266
00:57:03,072 --> 00:57:06,880
NAMNUNG: Well, I'm not set on you yet,
because I want to stay open to everyone.

1267
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,144
NAMNUNG: If you win the game again...

1268
00:57:10,336 --> 00:57:12,720
NAMNUNG: I probably wouldn't choose him.

1269
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,760
CRIS: Oh my God.

1270
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,520
SUNNY: I get it.

1271
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,864
SUNNY: Do you want to
get to know other people, right?

1272
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,840
NAMNUNG: Well, actually...

1273
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,320
NAMNUNG: When we chose each other...

1274
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1275
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,240
JANEYEH: I'm confused.

1276
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,160
NAMNUNG: Honestly, I wanted
to choose someone else.

1277
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,160
NAMNUNG: But MATHEUS chose me, you know.

1278
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:33,200
SUNNY: Yeah.

1279
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,040
SUNNY: You couldn't say no.

1280
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,840
NAMNUNG: I couldn't say no.

1281
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,560
NAMNUNG: But I still have the right
to choose one more person

1282
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,600
NAMNUNG: which would make it
three people.

1283
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,880
NAMNUNG: I didn't want to do that,
you understand?

1284
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,240
NAMNUNG: Because imagine
going there with three people.

1285
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,520
CRIS: So cute.

1286
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,320
- JANEYEH: Confusing.
- CRIS: It's so brutal, it's all messed up, really.

1287
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,920
MATHEUS: TOD was no surprise for me.

1288
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,880
ASSE: True.

1289
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:05,888
(Analyze) MATHEUS: Because TOD and TIME,
they were showing, well, their bodies, you know.

1290
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:07,880
(Sharp, Smart) (Truth)
RUSAMEEKAE: You guys weren't talking.

1291
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:12,544
MATHEUS: That's why they could see,
but we were a bit hiding, right?

1292
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:14,600
ASSE: Yeah yeah.

1293
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,600
CRIS: ASSE is cute.

1294
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,720
MATHEUS: And they sleep all together.

1295
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,280
JUNSU: Nice beds.

1296
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,760
JUNSU: Nice food.

1297
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,200

RUSAMEEKAE: JUNSU.

1299
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,680
MATHEUS: SUNNY, I'm coming.

1300
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,680
CRIS: "SUNNY, I'm coming."

1301
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,400
TIMETHAI: "SUNNY, I'm coming."

1302
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Just like CRIS said.

1303
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,360
CRIS: See?

1304
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,720
MATHEUS: SUNNY, I'm coming.

1305
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,600
LOVE(X)PERT: Hey.

1306
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,320
JUNSU: Excited.

1307
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,480

CRIS: JUNSU.

1309
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,000
MATHEUS: Really.

1310
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,080
MATHEUS: We look good.

1311
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow, CRIS,
you're good at guessing.

1312
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,080
CRIS: Of course,
he's gotta hit on SUNNY.

1313
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,240
TIMETHAI: It's already locked.

1314
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,320
CRIS: Locked already.

1315
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,560
RUSAMEEKAE: I want MATHEUS' shirt.

1316
00:58:51,264 --> 00:58:52,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1317
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,960
CRIS: You opened it the wrong way.

1318
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,880
RUSAMEEKAE: You opened it the wrong way.

1319
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,840
JOY: Help me.

1320
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,360
JOY: SUNNY is the strongest.

1321
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,608

I can do it.

1322
00:59:01,408 --> 00:59:02,000
JOY: SUNNY is the strongest.

1323
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,040

if TOD goes with TIME.

01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,160
CRIS: Please, wait, stop.

1540
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,928
(Confused)TIMETHAI: It's on the cheek.
What's wrong with your legs?

1541
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,840
CRIS: TOD looks too entertained.

1542
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,000
JANEYEH: He enjoys it.

1543
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,240
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG!

1544
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,160
TIMETHAI: My hands are all wet now.

1545
01:07:48,384 --> 01:07:49,824
JANEYEH: RUSAMEEKAE is jealous now.

1546
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,264
(Jealous)

1547
01:07:51,264 --> 01:07:52,640
(So unfair)RUSAMEEKAE: Why did they make me
the LOVE(X)PERT?

1548
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:53,696
RUSAMEEKAE: Why not
let me be on the island?

1549
01:07:53,696 --> 01:07:55,168
RUSAMEEKAE: I can stay there,
I'm not afraid of the sun either.

1550
01:07:55,168 --> 01:07:56,160
(Want to be the lucky one)

1551
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,040
TOD: It says "twice."

1552
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,200
CRIS: Twice?

1553
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:01,760
CRIS: TOD's says "twice"?

1554
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,312
KONG: Sure thing.

1555
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:07,160
(Absolutely fabulous)- CRIS: "Sure thing."
- JANEYEH: "Sure thing."

1556
01:08:07,424 --> 01:08:09,824
(Maybe hold back a little, sweetheart) RUSAMEEKAE: KONG, when a guy
is going to kiss like that...

1557
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:10,280
(Seeing through it)
CRIS: Yeah?

1558
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,984
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe turn away sometimes,
you can use a pillow to cover your face.

1559
01:08:13,984 --> 01:08:15,136
JANEYEH: Pretend a little.

1560
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:15,552
(Can't hold back jealousy)
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

1561
01:08:15,936 --> 01:08:17,376
RUSAMEEKAE: Now it's like "Yeah, yeah."

1562

(Giving a death stare)
(Haha)

1563
01:08:20,288 --> 01:08:21,600
KONG: Sure thing.

1564
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,840
JANEYEH: You need to be
a bit more proper, sweetheart.

1565
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:27,072
(Look)

1566
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:29,344

of the person in the middle.

1567
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,208
TOD: Let's take a picture

1568
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,160

JANEYEH: Hey, hey.

1575
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,680

KONG: One, two, three.

1577
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:54,944
(Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh)

1578
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,880
JANEYEH: Hey.

1579
01:08:59,744 --> 01:09:01,216
JANEYEH: Don't play like this, okay?

1580
01:09:04,064 --> 01:09:06,208
CRIS: It's too intense.

1581
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,120
- TIMETHAI: Hey.
- JANEYEH: Hey.

1582
01:09:11,136 --> 01:09:13,888

especially with KONG.

1583
01:09:19,776 --> 01:09:20,448
(Making a funny face)
TIMETHAI: Hey.

1584
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,560
JANEYEH: Hey, hey.

1585
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:23,584
(Don't tease me)

1586
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:24,840
CRIS: TIME is blushing too.

1587
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:26,368
RUSAMEEKAE: He was
just like a king cobra.

1588
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:27,712
(I can do it too)

1589
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,560
TOD: I'm ready to sleep.

1590
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
JANEYEH: Wow.

1591
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,320
TOD: I'm ready to sleep.

TIME: Hey.

1593
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,992
(Move closer)

1594
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my.

1595
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,080
CRIS: What's with these two?

1596
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,600
CRIS: Oh, it's really intense.

1597
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
CRIS: Really intense.

1598
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,760
JANEYEH: Hey, hey, hey.

1599
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,200
JANEYEH: TOD is so small.

1600
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
TIME: Hey.

1601
01:09:54,752 --> 01:09:56,080
JANEYEH: What is this?

1602
01:10:01,472 --> 01:10:03,600
(Hug)
TIMETHAI: Ah.

1603
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,176
(Hug)

1604
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,208
(So exciting)- TIMETHAI: Wow.
- JANEYEH: Woo.

1605
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,304
JANEYEH: KONG's face looks so happy.

1606
01:10:15,706 --> 01:10:16,959
TIMETHAI: Get me out of here.

1607
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,816
JANEYEH: This is how it ends?

1608
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,480
(Can't take it, whining)
TIMETHAI: Get me out of here.

1609
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,120
CRIS: The lights are off again.

1610
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,440
RUSAMEEKAE: My feeling right now...

1611
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,088
CRIS: How is it?

1612
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:25,856
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm upset.

1613
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,040
(Jealous)

1614
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,760
TIMETHAI: Good thing
the game ended there.

1615
01:10:29,888 --> 01:10:30,840
(Time for jealousy is limited)

1616
01:10:31,008 --> 01:10:32,960
CRIS: Is it over?
Is there a preview for next week?

1617
01:10:33,152 --> 01:10:33,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Do you want to know it?

1618
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,160
JANEYEH: Oh, I want to see now,
how's it gonna be?

1619
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:41,312
RUSAMEEKAE: There's a preview
for next week. How spicy will it be?

1620
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,200
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's watch together.

1621
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,920
(Want to meet the singles?
Send love to your favorite singles.)

1622
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,680
(On WeTV app to chat
with them in the livestream)

1623
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
(Preview)
JANEYEH: Alright.

1624
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,800
(Today, there will be two games
in the shell coin challenge.)

1625
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,192
(Hug and catch the ball by the beach)

1626
01:11:00,544 --> 01:11:01,880
(Rolling love on the beach)

1627
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,640
- CRIS: As expected of SUNNY.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Ahh!

1628
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:10,880
(Respect)

1629
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,376
(Touch)

1630
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,320

CANDIDATE: Late-night chat on the lawn.

1632
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,456
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

1633
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,680
FRAME: You can choose two people,
one for Fall In Love and one for One Night Stand.

1634
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,160
CRIS: Oh my god.

1635
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,400
RUSAMEEKAE: How is it gonna be?

1636
01:11:39,264 --> 01:11:42,200
NAMNUNG: After you've heard it,
you still can't decide?

1637
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,560
- TIMETHAI: Oh!
- CRIS: So harsh.

1638
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1639
01:11:47,296 --> 01:11:48,560
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my god.

1640
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,600
CRIS: Oh my god.

1641
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,360
CRIS: So brutal.

1642
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,280
JANEYEH: Oh, this game is so intense.

1643
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,880
CRIS: Oh, so intense.

1644
01:11:57,152 --> 01:11:58,368
CRIS: Oh, TOD.

1645
01:11:59,744 --> 01:12:01,080
RUSAMEEKAE: They could end up
hating each other.

1646
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,360
SUNNY: Without opening your eyes,

1647
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,240
SUNNY: you must use your sense of smell.

1648
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,480
CRIS: Here we go again,
what game is this?

1649
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,760
SUNNY: Go kiss the person
you like the most.

1650
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my god.

1651
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,440
JOY: Do you want to know
who KONG wants to kiss?

1652
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,440
CANDIDATE: This is crazy.

1653
01:12:12,608 --> 01:12:13,984
NAMNUNG: SUNNY, I choose you.

1654
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,240
LOVE(X)PERT: My girls.

1655
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,848
CRIS: It's all messed up.

1656
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:33,200
TIMETHAI: The beach earlier
was somewhat better.

1657
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,320
CRIS: So much tension everywhere.

1658
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,224
(Tired)

1659
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:40,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Honestly, everyone,
we want to scream

1660
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,040
RUSAMEEKAE: but I have to say
it's so unpredictable.

1661
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,880
RUSAMEEKAE: This is just a teaser
for next week.

1662
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,104
CRIS: It's giving me a headache.

1663
01:12:47,104 --> 01:12:49,568
(Holding head)RUSAMEEKAE: Of course, CRIS,
we saw the game.

1664
01:12:49,984 --> 01:12:52,800
RUSAMEEKAE: That's why I said
we probably need new pairs each time.

1665
01:12:52,928 --> 01:12:54,600
RUSAMEEKAE: We don't know
who'll pair with whom.

1666
01:12:54,816 --> 01:12:59,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Plus that last game, where they
had to open up, asking each other to do this and that.

1667
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,360
RUSAMEEKAE: No one can answer that.
We all have to wait and see.

1668
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,200
RUSAMEEKAE: For next week, I can say
the shell coin competition is intense.

1669
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,040
RUSAMEEKAE: If you're wondering
what comes next,

1670
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:18,624
RUSAMEEKAE: keep watching,
Saturday at 6 PM Beijing Time, only on WeTV

1671
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:21,600
- RUSAMEEKAE: with Borderless Love, LOVE(X).
- CRIS: With Borderless Love, LOVE(X).

1672
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,120
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's go for now, everyone.

1673
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm so stressed.
Bye-bye, everyone.
