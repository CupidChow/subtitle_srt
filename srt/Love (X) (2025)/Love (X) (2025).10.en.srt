00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,624
CRIS: And before that,
FRAME came in new.

175
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
CRIS: These two coming in
really stirred things up.

176
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Hmm.

177
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,720
CRIS: It's chaos, what used to be a love
triangle is now a square, then pentagon.

178
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,192
RUSAMEEKAE: It's confusing for everyone.

179
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:40,720
CRIS: So confusing.

180
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Are you curious about it?

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's go have a look.

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,448
PEANUT: Okay. Let's go.

183
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,960
SUNNY: Just came to save the day.

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,464
MILL: Hello.

185
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,736
KONG: Hello.

186
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:53,632
MILL: Hello.

187
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,520
KONG: Hello, hello.

188
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,520
(Talkative)
JUNSU: KONGPONG.

189
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,000
MILL: KONGPONG.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,600
MILL: Hello.

191
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,400
JOY: Hello.

192
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,520
(Correcting)
NAMNUNG: KONGPOP.

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,696
JOY: It's KONGPOP.

194
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:07,480
JOY: KONGPONG? Ah, KONGPOP.

195
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,880
JOY: Hello.

196
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,680
KONG: Oh.

197
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,120
KONG: Did we miscommunicate?

198
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,928
KONG: The names are all mixed up.

199
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:13,792
(Pleased)

200
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:14,944
JOY: Can I have a hug, please?

201
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,560
CRIS: JOY is going all out friendly!

202
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Dear JOY.

203
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
CRIS: Dear JOY.

204
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,768
JUNSU: KONGPOP, KONGPOP.

205
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:28,352
(Chanting)
JUNSU: KONGPOP.

206
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,616
- KONG: KONG, KONG, KONG from "camera"
- JUNSU: KONG, KONG, POP. KONGPOP.

207
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:36,640
KONG: Yes.

208
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,664
(That's correct)
CRIS: Cute.

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,040
RUSAMEEKAE: Is JUNSU
finding out about KONG?

210
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,520
CANDIDATES: Like.

211
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,424
TIME: Where's MATHEUS?
To think of it, where is he?

212
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:45,160
TIME: Where's MATHEUS?

213
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,240
PEANUT: He's asking about MATHEUS.

214
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,480
NAMNUNG: Probably went to the hospital.

215
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,376
TOD: Really?

216
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,912
- TIME: What's not coming out?
- TOD: Oh my god.

217
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,088
MILL: It doesn't come out.
MATHEUS always gets hit.

218
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,032
MILL: Got pushed down.

219
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:56,736
JOY: It's all about MATHEUS.

220
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,600
CRIS: Don't ask MATHEUS for the truth,
I'm begging you, TIME.

221
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,440
CANDIDATES: Huh?

222
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,000
(Now, everyone is invited to the beach.)

223
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,200
JANEYEH: It's starting.

224
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,120
(We are about to start a new round
of the shell coin competition.)

225
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,920
SUNNY: Shell coin competition again!

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,848
TIMETHAI: Loves playing games.

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,800
TOD: Let's go!

228
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,160
JUNSU: To the beach!

229
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,600
TOD: Go. First time playing the game.

230
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,552
KONG: What game is this?

231
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,520
TOD: Ahaha!

232
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,672
(Squeezing shoulder)
CRIS: Oh.

233
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,520
(Stealing a glance)

234
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,112
JANEYEH: Ouch.

235
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,160
PEANUT: His face says it all.

236
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,320
TOD: Is the sand hot?

237
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,400
(Showing concern)
NAMNUNG: Not hot.

238
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:51,840
(Sneaking a glance)
PEANUT: He doesn't know TOD treats everyone like this.

239
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,576
(Checking himself)
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

240
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:54,400
TIME: Is it hot?

241
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,448
(Showing concern)
SUNNY: No, not at all.

242
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
SUNNY: I can take it off.

243
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,280
(Looking left)
CRIS: He feels a bit hurt, though.

244
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
(Looking right)
RUSAMEEKAE: What are you gonna do, KONG?

245
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,760
JANEYEH: Ouch, stuck in the middle.

246
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:05,632
(Kicking sand for fun)

247
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,760
(Today's shell coin competition
includes two games.)

248
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,120
(Now entering the first game.)

249
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,480
(Catch and hug the ball by the beach.)

250
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,608
TIME: Catch and hug the ball.

251
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:21,280
(Catch and hug the ball by the beach)
NAMNUNG: Ah, catching the ball.

252
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,432
MILL: What?

253
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
TOD: Catch and hug the ball.

254
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,248
(The rule is that both people must throw
the ball up, and turn around once.)

255
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,440
(Turn around and hug)
(Embrace each other to keep the ball trapped between your bodies.)

256
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,072
(If the ball stays in place,)

257
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:39,936
(Catch the ball with your body)
(you succeed. The couple with the most catches wins.)

258
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,272
KONG: Throw it up, turn around quickly,
and hug to keep the ball between us.

259
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:47,840
SUNNY: Oh, okay.

260
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
JUNSU: Oh.

261
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,560
TIME: By the sea.

262
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,520
JUNSU: Sea.

263
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,600
JUNSU: Yay.

264
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,224
(Pairing up before the competition)
CANDIDATE: Yay.

265
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:57,360
CANDIDATE: Okay.

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,072
(Before getting into choosing pairs,)

267
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,960
(the newcomer has the right
to choose a partner first.)

268
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,568
(Please choose your partner.)

269
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:08,512
(Have the right to choose a partner first)
CANDIDATES: KONG.

270
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:10,656
- CANDIDATES: Wow.
- JANEYEH: So strong.

271
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:15,296
CANDIDATE: KONG.

272
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,912
NAMNUNG: Come on, KONG, go for it!

273
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,520
JANEYEH: I think KONG may pick
a new person other than TIME and TOD.

274
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,368
RUSAMEEKAE: So, will he pick
a woman or a man?

275
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,200
PEANUT: Might be a new guy.

276
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,624
(Aiming)

277
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,400
KONG: Why're you so still?

278
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,744
(Aiming)
CRIS: Is it ASSE?

279
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
CRIS: CHERRY may hit you.

280
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,880
KONG: Who should I choose?

281
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,824
JANEYEH: Please don't, dear.

282
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,360
RUSAMEEKAE: JUNSU is nervous. He wants
to pair with FRAME from the start.

283
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,000
KONG: I choose JUNSU.

284
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,048
KONG: JUNSU.

285
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
CRIS: You're awesome.

286
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
CRIS: That's bad.

287
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,400
CRIS: That's bad.

288
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
CRIS: That's bad.

289
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:03,168
(Looking immediately)
CRIS: He turned to ask for permission.

290
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,872
RUSAMEEKAE: KONG, don't get involved.

291
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,328
JANEYEH: He doesn't know anything,
he's not wrong.

292
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,856
(Grabbing the arm)

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
PEANUT: Oh.

294
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,640
JANEYEH: Hey, hey!

295
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:22,080
(Can't hold back a smile)
CRIS: KONG.

296
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:27,648
(Squeezing)
JANEYEH: He's checking. Checking.

297
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,752
- PEANUT: FRAME is awkward now.
- CRIS: Oh.

298
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:32,544
(Successful pairing)

299
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,752
(Hello, hello)
- JUNSU: Hello! - KONG: Hello!

300
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,864
(Tapping)
CRIS: Checking muscles again.

301
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,264
KONG: I feel JUNSU has a good build.
When he talks or something like that,

302
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:48,512
KONG: he talks in a cute way, so I chose
him as the first pair for the game.

303
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,640
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah.

304
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
CRIS: But I still believe that
JUNSU likes FRAME.

305
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,040
RUSAMEEKAE: JUNSU likes FRAME.

306
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,112
(The remaining 9 people will proceed to
the eye-contact round to find partners.)

307
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,848
(Pairing by eye contact)
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

308
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,896
(The rule is that)

309
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,232
(one will turn their back to everyone.)

310
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
(Anyone who wants to be their partner)

311
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,968
(walks over and gently taps them
on the shoulder from behind.)

312
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,856
(When they turn around,)

313
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:13,152
(the first person to make eye contact
with them will become a pair.)

314
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,264
RUSAMEEKAE: Who will end up with whom?

315
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,112
MILL: Anyone wants to go first?

316
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY.

317
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,920
SUNNY: I'm going first.

318
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,760
JANEYEH: There you go.

319
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,744
SUNNY: I'm going first.

320
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:30,432
TIME: I'm going...

321
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:31,648
(The two going out together)
CANDIDATES: Oh.

322
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,472
JANEYEH: That's an intense look.

323
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,736
JOY: Ladies first.

324
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:39,328
(Stepping back)
CRIS: Well done, JOY.

325
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,016
(The first)
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY wraps it up.

326
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,608
TOD: You can tell
just by the shadow, right?

327
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Who's brave enough
to walk over?

328
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
JOY: Go over there.

329
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
TIME: Close your eyes.

330
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,600
SUNNY: Close the eyes.

331
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:52,192
(Waiting)

332
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,120
(Observing)

333
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:01,568
(Stop)

334
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:07,392
(Walking out)

335
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:12,992
(Walking out)
JANEYEH: That's intense.

336
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,840
(2 people walking out)
JANEYEH: JOY is fond of SUNNY.

337
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,920
CRIS: NAMNUNG will go soon. Let's see.

338
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,680
TIMETHAI: But it depends on
who she turns to first.

339
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,928
(Walking back)
JOY: She's all yours.

340
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:25,840
JOY: She's all yours.

341
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:27,232
CRIS: Why are you speaking?

342
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,192
(Stepping back together)
TIME: No.

343
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:29,664
(Going back)

344
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,080
TIME: You go ahead.

345
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,200
CRIS: Why saying that?

346
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,440
(Backing off)
RUSAMEEKAE: What's going on with TIME?

347
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:35,560
(Looking)
TIMETHAI: He's unclear, right?

348
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,016
(Looking)

349
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:40,864
(Bailing out)

350
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:45,920
(If you're ready...)

(1.)

354
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,224
(Nudging)

355
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,320

00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,320
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my!

357
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,384

I was looking for where it was.

364
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:17,632
(Observing)

365
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,488
(Pair successfully) - RUSAMEEKAE: JOY has
protected SUNNY since the fruit game. - CRIS: Right.

366
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:24,928
JOY: At first, I passed this to TIME.

367
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,240

368
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,280

CRIS: FRAME is tied to whom?

374
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,040
(Anticipating) JANEYEH:
So intense, without JUNSU.

375
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,576

MILL: Join the group.

385

(The third one)

390
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,280
CRIS: If TIME doesn't walk over to tap,

391
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,080
CRIS: I'll cry out.

392
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:28,352

shoulder, please stand behind her.)

(Walking over)

398
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,320
CRIS: Will TIME walk over too?

399
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,488
TIMETHAI: Such an overthinker!

400
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:47,808
(Walking over)

401
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,944
(2 people walking out)

402
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,440
TIMETHAI: They're even wearing
swapped colors.

403
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, swap outfits.

404
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,480

(2...)

414
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
RUSAMEEKAE: I can't breathe right now.

415
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,216
(1.)

416
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:27,584
(Reaching out)

417

(Turning to TOD)

426
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,320
(Giving a smack)
CRIS: TOD is smart.

427
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,320
CRIS: A round of applause for TOD.

428
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,648
TIME: Is this allowed?

429
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:49,680
TIMETHAI: This technique is okay.

430
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,080

(Pair successfully)
TIMETHAI: Oh, wow.

432
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,168

He's all about the good vibes.

433
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,176
JANEYEH: KONG is confused now.

434
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,120

440
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,760

and CHERRY are too obvious, aren't they?

441
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:14,528
JANEYEH: No need to let them pick.

442
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:16,256

443
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:17,608

449
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:30,160
JANEYEH: "Go ahead, bro.
I'm heading to the sea now."

450
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,344

RUSAMEEKAE: Wow!

454
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,144

where the hero proposes to the heroine.

455
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,728
(Smiling)
CRIS: So cute.

(Pair successfully)

463
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:22,400

465
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,656
- NAMNUNG: Didn't poke me.
- TOD: He did.

466
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,376

KONG would be too popular.

(Peeking)

486
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:22,120

487
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,080
JANEYEH: NAMNUNG's confused.

488
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,360

491
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,040
NAMNUNG: Ah, they had you stand together
because you're paired up.

492
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,240
(Now, both teams, please bring out the ball
and take positions for the competition.)

493
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,160
(The first pair is about
to start playing)

504
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,592
PEANUT: JUNSU, what are you doing?

505
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,560

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,320
SUNNY: You can do it.

518
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:43,400
JOY: I trust you.

519
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,432
(Touching lightly) - RUSAMEEKAE: JOY!
- LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, wow, JOY!

520
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,072
JANEYEH: I feel sorry for NAMNUNG.

521
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,480
SUNNY: Oh, right, I've never
teamed up with JOY in any game.

522
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,824
Not sure what she thinks about it,
but I usually blush more with women than with men.

523
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,912
CRIS: Wow! She's shy!

524
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:03,936
PEANUT: She has a feeling for her.

525
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,360
CRIS: NAMNUNG's got a rival now.

526
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:14,560
(If you're ready...)

527
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:16,278
JUNSU: Fast, fast, okay?

528
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:17,728
(3...)

529
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,264
TIMETHAI: Seems like it's pretty tough.

530
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,768
(2,)

531
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:23,072
(1.)

532
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
TIMETHAI: Hey, three of them...

533
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,272
(JOY fell down)
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow!

534
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,208
(No points)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops, this is tough.

535
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,800
(Can they catch the ball?)
CRIS: Wow, this game is tough.

536
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,256
(The ball is falling)

537
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,048
(Sliding on his knees)

538
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:55,499
CRIS: Hey! The pose!

539
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,360
(Holding the ball)
TIMETHAI: It's safe!

540
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
CRIS: This pose is very dangerous.

541
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,728
CRIS: This pose is very dangerous.

542
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,664
TIMETHAI: Not touching the ball at all.

543
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,616
RUSAMEEKAE: Not touching
the ball at all.

544
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:19,125
JANEYEH: This is too much.

545
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:21,312
(Skin-to-skin)

546
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:22,760
TIMETHAI: Did KONG get
a special privilege or something?

547
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,512
CRIS: Yeah, right. Did KONG get
a special privilege or something?

548
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,560
JUNSU: We got it!

549
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:32,480
(Scored one point)

550
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:36,360
LOVE(X)PERT: They did it weirdly.

551
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,800
JANEYEH: So happy.

552
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:44,480
PEANUT: KONG is having
a sweet dream today.

553
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,680
TIMETHAI: Having a sweet dream
since yesterday.

554
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,400
CRIS: FRAME is confused.

555
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,728
(Next pair, please.)

556
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,360
RUSAMEEKAE: How's this pair? ASSE.

557
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:54,960
PEANUT: All that's left for this pair
is to buy the ring.

558
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,640
JOY: Go and try again.

559
00:23:56,992 --> 00:23:58,368
- JOY: You can do it.
- SUNNY: Oh, is it us again?

560
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,472
(Second round:
TIME, SUNNY VS CHERRY, ASSE)

561
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:02,812
TIME: Do you wanna rest first?

562
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:03,200
(Attentive)

563
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
SUNNY: I'm fine. Okay.

564
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

565
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:10,304
CRIS: When paired with JOY,
it's one thing.

566
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:11,640
CRIS: Once paired with TIME,

567
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,832
CRIS: it becomes another thing.

568
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,080
CHERRY: You throw.

569
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,464
ASSE: Okay.

570
00:24:14,464 --> 00:24:15,800
TIMETHAI: Oh, look at this pair
and that pair.

571
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,040
ASSE: Just a moment.

572
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,760
CHERRY: Mhm.

573
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,960
TIMETHAI: So different.
The sea is too romantic now.

574
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:24,992
MILL: The music, cue!

575
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,176
CRIS: MILL said, "The music, cue!"

576
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
JUNSU: ASSE!

577
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,352
JOY: Do your best!

578

JOY: Sorry, sorry.

580
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:35,708
CRIS: So cute.

581
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:39,454
TIME: Don't get it, though.

582
00:24:39,454 --> 00:24:40,224
SUNNY: Okay, I won't.

583
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:43,296
SUNNY: I'll just stay still
and wait to hug you.

584
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:43,744
TIME: Okay.

585
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:45,952
PEANUT: "I'll just stay still
and wait to hug you."

586
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,056
JANEYEH: Mother is mothering.

587
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:50,592
SUNNY: I'll just stay still
and wait to hug you.

588
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,584
TIME: Okay.

589
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:52,160
TIME: Okay.

590

Good luck. - SUNNY: Yeah. Crazy.

592

TIME: Good luck.

593
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:00,440
(Reaching out a hand)

594

TIMETHAI: Hehe.

595
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,440
(Holding hands)
JANEYEH: Reaching out a hand.

596
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,048
(If you're ready...)

597
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,640
(Start.)

598
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,152
CRIS: She loves playing games
and has to win.

599
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:35,296
(Touching each other) - PEANUT: Oh.
- LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, wow.

600
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:38,099
(Intimately)

601
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:39,480
RUSAMEEKAE: It's like shooting
a pre-wedding.

602
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,440
(Hugging)

603
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,424
(Hugging tightly)

604
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:57,080
(Got one point)

605
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Whoever breaks
this couple up

606
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,544
RUSAMEEKAE: is really bad.

607
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,792
RUSAMEEKAE: It's sinful.

608
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,440
JANEYEH: You'll be cursed.

609
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:11,760
JANEYEH: They're just using the game
as an excuse to hug.

610
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,984
(Hugging tightly)

611
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,608

(Hugging)

613
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:19,936
TOD: What?

614
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,000
CRIS: What are you shy about?

615
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,079
TIME: Oh, my God.

616
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,736
SUNNY: It was fun, but I was a bit shy.

617
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:34,176
TIMETHAI: Oh, you're being shy, SUNNY?

618
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,370
SUNNY: Is that allowed?

619
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
CRIS: Is that allowed?

620
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:40,451
TIME: I don't know. I couldn't get.

621
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,480
TIME: Is that allowed?

622
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,840
(Caught the ball with hands, No points)

623
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,240

624
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
PEANUT: Asking for one more try, huh?

625
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,304
- JUNSU: No.
- FRAME: No way.

626
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,456

One point; TIME, SUNNY: Zero points)

628
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,760
TIME: Okay.

629
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,320
CRIS: SUNNY didn't score at all
in two rounds.

630
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:01,440

One point; TIME, SUNNY: Zero points)

VS NAMNUNG, TOD) CRIS: Oh, here it comes.

633
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,048
(If you're ready...)

634
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,680
(Start.)

635
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,024
CRIS: This game is tough.

636
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:14,791
JUNSU: Go for it!

637
00:27:24,128 --> 00:27:24,544
(The ball is falling)

638
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:28,608
RUSAMEEKAE: Why am I holding my breath?
I'm holding my breath right now.

639
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:33,000
(Caught the ball)

640

RUSAMEEKAE: Awesome.

645
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:46,816
CRIS: They're really cute.

646
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,880
CRIS: But they're literally
just friends.

647
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,200
- JUNSU: That's not allowed.
- TIME: Why?

648
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Why is that?

649
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,152
TIME: Have to spin.

650
00:27:57,504 --> 00:27:58,097
ASSE: TOD.

651
00:27:58,304 --> 00:27:59,456
CRIS: TOD has to spin.

652
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,219
TOD: One more?

653
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:01,888
(Didn't spin)

654
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600

(Throwing the ball coolly)

656
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,120

657
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:11,720
(Rushing to catch)

658
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,856
- TIMETHAI: Catch it with chest muscles.
- JANEYEH: With chest muscles, haha.

659
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,728
(So happy)

660
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,536
(But it can't escape JUNSU's eyes)
- JUNSU: That doesn't count. - TIME: Not allowed.

661
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:22,304

(No points)

663
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,304
TOD: Okay, sorry.

664
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,072
(They still don't understand the rules)
TOD: Let's do it again.

665
00:28:27,744 --> 00:28:29,440
TOD: Let's do it again. I know now
I can't throw too high.

666
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,000
CRIS: Throw it just as high, TOD.

667
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,376
(If you're ready...)

668
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
RUSAMEEKAE: These two are
definitely great.

669
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,280
(Moving perfectly in sync)

670
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,944

(Caught the ball)

673

TIME: Nice catch.

674
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:55,264
CRIS: They're screaming
at the same time.

675
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,120
(Got two points)

676
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:03,744
- TIME: This counts.
- JUNSU: This counts.

677
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:04,320
JUNSU: This counts.

678
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,440
- TIME: That doesn't count.
- JUNSU: That doesn't count. What's that?

679
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,800
TOD: Why?

680
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:09,824
- NAMNUNG: What?
- TOD: Why?

681
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,400
(Why doesn't that count?)
CRIS: That doesn't count either?

682
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,640
(Here's the answer why that doesn't count)
CRIS: Why again?

683
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
(Spinning gracefully one more time)

684
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:18,272

- JUNSU: That's not allowed.

687
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,920
(Can't escape JUNSU's eyes)
TIME: It's not allowed.

688
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,960
(Can't escape eyes of JUNSU and TIME)
JUNSU: That doesn't count.

689
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,480
TOD: Please.

690
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,200
TOD: Please,
can't I just have one shell coin?

691
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,400
TOD: Can't I just have one shell coin?

692
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:41,248
(TOD is pleading)

693
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,400
(Laughing happily)
CRIS: JUNSU is funny.

694
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:47,008
TOD: Please.

695
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
TOD: Can I?

696
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,000
JANEYEH: What are you doing, TOD?

697
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,680
NAMNUNG: You, listen!

698
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,080
(Me?)
NAMNUNG: Listen!

699
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,472
NAMNUNG: Okay?

700
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,520
JUNSU: No need to say.

701
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,524
NAMNUNG: You guys.

702
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
NAMNUNG: How did you handle
the first ball earlier?

703
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,080
JUNSU: Okay,
you can have one shell coin.

704
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
- JANEYEH: Oh, she really hit him.
- NAMNUNG: Huh?

705
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,400
- RUSAMEEKAE: Does she have something on her mind?
- NAMNUNG: Stop.

706
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,640
(Gave in)
- TIME: You can have one shell coin. - NAMNUNG: What?

707
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:17,320
(Round three results: MILL and FRAME, two points
NAMNUNG and TOD, one point)

708
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,760
JANEYEH: That is a long-held feeling
coming out.

709
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,880
RUSAMEEKAE: It's not related to
the game, is it?

710
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,240
JANEYEH: It's totally not related to
the game.

711
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:25,240
(Round three results: MILL and FRAME, two points,
NAMNUNG and TOD, one point)

712
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,680
(Congratulations to MILL and FRAME)

713
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,920
(for receiving the most balls)

714
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,840
TIMETHAI: But these two are
really amazing.

715
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
CANDIDATES: Share some with us.

716
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:39,842
(Results of the beach ball game:
MILL and FRAME, two points, CHERRY and ASSE, one point)

717
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:41,888
(NAMNUNG and TOD, one point, KONG and JUNSU, one point,
TIME and SUNNY zero points, JOY and SUNNY zero points)

718
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,200
RUSAMEEKAE: We were all stunned
by that beach ball game.

719
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,880
RUSAMEEKAE: It was so fun.

720
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,200
CRIS: Is there another game?

721
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,480
RUSAMEEKAE: It's even more intense.
Do you know what it's called?

722
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,440
CRIS: What game?

723
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,400
(Rolling Love on the Beach)
RUSAMEEKAE: The Rolling Love on the Beach game.

724
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,480
JANEYEH: Rolling.

725
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,560
RUSAMEEKAE: We've started
to understand the show now.

726
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Seems like
they're pairing up again.

727
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,640
CRIS: Oh, they have to pair up again.

728
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's watch together how intense
the Rolling Love on the Beach game will be.

729
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,240
(Next up is the second game of today,)

730
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,520
(Rolling Love on the Beach.)

731
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:12,440
(Rolling Love on the Beach)

732
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
CRIS: How do they roll?

733
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,040
(In the last round,
MILL and FRAME were the winners.)

734
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,400
(Therefore, they get the privilege
to pick their partners first.)

735
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
- RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.
- PEANUT: Oh!

736
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,520
(Others can freely choose
their partners.)

737
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,880
(But there's an important rule.)

738
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,240
(You must not pair with one
from the last round.)

739
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
(Can't choose the same person)
JANEYEH: Oh, no.

740
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,600
CRIS: Let's start with the unlucky ones.

741
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,960
CRIS: ASSE and CHERRY.

742
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,336
RUSAMEEKAE: Why?

743
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,880
CRIS: Next is TIME,
who wants to get to know SUNNY better.

744
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,760
PEANUT: They've already paired up.

745
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,440
RUSAMEEKAE: At this moment,
NAMNUNG is like...

746
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,080
JANEYEH: It's my time.

747
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,640
CRIS: It's time.

748
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
TIMETHAI: How about KONGPOP
and TOD this time?

749
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,240
- PEANUT: Oops.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Oops.

750
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,480
CRIS: You're really good at this.

751
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see
who is paired with whom.

752
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,795
NAMNUNG: TOD.

753
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
FRAME: So, we must not pair up?

754
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,040
(Now, let's have our winners,
MILL and FRAME, choose their partners.)

755
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,320
RUSAMEEKAE: JUNSU is already
waiting for FRAME.

756
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,520
FRAME: JUNSU.

757
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,720
RUSAMEEKAE: She chose so quickly,
without a thought.

758
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,360
JANEYEH: Totally awesome.

759
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:18,720
(Peeking)

760
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,560
MILL: SUNNY.

761
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,272
CRIS: SUNNY!

762
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,160
(Peeking)
JANEYEH: Hey, TIME!

763
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,400
TIMETHAI: But TIME can't choose anyway.

764
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:28,978
TIMETHAI: Wow.

765
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,560
CRIS: JOY chose TIME.

766
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,760
CRIS: NAMNUNG wasn't quick enough.

767
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,400
CRIS: And now, who is TOD with?

768
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,640
- NAMNUNG: Oh, are they paired already?
- ASSE: Oh.

769
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,440
CRIS: Oh, there are three people left,
how do they do?

770
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
PEANUT: Oh, TOD and CHERRY.

771
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,920
CRIS: And who is paired with ASSE?

772
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,520
(No pair)
(ASSE, who has no pair, can freely choose a partner)

773
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,840
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey.

774
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:54,920
(Who will ASSE choose?)

775
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,160
PEANUT: Don't harm yourself, ASSE.

776
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,080
CRIS: CHERRY is looking at him.

777
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,320
(Praying)
RUSAMEEKAE: JUNSU, maybe?

778
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,920
ASSE: I choose JUNSU.

779
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,240
(Excited)
RUSAMEEKAE: I thought so.

780
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Look at CHERRY.

781
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:05,920
(Following CHERRY)

782
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,520
CRIS: ASSE, you're good.

783
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,360
JUNSU: Guys.

784
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,120
CRIS: JUNSU looks very happy today.

785
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,960
(Rolling Love on the Beach.)

786
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,520
(Two players must hug tightly.)

787
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,520
(Then roll along the path
to grab the flag.)

788
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,720
(Fight for the flag)
(The team who takes the least time)

789
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,960
(will be the winner)

790
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,640
(and will receive the most shell coins.)

791
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,520
(Now, let's have the first team
onto the field.)

792
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,960
- CHERRY: You can go first, it's okay.
- TOD: Alright.

793
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,280
- CHERRY: I'll go first.
- MILL: Okay.

794
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,000
TIMETHAI: They'll compete
against each other first.

795
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:36,200
(Staring)

796
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,152
JUNSU: ASSE, let's go.

797
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:39,433
(Going together)
- JUNSU: Let's go. - ASSE: Okay.

798
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,048
(Sneaking a peek)

799
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,200
(Checking)
CRIS: Did he go ask for permission?

800
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,680
JUNSU: Okay.

801
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,600
ASSE: Me?

802
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,120
JUNSU: Me?

803
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,280
JUNSU: Me?

804
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,336
ASSE: Okay.

805
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,200
CRIS: Is he lying down?

806
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,760
(Lying down quickly)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I really want to play this game.

807
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,592
JUNSU: Hurry up!

808
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:03,684
ASSE: Okay, okay.

809
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:04,411
LOVE(X)PERTS: Go ahead.

810
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,680
ASSE: How do I lie down? Like this?

811
00:34:21,888 --> 00:34:22,880
(Hugging tightly)
CRIS: That's too much.

812
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,080
CRIS: His butt is sticking way out.
I can't stand that.

813
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,400
TIMETHAI: No, they will bump
into each other.

814
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,520
JOY: That's weird, TOD!

815
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:39,776
(Lifting the waist)

816
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:41,728
(Checking)
CRIS: ASSE!

817
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,840
CRIS: TOD has naturally
charming vibe.

818
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,360
JOY: TOD!

819
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,320
JOY: That's weird!

820
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,560
RUSAMEEKAE: It upsets JOY.

821
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,760
PEANUT: Looks heartbroken.

822
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,040
(Sad)
TOD: ASSE turns away.

823
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,160
(If you're ready...)

824
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:04,192
(Three.)

825
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,240
(Two.)

826
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,920
(One.)

827
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,760
(Start)

828
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:12,968
CANDIDATE: Hey!

829
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,440
(Start early)
- CRIS: Just turn. - TOD: Go.

830
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,520
TIME: He started early.

831
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,776
LOVE(X)PERT: CHERRY, oh dear.

832
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,960
(Try to protect her)

833
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,240
LOVE(X)PERT: He is trying to protect her,
so she doesn't get hurt too much.

834
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,240
(Supporting her with one hand)
CRIS: TOD is quite a gentleman.

835
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:33,536
(Leading a little)

836
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,400
CRIS: This pair is so close.
I'm confused.

837
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:38,640
(Faces are close together)

838
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
JANEYEH: Oh, he sniffed his ear once.

839
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:52,480
(Holding tight)

840
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,360
(Caught up in time)

841
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,720
TIME: Be careful!

842
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,080
SUNNY: Heads up!

843
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,088
(Hit a bump at the same time)

844
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,080
(Swing upward)
CRIS: TOD is too strong.

845
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,000
CRIS: TOD just carried CHERRY!

846
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,960
SUNNY: I think
the most impressive person is TOD.

847
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,800
SUNNY: His arms are already huge, right?
He's protecting her, rolling along.

848
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,400
(They're almost at the finish line.)
CANDIDATE: Hurry up!

849
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,560
CRIS: Oh, TOD!

850
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,680
CRIS: ASSE.

851
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,480
CRIS: They arrived almost
at the same time.

852
00:36:48,135 --> 00:36:49,920
(They arrived almost at the same time.)

853
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,920
CRIS: Really good!

854
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640

It'll get caught.

907
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:31,968

RUSAMEEKAE: But this is actually
a surprise for KONG,

923
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,560
RUSAMEEKAE: because he just came here.

924
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,120
CRIS: Oh, right,
because KONG didn't know.

925
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,520

926
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,800
RUSAMEEKAE: One, two, three,
four... all that.

927

JANEYEH: KONG is super stressed.

937
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,080
JUNSU: When I have to roll around with
FRAME in a game,

938
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,920
JUNSU: I just think

939

doing all the work!

JUNSU: But it's not
the most important thing.

968
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,912
JUNSU: The most important thing
is with FRAME.

969
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:08,768
JUNSU: We played and we were happy.

970

CRIS: It's so sad, isn't it?

988
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Those two are already tense
with each other.

989
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,760

RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, really fast.

1029
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,040

1031

1033
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
TIME: You okay?

1034
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,480
TIMETHAI: They look like they like each other,
but both have huge egos.

1035
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,400
TIME: How did you do it?

1036
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,120
NAMNUNG: Does it hurt?

1037
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,000
KONG: Doesn't hurt.

1038
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,800
RUSAMEEKAE: No one cares, huh.

1039
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:55,155

TIME JOY 19 seconds 10 coins)

1042
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,920
RUSAMEEKAE: The first place goes to
CHERRY and TOD.

1043
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,640
RUSAMEEKAE: And last place,
it's TIME and JOY.

1044
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,520
TIMETHAI: TIME's game skills really dropped,
early episodes he was brutal.

1045
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,600
RUSAMEEKAE: True,
but your partner matters too.

1046
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,360
TIMETHAI: JOY and TIME,
her knee hit his crotch once...

1047
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:11,559
TIMETHAI: Ouch.

1048
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,160
TIMETHAI: Hey, but SUNNY and MILL
were okay.

1049
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,416
TIMETHAI: SUNNY just
wanted to win so bad.

1050
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,056
JANEYEH: Total fighter blood.

1051
00:44:17,184 --> 00:44:18,240
(Total fighter blood)
JANEYEH: She wants to win every single day.

1052
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,280
RUSAMEEKAE: But the one showing symptoms
the most is probably TIME and NAMNUNG.

1053
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:26,528
RUSAMEEKAE: It's not like
they're happy about winning,

1054
00:44:26,528 --> 00:44:28,440
RUSAMEEKAE: there's tension there.

1055
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:29,520
PEANUT: Psychological warfare.

1056
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,360
TIMETHAI: They like each other,
but both have egos.

1057
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,256
JANEYEH: Yes.

1058
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes, but the next
intense moment is coming.

1059
00:44:36,736 --> 00:44:41,040

RUSAMEEKAE: There's still a Night Talk Arena tonight.

1060
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,400
(What is it)
JANEYEH: This...

1061
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,744
RUSAMEEKAE: Everyone has to answer a question
they've never told anyone before.

1062
00:44:48,096 --> 00:44:49,720
RUSAMEEKAE: And there's
a punishment too.

1063
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,720
CRIS: There's punishment too?

1064
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,440
RUSAMEEKAE: If you won't answer,
you drink one glass as punishment.

1065
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,400
TIMETHAI: If it were me,
I'd fake it like this.

1066
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,120
(Pretending to be drunk to avoid problems)

1067
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,696
TIMETHAI: Drunk.

1068
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,800
PEANUT: Crazy indeed.

1069
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,200
RUSAMEEKAE: So brutal.

1070
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,480

JANEYEH: Yes, there are two flavors.

1084

1086
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:34,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Drink it cold
when it's hot in Samui, it's so good.

1087
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:37,376
JANEYEH: And it's fun
to chat with friends too.

1088
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,128

JOY: from the random box, one by one.

1095
00:46:04,576 --> 00:46:05,986

00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:07,296
(then chooses one person to answer or do what it says.)
JOY: you must read it and do it.

1097

SUNNY: Three players will take turns coming
to stand next to you while you keep your eyes closed.

1103
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:24,352
SUNNY: You have to smell them.

1104
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,960
SUNNY: their body scent and guess who it is.

1105
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
(After you close your eyes, three players
will take turns walking up to stand next to you.)

1106
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,008
(You're not allowed to open your eyes.
You have to use your sense of smell and guess who it is.)

1107
00:46:34,816 --> 00:46:36,800

to see who's going to stand up.

1108
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,176
CRIS: One for TIME.

1109

1112

tell me so I can bring my nose in.

1113
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:51,040

1114

JANEYEH: TIME is slow, see?

1123
00:47:09,984 --> 00:47:11,008
TIMETHAI: You can't be
slow in this game.

1124
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:13,080
PEANUT: MATHEUS's eyes are sparkling.

1125
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:15,360

SUNNY, huh.

1134
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:36,032
PEANUT: Yes.

1135
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,432
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm excited already.

1136
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,360
CRIS: MATHEUS must be
wearing tons of perfume.

1137
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,424
CRIS: TIME is slow.

1138
00:47:59,712 --> 00:48:00,928

1139
00:48:01,056 --> 00:48:02,496
SUNNY: MATHEUS.

1140
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:04,544

MATHEUS: Very good.

1143
00:48:09,536 --> 00:48:10,208
SUNNY: Yeah.

1144
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,440
CRIS: But MATHEUS was shocked because

1145
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:17,248
- CRIS: Best kiss ever.
- JANEYEH: The best kiss ever!

1146
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:20,320
SUNNY: Okay, who?

1147
00:48:21,952 --> 00:48:22,592
(switch spots.)

1148
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:23,392
RUSAMEEKAE: They're in the same room,
you know.

1149
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,664
JANEYEH: But NAMNUNG said she's been interested
in SUNNY for a long time, since the very beginning.

1150
00:48:25,664 --> 00:48:26,688
PEANUT: Yes.

CRIS: Aww, this couple is cute.

1156
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:47,936
CRIS: Even if nobody ships them,
we can ship them ourselves!

1157
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,880
JANEYEH: So cute!

1158
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,304
JANEYEH: Oh my.

1159
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:01,080
TIME: Is that even possible?
It's too hard.

1160
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,488
(She lunged in so suddenly)

1161
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,240
RUSAMEEKAE: Will she remember?

1162
00:49:27,808 --> 00:49:28,960
CRIS: What's wrong with TIME?

1163
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,608
PEANUT: And MATHEUS's face just now...

1164
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,328
SUNNY: Ah, NAMNUNG.

1165
00:49:35,968 --> 00:49:37,152

1167
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,920
(SUNNY guessed right, it's NAMNUNG)
PEANUT: Wow, she really buried her face in just now.

1168
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:43,360
CHERRY: Well, they're roommates.

1169
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,568
TOD: They're together every day.

1170
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,224
CRIS: Cute, right? SUNNY.

1171
00:49:58,752 --> 00:50:01,720
(Third person JOY) CRIS: JOY probably won't
be easy she's not that close with her.

1172
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,488
(Come closer)

1173
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,552
JANEYEH: JOY,
she comes in and just offers it,

1174
00:50:09,312 --> 00:50:10,624
(Walks straight in)

1175
00:50:12,448 --> 00:50:13,568
(Even closer)

1176
00:50:13,568 --> 00:50:14,176
RUSAMEEKAE: Sis JOY!

1177
00:50:15,136 --> 00:50:17,760
CRIS: Sis JOY has charm though,
kinda that vibe.

1178
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,192
(Backing off)

1179
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:22,112
JANEYEH: SUNNY is really aggressive.

1180
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:25,248
PEANUT: SUNNY is here to play and to win.
I'm gonna smell till I get it.

1181
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:26,592
JANEYEH: Don't run away, stay still.

1182
00:50:26,592 --> 00:50:27,840
CRIS: MILL said it.

1183
00:50:33,504 --> 00:50:34,272
CRIS: She's confused.

1184
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:37,216
JANEYEH: Smelling that much...

1185
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:38,360
CRIS: SUNNY is a bit too much, no?

1186
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:40,384
JANEYEH: I like it.

1187

SUNNY: JOY.

1189

(SUNNY guessed right, it's JOY)
CRIS: How did she know?

1190
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:52,832
SUNNY: I can recognize people by smell.

1191
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,328
JOY: SUNNY made my heart race so much.

1192

1195

(You're holding it upside down.)

1212
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,320
NAMNUNG: Ugh, such an old-person joke.

1213
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:56,672
RUSAMEEKAE: An old-person joke.

1214
00:51:56,672 --> 00:51:58,368
NAMNUNG: Just kidding.

1215
00:51:58,784 --> 00:51:59,936

In your past love experiences,)

TOD: In your past love experiences,

TOD: what is the thing
you regret doing the most?

1220

TOD: Alright, I can choose now.

1221
00:52:13,184 --> 00:52:14,320
PEANUT: KONGPOP.

TOD: MILL.

I want to get to know MILL.

MILL: Like, the biggest regret.

1231
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,384
JOY: Even mistakes can be lessons,
anything in life.

1232
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:41,952
MILL: Then it's probably...
my ex cheating.

1233
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:43,744
MILL: Oof, what if I say it
and I start crying?

1234
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:46,880
- JOY: It's okay.
- CHERRY: It's alright.

1235

00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:51,296
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD feels guilty now.

1237
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,832

1239
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:55,720

1240
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,840
MILL: Three times.

00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,920
NAMNUNG: Three?

1244
00:53:00,864 --> 00:53:04,384
TOD: You forgave three times.
No more after that?

1245
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:06,080
TOD: Oh my god.

1246
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,944
TOD: Has it been a long time?

1247
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,184
MILL: Over a year ago.

1248
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,272
TOD: And what was the reason
for forgiving him the first time?

1249
00:53:15,072 --> 00:53:17,760
MILL: I just thought
it wouldn't happen again.

1250
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,776
TOD: But he didn't see it
as an important opportunity.

1251
00:53:23,776 --> 00:53:25,040
TOD: He did it again
the second time, right?

1252
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,896
(Nods)

1253
00:53:31,872 --> 00:53:35,920
TOD: And the last time, what made you
decide not to take it anymore?

1254
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:42,752
MILL: It was many times already,
he probably won't change.

1255
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,208
JANEYEH: Oh, she's carrying wounds.

1256
00:53:46,784 --> 00:53:50,040
CRIS: If he can cheat so many times,
it's not a mistake. He doesn't love you.

1257
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,360
JANEYEH: That's true.

1258
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:06,368
SUNNY: You're very brave.
You've walked away from it.

1259
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,728
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY,
you're very brave, dear.

1260
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:13,120
TOD: Stay strong, be strong.

1261
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,416
TOD: But I ended up
asking a question that

1262
00:54:17,248 --> 00:54:20,640
TOD: was painful for her, and it

1263
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,440
TOD: made her cry.

1264
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:25,760
TOD: I shouldn't have asked MILL.
I should've asked someone else.

1265
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,488
PEANUT: But he feels guilty.

1266
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:28,760
RUSAMEEKAE: If we look at it
from another angle,

1267
00:54:28,992 --> 00:54:31,200
RUSAMEEKAE: sometimes
speaking out like this...

1268
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:31,712
JANEYEH: Is also good.

1269
00:54:31,712 --> 00:54:33,360

1270

RUSAMEEKAE: we accept and dare
to speak out, to acknowledge it.

1271

TOD: I'm very satisfied
with MILL's response.

1272
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,728

1273

1530
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,248
JANEYEH: It's the right person.

1531
01:07:17,248 --> 01:07:18,488
RUSAMEEKAE: Even though he could just

1532
01:07:18,888 --> 01:07:20,768
RUSAMEEKAE: chose to drink
and not to answer.

1533
01:07:20,768 --> 01:07:23,248
CRIS: Why did he have to say it?

1534
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:23,904
CRIS: It's bad in every way.

1535
01:07:23,904 --> 01:07:26,272
TIMETHAI: I think he's still young,
and I think

1536
01:07:26,272 --> 01:07:28,728
TIMETHAI: he feels like he has to do
something that has an impact,

1537
01:07:28,728 --> 01:07:30,648
TIMETHAI: just trying to make waves.

1538
01:07:30,648 --> 01:07:32,864
TIMETHAI: But the waves
hit back at himself.

1539
01:07:32,864 --> 01:07:33,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

1540
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,528
CRIS: It's all a mess.

1541
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:36,368
RUSAMEEKAE: It's a mess.

1542
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,368
JANEYEH: I think if the girls end up
together, it's good. Let TIME go.

1543
01:07:39,904 --> 01:07:41,408
(It's a better ending like this)- JANEYEH: NAMNUNG and SUNNY can be together.
- CRIS: Yes.

1544
01:07:41,408 --> 01:07:42,368
PEANUT: Yes.

1545
01:07:42,368 --> 01:07:43,424
RUSAMEEKAE: It's possible.

1546
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:47,848
RUSAMEEKAE: But it's okay, keep it
for now as the story isn't over yet.

1547
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,232
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's continue watching.
They've finished answering the questions.

1548
01:07:51,232 --> 01:07:52,864
RUSAMEEKAE: When they go back
to the villa,

1549
01:07:52,928 --> 01:07:56,128
RUSAMEEKAE: let's see how
the atmosphere in the villa is.

1550
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:57,285
CRIS: Ugh.

1551
01:08:04,928 --> 01:08:06,624
NAMNUNG:
TOD, wait for me too, wait for me.

1552
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,128
- TIME: Wait for me too.
- NAMNUNG: Wait for me.

1553
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,408
TIME: What?

1554
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:10,816
(Indifferent)
NAMNUNG: Wait for me.

1555
01:08:10,816 --> 01:08:11,456
(Indifferent)
TIME: Where are you going?

1556
01:08:12,096 --> 01:08:13,600
TIME: Where are you going?

1557
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,496
LOVE(X)PERT: Wow!

1558
01:08:14,848 --> 01:08:16,736
LOVE(X)PERT: She ignored him.

1559
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:21,600
CANDIDATE: Once I've seen that

1560
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,728
(SUNNY and NAMNUNG's room, the two are in the bathroom)
CANDIDATE: MATHEUS is interested in you and me,

1561
01:08:24,728 --> 01:08:27,744
CANDIDATE: TIME is interested in
you and me, so it's like...

1562
01:08:27,744 --> 01:08:28,832
CANDIDATE: You know?

1563
01:08:28,832 --> 01:08:30,464
CRIS: They're having
an open-hearted talk.

1564
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,824
(Thinking)
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh my.

1565
01:08:33,824 --> 01:08:34,656
CRIS: Think more.

1566
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:35,872
CRIS: You should do that.

1567
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Is he going to
apologize or...

1568
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:43,328
CRIS: It's too late to apologize.

1569
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:45,696
JANEYEH: Maybe in ten years,
not just two or three days.

1570
01:08:45,696 --> 01:08:46,688
JANEYEH: Come back
and talk again after ten years.

1571
01:08:50,848 --> 01:08:53,248
PEANUT: But it seems like
he's thinking about it.

1572
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,288
TIME: There are many things I have to do

1573
01:08:57,408 --> 01:08:58,496
TIME: and to confess.

1574
01:08:59,072 --> 01:08:59,872
JANEYEH: What are you doing? Confessing?

1575
01:09:00,064 --> 01:09:02,328
(Leave)
TIMETHAI: No, no.

1576
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,456

TIME: I've been waiting for 5 days now.

1589
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,048
CRIS: Plot twist?

1590
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:42,888
CRIS: We still don't know because
in the end, during the day...

1591
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,312
(Who will TIME choose to invite?)

1592
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,232
(SUNNY and NAMNUNG's room, the two are in the bathroom)
RUSAMEEKAE: And the two are here.

CANDIDATE:TIME is interested in you
and me, so it's like...

1594
01:09:52,512 --> 01:09:53,768
JANEYEH: I'm going crazy.

1595
01:09:53,768 --> 01:09:56,832
CRIS: Crazy.
What kind of crazy game is this?

1596
01:09:57,248 --> 01:09:59,248
CANDIDATE: Who's coming?
Someone's coming.

1597
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:06,144
LOVE(X)PERT: Let's see.

1598
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:11,168
CRIS: Is it over? Is the episode over?

1599
01:10:11,168 --> 01:10:12,256
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't, please don't.

1600
01:10:12,256 --> 01:10:14,088
JANEYEH: Is it ending like this again?

1601
01:10:14,304 --> 01:10:15,392
(Left hanging)

1602
01:10:16,634 --> 01:10:19,674
CRIS: Don't tell me after 15 minutes

1603
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,474
CRIS: of ranting about TIME,
he actually had a reason?

1604
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:24,314
(Plot twist)

1605
01:10:24,314 --> 01:10:27,954
CRIS: That's why he chose NAMNUNG.

1606
01:10:27,954 --> 01:10:31,954
CRIS: He said he wanted to go to X-Land with NAMNUNG
because he planned it since earlier today.

1607
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:35,002
- JANEYEH: Very intense.
- CRIS: Wow!

1608
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:37,568
RUSAMEEKAE: It's okay, CRIS.
It's okay, everyone.

1609
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:40,434
RUSAMEEKAE: I believe the viewers
feel the same as us right now.

1610
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:44,594
RUSAMEEKAE: So in the end, who will TIME
choose to invite for a date?

1611
01:10:45,114 --> 01:10:48,274

JANEYEH: Ugh! I want to scream.

1617
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:04,554
RUSAMEEKAE: No clapping,
I'm leaving with this mood.

1618
01:11:04,554 --> 01:11:06,394
RUSAMEEKAE: No need to clap,
my hair's falling out.

1619
01:11:06,426 --> 01:11:08,186

- TIMETHAI: I want to have good things.

1624
01:11:27,456 --> 01:11:30,490

01:11:40,602 --> 01:11:42,490
PEANUT: Who is MATHEUS changing?

1631
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:44,314
RUSAMEEKAE:
Everyone has the right to change, CRIS.

1632
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:45,954
CRIS: It's a total mess.

1633

for me, come tell me later.

01:12:20,768 --> 01:12:21,554
RUSAMEEKAE: Ugh.

1644
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:23,994

but he loves with all his heart.

TIME: I just want to thank you.

in a very long time.

1648
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:31,354
CRIS: Did you secretly teach him?

1649
01:12:31,354 --> 01:12:33,234
JANEYEH: This is how it's done.

1650
01:12:33,274 --> 01:12:35,154
(Who will TIME choose?)
TIME: Will you go on a date with me?
