00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
TIME: At first, I should've just refused
and said, "okay, I'd rather not answer."

173
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,760
TIME: The words from the game,
they belong to the game.

174
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

175
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,320
TIME: But when I chose you, I just
wanted you to know I liked both of you.

176
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:45,280
TIME: I just meant I'm only
interested in you two.

177
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,992
RUSAMEEKAE: Wanted to communicate
that he likes these two people.

178
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,400
TIME: The one-night stand and falling
in love, for me it's not much different.

179
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,160
TIME: I'm not someone
who likes one-night stands.

180
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,280
JANEYEH: Ah, you knew that.

181
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,880
TIMETHAI: Calm down, calm down.

182
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,440
NAMNUNG: I understand.

183
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,240
CRIS: Oh, she understood.

184
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,240
NAMNUNG: I understand what you're trying
to communicate, but I just feel...

185
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,400
NAMNUNG: It's like, I hoped it would go
a different way.

186
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,600
- CRIS: That's right.
- TIME: Got it.

187
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880
NAMNUNG: That it wouldn't be
that question, something like that.

188
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,800
- TIME: Got it.
- NAMNUNG: That...

189
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,888
NAMNUNG: I feel that the choice of words

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
NAMNUNG: wasn't exactly something
to be proud of.

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,648
RUSAMEEKAE: It happened
in front of others too, right?

192
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:40,320
JANEYEH: Yes.

193
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,240
TIME: I understand, I do understand.

194
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,960
NAMNUNG: That's why I got a little
emotional. I'm sorry about that.

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,320
CRIS: Oh.

196
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,000
CRIS: How old is she? She's so mature.

197
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
TIMETHAI: She seems older than twenty.

198
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,840
CRIS: Really.

199
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,112
TIME: It's okay.
First of all, I'm sorry.

200
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

201
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,040
TIME: Many people think I am a flirt.

202
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,760
TIME: Because of my look and
personality, it takes time

203
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
TIME: to talk to this person,
and to talk to that person.

204
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,280
TIME: But in fact,
I just want to be sure.

205
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,600
TIME: I'm the type of person who,
if I love someone, I'm all in for them.

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
TIMETHAI: Oh.

207
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,880
TIMETHAI: Does this settle it, CRIS?

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,280
CRIS: Settled.

209
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,760
CRIS: Tried to be tough,
but eventually caved.

210
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:42,112
NAMNUNG: But there's never time to
sit down and have a real chat.

211
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Yes.

212
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,560
TIME: Hmm, our timing never lines up.

213
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
CRIS: It's all messed up now.

214
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:57,160
CRIS: It's like a total mess.

215
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
NAMNUNG: Ouch.

216
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
NAMNUNG: Ouch.

217
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,160
NAMNUNG: So intense.

218
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,960
NAMNUNG: Sorry.

219
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,400
TIME: Umm.

220
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,280
NAMNUNG: I talked with TIME.

221
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,048
NAMNUNG: We cleared things up
like usual.

222
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,688
NAMNUNG: And I apologized
like I normally do.

223
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,680
NAMNUNG: Right now, I'm interested
in both, including TIME.

224
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,936
NAMNUNG: I'm also interested in SUNNY,
which makes decisions even harder.

225
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:43,760
CRIS: A mess again.

226
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,680
SUNNY: I'm assuming you wouldn't use
your shell money.

227
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,080
JANEYEH: Huh?

228
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,720
SUNNY: I want to borrow enough money
from you to make a hundred.

229
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,600
JANEYEH: What?

230
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,768
(Wants to borrow coins to buy a date)
SUNNY: This way, I'll have two hundred.

231
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:57,984
FRAME: Two hundred,
she's going on two dates.

232
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:58,656
KONG: Who are you going with?

233
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,928
SUNNY: TIME and NAMNUNG.

234
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,520
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

235
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,040
SUNNY: I guess I feel something
for NAMNUNG.

236
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,480
RUSAMEEKAE: What?

237
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,000
- CRIS: She just told everyone.
- TIMETHAI: Oh, she told them easily.

238
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,600
CRIS: Good job, SUNNY.

239
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,040
RUSAMEEKAE: What's important is
she wants to spend time with two people.

240
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,472
JANEYEH: Maybe she wants to know
who she likes more?

241
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,816
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah,
maybe she wants to be clear?

242
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,440
JANEYEH: That's brilliant.

243
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:24,800
CRIS: I'm excited.

244
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,440
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY is awesome.

245
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
CRIS: SUNNY is amazing, so impressive.

246
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,368
(Thoughts on the relationship between NAMNUNG and TIME)
CRIS: Let's hear from JANEYEH.

247
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:31,960
CRIS: If you were NAMNUNG,
wouldn't it be too late?

248
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,200
JANEYEH: If it were me,
it would already be too late.

249
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,360
CRIS: It's too late, right?

250
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
RUSAMEEKAE: Alas, I feel for them.
Their timing is never right.

251
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,440
CRIS: Ugh.

252
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,360
RUSAMEEKAE: In the end,
there's really nothing.

253
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,400
CRIS: Hmm.

254
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,000
CRIS: ASSE, oh,
ASSE's neck pain has healed.

255
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,976
ASSE: I can't find it.

256
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,512
RUSAMEEKAE: His neck is still stiff.

257
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
(Stiff)
JANEYEH: Oh, his neck splint is gone.

258
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,560
MILL: Oh.

259
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,192
MATHEUS: Oh.

260
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,560
MATHEUS: Oh.

261
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,424
CHERRY: Where did you take it off?

262
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,816
ASSE: I'm not sure because I looked back
for it, but I can't find it.

263
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,280
(Thinking)

264
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,400
ASSE: Even JUNSU can't find it.

265
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,144
CHERRY: Oh, okay, I'll help you.

266
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:12,040
ASSE: Sure.

267
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,400
ASSE: Sure.

268
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,400
ASSE: I just can't find it.

269
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
CHERRY: No, it's in the room, right?
Not outside, right?

270
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,680
- ASSE: Yes, it's in the room.
- CHERRY: Okay.

271
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,792
CHERRY: Okay.

272
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,840
RUSAMEEKAE: These two are so polite,
aren't they?

273
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,880
CRIS: Yeah, they're cute.

274
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,512
RUSAMEEKAE: He's just walking
with a stiff neck like that.

275
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:29,568
CHERRY: Here it is.

276
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,840
ASSE: Oh.

277
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:33,640
ASSE: Ugh.

278
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,848
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

279
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,200
CRIS: Why can't he find it?

280
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,072
CHERRY: This one, right?

281
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,200
ASSE: Honestly, I found it.

282
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,544
ASSE: I already found it.

283
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,320
CHERRY: Huh?

284
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,960
ASSE: I just want to...

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,160
CHERRY: Huh?

286
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,800
ASSE: I just wanted to invite you...

287
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,600
CHERRY: Huh?

288
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,360
CRIS: Oops.

289
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,080
ASSE: to this place.

290
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,160
CHERRY: To where?

291
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,872
ASSE: This one.

292
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,880
CRIS: Oops!

293
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Huh?

294
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,160
(What is ASSE showing CHERRY?)
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey, don't tell me he bought it.

295
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,920
(What is it?)
ASSE: I want to use it to invite you

296
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,080
ASSE: to exclusive one-on-one date.

297
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my!

298
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,640
CRIS: Oh, so cute.

299
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,520
JANEYEH: Hey, that's cute.

300
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,880
CRIS: Hey, so cute.

301
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,960
(Thrilled)

302
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,680
CRIS: How did he know

303
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,920
CRIS: that CHERRY would
definitely help him find it?

304
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,760
TIMETHAI: Yeah, if it were someone else,
it'd be over. He clearly knows.

305
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,480
CRIS: Oh, can we keep watching?
They're so cute.

306
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,280
JANEYEH: They're so cute.

307
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,360
CHERRY: Ah.

308
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,440
ASSE: Really.

309
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,936
CRIS: Aw, that's cute.

310
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,280
CHERRY: Today?

311
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,160
ASSE: Yes, I want to invite you, CHERRY.

312
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,122
(Half an hour before)

313
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,160
(Current: 108 coins)

314
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,640
CRIS: Oh, he used all his coins.

315
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:38,680
(Current: 8 coins)

316
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,720
CRIS: What is he doing?

317
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,200
(Kept in pants)
RUSAMEEKAE: What is he doing?

318
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,960
CRIS: Oh, he hid it.

319
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Isn't there any
other place to hide, ASSE?

320
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,440
CRIS: He can't move his neck,
so he has to do it like this.

321
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,696
CRIS: Oh, that's so cute.

322
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,080
CRIS: Are they going? Already?

323
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,080
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh,
how are these two going to date?

324
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,240
CHERRY: Oh, it's really beautiful.

325
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:03,960
(Rooftop view)

326
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,760
CHERRY: It's very beautiful.

327
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,800
ASSE: Oh, it's beautiful.

328
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,440
CHERRY: It's very beautiful.

329
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,480
CHERRY: Oh, there's food too.

330
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,280
ASSE: Barbecue.

331
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Our show is rich.

332
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,680
CHERRY: Awesome.

333
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,440
CHERRY: Wow.

334
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:20,760
ASSE: It's starting.

335
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,640
CHERRY: Yes, it's starting.

336
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,600
ASSE: Are you excited?

337
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,840
CHERRY: Yes, I'm excited.

338
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:29,344
ASSE: I'm going to make my recipe.

339
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,784
CHERRY: Okay.

340
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,320

00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,056
(Blowing)

342
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800

00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:54,560
CHERRY: It's tasty.

346
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,936
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, if you get married
in Sweden, let me know, I'll fly there.

347
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,080
CHERRY: What's your type like?

348
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,560
JANEYEH: Oh.

349
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,856
ASSE: Well. Hmm...

350
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:15,080
CRIS: Oh, answer carefully.

351
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,920
ASSE: Hmm... Long hair.

352
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,960
ASSE: Yeah, but not too long.

353
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,200
(Looking at CHERRY)
ASSE: And kind of... Sharp face.

355
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,888
(Looking at CHERRY's nails)

RUSAMEEKAE: He's looking
at her and answer.

357
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Looking at her and answer.

358
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,800
CHERRY: What?

359
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,240

364
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,664
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

365
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,280
CRIS: Oh, why are you so cute, ASSE?

366
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,160
ASSE: That's correct.

367
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,480
(Looking)
ASSE: And...

368
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,160
CRIS: What?

369
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,760

Yes, dark like this.

372
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,432

373
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:07,520
CHERRY: Oh.

374
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,800
ASSE: I like brown eyes.

375
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,880
RUSAMEEKAE: It's CHERRY's
eye color. She knows.

376
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:25,240
(Thinking)

377
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,520
CHERRY: You got two kiss marks
on the first day. Who do you think they were from?

378
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,840
JANEYEH: Thinking...

379
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,200
(Staring)
CRIS: Oh, answer carefully.

380
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:36,640
ASSE: I think it's definitely CHERRY.

381
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,440
CRIS: Oh, that's so cute.

382
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,960
ASSE: Yes.

383
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:43,400
CHERRY: And the other person?

384
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,200
CHERRY: And the other person?

385
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,240
ASSE: The other person.

386
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,616
(The smile disappeared)
JANEYEH: The smile disappeared.

387
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,440
CRIS: Answer carefully.

388
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,360
ASSE: I have no idea.

389
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,040
ASSE: Yes.

390
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
CRIS: But he might not really know.

391
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,880
ASSE: And who do you think
kissed you on the first day?

392
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
CRIS: He's always speaking
so nicely. That's so cute.

393
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,880
RUSAMEEKAE: I've become Swedish now.
I'm so rude compared to him

394
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,600
CHERRY: It's you.

395
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,720
CHERRY: It's you.

396
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,160
ASSE: Yes.

397
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:20,960
(Laughing)

398
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,760
CRIS: They're cute.

399
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:24,960
TIMETHAI: Everything's flowing smoothly.

400
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,000
ASSE: And how did you figure that out?

401
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,200
RUSAMEEKAE: How did you know?

402
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,960
(Asking)

403
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,880
CHERRY: We played games together
and held hands.

404
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,160
- ASSE: Hmm.
- CHERRY: Do you remember?

405
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,200
ASSE: Yes, I do.

406
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,560
CHERRY: Uh-huh.

407
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,240
CHERRY: And then the kiss mark game.

408
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
CHERRY: You held my hand.

409
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:43,680
CHERRY: So I remembered the first touch,
and I knew it was you.

410
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,920
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

411
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,456
(Looking)

412
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,528
RUSAMEEKAE: She remembered
the first touch.

413
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,600
(Remember the feeling, ever since the first day)
CRIS: I can't take it anymore.

414
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,163
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh, my!

415
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,720
TIMETHAI: CHERRY and her sixth sense.

416
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,960
CRIS: CHERRY and her sixth sense.

417
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,080
CRIS: That's so cute.

418
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,016
ASSE: I'm shy and excited.

419
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,560
CRIS: You're so cute, ASSE.

420
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
CRIS: CHERRY, can you give him a hug?

421
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,040
ASSE: You're so beautiful today.

422
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,840
CRIS: You're so beautiful today.

423
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,720
ASSE: And you look like Jasmine.

424
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,600
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

425
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,080
CRIS: Oh, you look
as beautiful as Jasmine.

426
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,080
RUSAMEEKAE: So,
is he going to be Aladdin?

427
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:28,314
(Looking)

428
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
CRIS: I can't take it anymore.

429
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,680
CHERRY: Oh, it's fireworks!

430
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
ASSE: Oh, it's fireworks! Wow.

431
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

432
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, wow.

433
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,280
ASSE: It's beautiful.

434
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,360
CHERRY: Yes.

435
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,560
ASSE: A perfect moment
seeing the fireworks.

436
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,840
CHERRY: Yes.

437
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,000
ASSE: And there's the sea too.

438
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,440
ASSE: And there's food. I've never
done anything like this before.

439
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,520
CHERRY: Same here.

440
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,160
CRIS: Oh.

441
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,080
CRIS: Can they just get married already?

442
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,160
CRIS: Can they get married already?

443
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,640
JANEYEH: Can we join the wedding too?

444
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,600
CRIS: Can we?

445
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
CHERRY: If there's another date,

446
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
CHERRY: I'll come with you again.

447
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,400
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

448
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,280
ASSE: Sure.

449
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,160
CRIS: Oh.

450
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:16,280
ASSE: I'm happy.
I love it like this. It's perfect.

451
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:18,280
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, that's heartwarming.

452
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,720
(Leaning on shoulder)
CRIS: That's so heartwarming.

453
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:24,920
ASSE: I'm so happy to be out
and spend time together.

454
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,160
CHERRY: We went on a date today.
I was already very impressed by him.

455
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,520
CHERRY: With how he took care
of me and everything.

456
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,800
CHERRY: He had a surprise for me,
and it made me so happy. I came home feeling so happy.

457
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,640
CRIS: Oh, that's so cute.

458
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,280
JANEYEH: They can
get married right away.

459
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,360
JANEYEH: This couple
has no obstacles at all.

460
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,400
CRIS: Indeed, no obstacles at all.

461
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,800
CRIS: No one should try
to take them away.

462
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,160
CRIS: They're adorable.

463
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,000
CRIS: And he's been like this
from the start.

464
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,480
CRIS: Since day one,
no matter what the game was.

465
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:57,920
CRIS: That game where he ran on the raft.
Remember? He stumbled and didn't win anything,

466
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,040
CRIS: but he was happy, that's all.

467
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,360
RUSAMEEKAE: Well...

468
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,880
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's give them blessings.

469
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,960
RUSAMEEKAE: Seeing this couple,
I want to bless them. May they be happy.

470
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,880
RUSAMEEKAE: And no one will interfere, okay?
Stay together until the very last episode.

471
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,640
TOD: Should we go over there?

472
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,160
MILL: Okay.

473
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,280
CRIS: Who's there?

474
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,760
TOD: Who's there?

475
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,560
CRIS: Oh, is it TOD and NAMNUNG?

476
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
CRIS: Oh, it's TOD and MILL!

477
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,480
- TIMETHAI: Oh.
- CRIS: It's TOD and MILL!

478
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,480
JANEYEH: Hey, what's going on?

479
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,040
TIMETHAI: What's happening here?

480
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,880
JANEYEH: What's going on here?

481
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,768
TIME: Your shirt is really nice.

482
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,760
CRIS: Here we go again.

483
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,840
CRIS: Hey, wait a minute.

484
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:39,680
TIME: I like this shirt.

485
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
CRIS: Your pants are nice.

486
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,200
CRIS: Your suit looks
very handsome on you.

487
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,608
CRIS: And now, your shirt is nice.

488
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:46,160
TIMETHAI: Yeah,
he likes everything TOD wears.

489
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:49,568
TIMETHAI: Even when TOD wears a robe,
he will still compliment him that it looks nice.

490
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,840
TOD: Let's swap outfits later.

491
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
(Run away)

492
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,760
TIME: Okay.

493
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,752
(Looking)

494
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,160
RUSAMEEKAE: He seems lonely.

495
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,216
FRAME: But you still
haven't talked, right?

496
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,160
KONG: Not yet. I haven't had the chance.

497
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,088
JANEYEH: Oh, everyone's helping KONG.

498
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:16,960
(Blushing secretly)

499
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:19,800
(Walking together) RUSAMEEKAE:
Maybe one of the three people TOD likes is MILL?

500
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:20,704
CRIS: It could be.

501
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:24,992
TOD: How's it going here?

502
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,360
MILL: Good.

503
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,360
MILL: Good, I feel like...

504
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,480
MILL: If I hadn't come here,
I wouldn't have met anyone.

505
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:38,458
MILL: I wouldn't have met
new people like this.

506
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,080
MILL: I probably stay
with the same people and in the same circle.

507
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,600
(Turning to look)

508
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,400
TOD: That's good.

509
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:47,360
TOD: I'd better not ask
how many people you're eyeing.

510
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
CRIS: Wow, TOD! Going for it already?

511
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,472
TOD: It might be
too pressuring to answer.

512
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:56,352
TOD: Yeah, right?

513
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
TOD: If I ask...

514
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,552
TOD: I don't really want to know.

515
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:01,440
(Staring)

516
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,088
- CRIS: MILL, keep it cool. Be calm like NAMNUNG.
- RUSAMEEKAE: There's no time now.

517
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,576
(Kicking sand)

518
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,640
CRIS: MILL, keep it cool.
MILL, act properly.

519
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,440
TIMETHAI: Stand properly.

520
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,880
MILL: Maybe ten.

521
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,440
MILL: Maybe ten.

522
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,328
- TIMETHAI: Oh, wow.
- TOD: Haha.

523
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:20,960
CRIS: Ugh.

524
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,960
CRIS: Ah, MILL.

525
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,904
TOD: Oh, okay. Sure.

526
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,432
MILL: No. If ten, how's that exactly?

527
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,760
MILL: Who is right?

528
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,360
MILL: Uh-huh.

529
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:39,640
MILL: But initially I thought
if coming here would work out because...

530
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:41,040
(Observing)

531
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,840
TOD: Uh-huh.

532
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,088
MILL: I don't really approach anyone.

533
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,000
TOD: You don't approach first, right?

534
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,680
RUSAMEEKAE: MILL is shy
because she's been disappointed before.

535
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
JANEYEH: Oh, yeah,
she's had wounds before.

536
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,320
TOD: So normally,
when you meet someone you like...

537
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,096
TOD: How do you let them know,
or do you just wait for them to approach you?

538
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:01,280
(Asking)

539
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:02,848
JANEYEH: What do you mean?

540
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,824
(Glancing)

541
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:09,120
- JANEYEH: Oh. - RUSAMEEKAE:
You're talking to MILL right now, TOD.

542
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:10,560
(Avoiding eye contact)

543
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,056
RUSAMEEKAE: Or is TOD
trying to get over TIME?

544
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:14,400
TIMETHAI: Trying
to find some distraction?

545
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,600
MILL: Maybe follow them first.

546
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:18,560
CRIS: Wow!

547
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:19,960
(Nodding)

548
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,600
- RUSAMEEKAE: That's what I'm talking about!
- CRIS: That's what I'm talking about!

549
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,080
TOD: You choose to follow but don't show
yourself by liking first, right?

550
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,944
(Shy)
TOD: Oh, I'm too shy.

551
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,128
CRIS: Oh.

552
00:23:30,312 --> 00:23:31,104
(Blushing)

553
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:32,448
JANEYEH: Oh.

554
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:33,696
CRIS: She's so cute, isn't she?

555
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,160
MILL: The first time talking
to TOD one-on-one, I felt a bit shy.

556
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:43,680
(Turning to look)

557
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
MILL: I didn't step in.
I watched through the mirror with JOY.

558
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,160
TIME: You need to find a chance.

559
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,296
KONG: This is the best opportunity.

560
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:57,160
RUSAMEEKAE: Wow.

561
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,760
TIME: Then is KONG the third one?

562
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:11,200
KONG: Maybe.

563
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,952
CRIS: Yeah, maybe KONG, NAMNUNG, MILL?

564
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,736
TIMETHAI: But didn't TOD say
KONG isn't the one? When NAMNUNG asked.

565
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:18,688
JANEYEH: But he thinks he's one of them.

566
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,320
JANEYEH: I feel for him.

567
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,808
TIME: There's no more.

568
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,448
KONG: Huh, yeah.

569
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,568
TIME: It's probably not me.

570
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
- CRIS: TIME.
- JANEYEH: TIME.

571
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,352
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME said
it's probably not him.

572
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,600
TIMETHAI: Give him a smack
on the head, SUNNY.

573
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,880
TIMETHAI: One smack, SUNNY.

574
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,160
- KONG: Oh.
- TIME: Seriously.

575
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,960
KONG: What?

576
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,160
TIME: Trust me.

577
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,976
(Looking again)

578
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:43,904
RUSAMEEKAE: Emotional day.

579
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:44,896
RUSAMEEKAE: Overthinking and confused.

580
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,624
MILL: It's twitching. So funny.

581
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:52,240
(Look down)

582
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,568
JANEYEH: I feel for him.

583
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh, I'm sad.

584
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:06,304
- JANEYEH: I feel sorry for KONG.
- RUSAMEEKAE: KONG.

585
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:10,280
RUSAMEEKAE: So KONG
doesn't know that TOD...

586
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,960
- JANEYEH: TOD doesn't have feelings for him.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, he doesn't.

587
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,520
CRIS: But...

588
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:16,256
CRIS: But KONG isn't wrong that he...

589
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,640
CRIS: That he feels this way about TOD.

590
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,496
- CRIS: Because when he was in the curtain. Remember?
- JANEYEH: TOD gave him so much hope.

591
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:27,072
- CRIS: TOD was making a strong move on him.
- JANEYEH: Yeah, he was really making a move that day.

592
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
JANEYEH: Sigh.

593
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,240
JANEYEH: MATHEUS.

594
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
MATHEUS: You look very happy today.

595
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:43,840
TIME: It's getting tough.

596
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,640
JANEYEH: I'm stressed.

597
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:46,560
SUNNY: My head hurts a lot today.

598
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:48,448
(Looking)

599
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:55,904
CRIS: Oh, no. It's become a love quadrilateral,
pentagon, even hexagon. I'm so confused!

600
00:25:55,904 --> 00:26:01,800
RUSAMEEKAE: But the two people I don't worry about
are JUNSU and FRAME, and ASSE and CHERRY.

601
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,272
TIMETHAI: Two couples.

602
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:03,764
MATHEUS: Let's go.

603
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:13,000
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't tell me
TOD wrote to TIME.

604
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,464
JANEYEH: Thanks for always
complimenting the shirt.

605
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:16,240
TIMETHAI: Thanks for liking the shirt.

606
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,208
CANDIDATE: How do you feel?

607
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,944
CANDIDATE: Wait and see.

608
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:32,840
JANEYEH: How many?

609
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,640
CRIS: There must be many.

610
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:36,200
(NAMNUNG, Three letters)

611
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,248
CRIS: Oh, my God!

612
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,296
CRIS: She must be shocked because there was
a time she didn't get any. Remember?

613
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:43,904
TIMETHAI: Comeback.

614
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:44,736
JANEYEH: Comeback No.1, NAMNUNG.

615
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,840
NAMNUNG: Three letters.

616
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,744
NAMNUNG: I felt shocked. What happened?

617
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,088
(Confused)

618
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,992
(To NAMNUNG) CRIS: I'm staying right here, always.
Turn around. I'm just behind you. From TOD.

619
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:57,664
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD.

620
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,192
(Curious)

621
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
RUSAMEEKAE: Or is this like a farewell?

622
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Is it goodbye?

623
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:07,560
- CRIS: No, it says, "I'm here. I'm still here."
- JANEYEH: Whenever you turn around, you'll find me.

624
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,312
- JANEYEH: Waiting.
- CRIS: But not expecting much.

625
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:10,760
- CRIS: Right?
- RUSAMEEKAE: Okay.

626
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,584
CRIS: Oh, I feel sorry for him.

627
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:13,216
RUSAMEEKAE: Ah, okay.

628
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:23,097
(To NAMNUNG) CRIS: Thank you for everything.
If only we started talking earlier. Not sure if it's too late.

629
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:24,568
TIMETHAI: Red dress is so cute.

630
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,216
CRIS: Not sure if it's too late.

631
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,072
CRIS: It means he's keep going.

632
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:31,936
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

633
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:34,360
(Laughing)

634
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,800
CRIS: Oh, she's happy.

635
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,400
JANEYEH: Oh, I'm excited.

636
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,976
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY wrote to NAMNUNG.

637
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,880
TIMETHAI: It turns out
NAMNUNG is making a comeback.

638
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,256
(To NAMNUNG) CRIS: First time writing to you.
I'm still trying to figure out what you are to me.

639
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:51,904
CRIS: How I feel about you.
Last night was real.

640
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,680
- CRIS: That's just how Gen Z is.
- TIMETHAI: She wrote it boldly.

641
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,920
CRIS: She should already
know it's SUNNY.

642
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,985
CRIS: Because last night felt real.

643
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,320
(TIME and SUNNY got one letter each)
CRIS: TIME and SUNNY got one each.

644
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:10,498
(NAMNUNG to TIME: I'm so happy that we
finally talked openly with each other)

645
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:11,548
(I hope that in the days to come,
we can all follow our hearts)

646
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:12,288
(JOY to SUNNY: I hope you're happy)

647
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:15,120
RUSAMEEKAE: It's TOD.

648
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:16,600
(Two letters)

649
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,640
- JANEYEH: Ah, he's getting popular.
- CRIS: I think it's MILL.

650
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,962
(KONG to TOD: Wanted to talk at the beach today.
But you seemed happy talking to someone else)

651
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:20,752
(Not sure if I should still ask. But I'd like us
to talk alone sometime. I'm around if you want)

652
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:21,382
(MILL to TOD: Thank you for approaching first.
I'm glad that I talked more with you today)

653
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:21,880
(I'm going to give it my all in the game tomorrow,
so I can make it to X-Land. Goodnight)

654
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,000
JANEYEH: He's getting popular.

655
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,360
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD, who never got any.

656
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,800
JANEYEH: Or did the orange shirt
bring luck?

657
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,016
CRIS: Lucky color.

658
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:30,880
CRIS: Based on the lucky color.

659
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:33,120
(Spectrum letter relationships,
JUNSU to FRAME, ASSE to CHERRY, MATHEUS to KONG)

660
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,648
CRIS: Did MATHEUS write to KONG?

661
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,672
CRIS: So, there wasn't anything.

662
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:37,480
(Nothing)
RUSAMEEKAE: There wasn't anything.

663
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,136
(Spectrum letter relationships)
RUSAMEEKAE: He was just trying to say that...

664
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,208
CRIS: He just wanted to write that
they were roommates for one day.

665
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,360
CRIS: Wait, but it'd be so iconic if MATHEUS wrote to TOD
because they had a scene like blow-drying hair.

666
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,248
RUSAMEEKAE: Sweetly blow-drying
each other's hair.

667
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,488
JANEYEH: Maybe like, "You blow-drying
my hair really made my heart flutter."

668
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:52,920
CRIS: Something like that.

669
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,760
TIME: It's almost over.

670
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,000
TIME: What should we do?

671
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:08,992
TOD: I think you have the answer.

672
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:17,408
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME asks for his advice
about someone else.

673
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,560
CRIS: TOD must feel really hurt.

674

somehow, right?

676
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,880

from all other women.

They like the same guy and also like each other.

707

the rest of them.

I'm just thinking.

to do a show with me?

794
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:39,440
RUSAMEEKAE: Because SUNNY is the MC.

795
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,240
CRIS: Of course,
TIME has to be tempted, right?

796
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,264
RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah, feeling worried.

797
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,280
CRIS: Is he gonna say yes?

798
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,240

even being the MC?

803
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,744
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY should be performing!

804

- TIME: Okay.

805

RUSAMEEKAE: Would you call that
pouring oil on the fire?

825
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:12,720
RUSAMEEKAE: Like, pouring oil until everything
goes up in flames and burns to the ground.

826
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,952
TIMETHAI: And you don't even

SUNNY: Because my mom was very strict,
very Asian.

really using my time efficiently.

NAMNUNG: And what kind of person were they?

00:54:46,234 --> 00:54:46,874
NAMNUNG: What was it?

1155

TOD: My first love was

1156
00:54:58,954 --> 00:55:00,194
TOD: transgender.

1157
00:55:00,194 --> 00:55:01,514

00:55:08,634 --> 00:55:12,514
TOD: It happened when I was 16,
about 20 years ago.

1162
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:15,714
(20 years ago)
TOD: Around Grade 10.

1163
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,794
TOD: It was a long time ago,
and it might not have been like today,

1164
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:23,714
TOD: when people's understanding about gender
is probably a lot more than back then.

1165
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,434
CRIS: Oh, TOD!

1166
00:55:25,714 --> 00:55:27,234
RUSAMEEKAE: Back then
it might not have been that open.

1167
00:55:28,314 --> 00:55:30,394
TOD: But I didn't care about

1168
00:55:30,946 --> 00:55:33,122
TOD: what my friends or people around me

1169
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,314
TOD: would think about me dating

1170
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,754
TOD: a transgender person.

1171
00:55:38,194 --> 00:55:39,394
TOD: I didn't care about other people.

1172
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:41,914
TOD: I only cared about my own feelings.

1173

1174
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,954

00:55:54,874 --> 00:55:55,834
TOD: this person must be

1178
00:55:57,874 --> 00:56:00,194
TOD: very confident and trusting in me.

1179
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:02,954
TOD: At that time, I felt that

1180
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:07,194
TOD: I was very happy,
even though it was for a short period.

1181
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:10,314
TOD: It was something I was
very impressed with at that time.

1182
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:12,834
(Very impressed at that moment)

1183
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,154
CRIS: TOD is absolutely wonderful.

1184
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:23,714
JOY: If they're listening, they must be
very proud that you talked about them.

1185
00:56:25,074 --> 00:56:27,674
CRIS: Really, if they're listening,
they must be very happy.

1186
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,514
TOD: I miss you.

1187
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:34,994
CRIS: Oh.

1188
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:37,154
CRIS: That's very sweet.

1189
00:56:39,034 --> 00:56:40,514
CRIS: Same here, exactly the same.

1190
00:56:40,514 --> 00:56:41,354
JANEYEH: Ah.

1191
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:46,674
TOD: I miss you.

1192
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:48,874
CRIS: Oh, TOD.

1193
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:50,234
JANEYEH: TOD is truly amazing.

1194
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:52,674
RUSAMEEKAE: MILL is smiling proudly.

1195
00:56:52,914 --> 00:56:54,154
CRIS: A proud smile.

1196
00:56:56,954 --> 00:56:58,394
JOY: Listening to this
makes me want to cry.

1197
00:57:00,554 --> 00:57:03,674
SUNNY: He's like
the definition of love is love.

1198
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:08,754
NAMNUNG: I admire how TOD
knows himself and follows his heart.

1199
00:57:11,078 --> 00:57:14,709
(Love is a gentle lesson
leading us through joy and sorrow, teaching us that)

1200
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:19,234
(every time we fall, it's not the end
but the beginning of understanding our own heart)

1201
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:26,818
(Love grows with us
learning to embrace and be loved)

1202
00:57:27,187 --> 00:57:33,090
(In the end, we'll stand on our own
with a heart steadier than before)

1203
00:57:33,378 --> 00:57:50,359
(and the light within us
will shine brighter than yesterday)

1204
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:54,714
RUSAMEEKAE: I admire TOD's courage
and honesty towards himself.

1205
00:57:55,034 --> 00:57:57,954
RUSAMEEKAE: I also greatly respect his
bravery in sharing this on the show.

1206
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:01,194
RUSAMEEKAE: Like me,
I married Mr. JONAS.

1207
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:03,714
RUSAMEEKAE: Uh, we've been
together for 18 years now.

1208
00:58:06,714 --> 00:58:08,954
RUSAMEEKAE: May I turn
and ask this way now?

1209
00:58:10,514 --> 00:58:13,674
RUSAMEEKAE: Does anybody remember
their first love, like a puppy love?

1210
00:58:14,154 --> 00:58:16,394
CRIS: Oh wow, let me reminisce.
It's been a long time.

1211
00:58:16,434 --> 00:58:17,754
JANEYEH: I've deleted all memories.

1212
00:58:18,554 --> 00:58:21,474
CRIS: But at my school,
I studied in an international school.

1213
00:58:21,554 --> 00:58:25,234
CRIS: And then there was
a day that's like Rose Day.

1214
00:58:25,394 --> 00:58:26,194
CRIS: In which I

1215
00:58:26,594 --> 00:58:29,034
CRIS: received flowers from someone.

1216
00:58:29,514 --> 00:58:32,474
CRIS: Until one day, I found out
it was from another friend.

1217
00:58:32,874 --> 00:58:33,674
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

1218
00:58:33,874 --> 00:58:35,034
CRIS: But I was very toung.

1219
00:58:35,674 --> 00:58:36,674
CRIS: I was busy fixing my hair.

1220
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,434
CRIS: We never really talked.

1221
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:43,458
CRIS: In the end, we both went abroad
to study and we're not in touch anymore.

1222
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:46,754
JANEYEH: From what I remember,
I liked my senior

1223
00:58:46,754 --> 00:58:48,754
JANEYEH: or deskmate.
I was very introverted.

1224
00:58:48,754 --> 00:58:49,234
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh.

1225
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,674
JANEYEH: So I wouldn't dare to talk.
I just admired them quietly.

1226
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,514
TIMETHAI: I was talking
to a girl through Hi5.

1227
00:58:55,474 --> 00:58:56,434
CRIS: That's very old.

1228
00:58:56,434 --> 00:58:58,434
TIMETHAI: I've never met her
face to face until today.

1229
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,874
TIMETHAI:
I don't even know if she's real.

1230
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:03,106
- TIMETHAI: I saw pictures and talked to her for a month.
- RUSAMEEKAE: Yeah.

1231
00:59:03,354 --> 00:59:06,234
RUSAMEEKAE: I must say
there's nothing luckier than

1232
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:08,434
RUSAMEEKAE: having someone
who loves us for who we are.

1233
00:59:08,714 --> 00:59:09,234
JANEYEH: Right.

1234
00:59:09,234 --> 00:59:09,714
TIMETHAI: Love is...

1235
00:59:09,954 --> 00:59:11,554
RUSAMEEKAE: Love is love, you know.

1236
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:15,194
RUSAMEEKAE: Teenage love
is a beautiful thing, it's a good thing.

1237
00:59:15,194 --> 00:59:17,394
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's take a look
at the next morning.

1238
00:59:17,394 --> 00:59:19,674
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's see
what happens at the villa.

1239
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:26,034
FRAME: Want to take a picture?

1240
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,779

1241
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:30,914
TIMETHAI: They're in different houses.

1242
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:31,994

1243
00:59:31,994 --> 00:59:32,754
ASSE: Sponsor.

1244
00:59:38,994 --> 00:59:40,434

ASSE: Come and take a picture.

1246
00:59:42,794 --> 00:59:44,474
CHERRY: Come on. I'll take one for you.

1247
00:59:44,474 --> 00:59:45,914
LOVE(X)PERT: And then the hand.

1248
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:47,874
JANEYEH: Wow, that's harsh.

1249
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:48,674
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my!

1250
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:49,594
JANEYEH: Really harsh.

1251
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:50,994
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY, get up, darling.

1252
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:53,434
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY, no need to sit there.

1253

CANDIDATE: Just a moment.

1254
00:59:54,874 --> 00:59:56,114
JANEYEH: SUNNY's smile is so awkward.

1255
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:00,314
CANDIDATE: Ooh.

1256
01:00:00,794 --> 01:00:01,954

LOVE(X)PERT: TIME is here.

1259
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:12,226

1260
01:00:16,794 --> 01:00:17,514

1262
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:20,434
JUNSU: She's prepared.

1263
01:00:21,194 --> 01:00:22,474

1264
01:00:28,634 --> 01:00:29,666

1270
01:00:48,474 --> 01:00:49,274

SUNNY: It's okay.

1275
01:00:59,298 --> 01:01:00,066

01:01:00,066 --> 01:01:00,910
JANEYEH: Oh my god.

1277
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:02,154
JANEYEH: It's so tense.

1278
01:01:04,002 --> 01:01:05,074
TIMETHAI: Why so tense?

1279
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:06,754
TIMETHAI: What's making them tense?

1280
01:01:08,354 --> 01:01:09,434

1281
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:11,074

NAMNUNG: Very good.

SUNNY: Like...

1303
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:26,714
SUNNY: This situation
is already challenging.

1304
01:02:26,714 --> 01:02:28,114
SUNNY: No one can blame anyone.

1305
01:02:28,114 --> 01:02:29,914
SUNNY: It's everyone's feeling,
you know?

1306
01:02:30,354 --> 01:02:34,034
SUNNY: And I can't be mad at you.
You're single too, interested in two people.

1307
01:02:34,034 --> 01:02:35,954
SUNNY: Outside, you might be
interested in five more.

1308
01:02:35,954 --> 01:02:37,834
SUNNY: That's the reality of things.

1309
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:38,954
CRIS: Baby.

1310
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:41,594
CRIS: You're number one.

(Silence)

1312
01:02:49,114 --> 01:02:51,314
TIME: I can choose to keep my distance.

1313
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:54,434
TIME: If it means
you will laugh and smile like before.

1314
01:02:55,154 --> 01:02:59,138
TIME: I can just watch from afar.

1315
01:02:59,138 --> 01:03:01,554
SUNNY: It's not what I wanted it to be.

1316
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:07,714
TIME: I feel that...

1317
01:03:10,034 --> 01:03:12,514
TIME: Once I entered this situation,

1318
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:16,258
TIME: it makes one person...

1319
01:03:16,514 --> 01:03:19,314
TIME: It makes someone have to be upset.

1320
01:03:19,674 --> 01:03:21,250
TIME: And I don't want
to be that kind of person.

1321
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,314
SUNNY: No, but ultimately,
this is your life.

1322
01:03:24,314 --> 01:03:27,994
- SUNNY: What makes you happy, just make it clear that...
- TIME: Yes.

1323
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:31,954
SUNNY: If you can make it clear, right?

1324
01:03:31,954 --> 01:03:33,834
SUNNY: Suppose you choose NAMNUNG,
I understand.

1325
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:34,514
JANEYEH: Yeah.

1326
01:03:34,594 --> 01:03:35,834
SUNNY: If you choose me,

1327
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:37,754
SUNNY: I'm sure NAMNUNG
will understand too.

1328
01:03:37,754 --> 01:03:41,474
SUNNY: But right now,
the confusion makes everyone...

1329
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:43,034
JANEYEH: True.

1330
01:03:43,674 --> 01:03:44,474

TIME: No.

1332

TIME: I'm having an emotional day.

1333
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,418
TIME: I don't know.

1334
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:20,154
JANEYEH: You never know anything.

1335
01:04:21,634 --> 01:04:23,514
TIMETHAI: Take it easy, calm down.

1336
01:04:26,714 --> 01:04:28,074
SUNNY: I know you feel bad.

1337
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:31,394
SUNNY: But I just think you shouldn't
close off opportunities for yourself.

1338
01:04:31,394 --> 01:04:32,394
RUSAMEEKAE: Beautiful.

1339
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:40,002
SUNNY: Today, you might not be able to
decide whether you like me or NAMNUNG,

1340
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:41,034
SUNNY: because of this and that.

1341
01:04:41,034 --> 01:04:44,154
SUNNY: No one is forcing you
to decide today.

1342
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,634
SUNNY: So don't blame yourself.

1343
01:04:47,618 --> 01:04:49,594
JANEYEH: Excellent, clear.

1344
01:04:49,826 --> 01:04:50,850
SUNNY: It's okay.

1345
01:05:05,274 --> 01:05:05,874
NAMNUNG: Hello.

1346
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:07,194
NAMNUNG: Sorry.

1347
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,594
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

1348
01:05:12,554 --> 01:05:13,634
SUNNY: Eating beans again?

1349
01:05:14,154 --> 01:05:14,954
NAMNUNG: Not beans.

1350
01:05:15,474 --> 01:05:16,314
NAMNUNG: Just sunflower seeds.

1351
01:05:17,434 --> 01:05:18,954
CRIS: I told you.
Why do you have to talk in the room?

1352
01:05:18,994 --> 01:05:19,794
JANEYEH: I'm having a headache.

1353
01:05:32,354 --> 01:05:33,154
SUNNY: Are you okay?

1354
01:05:35,914 --> 01:05:37,394
TIME: It's okay to not be okay.

1355
01:05:39,746 --> 01:05:41,674
RUSAMEEKAE: But it's okay
not to be okay.

1356
01:05:46,786 --> 01:05:47,682
SUNNY: It's okay.

1357
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,794
CRIS: Oh, why did you come out now?

1358
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:10,154
JANEYEH: Who gave her the cue or what?

1359
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:11,634
JANEYEH: Who gave the cue?

1360
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:18,914
CRIS: Seriously, like...

1361
01:06:19,274 --> 01:06:21,154
CRIS: Seriously,
isn't this like a crazy game?

1362
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:22,154
JANEYEH: Headache.

1363
01:06:23,154 --> 01:06:24,834
TIMETHAI: My bro might not have...

1364
01:06:25,594 --> 01:06:26,714
TIMETHAI: much luck in love.

1365
01:06:26,954 --> 01:06:28,914
JANEYEH: It's like he's cursed.

1366
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:39,074
CRIS: Confused.

1367
01:06:40,194 --> 01:06:40,994
CRIS: Boom.

1368
01:06:47,114 --> 01:06:47,994
JUNSU: Sit down.

1369
01:06:49,026 --> 01:06:50,394
NAMNUNG: Why sit?

1370
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:53,090
NAMNUNG: Everyone's all in pairs.
I have no idea where to fit in.

1371
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,082
LOVE(X)PERT: Oh.

1372
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:03,714
NAMNUNG: I turned on the tap
to make some noise.

1373
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:07,234
NAMNUNG: So I'd feel like
I'm not hearing their conversation.

1374
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:09,234
NAMNUNG: I don't want to know
what they're talking about.

1375
01:07:09,874 --> 01:07:13,874
NAMNUNG: And as I opened the room door,
I saw them hugging each other...

1376
01:07:15,394 --> 01:07:16,634
NAMNUNG: Okay.

1377
01:07:18,794 --> 01:07:21,634
NAMNUNG: Okay,
I feel like their relationship...

1378
01:07:22,474 --> 01:07:23,674
NAMNUNG: seems...

1379
01:07:25,762 --> 01:07:28,314
NAMNUNG: like it's 100% already.

1380
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:34,034
JANEYEH: No, but you...

1381
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:35,674
TIMETHAI: It was a bad timing.

1382
01:07:35,874 --> 01:07:37,154
CRIS: I can't watch this, like...

1383
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:47,874
TIME: I admit that things
weren't managed that well.

1384
01:07:48,634 --> 01:07:51,834
TIME: But I never thought
it would really reach this point.

1385
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:56,714
SUNNY: I talked to TIME, and I told him

1386
01:07:56,714 --> 01:07:58,754
SUNNY: that if you're interested in NAMNUNG,
you can talk to her.

1387
01:07:59,394 --> 01:08:01,378
SUNNY: Since everyone is single,
I won't stop you.

1388
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:01,874
SUNNY: I understand.

1389
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:03,874
SUNNY: If you like many,
then get to know all of them.

1390
01:08:04,322 --> 01:08:05,058
SUNNY: I understand too.

1391
01:08:05,186 --> 01:08:07,354
SUNNY: Because I'm not clear
about my own feelings.

1392
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:08,674
SUNNY: It's not even been two weeks yet.

1393
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:10,954
SUNNY: Choosing someone
is hard because...

1394
01:08:12,258 --> 01:08:13,794
SUNNY: The connection
I have with NAMNUNG

1395
01:08:13,794 --> 01:08:14,914
SUNNY: and the connection
I have with TIME

1396
01:08:14,914 --> 01:08:15,954
SUNNY: are different.

1397
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:20,354
CRIS: It's a mess. I feel for her.

1398
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:23,074
TIMETHAI: It'll be a little tangled up,
you know.

1399
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:25,594
CRIS: Why not clear things up
between the three of you, seriously?

1400
01:08:25,594 --> 01:08:25,994
RUSAMEEKAE: Right.

1401
01:08:27,434 --> 01:08:28,034
TOD: Beautiful.

1402
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:31,794
TOD: The only word I can say
is that it's really beautiful, like...

1403
01:08:31,794 --> 01:08:33,074
- CANDIDATE: Paradise.
- TOD: Yes.

1404
01:08:37,274 --> 01:08:38,594
TOD: The sea color is beautiful, right?

1405
01:08:40,834 --> 01:08:44,546
MILL: I don't know when I'd have
a chance to be here like this,

1406
01:08:44,546 --> 01:08:46,114
MILL: to see this again.

1407
01:08:47,754 --> 01:08:48,834
TOD: It's just so good.

1408
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,234
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD and MILL
are adorable too.

1409
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:53,442
JOY: If you wonder...

1410
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:55,674
JOY: TIME's crying.

1411
01:08:56,474 --> 01:08:57,994
JOY: I was going to
sing for him for fun.

1412
01:08:58,594 --> 01:08:59,394
TOD: Really?

1413
01:09:03,074 --> 01:09:04,234
JOY: Tears just flowed.

1414
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:05,474
CRIS: TOD, go.

1415
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:06,914
CRIS: It's your time now, TOD.

1416
01:09:07,074 --> 01:09:07,794
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD.

1417
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:08,594
TOD: What's wrong?

1418
01:09:10,338 --> 01:09:11,474
JANEYEH: Go. Let's go.

1419
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:13,794
CRIS: It's all a mess.

1420
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:21,754
CRIS: Oh, I feel for him.

1421
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:23,994
JANEYEH: Ah, I won't scold you anymore.
I'm sorry.

1422
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:30,274
CRIS: I feel sorry for him.

1423
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:38,434
TOD: Oh.

1424
01:09:50,074 --> 01:09:50,914
TOD: What's stressing you out?

1425
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:52,594
TIME: I'm not stressed.

1426
01:09:54,674 --> 01:09:55,194
TOD: And about...

1427
01:09:55,394 --> 01:09:56,354
TIMETHAI: He's being an advisor again.

1428
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,594
TIME: Do you remember I told you...

1429
01:10:06,634 --> 01:10:10,354
TIME: There was a very important
moment in my life.

1430
01:10:14,474 --> 01:10:17,034
TIME: About three or four years ago,
my mother passed away.

1431
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:24,914
TIME: There are days like these when...

1432
01:10:25,114 --> 01:10:26,034
TOD: Oh, you miss her like this?

1433
01:10:26,234 --> 01:10:27,234
TIME: I miss my mom, yes.

1434
01:10:27,234 --> 01:10:28,554
TIME: It's not much.

1435
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:31,794
JANEYEH: Oh, he misses his mom.

1436
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:38,690
RUSAMEEKAE: He's someone

1437
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:40,434
RUSAMEEKAE: who genuinely
doesn't want to make anyone sad.

1438
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:42,434
JANEYEH: Yes, he doesn't
want to lose anyone.

1439
01:10:42,434 --> 01:10:44,874
RUSAMEEKAE: That's really how he is.
He doesn't want to upset the others.

1440
01:10:45,794 --> 01:10:48,866
TOD: I think that you missing your mom

1441
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:50,514
TOD: is actually a good thing.

1442
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:51,114
TIME: Yes.

1443
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:53,794
TOD: You're being with yourself,
missing your mom.

1444
01:10:53,794 --> 01:10:54,594
TIME: Yeah.

1445
01:10:59,514 --> 01:11:02,554
TOD: When you go outside,

1446
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:05,514
TOD: with so much chaos,

1447
01:11:06,954 --> 01:11:10,914
TOD: you might not miss her
as intensely as you do here.

1448
01:11:13,154 --> 01:11:15,586
TIME: I'm a person who likes to cry.

1449
01:11:15,586 --> 01:11:17,634
TIME: But before,
I wasn't brave enough to cry.

1450
01:11:23,522 --> 01:11:24,706
(Gentle touch)

1451
01:11:30,154 --> 01:11:32,546
CRIS: TOD.

1452
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:38,994
TOD: It's good.

1453
01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:44,234
TIME: It's nothing, just...

1454
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:46,834
TOD: If your mom knows,
she'd definitely be happy.

1455
01:11:48,274 --> 01:11:50,394
TOD: She'd say she misses you too.

1456
01:12:01,762 --> 01:12:02,394
(Gentle touch)

1457
01:12:02,394 --> 01:12:03,874
RUSAMEEKAE: Hold his shoulder
properly, TOD.

1458
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:05,314
JANEYEH: Oh, come on.

1459
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,778
(Pulling hair)

1460
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:15,842
(Glancing)

1461
01:12:17,554 --> 01:12:19,554
JANEYEH: TOD.

1462
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:25,914
TOD: Let's hug.
You can tell me anything.

1463
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:29,154
TOD: Just say it.

1464
01:12:31,754 --> 01:12:32,898
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD is like a microwave.

1465
01:12:32,898 --> 01:12:34,834
JANEYEH: I'm going to cry.

1466
01:12:38,794 --> 01:12:40,290
CRIS: TOD is the warmest, right?

1467
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:55,714
CRIS: This is messier than before.

1468
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,154
JANEYEH: Heh.

1469
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:09,154
TIME: Thanks for being there for me.

1470
01:13:11,034 --> 01:13:11,834
TOD: Go ahead and cry.

1471
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:22,994
JANEYEH: I don't want to cry.
I don't want to cry.

1472
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:33,474
CRIS: TOD.

1473
01:13:38,338 --> 01:13:40,706
(Hold it in)

1474
01:13:42,306 --> 01:13:43,266
TOD: You must be hungry now.

1475
01:13:46,466 --> 01:13:48,314
(Laughing)
TIME: There's nothing to eat.

1476
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:50,274
TOD: I ordered some fruit.

1477
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:51,714
TOD: I'll get you some snacks.

1478
01:13:52,954 --> 01:13:54,074
- TIME: Mm.
- TOD: Okay.

1479
01:13:55,194 --> 01:13:55,994
TOD: Just be with yourself.

1480
01:13:55,994 --> 01:13:56,834
TOD: I won't bother you anymore.

1481
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:58,314
TIME: Okay, thank you.

1482
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:01,554
TOD: Just lie down.

1483
01:14:02,178 --> 01:14:03,354
TOD: I'll go check on the fruit.

1484
01:14:03,354 --> 01:14:04,154
TIME: Thank you.

1485
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,754
RUSAMEEKAE: Even though TOD knows that
he might like someone else,

1486
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:21,514
RUSAMEEKAE: in the end,
he'll always be here.

1487
01:14:29,274 --> 01:14:30,074
MILL: How's it going?

1488
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:30,850
(Ask)

1489
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:33,634
TOD: He's just missing his mom.

1490
01:14:34,674 --> 01:14:35,474
TOD: It's nothing.

1491
01:14:35,994 --> 01:14:36,794
TOD: Oh wow.

1492
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:38,954
TOD: Oh, I want to eat Pad Ka Prao.

1493
01:14:39,234 --> 01:14:40,546
MILL: I want to eat papaya salad.

1494
01:14:40,914 --> 01:14:42,474
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD's heart
is with TIME now.

1495
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:44,994
(Help find)

1496
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:46,954
- MILL: Wow
- TOD: I'll give it to TIME.

1497
01:14:47,874 --> 01:14:49,794
JANEYEH: Oh, so sweet.

1498
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,962
- MATHEUS: Swiss made.
- TOD: Yes.

1499
01:14:53,058 --> 01:14:54,498
MATHEUS: Mayonnaise.

1500
01:14:57,714 --> 01:14:59,202
CRIS: That's really harsh.

1501
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:01,674
TOD: Eat first.

1502
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,794
TIME: It's okay.

1503
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:12,794
JANEYEH: Feeling touched, aren't you?

1504
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,754
RUSAMEEKAE: They're roommates.
Don't overthink it.

1505
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,114
MILL: I love Pixie.

1506
01:15:25,506 --> 01:15:26,268
MATHEUS: Tart.

1507
01:15:35,426 --> 01:15:37,186
MATHEUS: It reminds me of Brazil.

1508
01:15:43,274 --> 01:15:43,714
CRIS: It's a mess.

1509
01:15:43,714 --> 01:15:44,194
TIMETHAI: It's a mess.

1510
01:15:46,178 --> 01:15:47,554
JANEYEH: A big mess.

1511
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,074
TIMETHAI: Messy and broken.

1512
01:15:56,754 --> 01:15:58,714
RUSAMEEKAE: A day full of emotions,
overthinking, confusion.

1513
01:15:58,914 --> 01:16:02,434
CRIS: I wear Sherlock Holmes attire.
Sherlock Holmes isn't working at all.

1514
01:16:02,714 --> 01:16:05,874
CRIS: Every time we solve something,
Sherlock Holmes almost gives everyone a heart attack.

1515
01:16:09,674 --> 01:16:10,754
CRIS: It's just too difficult.

1516
01:16:11,074 --> 01:16:11,914
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG is hurt.

1517
01:16:12,674 --> 01:16:13,674
RUSAMEEKAE: SUNNY is hurt too.

1518
01:16:13,914 --> 01:16:15,274
RUSAMEEKAE: Then TOD is pulled in.

1519
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:17,834
RUSAMEEKAE: And TOD is about to...

1520
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:18,954
TIMETHAI: Get over it?

1521
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:20,074
RUSAMEEKAE: Have something with MILL.

1522
01:16:20,074 --> 01:16:20,594
RUSAMEEKAE: It's a loop.

1523
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,394
RUSAMEEKAE: It's because of TIME.

1524
01:16:22,514 --> 01:16:24,394
RUSAMEEKAE: TIME is someone who is...

1525
01:16:24,634 --> 01:16:25,714
RUSAMEEKAE: gentle.

1526
01:16:26,034 --> 01:16:27,234
RUSAMEEKAE: He's sensitive.

1527
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:28,962
RUSAMEEKAE: But there are some aspects
where it might feel that

1528
01:16:29,186 --> 01:16:33,754
RUSAMEEKAE: it might hurt others
when it comes to his own feelings.

1529
01:16:33,994 --> 01:16:37,594
RUSAMEEKAE: But I want everyone
to not be angry or harsh on TIME.

1530
01:16:37,914 --> 01:16:38,474
JANEYEH: True.

1531
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:42,754
RUSAMEEKAE: Try to open hearts
and think from another perspective.

1532
01:16:43,874 --> 01:16:47,114
RUSAMEEKAE: I admit that this afternoon
was another tense afternoon,

1533
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:48,554
RUSAMEEKAE: not bright.

1534
01:16:48,554 --> 01:16:53,514
RUSAMEEKAE: But tonight
will definitely turn into a thrill.

1535
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:54,154
CRIS: Really?

1536
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:58,514
RUSAMEEKAE: Do you know why?
Because it's the final trip to X-Land.

1537
01:16:58,714 --> 01:16:59,674
JANEYEH: The last time.

1538
01:16:59,914 --> 01:17:01,434
RUSAMEEKAE: It's happening now.

1539
01:17:01,434 --> 01:17:03,154
RUSAMEEKAE: Let's go see

1540
01:17:03,154 --> 01:17:04,226
RUSAMEEKAE: what it'll be like

1541
01:17:04,322 --> 01:17:06,634
RUSAMEEKAE: and who will get to go.

1542
01:17:10,754 --> 01:17:14,634
(Today is the final X-Land date)

1543
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:17,434
(of LOVE(X).)

1544
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:20,034
(The final date at X-Land)
(Those who get this special privilege...)

1545
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:21,554
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1546
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,074
CRIS: Who?

1547
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:25,218
(is the person with
the highest number of shell coins.)

1548
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:26,154
JANEYEH: The most?

1549
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:27,634
CRIS: Who has the most shell coins?

1550
01:17:29,074 --> 01:17:30,034
TIMETHAI: The final time?

1551
01:17:30,034 --> 01:17:31,634
RUSAMEEKAE: The final time.

1552
01:17:33,314 --> 01:17:34,114
TOD: I'm not going then.

1553
01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:34,994
CRIS: It's not TOD.

1554
01:17:37,354 --> 01:17:37,874
RUSAMEEKAE: Who?

1555
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:39,554
(SUNNY.)

1556
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:40,794
CRIS: SUNNY.

1557
01:17:41,474 --> 01:17:43,474
(SUNNY has the most coins.
She earns the right for the last trip to X-Land.)

1558
01:17:43,474 --> 01:17:44,794
JANEYEH: SUNNY has kept
her coins all the time.

1559
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:45,474
MATHEUS: What?

1560
01:17:46,754 --> 01:17:51,234
(SUNNY, please go back to your room
to read the rule letter.)

1561
01:17:52,386 --> 01:17:53,354
SUNNY: Bye everyone.

1562
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:53,954
TOD: Bye.

1563
01:17:53,954 --> 01:17:54,754
FRAME: Bye.

1564
01:17:56,474 --> 01:17:57,194
CRIS: A mess.

1565
01:17:57,194 --> 01:17:57,994
TIMETHAI: A big mess.

1566
01:18:00,114 --> 01:18:03,074
CRIS: JOY is pitiful.
JOY also hoped it would be her, right?

1567
01:18:04,034 --> 01:18:09,714
SUNNY: Choose with your heart and write the name
of the person you want to spend it with on the invitation card.

1568
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:15,874
JANEYEH: SUNNY is stressed too.

1569
01:18:16,034 --> 01:18:18,114
MATHEUS: So you think tonight
you're gonna go to X-Land again?

1570
01:18:19,514 --> 01:18:20,514
MATHEUS: It's gonna be so hard.

1571
01:18:20,594 --> 01:18:21,634
RUSAMEEKAE: Because she's bisexual.

1572
01:18:21,674 --> 01:18:22,554
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG is also bisexual.

1573
01:18:22,754 --> 01:18:24,154
RUSAMEEKAE: If you're going with bisexuals,
then everyone is bisexual.

1574
01:18:24,594 --> 01:18:26,514
JANEYEH: Or is it MATHEUS?

1575
01:18:27,194 --> 01:18:28,514
TOD: I'm not going again.

1576
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:29,954
RUSAMEEKAE: JOY?

1577
01:18:29,954 --> 01:18:30,994
JANEYEH: Or will it be JOY?

1578
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:34,554
KONG: But if SUNNY picks JOY,
and then there's NAMNUNG too.

1579
01:18:35,354 --> 01:18:36,874
CRIS: The instigators are here.

1580
01:18:37,154 --> 01:18:37,914
TIME: She's here.

1581
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:41,714
- FRAME: She's here.
- KONG: Oh my God.

1582
01:18:42,154 --> 01:18:43,234
RUSAMEEKAE: Who is she going to?

1583
01:18:43,514 --> 01:18:44,314
TOD: Wow.

1584
01:18:44,394 --> 01:18:45,194
CANDIDATE: She's here.

1585
01:18:45,674 --> 01:18:46,994
RUSAMEEKAE:
I'm excited about the outfit.

1586
01:18:48,314 --> 01:18:49,514
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

1587
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:51,314
(Going to TIME)
CRIS: I'm very excited.

1588
01:18:56,234 --> 01:18:57,034
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

1589
01:18:57,514 --> 01:18:58,394
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.

1590
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:01,154
RUSAMEEKAE: TOD is happy.

1591
01:19:03,274 --> 01:19:04,834
RUSAMEEKAE: Don't tell me
it ends like this.

1592
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:09,890
(In the end,
who will SUNNY take to X-Land?)

1593
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,674
TIMETHAI: Oh, next week again.

1594
01:19:13,794 --> 01:19:14,834
TIMETHAI: This phrase comes up again.

1595
01:19:15,274 --> 01:19:16,474
CRIS: Is that true?

1596
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:17,554
CRIS: Is this over now?

1597
01:19:19,274 --> 01:19:20,802
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe she just went to ask.

1598
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:22,272
RUSAMEEKAE: Maybe she didn't pick him.

1599
01:19:22,272 --> 01:19:23,154
(Don't trust anything at all)
RUSAMEEKAE: I can't trust anyone.

1600
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:26,338
CRIS: She can't be that tough.

1601
01:19:26,674 --> 01:19:28,434
RUSAMEEKAE: But it's between
NAMNUNG and TIME.

1602
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:31,746
RUSAMEEKAE:
Ending in LOVE(X) style again.

1603
01:19:32,794 --> 01:19:35,298
RUSAMEEKAE: It's totally unpredictable
to see what will happen.

1604
01:19:35,474 --> 01:19:36,634
RUSAMEEKAE: We don't know either

1605
01:19:36,994 --> 01:19:38,314
RUSAMEEKAE: who will be picked.

1606
01:19:38,434 --> 01:19:40,794
RUSAMEEKAE: If anyone wants to know
how the final X-Land

1607
01:19:41,314 --> 01:19:42,338
RUSAMEEKAE: will be...

1608
01:19:42,338 --> 01:19:45,554
RUSAMEEKAE: If you want to know,
stay tuned for next week.

1609
01:19:45,554 --> 01:19:48,834
RUSAMEEKAE: Keep cheering them
on every Saturday at 6 PM Beijing Time,

1610
01:19:48,834 --> 01:19:51,034
RUSAMEEKAE: only on WeTV

1611
01:19:51,034 --> 01:19:52,314
RUSAMEEKAE: with

1612
01:19:52,314 --> 01:19:54,034
RUSAMEEKAE: Borderless Love

1613
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:55,194
RUSAMEEKAE: LOVE(X).

1614
01:19:57,634 --> 01:19:59,794
CRIS: I've got a headache today,
I'll leave for now.

1615
01:19:59,794 --> 01:20:03,194
CRIS: I'm going to take some painkillers.
See you next week, bye.

1616
01:20:05,474 --> 01:20:06,114
(Focus)

1617
01:20:06,114 --> 01:20:07,714
CRIS: Oh, is TIMETHAI okay?

1618
01:20:08,594 --> 01:20:09,394
CRIS: Calm down.

1619
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:11,274
RUSAMEEKAE: I'm excited
about the outfit.

1620
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:13,794
CRIS: Wow.

1621
01:20:14,754 --> 01:20:15,554
JANEYEH: Oops.

1622
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:20,954
(So, what exactly happened?)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh!

1623
01:20:20,994 --> 01:20:24,434
SUNNY: Honestly, I've wanted to know
from the beginning if you're interested in me.

1624
01:20:26,754 --> 01:20:28,322
SUNNY: Can't you tell I like you?

1625
01:20:30,074 --> 01:20:34,274
SUNNY: It makes me wonder
if it could turn into something else.

1626
01:20:35,034 --> 01:20:35,834
JANEYEH: Wow.

1627
01:20:36,314 --> 01:20:38,474
CRIS: This is...

1628
01:20:38,674 --> 01:20:41,114
SUNNY: The first person
I slept with was actually a woman.

1629
01:20:43,354 --> 01:20:43,874
CRIS: That's harsh.

1630
01:20:43,874 --> 01:20:44,994
JANEYEH: Just shoot, boom.

1631
01:20:45,434 --> 01:20:46,234
RUSAMEEKAE: Hey!

1632
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,042
RUSAMEEKAE: NAMNUNG.

1633
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:48,438
LOVE(X)PERT: First day outfit, right?

1634
01:20:50,474 --> 01:20:51,274
CRIS: That's hot.

1635
01:20:51,954 --> 01:20:52,794
TIMETHAI: It's right, isn't it?

1636
01:20:52,954 --> 01:20:54,474
CRIS: They're both really good.

1637
01:20:55,394 --> 01:20:57,954
(Next, we'll start the battle for)

1638
01:20:57,954 --> 01:21:00,514
(the last couple date
before confessing love.)

1639
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:02,794
(Start the competition) RUSAMEEKAE:
Oh, playing a game to win the right first.

1640
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,841
(And the one who gets it...)

1641
01:21:09,314 --> 01:21:10,834
RUSAMEEKAE:
We'll have to see who gets it.

1642
01:21:10,834 --> 01:21:11,682
CRIS: Oh, it's random.

1643
01:21:13,434 --> 01:21:15,330
(TOD and NAMNUNG.)

1644
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,274
CRIS: These two again.
They have such luck.

1645
01:21:22,314 --> 01:21:23,234
NAMNUNG: Hesitate.

1646
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:25,074
RUSAMEEKAE: Who is NAMNUNG inviting?

1647
01:21:31,138 --> 01:21:31,794
NAMNUNG: Hello.

1648
01:21:31,794 --> 01:21:32,594
CANDIDATE: So beautiful.

1649
01:21:33,794 --> 01:21:34,562
CRIS: TIME, SUNNY.

1650
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:35,810
(Who will NAMNUNG invite for a date?)
RUSAMEEKAE: Oh my God.
