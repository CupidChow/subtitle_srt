JUNSU: do you think
who is the most handsome

232
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,530
JUNSU: among the guys?

233
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,824
JUNSU: She thinks it's us.

ASSE: And we don't know...

274
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:11,770

to ask him yourselves. I'd better not tell.

275
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,810
ASSE: And not lucky, because
if a new guy comes into this house,

276
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,664
ASSE: and the girls will...

277
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,010

TIME: If we like the same person,
it will be like...

282
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,650
ASSE: Yes.

283
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,010
TIME: But if a new guy comes, okay,

284
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,050

SUNNY: But you have to
check out others, right?

I haven't felt a connection with anyone.
