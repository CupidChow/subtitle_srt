1
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,661
Hye-bok, are you sleeping?

2
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,372
Why aren't you at school? Hurry up.

3
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,082
I'm bored.

4
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,463
Why is your phone still off?
It's lunchtime already.

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,923
Call me as soon as you get this.

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,050
You're making me worried.

7
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,304
Is something wrong?

8
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,307
I'm heading over there.

9
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,412
BEWARE OF FOREST FIRES

10
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,182
You have arrived at your destination.

11
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,351
The route guidance is now finished.

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,280
KISS BURN

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,805
Your foot.

14
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,937
Is this Hye-bok's house?

15
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,365
This is my house.

16
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,452
Are you her father?

17
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,121
Yes.

18
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,292
Why?

19
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,460
What's that look for?

20
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,796
Is Hye-bok here?

21
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,133
No.

22
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,676
Where is she?

23
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,846
At her uncle's.

24
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,351
I can't get in touch with her.

25
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,478
Is there something going on?

26
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,189
Her phone's broken.

27
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,525
Why?

28
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,527
It fell in the toilet.

29
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,327
What's that sound?

30
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,830
Get out. Hey.

31
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,540
You get injured often, don't you?

32
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,669
Hye-bok told you stuff like that?

33
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,213
I know you two are not close.

34
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,051
I can just tell by myself.

35
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,304
Nosy people like you often get injured.

36
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,770
You're just like
how Hye-bok described you.

37
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,231
All right.

38
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,192
Just go. Hye-bok isn't here. Come on.

39
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,403
Wait...

40
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,817
Hye-bok.

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,445
Hye-bok, it's me, Han-na.

42
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,657
You're in there, right?
You just made that sound, didn't you?

43
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,243
Is this your room?

44
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,040
Oh, my gosh!

45
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,295
This is my room.

46
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,173
Now leave.

47
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,418
BEWARE OF FOREST FIRES

48
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,819
Hye-bok.

49
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,031
Hye-bok!

50
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,747
Han-na.

51
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,667
Hey, your hair...

52
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,928
Were you hit?

53
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,472
No, I wasn't.

54
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,307
Then what are these?
Are these from allergies?

55
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,975
They are hickeys.

56
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,644
Hickeys?

57
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,978
Yes.

58
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,689
Don't you know what that is?

59
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,986
You know, the marks you get from kissing.
You're old enough to know that.

60
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,282
I know what they are.
The stuff you get from kissing.

61
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,369
The question is where you got them.

62
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,830
At the beach.

63
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,331
-At the beach?
-Yes.

64
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,416
You went to the beach? When?

65
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,168
Last night.

66
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,379
I go there from time to time
when I get lonely.

67
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,509
Who did you do it with?

68
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,219
Some guy.

69
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,305
You aren't seeing any guys, though.

70
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,350
There are guys
when you go to the beach at night.

71
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,270
So you had your first kiss
with a stranger?

72
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,604
Yes.

73
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,358
He attends Dongil High School.

74
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,609
So he's a delinquent?

75
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,946
He's not exactly a delinquent...

76
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,365
Is he?

77
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,035
But delinquents are usually handsome.

78
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,913
Well, you're right.

79
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,380
Then why is your hair like that?

80
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,303
Oh, right. My hair.

81
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,139
What do I do?

82
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,310
My hair...

83
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,730
It's okay.

84
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,149
Don't look at my hair.

85
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,568
-It's fine.
-Close your eyes.

86
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,571
-Don't look at my hair.
-It's really fine.

87
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,655
I already saw it, anyway.

88
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,743
My dad got drunk and cut my hair like this

89
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,786
when I was sleeping.

90
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,707
How can I live like this?

91
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,169
Just forget it and live on
like you used to.

92
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,254
How can I forget this?

93
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,551
All you did was kiss each other?

94
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:33,971
Well,

95
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,806
we went a bit further.

96
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,351
A bit further? How much?

97
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,727
Did you sleep with him?

98
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,731
How could we? We were outside.

99
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,736
It would be hard to do it outside.

100
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,741
Thinking about that jerk
makes me angry, though.

101
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,369
How could he do this to you?

102
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,745
Did he do this on purpose?

103
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,583
I did the same thing to him.
I bet he has similar marks by now.

104
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,711
-You did this to him, too?
-Yes.

105
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,713
Does it just come naturally?

106
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,299
Well, you might not know yet,

107
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,512
but when you're kissing,
you can't keep a straight mind.

108
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,639
-You can't?
-No.

109
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,308
So, my hands just naturally

110
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,019
-slide...
-To where?

111
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,189
And my body just moves naturally.

112
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,983
Move how?

113
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,695
I just move my body unconsciously.

114
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,364
-You do?
-Yes.

115
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,242
It relieves all my stress.

116
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,870
I didn't know you get stressed.

117
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,455
I guess I do.

118
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,427
But that guy would go to school
even if he has hickeys.

119
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,429
Guys like him would just show it off.

120
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,515
Gosh, that pisses me off.

121
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,275
We can't just sit back.

122
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,153
Let's get revenge.

123
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,071
On who? Him?

124
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
But...

125
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,743
I don't even know his name.

126
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,119
What?

127
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,246
I don't have his number, either.

128
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,206
You didn't even get his number?

129
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,584
Why would I?

130
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,086
I can't believe you.

131
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,592
Then who would we get revenge on?

132
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,303
Your father.

133
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,513
My dad?

134
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,059
This is just unbelievable.

135
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,394
What kind of father
would do this to his own daughter?

136
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,939
Why do you put up with all this?

137
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,609
Well, I have you.

138
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,535
I won't let him get away with this.

139
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,206
SESAME OIL

140
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,546
Spread it out thinly.

141
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,756
-Like this?
-Yes.

142
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,591
Spread this over there.

143
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,262
Is it enough just to make him slip?

144
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,390
Yes, it's enough.

145
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,148
What if he gets hurt, though?

146
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,900
He should get hurt for once.

147
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,376
All right, I'll be off.

148
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,378
-Bye.
-Bye.

149
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,091
-Be careful on your way back.
-Okay, bye.

150
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,452
HOW TO FILE A LEGAL COMPLAINT ON YOUR OWN

151
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,798
It's falling over now?

152
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,633
It should've fallen over a while ago.

153
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,761
We can't just sit back. Let's kill him.

154
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,353
It's like an ice skating rink.

155
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,981
It's so slippery.

156
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,108
-Look.
-This is really slippery.

157
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,651
He's doomed now.

158
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,414
He's here.

159
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,176
SUMMONS NOTICE TO THE DEFENDANT

160
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,102
Why would he come inside
with his shoes on?

161
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,983
It's hard to get revenge.

162
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,235
It is.

163
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,589
Try one.

164
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,845
This is one way to get revenge, you know.

165
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,852
Why are you getting scared over nothing?
It's not a big deal.

166
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,271
Come on.

167
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,981
Should I try one?

168
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,079
Blow into it.

169
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,165
That's right.

170
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,763
What do you think? Can you feel anything?

171
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,807
-It feels...
-Yes?

172
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,684
like it's making me brave.

173
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,436
You're totally suited for this.

174
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,703
-It's my dad!
-What?

175
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,417
Is there a road ahead?

176
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,961
No, there isn't. Go back.

177
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,754
All right. Sorry.

178
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,396
Gosh, why did he have to get lost here?
He really scared me.

179
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,273
You coward.

180
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,941
You're no better.

181
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,943
Hey, I'm not as bad as you.

182
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,497
I smell something nice.

183
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,669
You're right.

184
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,005
I guess I'm really hungry.

185
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,549
It's about time we got hungry.

186
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,473
-Fire!
-What the hell?

187
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,016
Fire!

188
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,559
Oh, gosh. What do we do?

189
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,437
-Water! Get some water!
-Right, water.

190
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,646
-Hurry!
-There's no water.

191
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,148
Where can we get water?

192
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,743
Move over. Come on.

193
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,135
Hey, it's dangerous!

194
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,304
What do we do?

195
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,184
-Hey, use dirt.
-The dirt?

196
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,641
The chickens... Oh, no.

197
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,019
We could have all died. Oh, my gosh.

198
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,655
-Han-na, let's stop this now.
-Oh, gosh.

199
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,115
Okay?

200
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,992
Let's stop this.

201
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,122
That was close.

202
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,710
Why did you throw your cigarette here?

203
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,422
I don't know why I did that.

204
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,343
Don't cry. It's okay.

205
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,762
You're the one who told me to try it.

206
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,645
Why did you get a shovel?

207
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,439
A shovel?

208
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,900
Why did you bring that shovel?

209
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,236
-Why would you...
-It's better than bringing flour!

210
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,157
We almost died!

211
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,617
I'm exhausted.

212
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,493
You were clueless, too.

213
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,748
That was so funny.

214
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,006
Are you stressed?

215
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,758
Yes.

216
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,806
Do you want to go to the beach, then?

217
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,017
The beach?

218
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,687
You said going to the beach
helps relieve stress.

219
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,981
Right.

220
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,361
I'll take you there. Do you want to go?

221
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,656
-Should we go?
-Okay, let's go.

222
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,949
-Really?
-Let's go.

223
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,659
-We're going now?
-Yes.

224
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,619
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

225
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,663
Let's go to the beach
and relieve some stress.

226
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,040
I feel like my stress
is going away already.

227
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,147
I really smell something nice.

228
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,484
You're right.
Isn't this the smell of fried chicken?

229
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,196
-Do they sell fried chicken at the beach?
-Of course.

230
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,823
They sell everything at the beach.

231
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,617
Really? That's amazing.

232
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,035
Of course.

233
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,039
By the way, what does your dad do?

234
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,750
My dad? He's a forest fire lookout.

235
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,505
A forest fire lookout...

236
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:20,649
KISS BURN

237
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,901
