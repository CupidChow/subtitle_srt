1
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,124
My sister was having
a really difficult time.

2
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,501
She said she couldn't live like that
any longer.

3
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,963
She started saying
that she just wanted to die.

4
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,969
But she never really wanted to die.

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,347
I guess she endured all that time
in the hospital

6
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,933
because she actually wanted to live.

7
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,815
But she ended up dying.

8
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,159
I stayed with her,

9
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,747
watching her pass away slowly.

10
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,878
At the moment of her death,
she opened her mouth.

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,175
She was desperately trying
to breathe her last breath.

12
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,560
Like this. She died
with her mouth open like this.

13
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,614
That is why

14
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:59,077
I promised myself that I would never die
with my mouth open.

15
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,707
I'll resist life by accepting my death
when I die.

16
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,378
That's what I decided.

17
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:17,345
WALKING AT NIGHT

18
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,268
Why are you telling me such gloomy stuff?

19
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,602
What?

20
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,815
Stuff like dying.

21
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,988
Because...

22
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,823
I'm dead.

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,081
Did you forget?

24
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,503
I remember now.

25
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,261
You died...

26
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,387
You did...

27
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:00,889
You...

28
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,928
Hey.

29
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,353
Why are you crying? You're making me sad.

30
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,982
You didn't even shed a single tear
at my funeral.

31
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,246
I thought about cutting ties with you
since you didn't cry.

32
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,583
I don't know how I'd cut ties
after dying, though.

33
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,469
I didn't want to cry.

34
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,433
I don't even know
why I'm crying right now.

35
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,689
You're the one who died and left me here.

36
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,732
Why should I cry for you?

37
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,570
Why are you getting so worked up?

38
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,990
It's such a nice night.

39
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,033
Come on.

40
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,953
Don't you remember this street?

41
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,590
This is where we used to walk together.

42
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,302
Do you remember now?

43
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,056
I remember. You flirted with me here.

44
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,267
-I did?
-Yes, totally.

45
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,811
I just showed my affection to you.
Don't call it flirting.

46
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,695
You smelled really nice that night.

47
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,657
And now, too.

48
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,834
It's amazing how I can smell stuff
even in a dream.

49
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,170
Right.

50
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,215
Do you realize that you're in a dream now?

51
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,477
Then are you not real?

52
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,187
I am.

53
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,691
Well, I'm not alive, so maybe I am not.

54
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,280
I feel sad

55
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,909
because I can feel that I am disappearing

56
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,411
as if I am slipping away.

57
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,416
I don't know where I am now,

58
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,461
but I wanted to come and see you

59
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,089
before I completely disappear.

60
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,014
So I used your dream, like this.

61
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,272
So is this what it's like to see
dead people in your dream?

62
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,066
I'm not sure.

63
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,985
I haven't been dead for long,
so I don't know much.

64
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,031
Anyway, I heard that when you wake up
from the dream,

65
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,659
you would barely remember anything.

66
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,995
Then what's the point of all this
if I can't remember anything?

67
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,163
And you're already dead.

68
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,916
Remembering isn't important.

69
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,086
The important thing...

70
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,965
is that we can be together again
like this.

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,938
I'm starting to get sad again.

72
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,900
Don't cry. You'll wake up from your dream.

73
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,947
Okay.

74
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,286
You're so obedient. Good boy.

75
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,373
That's why I liked you so much.

76
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,553
I loved this place.

77
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,805
Do you think it's still there?

78
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,891
I'm not sure.

79
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,143
Do you remember what we ate?

80
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,728
Of course.

81
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,483
They were selling a glass of wine
at a ridiculous price of 3,900 won.

82
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,402
You remember stuff like that?

83
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,863
Of course, I remember everything.

84
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,992
I remember the strange painting
hung on the stone wall,

85
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,287
and the drunk man
who was sleeping next to us.

86
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,582
There was another table across from us,

87
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,003
and nice music was playing
inside the restaurant.

88
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,256
I think the music was strange.

89
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,055
Right, it was this song.

90
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,108
I remember the bad wine, too.

91
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,735
I liked it, though.

92
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,445
It was terrible.

93
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,329
It really is terrible.

94
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,200
Aren't you curious about why I died?

95
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,708
What's the point?

96
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,086
You said I wouldn't remember anything
when I wake up.

97
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,674
Well, then...

98
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,688
Why did you die?

99
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,070
I was lonely.

100
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,876
The loneliness I felt seemed endless.

101
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,963
I couldn't see the end of it.

102
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,178
Did I make you feel lonely?

103
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,058
No.

104
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,897
You were always there for me.

105
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,446
There are people who know me
and people who don't.

106
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,242
You were one of those who knew me,

107
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,621
and there were others besides you.

108
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,835
Those people were the ones
who made me feel lonely.

109
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,132
There were so many people

110
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,095
who knew me other than you,

111
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,391
but the way they treated me
made me feel lonely.

112
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,146
You were always there for me,

113
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,484
but I just suffered in vain

114
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,988
until I died.

115
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,169
What are you doing?

116
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,592
I'm trying to make sure
I remember this when I wake up.

117
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,523
I'll never stop blaming myself.

118
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,069
I'll probably spend the rest of my life

119
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,865
trying to figure out what I did
to make you die.

120
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,493
I'm sorry.

121
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,501
I want to...

122
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,630
make you remember
that it wasn't your fault.

123
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,878
Did you see how I died?

124
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,216
No.

125
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,220
I only heard about it.

126
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,684
I didn't die right away,

127
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,187
even when I fell from so high.

128
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,483
I was conscious for a moment.

129
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,444
People gathered around me,

130
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,614
and I closed my mouth
with all my strength.

131
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,077
I couldn't breathe through my nose
because of the blood,

132
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,412
but I still closed my mouth.

133
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,460
I can't remember how I died, though.

134
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,674
Do you happen to know whether I died

135
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,425
with my mouth open or closed?

136
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,470
No, I don't.

137
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,390
I'm curious.

138
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,395
You still get curious about things
even after death?

139
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,982
I guess so.

140
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,112
I don't know where my sister is

141
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,407
and where I'm going.

142
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,452
Even when I'm dead,

143
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,873
I constantly feel the sense
of disappearing.

144
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,334
The sense of disappearing...

145
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,170
That's all there is.

146
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,258
There is nothing...

147
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,761
I can figure out.

148
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,231
It was summer.

149
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,742
That night. It was a summer night.

150
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,329
I could hear the sound of insects.

151
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,804
Dreams and death

152
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,892
lead to nowhere.

153
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,565
They will end up nowhere...

154
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,361
and eventually be forgotten.

155
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,737
We are here,

156
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,242
but no one will remember us.

157
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,876
Everything is gone,
and only the night remains.

158
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,680
Goodbye.

159
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,394
