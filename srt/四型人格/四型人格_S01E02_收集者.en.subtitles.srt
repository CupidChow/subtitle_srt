1
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,008
Since the first time I saw you,
I knew you were special...

2
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,221
and had many secrets.

3
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:05,774
COLLECTOR

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,155
How have you been?

5
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,574
Good.

6
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,534
Really?

7
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,333
Well, it was nice to have some time
for myself.

8
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,503
And it wasn't the first time you did this.

9
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,215
I'm sorry for disappearing
suddenly like that.

10
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,842
No, it's fine.

11
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,511
It's okay.

12
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,518
But...

13
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,356
why haven't you contacted me?
I'm just curious.

14
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,613
Do you want to hear something
that would comfort you?

15
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,865
Or the truth?

16
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,160
Stop joking around.

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,287
I want the truth.

18
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,417
I went on a trip.

19
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,254
Did you get me any presents, then?

20
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,258
It's nothing much, but...

21
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,767
Wait.

22
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,479
Open it after I leave, okay?

23
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,608
Don't worry.

24
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,487
You'll never forget this day.

25
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,322
I'll make sure of it.

26
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,203
Really?

27
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,792
Did you go on the trip by yourself?

28
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,713
No, I went to an island
with my foreign friends.

29
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,131
Two of them.

30
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,592
Are they guys?

31
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,011
Yes. I needed to get something from there.

32
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,233
Which island did you go to?

33
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,527
-It's called Phi Phi Islands.
-Oh, DiCaprio?

34
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,946
Yes, one of his movies was filmed there.

35
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,407
Youngsters doing drugs
and having sex and stuff...

36
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,159
That was a bizarre movie.

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,828
By the way,

38
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,206
do you speak English?

39
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,418
Well, there was really no need
to talk much.

40
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,378
Then, what did you do?

41
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,757
I surfed and snorkeled.

42
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,969
It was so fun and exciting
surfing with my friends.

43
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,265
Surfing?

44
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,645
Yes. Just giving myself to the waves

45
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,650
made me feel like I became sugar.

46
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,239
It was so exciting.

47
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,117
It was fascinating.

48
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,459
And I did some reading.

49
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,839
It must have been a valuable experience.

50
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,176
Your body and mind
must have gotten healthier.

51
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,890
You're really awesome.
You're not acting jealous.

52
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,150
Anyway, what kind of book did you read?

53
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,028
The Kama Sutra of Patañjali.

54
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:40,947
What?

55
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,742
I mean the Yoga Sutras of Patañjali.
It's just a yoga book.

56
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,369
It wasn't really interesting.

57
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,086
What did I tell you?

58
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,880
I told you she wasn't human.

59
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,383
You should've been good to me
when we were together.

60
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,970
Jeong-u.

61
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,223
Being plain and simple is the best.

62
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,142
That's why it's hard to be that way.

63
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,853
You even broke off our engagement.

64
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,939
Were you that eager
to be with a young and pretty girl?

65
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,026
-Jeong-u.
-Yes?

66
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,736
What's with that face?

67
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,030
Are you thinking weird stuff again?

68
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,781
No, I'm not.

69
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,618
So, tell me more about your trip.

70
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,454
I want to hear more.

71
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,622
It's boring for me.

72
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,583
It's all in the past now.

73
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,551
I feel a bit stuffy.

74
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,136
Why don't we walk a bit?

75
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,430
Sure.

76
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,011
Do you remember

77
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,806
the day you wore the yellow shirt?

78
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,104
Was it spring?

79
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,189
Or was it summer?

80
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,653
You looked really pretty that day.

81
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,075
And...

82
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,619
under that bridge...

83
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,801
I was that passionate?

84
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,558
It was so entrancing.

85
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:15,852
Come on.

86
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,646
You said the same thing
to other women, didn't you?

87
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,483
Oh, right.

88
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,027
There's something I'm curious about.

89
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,988
What is it?

90
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,866
What do women mean to you?

91
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,204
You know how they say

92
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,124
that men talk to women to sleep with them,

93
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,960
and women sleep with men to talk to them.

94
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,503
Oh, that makes sense.

95
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,130
Really?

96
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,215
Do you really think so?

97
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,343
It's not that simple.

98
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,180
Anyway,

99
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,391
I've thought that women
are much more superior to men

100
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,143
since long ago.

101
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,521
Why?

102
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,108
If God is in a human form,

103
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,028
I think it would be of a woman.

104
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,699
You think so?

105
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,580
Well, women can give birth to babies.
They can bear new lives.

106
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,125
And they bleed once a month as Jesus did.

107
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,460
Men can't even imagine

108
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,838
how painful and tough it is
to go through something like that.

109
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,132
But women endure it all.

110
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,135
And most dominant animals and plants

111
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,637
are beautiful.

112
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,264
Just think about the delicate
and smooth lines

113
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,517
of the female body.

114
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,646
But aren't male peacocks
and lions more beautiful than the female?

115
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,733
Well...

116
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,236
Well,

117
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,446
what I want to say

118
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,574
is that women are more beautiful
and stronger

119
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,077
and that they give birth to new lives.

120
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,162
That makes them closer to God.

121
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,792
And you know,

122
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,919
no matter how tough a guy is,
he'll need the love

123
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,629
of his mother and a woman.

124
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,840
You know, that man...

125
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,135
Pablo Escobar.

126
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,265
He became a drug lord to protect
his wife and children.

127
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,308
The nature of men...

128
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,436
It's all about hunting,

129
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,897
destruction, and war.

130
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,777
Men are nothing without the love of women.

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,248
KIM JIN-U: CAN YOU COME OUT FOR A SECOND?

132
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,667
You're the only guy I've met
who says stuff like that.

133
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,712
It's so interesting.

134
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,592
Did you even hear what I said?

135
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,014
Since it's so fun to talk to you,
why don't we

136
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,474
just talk on the phone from now on?

137
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,518
What do you think?

138
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,273
Hang on.

139
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm going to use the restroom.

140
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,927
I went on a trip.

141
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,680
-That's a bit erotic.
-Really? You don't like it?

142
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,681
I like it.

143
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,228
-Aren't you here with someone?
-I am. I should go now.

144
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,480
All right.

145
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,191
-When can I see you again?
-We can meet again later.

146
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,913
Don't.

147
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,873
You brought it all on yourself.

148
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,042
Just don't do anything.

149
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,914
Ji-su.

150
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,667
-Yes?
-Do you know him?

151
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,793
No.

152
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,755
-Where was it again?
-I found this place...

153
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,133
Look at this. Here.

154
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,313
Who is he?

155
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,608
What? Why?

156
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,821
You two seemed close.

157
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,532
Yes, he's a friend.

158
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,995
We do yoga together.
He told me something funny.

159
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,332
Something about yoga?

160
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,376
Yes.

161
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,045
There's a god named Shiva,
the god of yoga.

162
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,259
"Shiva"? So there's even a god of yoga.

163
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,097
If your thoughts are right,
Shiva would be a female.

164
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,600
According to my friend,

165
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,352
Shiva could talk to fish.

166
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,189
Apparently, if you master yoga,

167
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,192
you can stay underwater
for a long time without breathing.

168
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,237
If you can really do that,
wouldn't it be fantastic?

169
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,866
Humans have so many limits.

170
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,582
I just...

171
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,503
want to be more free and eternal.

172
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,597
Jeong-u, I'm getting bored now.
I'll be off.

173
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,724
Eun.

174
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,852
It's been a while since we last met.

175
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,190
Why don't you stay with me tonight?

176
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,985
What?

177
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,988
If that's what you wanted,
why didn't you say so before?

178
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,549
It's getting late.

179
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,967
Maybe next time.

180
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,428
Don't go. Please. You can't.

181
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,932
What's up with you? I'm tired.

182
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:14,353
I really need to tell you something.

183
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,398
I really do. Let's just talk for a minute.

184
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,276
What more do you have to say?
We already talked a lot.

185
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,738
What you want to say
is that you want me to stay with you

186
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,907
and sleep with you, isn't it?

187
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,701
No, it isn't.

188
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,707
All right, then.

189
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,877
I'll hear what you have to say.

190
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,858
Don't you think...

191
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,237
you're being too harsh on me?

192
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,822
What do you mean?

193
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,535
Are we even dating? Would you say we are?

194
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,662
Well, in some ways.

195
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,085
I went through so much to be with you.

196
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,055
I mean,

197
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,766
you just disappeared...

198
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,271
for over ten days
without saying anything to me,

199
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,233
and told me nonsense
about going to an island with some guys.

200
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,527
And you just kept
looking at your phone all day.

201
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,989
You told me you're going to the restroom
and kissed someone else.

202
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,534
And now you say you're leaving
because you're bored?

203
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,872
How can you be so rude?

204
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,376
You shouldn't treat
your boyfriend like this.

205
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,006
How long should I put up with this?

206
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,093
What...

207
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,388
What do I mean to you?

208
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,474
You're talking about
that stupid "meaning" again.

209
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,558
Hey!

210
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,652
You told me you found me attractive
because I had a lot of secrets.

211
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,905
You don't even remember
saying that, do you?

212
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,617
Hey.

213
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,247
I do not have any legal obligations
to you, Jeong-u.

214
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,040
We are in a non-committed relationship
here.

215
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,292
Wherever I go, whatever I do,

216
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,795
whatever I want to do,
and whatever I talk about with anyone...

217
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,965
It is all up to me to decide.

218
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,677
Jeong-u.

219
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,722
There are all kinds
of strange relationships in the world

220
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,433
that you cannot understand.

221
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,144
So what I mean is that B doesn't
have to come after A,

222
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,772
and two doesn't have to come after one.
Do you get it?

223
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,485
I just stayed with you all day

224
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,155
to be polite to you,

225
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,157
and that time's up now.

226
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,034
I listened to everything you said today.

227
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,494
That stuff about women and God?

228
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,455
It wasn't the first time you said it.

229
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,042
I just sat quietly and listened to you
when I already heard it several times.

230
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,086
I feel a bit bad for you,

231
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,505
and I still have a bit of respect
and affection for you.

232
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,759
That's the only reason I stayed with you.
So what is this all about?

233
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,803
What do you want from me?

234
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,019
What you said is right.

235
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,648
But...

236
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,527
I...

237
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,155
love you.

238
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,535
Can't you see how I feel?

239
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,415
Can't you? Can't you see
how I feel about you?

240
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,376
What do I have to do?

241
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,006
I don't know.

242
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,177
I don't see anything right now.

243
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,723
You're just...

244
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,019
not cool.

245
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,815
Can't you be cool?

246
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,693
I wish...

247
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,239
you could just be cool for one second.

248
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,573
Please.

249
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,451
You always talk about love,
but do you even know what it is?

250
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,038
Show me what true love is.

251
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,458
If there is such a thing, show me.

252
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,752
Take your heart out and show it to me.

253
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,504
Come on, take it out.

254
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,673
You can't, can you?

255
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,303
I haven't seen anyone
who'd do that much for me recently.

256
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,959
Is this enough?

257
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,187
I'll salt this properly

258
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,023
and preserve it well so it won't rot

259
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,525
for a long time.

260
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,083
Your name was Baek...

261
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,627
Jeong...

262
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,380
Jeong-u.

263
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,382
Right, Baek Jeong-u.

264
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,509
"Jeong-u."

265
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,732
LEE JI-HO

266
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,985
BAEK JEONG-U

267
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,487
I told you
that you'd never forget this day.

268
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,283
I love you.

269
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,328
Goodbye.

270
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,795
