1
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,548
Left!

2
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,548
All right.

3
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,269
Again.

4
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,729
Don't make strange noises
when you play tennis

5
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,022
with other guys.

6
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,315
What noises?

7
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,652
-Noises like this?
-Yes.

8
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,403
Don't do that.

9
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,832
Don't marry that woman, Dad.

10
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,131
Why aren't you answering me?

11
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,479
Do you want to play a match with me?

12
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,494
Go on. You two look good together.

13
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,708
If I win,

14
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,419
end things with your dad.

15
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,672
And if I win?

16
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,008
If you win,

17
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,176
I'll end things with your dad.

18
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,016
No. If I win,

19
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,643
just marry your boyfriend.

20
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,899
He's not my boyfriend!

21
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,193
What's the problem?

22
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,112
You just have to win.

23
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,789
You...

24
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,504
We're not...

25
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,507
We're not...

26
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,218
-I called him here to seduce her.
-Don't worry.

27
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,387
-You'll lose.
-I told him to seduce her,

28
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,847
-not act like my boyfriend.
-Father.

29
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,808
This idiot can't understand anything
I tell him.

30
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,269
Goodness.

31
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,147
If you go around saying
you are my boyfriend,

32
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,857
there's no way she'll get seduced by you.

33
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,942
Gosh.

34
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,528
You never do anything right
when I ask for a favor!

35
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,697
It's my fault for calling you here.

36
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,283
What an idiot!

37
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,255
Oh, no!

38
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,286
Hold on...

39
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,320
Please,

40
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,739
I can't accept this.

41
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,870
You... already agreed to it.

42
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,998
No,

43
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,292
I mean...

44
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,454
I won't marry your dad.

45
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,100
Thank you.

46
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:27,546
LOVE SET
