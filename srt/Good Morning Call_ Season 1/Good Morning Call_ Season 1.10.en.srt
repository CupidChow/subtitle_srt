00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:15,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sorry.</font>

2
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:17,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you.</font>

3
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This is good.</font>

4
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:32,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Here.</font>

5
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My mom gave these to me.</font>

6
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:49,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's good.</font>

7
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She only bought this
because she wants to eat them.</font>

8
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:01,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This is so sweet.</font>

9
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:06,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You don't like sweets much,
do you, Daichi?</font>

10
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But you gave me chocolates every year.</font>

11
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:15,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's because if I give you ones
that I want to eat</font>

12
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">then I can eat them with you.</font>

13
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I think <i>you ate most of them.</i></font>

14
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:34,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi.</font>

15
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Today, I--</font>

16
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't worry. It's OK.</font>

17
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:44,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If you don't want to talk about it,
then don't.</font>

18
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can stay here tonight if you want to.</font>

19
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We've got school tomorrow...</font>

20
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">so I'll go back home today.</font>

21
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yuri... how are you feeling?</font>

22
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I heard you have a fever.</font>

23
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I thought
you were coming home late tonight.</font>

24
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Listen to me, Yuri.</font>

25
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm feeling tired.</font>

26
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-So we can have dinner out, OK?
-I want to tell you everything.</font>

27
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'd like to have soba or something.</font>

28
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Come on, listen.
-I don't want to hear it!</font>

29
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:28,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hear him out.</font>

30
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:32,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can still divorce him
after you listen to what he has to say.</font>

31
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You stay out of this!</font>

32
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:42,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry for not telling you
about my transfer.</font>

33
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:46,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I meant to tell you all about it.</font>

34
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Yeah, right.
-I did. I'm serious.</font>

35
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How can you talk to
your ex-girlfriend...</font>

36
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but not talk to me about it?</font>

37
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:03,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Her husband was transferred
to live alone overseas,</font>

38
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">so I wanted to ask her some questions
about it.</font>

39
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So?
What if her husband is overseas?</font>

40
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:15,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She really has nothing to do with this.
I just...</font>

41
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:19,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I just couldn't tell you, that's all.</font>

42
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:20,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Couldn't tell me what?</font>

43
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I want you to come with me.</font>

44
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I know what you'd say.</font>

45
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,538
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You'd say
that you'd throw away your life here</font>

46
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:33,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and come with me.</font>

47
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Then why--
-But if you did...</font>

48
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:42,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If you did...
you wouldn't be losing just your job...</font>

49
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but our home in Japan too.</font>

50
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:54,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't tell me...</font>

51
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">you were worried about me
having a place to stay.</font>

52
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I never asked you to do that.</font>

53
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Or maybe</font>

54
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">you were going to let me have Yuri?</font>

55
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:16,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I knew it. You and your ex-girlfriend
are getting on good.</font>

56
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It only makes sense.</font>

57
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,638
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Instead of this crazy drunk,</font>

58
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:22,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">you'd rather be with a woman
that understands your work--</font>

59
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-What did you do--
-I told you before.</font>

60
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I will never let you have Yuri.</font>

61
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then take her with you!</font>

62
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:50,338
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If we go there,</font>

63
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:53,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">we won't be able to come back
for three years.</font>

64
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You'll have to quit your current job,</font>

65
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:01,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and we won't be able to see Hisashi.</font>

66
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You already know, right?</font>

67
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:17,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know what I'll say.</font>

68
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, sorry.</font>

69
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Uehara.</font>

70
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:50,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry about the trouble I caused you.</font>

71
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:58,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Quit being a pussyfoot!</font>

72
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's payback.</font>

73
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao.</font>

74
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:16,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao.</font>

75
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:25,805

76
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry. I'm going home. Yuri.</font>

77
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:14,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So that means
Yuri stayed overnight here?</font>

78
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:23,438
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">UNKNOWN</font>

79
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:30,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hello. This is Yoshikawa Nao.</font>

80
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:52,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Nao.
-Uhm, Uehara...</font>

81
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:57,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I just found out there's an opening
at the girls' dorm from next month.</font>

82
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:00,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What?</font>

83
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:03,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They said I could move right in
at that time.</font>

84
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I didn't expect an opening this soon.</font>

85
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:17,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, I see.</font>

86
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:23,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's good news.</font>

87
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:34,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a little sooner than I planned,
but it's OK, right?</font>

88
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:46,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao,</font>

89
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-about today--
-Sorry...</font>

90
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,905

91
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:59,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm going to sleep for a while.</font>

94
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:34,072

97
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:39,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So, how was your Valentine's date?</font>

98
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did you tell him?</font>

99
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:44,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No.</font>

100
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:48,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What? You mean you didn't tell him?</font>

101
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:51,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, it was kind of...</font>

102
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Jeez! You look so depressed.</font>

103
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Mitsuishi, you go on ahead.
-Huh? Why?</font>

104
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:00,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Dang, you're cold.
-Just go!</font>

105
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:03,772

106
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:06,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

107
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:11,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao?</font>

108

109
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know,
there may have been a good reason for it.</font>

110
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Like what?</font>

111
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:25,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Uh, well... Look,</font>

112
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">when a friend is truly in trouble,</font>

113
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">you'd at least want to listen
to their problem, right?</font>

114
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:33,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-But she's not a friend.
-Huh?</font>

115
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yuri's not just a friend.</font>

116
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:40,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I mean, he's always liked her.</font>

117

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But, even though he used to like her,
she's still his sister-in-law.</font>

118
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:51,138
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You wouldn't like it
if he were the type of guy</font>

119

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">who was cold and ignored
that kind of thing.</font>

120

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yeah.</font>

121
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But...</font>

122
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:07,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">what I hate more is seeing Uehara
become all frantic over Yuri.</font>

123
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I hate myself for hating Yuri too.</font>

124

126
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao, why don't you stay at my place
for a while?</font>

127
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:39,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll listen to you

129
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:47,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

130

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What did you want to talk to me about?</font>

131
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's your problem?</font>

132
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:12,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I thought you said you told Nao
how you felt about her.</font>

133
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then how come she was crying?</font>

134
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:29,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She was soaking wet,
carefully carrying that cake.</font>

135
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's wrong with you?</font>

136
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you even thinking about
Nao's feelings?</font>

137
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If you make a promise, then keep it!</font>

138
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:48,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You got her hopes up
and played with her feelings.</font>

139
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She just giggles and brushes off
whatever you say.</font>

140
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Have you ever thought about her feelings?</font>

141
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:06,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No. No way. I won't let you.</font>

142
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I won't let you have Nao.</font>

143
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She's the only one who can decide that.</font>

144
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm not going to back off either.</font>

145
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:26,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a little late to be saying that.</font>

146
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:31,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I knew letting you two live together
was a mistake.</font>

147
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:46,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There you are.
Where's Nao's special lunch?</font>

148
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:52,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Jeez!</font>

149
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:55,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I thought I'd be able to get
some leftovers.</font>

150
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:59,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So, how was the cake?</font>

151
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You got one from Nao, didn't you?</font>

152
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I totally thought I'd get something
at least from Nao this year, but,</font>

153
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:10,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">"This year, I'm only giving one
to the person I'm serious about."</font>

154
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's what she told me.</font>

155
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:18,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How was it?
Was Nao's true-love cake good?</font>

156
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Oh!
-You can have it.</font>

157
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What? Really?</font>

158
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You haven't had any of it.</font>

159
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao.</font>

160
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:44,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi.</font>

161
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Do you have a little time right now?</font>

162
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:54,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry, but I've got work today.</font>

163
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:56,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I see.</font>

164
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you all right?</font>

165
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:03,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yeah.</font>

166
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:08,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao's going to be staying at my place
from today.</font>

167
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:10,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

168
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you, Daichi.</font>

169
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:16,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No problem.</font>

170
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Bye.
-See you.</font>

171
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

172
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">EVENING STAR RAMEN, CLOSED</font>

173
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What are all these?</font>

174
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:36,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They're presents from customers.</font>

175
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:41,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-They're all for Issei?
-Yep.</font>

176
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can't believe you're popular, Issei.</font>

177
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:46,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hey, I'm called the "Handsome Manager,"
you know!</font>

178
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Really?
-He takes after me.</font>

179
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,438
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">By the way,
did you meet up with him yesterday?</font>

180
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Huh?
-Uh... Uehara, is that his name?</font>

181
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-He came here yesterday.
-Really?</font>

182
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He was looking for you.</font>

183
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry, but we're still closed.</font>

184
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Aren't you Nao's...</font>

185
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:08,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Has she been here?</font>

186
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:10,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, today's her day off.</font>

187
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yeah, I thought so.</font>

188
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:14,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thanks.</font>

189
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:18,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He was kind of frantic.</font>

190
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did you give him the cake?</font>

191
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No.</font>

192
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I see.</font>

193
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:33,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Things don't always go so smoothly.</font>

194
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll be staying over
at another place for a while.</font>

195
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:08,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>So, you mean,</i></font>

196
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:12,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Uehara went around looking for you?</font>

197
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:16,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yeah, I think so.</font>

198
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:23,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't you think you should see him
and talk about it?</font>

199
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:28,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can't keep avoiding him like this,
you know.</font>

200
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:36,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's an opening in the girls' dorm.</font>

201
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Really?</font>

202
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They said I can move in next month.</font>

203
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:48,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you'd move out of your place?</font>

204
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:52,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I still haven't given an answer
to the dorm.</font>

205
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:56,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But we already decided
that we'd only live together</font>

206
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">until there was an opening at the dorm.</font>

207
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:04,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Besides, I can't keep it secret
from my parents forever.</font>

208
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:06,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is that what you want?</font>

209
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know anymore.</font>

210
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He told me that he likes me,
but I don't know if it's true.</font>

211
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:26,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What?</font>

212
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It makes me think sometimes...</font>

213
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:37,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">what if it hadn't been me
that was living with him?</font>

214
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:45,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It was just chance
that I was close to Uehara.</font>

215
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But if I hadn't been,</font>

216
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:52,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">then he probably wouldn't have
even noticed me.</font>

217
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then...</font>

218
00:21:57,705 --> 00:22:01,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I never would have had to go through
falling in love with Uehara.</font>

219
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:05,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao.</font>

220
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:12,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And I never would have had to feel
this way.</font>

221
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:19,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's no point in talking like that now.</font>

222
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You've met, and that's that.</font>

223
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:24,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Listen to me.</font>

224
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:27,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Chance and fate and all that stuff,</font>

225
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">that's what love is made of. All of it.</font>

226
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:36,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You could go on forever
talking about "what-ifs."</font>

227
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:42,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Has it really been nothing but heartbreak?</font>

228
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>You were happy, Nao.</i></font>

229
00:22:57,805 --> 00:23:00,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You were happy
when you fell in love with Uehara.</font>

230
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't want you to regret
falling in love with Uehara.</font>

231
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

232
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:26,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So, you need to tell Uehara</font>

233
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">everything you're thinking about.</font>

234
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:32,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Even if you do move into the dorm,</font>

235
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:36,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">it's no good trying to run away from this.</font>

236
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:43,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

237
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:54,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh! Answer it! Answer it!
It might be Uehara.</font>

238
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">DAICHI</font>

239
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:04,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, it's Daichi.</font>

240
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hello?</font>

241
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry about calling you so late.</font>

242
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:38,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's OK.</font>

243
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:40,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's wrong?</font>

244
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:47,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know, Nao, I still like you.</font>

245
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:53,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If it were me, I'd never make you cry.</font>

246
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:56,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'd never play with your feelings either.</font>

247
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:02,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know what I thought about
when I saw you crying the other day?</font>

248
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I thought, "I want to be with Nao."</font>

249
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:15,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, that's not it.</font>

250
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:21,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I want you to be with me.</font>

251
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:29,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">When I enter university,
I'm thinking about living on my own.</font>

252
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:33,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Really?
You're not going to commute from home?</font>

253
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I changed my mind.</font>

254
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:44,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao, will you live with me?</font>

255
00:25:49,772 --> 00:25:51,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I want to live with you, Nao.</font>

256
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:56,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi...</font>

257
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao.</font>

258
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:18,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I want you to think it over
carefully again.</font>

259
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:25,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi...</font>

260
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I...</font>

261
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I think I might be moving out of there.</font>

262
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:37,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Really?</font>

263
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's an opening at the girls' dorm.</font>

264
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They said I can move in next month.</font>

265
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Then--
-But...</font>

266
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:53,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sorry.</font>

267
00:26:58,405 --> 00:26:59,672

268
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:05,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I still like Uehara.</font>

269
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,238
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">With all my crying,</font>

270
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:15,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I caused you a lot of trouble, Daichi.</font>

271
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:21,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But, I really still do like Uehara.</font>

272
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:29,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No matter who he actually likes.</font>

273
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:35,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So...</font>

274
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:39,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sorry.</font>

275
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:49,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My second confession of love...</font>

276
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and I get rejected again.</font>

277
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:56,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi.</font>

278
00:27:57,872 --> 00:27:59,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, I knew it would happen, though.</font>

279
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:06,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's so great about that guy, anyway?</font>

280
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's so selfish.</font>

281
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:15,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can't tell what he's thinking at all.</font>

282
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:21,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And he's mean,</font>

283
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">childish,</font>

284
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">eats too much</font>

285
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and plays with my feelings all the time.</font>

286
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:37,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But, still...</font>

287
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:43,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">he's kind in a lot of ways too.</font>

288
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:49,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

289
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:09,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thanks always. From Nao.</font>

290
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:25,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This is delicious.</font>

291
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,738
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Ow, ow, ow!</i></font>

292
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:01,538
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's this all about?</font>

293
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:04,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm supposed to be having lunch
with Marina.</font>

294
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:05,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's nobody in there!</font>

295
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:08,138
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I feel like I could die
if I don't tell someone this.</font>

296
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:09,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What?</font>

297
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:11,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I felt like digging a hole
and shouting into it.</font>

298
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:12,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So what is it?</font>

299
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi confessed his love to Nao.</font>

300
00:30:18,972 --> 00:30:21,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>-That's old news.
-You know about it?</i></font>

301
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:25,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Even though it happened yesterday?
-Huh? Yesterday?</font>

302
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:31,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi said to Nao,
"When I graduate, let's live together."</font>

303
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:33,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Seriously? And what did Nao say?</font>

304
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:37,138
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Hey.
-Before I could hear that,</font>

305
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:39,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I ran away.</font>

306
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why did you do that?
Her answer's the important part!</font>

307
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:46,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If Nao chose Daichi,
what would happen to Uehara?</font>

308
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Uehara would be getting what he deserves.</font>

309
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:50,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He broke his Valentine's promise with Nao.</font>

310
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Really?
-As for me,</font>

311
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:55,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I think Daichi is a better match for Nao.</font>

312
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:59,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But Uehara also likes Nao.</font>

313
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm not so sure about that.</font>

314
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:04,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It doesn't seem like
he treats her very well.</font>

315
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:13,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I like what I just heard.</font>

316
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's go, shall we?</font>

317
00:31:18,405 --> 00:31:21,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm getting a really awful feeling
about this.</font>

318
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:23,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>-What? Seriously?
-Yes, seriously.</i></font>

319
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:27,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>I heard Daichi asked Nao to live with him.</i></font>

320
00:31:27,772 --> 00:31:30,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So it's true about Daichi
and Nao having that kind of relationship.</font>

321
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,638
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But don't you feel awful for Uehara?</font>

322
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:34,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yeah, the poor thing.</font>

323
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I feel so bad for him.</font>

324
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:43,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Oh, dear.
-Uehara was right there.</font>

325
00:31:56,538 --> 00:32:00,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao. Can we talk with you for a moment?</font>

326
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:02,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

327
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:06,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is it true that you're going to live
with Daichi when he graduates?</font>

328
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:09,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How do you know about that?</font>

329
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:12,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What are you talking about?</font>

330
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:14,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We're not asking you, Marina--</font>

331
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:16,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You don't have to answer, Nao.
This is so stupid.</font>

332
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:18,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It must be true if you can't deny it.</font>

333
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:19,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's quite a shock.</font>

334
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So it was true that you have
that kind of relationship with Daichi.</font>

335
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:26,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That means Uehara was just your toy,
right?</font>

336
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:29,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That poor Uehara.</font>

337
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I would never--</font>

338
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:35,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-You're just sore that we found out.
-That's right. Tell it to us straight!</font>

339
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:37,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You're going to choose Daichi, right?</font>

340
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:43,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's nothing to say. I just...</font>

341
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:46,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>It was all my idea.</i></font>

342
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:50,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi.</font>

343
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We made it.</font>

344
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,438
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Mitsuishi, you went and got him?</font>

345
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:58,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I was worried it would get out of hand.</font>

346
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My love for her is all one-sided.</font>

347
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:06,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't go bullying Nao for it.</font>

348
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:07,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But...</font>

349
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:09,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao!</font>

350
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Uehara!
-Uehara!</font>

351
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:22,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come with me.</font>

352
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What do you want with her?</font>

353
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:31,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-It's none of your business.
-It's none of yours either.</font>

354
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:41,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You broke up, didn't--</font>

355
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:43,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We didn't break up!</font>

356
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:50,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's go.</font>

357
00:34:02,672 --> 00:34:05,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That was on purpose, wasn't it, Daichi?</font>

358
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:06,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Huh?</font>

359
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You got Uehara worked up on purpose,
right?</font>

360
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:11,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm not as unselfish as that.</font>

361
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:17,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know,
they really are a troublesome pair.</font>

362
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You want to go out with us?</font>

363
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:24,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We'll go to karaoke or bowling,
or anything you like.</font>

364
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:26,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Abe will pay for everything.
-Huh?</font>

365
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,238
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's the one who eavesdropped
on you confessing your love.</font>

366
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:29,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Hey!
-No, I wasn't.</font>

367
00:34:29,572 --> 00:34:31,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I just happened to be there.</font>

368
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:34,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK, let's go bowling after karaoke!</font>

369
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We'll do it all!</font>

370
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:38,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Are you serious?
-Abe's paying.</font>

371
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:45,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where did you stay last night?</font>

372
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:50,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At Marina's place.</font>

373
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:57,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You mean, you were worried about me?</font>

374
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No.</font>

375
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I didn't think so.</font>

376
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:12,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's got nothing to do with you.</font>

377
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sorry.</font>

378
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:22,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sorry... I didn't keep my promise.</font>

379
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's nothing between Yuri and me.</font>

380
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:37,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She was drunk</font>

381
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:40,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and was staggering down the street
in a terrible state.</font>

382
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I couldn't help but look after her.</font>

383
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:48,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She came here only
because she thought you were here.</font>

384
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:53,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She and my brother had a good talk
and settled things.</font>

385
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She was drunk.</font>

386
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Totally smashed... and threw up.</font>

387
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:09,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did she kiss you?</font>

388
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is that what you're worried about?</font>

389
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:19,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-I can't help it.
-Don't be stupid.</font>

390
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:25,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's no answer!</font>

391
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:27,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Where are you going?
-I'm thirsty.</font>

392
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's this?</font>

393
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:43,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Isn't that what you said?</font>

394
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:45,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You'd only want this in return.</font>

395
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:48,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">MILK PUDDING</font>

396
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:04,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The cake... was delicious.</font>

397
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:11,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But it was crushed.</font>

398
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:14,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It still tastes the same.</font>

399
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:21,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This isn't the kind of thing
you're supposed to give as a present.</font>

400
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:25,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There are...</font>

401
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">way too many.</font>

402
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:41,939

403
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't go anywhere.</font>

404
00:37:58,505 --> 00:38:00,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Uehara.</font>

405
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:08,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I like you.</font>

406
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:18,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I really like--</font>

407
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I know.</font>

408
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:38,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

409
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>To all graduates and parents,</i></font>

410
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:54,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>I want to express my
heartfelt congratulations.</i></font>

411
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:55,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!</font>

412
00:38:55,772 --> 00:38:56,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Take a picture with me!</font>

413
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:00,538
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Congratulations, Daichi!
-Congratulations, Daichi!</font>

414
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:01,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Picture, please.
-Thank you.</font>

415
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:03,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Thank you.
-Here, here.</font>

416
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:05,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi!</font>

417
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Sorry. I have to go.</font>

418
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:10,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Daichi...
-Sorry.</font>

419
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:13,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Excuse me.</font>

420
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Congratulations on graduating.</font>

421
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you.</font>

422
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:26,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao.</font>

423
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:34,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">When you've got tests,
start studying ahead of time.</font>

424
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

425
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:42,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And eat properly.</font>

426
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:45,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

427
00:39:46,205 --> 00:39:48,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And don't be late.</font>

428
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:53,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I know.</font>

429
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:02,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And don't cry anymore.</font>

430
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know, I won't be around if you do.</font>

431
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:23,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

432
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:31,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi.</font>

433
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:40,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you.</font>

434
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:45,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Didn't I just tell you not to cry?</font>

435
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:46,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can't help it.</font>

436
00:40:48,505 --> 00:40:49,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Look who's here.</font>

437
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nao!</font>

438
00:40:51,505 --> 00:40:54,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Daichi, thanks for all you've done.</font>

439
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:55,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you.</font>

440
00:40:55,805 --> 00:40:59,138
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-You can leave Nao in my hands.
-What are you talking about?</font>

441
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:02,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, you can leave Marina in my hands.</font>

442
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:05,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-You got it.
-Oh, Mitsuishi!</font>

443
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:08,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can't believe Daichi's graduating.</font>

444
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:20,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It was eight years.</font>

445
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My one-sided love for Nao was that long.</font>

446
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:32,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What are you laughing about?</font>

447
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:36,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No... it's nothing.</font>

448
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:44,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I totally thought
forgetting was impossible.</font>

449
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:51,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But I was able to forget
after meeting her.</font>

450
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:54,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I was able to forget about someone I loved
for eight years.</font>

451
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:58,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you encouraging me?</font>

452
00:42:00,505 --> 00:42:01,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry if I sounded righteous.</font>

453
00:42:02,672 --> 00:42:03,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That kind of pissed me off.</font>

454
00:42:23,405 --> 00:42:24,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Uehara.</font>

455
00:42:24,572 --> 00:42:25,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's go.</font>

456
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:31,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">OK.</font>

457
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:39,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Dang, I'm hungry.</font>

458
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hey!</font>

459
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:47,039
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Huh? Ow!</font>

460
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:48,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What do you want to eat today?</font>

461
00:42:48,772 --> 00:42:51,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hey, quit walking away!</font>

462
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:55,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Come to think of it...
-Huh?</font>

463
00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:58,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-What happened with that?
-With what?</font>

464
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:00,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The girls' dorm.</font>

465
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:04,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, about that,</font>

466
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:09,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I missed my chance to take it,
so they got another person.</font>

467
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Really?
-But that's all right.</font>

468
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:17,839
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You told me
that you didn't want me to go anywhere.</font>

469
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:19,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What?</font>

470
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:22,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-You said that, right?
-No, I didn't.</font>

471
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:23,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, you did!</font>

472
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:26,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">"Stay right here."</font>

473
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:29,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-You're getting carried away.
-Are you glad?</font>

474
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:33,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you?</font>

475
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:35,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Not really.</font>

476
00:43:37,472 --> 00:43:39,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can't be honest, can you?</font>

477
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:53,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>What do you want for dinner tonight?</i></font>

478
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,238
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-Meat.
-What? Meat again?</font>

479
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:58,939
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">-OK, braised beef and potato is fine.
-But that's meat too!</font>

480
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:01,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Shabu-shabu would be nice.</font>

481
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And that's meat as well.</font>

482
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:11,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Dad! Mom!</font>

483
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.</font>
