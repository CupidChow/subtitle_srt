1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:20,979
{\an8}- There's a child. Seven years old.
{\an8}- Help! Let go of me!

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,107
{\an8}Stay back. Do not approach.

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,818
{\an8}- Poor child!
{\an8}- You can't go any further.

4
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,489
{\an8}- Move your ass!
{\an8}- Do you know her?

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,284
{\an8}Vivian, do your standup here.

6
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,495
Vivian.

7
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,080
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Miss!

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,666
- We can talk about this!
- Let's go over the fence.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,625
- Ma'am!
- Mama!

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,502
Ma'am, just tell us what you want.

11
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,255
- Hey, Vivian! Wait! Hey!
- Come down here.

12
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,466
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey! Come here.

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,759
Sit down, okay?

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,302
This is perfect.

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,221
- Let's have a frontal shot here.
- Ma!

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,973
- Stop it!
- A frontal shot.

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,100
Haven't you learned anything at all?

18
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,435
Come on.

19
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,519
Stop it, let's go.

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,521
- Help!
- She has a gun.

21
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,689
I don't want to do this.

22
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,649
Okay, I'll do it alone.

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,068
That's not what I'm saying.

24
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,069
What I'm saying is,

25
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,404
I don't want to do this
because I don't know you anymore.

26
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,531
This is wrong.

27
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,200
What's happened to you?

28
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,203
- Let go of her! Hey!
- Let Nenuca go!

29
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,288
Hey! Vivian!

30
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,791
Please help them.

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,592
This place looks familiar.

32
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,390
Here. I'll annotate here.

33
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,351
{\an8}But I could also do a voiceover.

34
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,936
{\an8}In three, two, one.

35
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,854
{\an8}We're here now in Caloocan City,

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,774
{\an8}where a hostage-taking drama
is taking place.

37
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,693
{\an8}A woman has gone mad.

38
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,671
This is my house.

39
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,934
Ouch! Ouch! You're bad!

40
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,103
Nenuca?

41
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,659
Nenuca.

42
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,246
My child.

43
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,873
My child.

44
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,833
Mom?

45
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,508
Mom!

46
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,304
Wait a moment, miss.

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,806
Don't hurt my mom.

48
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,016
Your mother?

49
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,398
It's a better headline
if your mother is dead.

50
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,195
Whatever demon you are, please go away!

51
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,698
I love you so much, my child.

52
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,257

Vivian!

63
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,582
Get up. You will be late.

64
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,209
Vivian!

65
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:12,919
Vivian!

Dried fish.

67
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,141
Wait.

68
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:34,732
- My customers are early today.
- Of course, Mommy Monica.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,405
Lucy, get Papu's candle
and put the flowers next to it.

70
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,739
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,950
I still miss your father.

72
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,118
Do you remember?

73
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,162
Today is the 13th anniversary
of his death.

74
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,833
I'm sure that he's proud of you.

75
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
Mom,

76
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,296
you're tiring yourself.

77
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,215
You can't get tired

78
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,634
because your tumor might grow back.

79
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,177
My child,

80
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,722
I like what I'm doing.

81
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,641
Like you. You're happy doing
what you're doing, right?

82
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,934
All right, my child.

83
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,771
Go and get those scoops
so that you'll be more famous.

84
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:21,154
Did you know? My daughter
is with the other network.

85
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,032
She'll become even more famous now.

86
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:28,369
Just like her father. He was also
a reporter before he died.

87
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,003
- Ma'am Vivian!
- Ma'am Vivian!

88
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,005
Good morn-- Oh!

89
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,799
Oh God, you're beautiful even this early.

90
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,551
Jasper, I've been waiting here.

91
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,805
- Ma'am, it was all Louise's fault.
- Ma'am. Ma'am, I'm sorry.

92
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,225
We went back home because I forgot to
feed Kim, my chihuahua.

93
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,560
- Let's go. We're late.
- Let's go.

94
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,562
- That's what I'm saying.
- Let's go! Yeah, yeah.

95
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,355
- Good morning, Vivian.
- Good morning.

96
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,648
Ma'am, after you.

97
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,359
Next time, don't be late.
Follow the call time.

98
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,986
- Yes, ma'am. Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

99
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,780
- I'm really sorry.
- It was Louise, not me.

100
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,239
Stop, we already picked her up.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,577

104
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,259
Ma'am, we'll just set it up.

105
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,893

106
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,187
<i>Wow! Thank you, Papu.</i>

107
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,897
Let's open it.

108
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,816
There.

109
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,529
- Wow!
- Thank you, Papu.

110
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,239
Here I am, your cameraman again!

111
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,573
- I'll be singing now.
- Come here!

112
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,033
<i>What time is it already?</i>

113
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,660

116
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,833
Hi, Ma'am Viv.

117
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,127
Coffee.

118
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,465
You're reminiscing there.

119
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,842
Nostalgia gaming.

120
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,261
Excuse me.

121
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,304
I was just doing a fit check.

122
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,143
By the way, Ma'am Viv,

123
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,812
I just want you to know

124
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,106
that I'm upset with you.

125
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,484
Because you didn't
follow me back on Instagram.

126
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,444
So, it's like…

127
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,196
I'm not worthy, you know?

128
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,825
You're more suited for OnlyFans.

129
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,662
You're a subscriber, huh?

130
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,416
So…

131
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,378
I'm sorry if I'm disrupting
your "meet cute" moment,

132
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,713
but, ma'am, it's time to go.

133
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,798
The set is ready. It's time for your take.

134
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,841
Let's go, ma'am.

135
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,342
Let's go.

136
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,229
Lights! And make sure to hide
my eyebags, please.

137
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,023
Makeup.

138
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,692
THE SHRINE OF JESUS THE NAZARENE
IS THE HOME OF EVERY FILIPINO

139
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:08,779
We're here, Rex, at Quiapo,
where we are monitoring the prices…

140
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,324
- I'm all set. I'm ready to record now.
- Game!

141
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,492
…of basic commodities.

142
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,826
Ma'am.

143
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,621
Share my blessing.

144
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,999
- Is she part of the show?
- Miss, we're shooting.

145
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,960
If you're not an onion,
you shouldn't be here.

146
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,172
Ma'am, I'm sharing my blessing.

147
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,258
I mean that I'm sharing my blessing
for you, madam.

148
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,179
Is this what you're going to share?
What blessing do I get from this?

149
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,806
You're always having nightmares, right?

150
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,939
What do you know about my dreams?

151
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,275
You buried the truth.

152
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,237
It wants to break out.

153
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,531
But don't worry.

154
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,450
From now on,
you'll be able to see them all.

155
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,910
Even when you're awake.

156
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,828
The barrier will fall.

157
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,622
They can finally be with you.

158
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,874
Wait. Who are they?

159
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,045
- Look over there.
- Where?

160
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,602
Miss?

161
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,998
Ma'am Viv.

162
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,418
You look stunned.

163
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,255
What do you mean?

164
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,840
I was just internalizing.

165
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,049
Let's take this.

166
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,050
Are you guys ready?

167
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,010
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go.

168
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,262
Ma'am! Miss Sylvia is asking us
to pack up now.

169
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,139
She's asking us to return
to the newsroom ASAP.

170
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,307
Why?

171
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,891
I think I know why.

172
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,437
Your first exposé was
the Cement Massacre, right?

173
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,772
The one with Ernesto Malugay.

174
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,567
What about Ernesto Malugay?

175
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,946
The security guard that you put in jail

176
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,240
is now free.

177
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,161
- We'll pack up now?
- Yes.

178
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,120
Thank you.

179
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,220
Good morning, ma'am.

180
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,016
The person I put in jail was set free.

181
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,270
And I'm going to interview him?

182
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,939
Who's the asshole who thought of that?

183
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,399
Me!

184
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,781
That's why I think it's a brilliant idea.

185
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,241
I know, right?

186
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,327
It's like you'll have a rematch.

187
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,204
The netizens will love that.

188
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,538
They'll bash you.

189
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,456
Yeah.

190
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,541
But in a good way.

191
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,545
Among all our broadcasters,

192
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,508
you're the only one
who got a video of the massacre.

193
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,594
And that convicted Ernesto Malugay

194
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,222
and three of the four killers.

195
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,807
You were phenomenal, sweetheart.

196
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,976
If I'm that good, why was he set free?

197
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,565
- That's mine.
- Louise!

198
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,192
This is your cue to give me the file.

199
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,527
Yes, ma'am. Sorry.

200
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,278
- Ernesto Malugay…
- Ernesto Malugay.

201
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,365
…overturned an appeal due to lack of
evidence that he was an accessory.

202
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,076
That's the hard copy for the boomers.

203
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,579
You also have a soft copy
in the Viber group chat.

204
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,707
So it's actually fine.

205
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,584
He's been in jail for three years.

206
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,505
The guy just let the killers
into the massacre site.

207
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,173
Boss.

208
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,552
To be honest, I'm not comfortable.

209
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,304
Brilliance is never comfortable,
sweetheart.

210
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,349
Do you think your father became famous
because he was always comfortable?

211
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,311
You're really going to use my dead father?

212
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,229
So?

213
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,440
I also use the living.

214
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,693
And TBH,

215
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:20,197
this blockbuster Cement Massacre of yours,

216
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,782
it was good, yes.

217
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,452
But after that,

218
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,248
all of your stories were uninteresting.

219
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,541
Kind of dull.

220
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,459
Right?

221
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,461
Some even say that

222
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,962
you're overrated.

223
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,551
But this! This story, well…

224
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,804
This will resonate so well
with the board of directors.

225
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,432
They might even make you
the lead host of <i>Untold.</i>

226
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,935
"Make your Mama proud,"
as Boy Abunda says.

227
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,396
Unless

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,733
you want to pass on this project.

229
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,402
Louise, you can cover this, right?

230
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,154
- Yes, I'll do it.
- No.

231
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,238
I'll do it.

232
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,740
That's my girl.

233
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,201
You guys okay now?

234
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,619
Did you enjoy watching this?

235
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,412
Get back to work.

236
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,122
Viv, wait. Don't leave.

237
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,040
Stay.

238
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,167
You come here. I need to talk to you.

239
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,301
What's this?

240
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,261
Why is this still here?

241
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,971
Your friend asked me to give it to you.

242
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,223
What friend?

243
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
Elaine.

244
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,225
Elaine?

245
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,727
No.

246
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,145
That's a different Elaine.

247
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,483
Boss, I'll get moving now.
I have research to do.

248
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,610
Wait. Vivian, listen to me first.

249
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,197
What I'm looking for is the old Vivian.

250
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,286
The hungry reporter who is always ready
to devour all stories.

251
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,582
Like you were back when
Benjie was your partner.

252
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,293
I need that Vivian.

253
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,087
Where is that Vivian, huh?

254
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,590
<i>Please fix the karaoke later.</i>

255
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,843
Mom and Auntie Choleng
are counting on you.

256
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,844
Is that so?

257
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,558
<i>Benj! Is it done?</i>

258
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,184
<i>Mom is ready to sing.</i>

259
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,728
Here it is.

260
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,273
Idol, hi.

261
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,774
Kitty Marie, say hi.

262
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,652
Hi. Hi, Kitty Marie.

263
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,780
- It's on. Hello?
- Here we go!

264
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,657
It's working! It's working now.

265
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,992
You take care, okay?

266
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,702
- "Total Eclipse of the Heart."
- Bye.

267
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,953
Bye, Nenuca.

268
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,204
"Que Sera, Sera"!

269
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,206
- Thank you, Benjie.
- No problem.

270
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,375
Vivian.

271
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,506
Husband material.

272
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,842
Here you go, Auntie.

273
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,386
I asked her to go to Canada with me
but she doesn't want to.

274
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,808
I'm still thinking about that.
For Mom's health.

275
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,185
Oh, my child. Don't think about me.

276
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,937
Think about yourself.

277
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,188
Your dreams.

278
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,232
Your reporting job.

279
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,525
That's what you must achieve.

280
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,112
Here's a sandwich. For you.

281
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,573
- Thank you.
- Spaghetti for you.

282
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,158
There's a fork inside.

283
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,161
- Thank you.
- I heard you used your hands last time.

284
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,914
You know what, Mom?

285
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,751
The truth is, it's days before payday,
and we're out of money.

286
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,710
Really?

287
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,297
- Oh, don't.
- Why not?

288
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,132
I smell like chopped pork!

289
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,759
- Oh, not there.
- No, it's okay.

290
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,385
You smell like tofu.

291
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,304
- And shanghai.
- You're so mean.

292
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,221
Mom.

293
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,264
Well…

294
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,351
Eat.

295
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,518
That's delicious.

296
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,314
So,

297
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,733
what if you'd become a singer?

298
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,902
Would you have been rich by now?

299
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,199
I'd have been just like Mom
and Auntie Choleng,

300
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,576
and my audience would be
the food Mom cooked.

301
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,328
I heard that.

302
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,210
You know, someday, you will shine.

303
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,630
That's what I really like about you.
You're my number one fan, right?

304
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,590
I'm the only one
who's not number one for you.

305
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,259
So you got an opening.

306
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,721
You know, I'm obsessed with you.

307
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,474
I want to watch you more than Netflix,

308
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,851
and I love you even more than coffee.

309
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,853
You're comparing me to 3-In-1 coffee?

310
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,238
Ma'am, here's your take-out.

311
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,823
Thank you.

312
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,543
Benj?

313
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,213
Benj?

314
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,216
Benjie, I know you're there.

315
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,515
I brought your favorite spaghetti.

316
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,149
Benj, can we talk?

317
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,905
Something happened to me.

318
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,453
I saw Elaine.

319
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,163
Benjie.

320
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,959
Benj, please.
I don't have any other friends.

321
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,840
Benj?

322
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,718
Who was that?

323
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,265
Benj.

324
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,642
Benj.

325
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,981
I'll just leave the spaghetti here, okay?

326
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,838
<i>Ma'am Viv,</i>

327
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,049
Devin and Spike are here now.

328
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,009
Louise will be late.

329
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,135
She'll be late?

330
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,138
That kid is really irritating.

331
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,015
Here's what we'll do.

332
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,809
When Louise arrives,

333
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:26,438
tell her that when I give my cue,
she'll bring this woman to me.

334
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,481
Okay, ma'am.

335
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,775
Mommy?

336
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,152
Here it is.

337
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,696
You'll finally see the men

338
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,616
who just stood there and watched
your daughter being raped.

339
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,246
- Hey! Isn't it?
- No.

340
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,372
Let's go.

341
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,498
There they are.

342
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,459
I can't do this.

343
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,379
No, Mommy. You can do this.

344
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,090
They are shameless!

345
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,176
They're the ones who violated
your daughter.

346
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,848
They crushed your baby.

347
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,266
Let it out.

348
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,268
Unleash your rage!

349
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,312
Yes.

350
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,606
- You can do it, okay?
- Yes. Yes.

351
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,486
Make her memorize it.

352
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,863
Exact words?

353
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,656
Yes. Exact words.

354
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,241
Okay, ma'am.

355
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,036
We're now here at Midnight Bar

356
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,290
where a rape allegedly took place.

357
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,626
Okay.

358
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,089
When you saw the rape,

359
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,966
you didn't stop it?

360
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,050
No, no.

361
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,845
Because I don't want to disturb
other people's fun.

362
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,263
- Right, Spike?
- Yes.

363
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,057
Rape is done

364
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,142
just for fun?

365
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,686
I don't know and I don't care.

366
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,606
We thought that we'd be able to post it.

367
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,357
That's why we didn't help.

368
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,818
We even got suspended from TikTok.

369
00:19:56,153 --> 00:20:00,157
So you didn't feel guilty

370
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,869
that you saw a crime

371
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,330
but did nothing about it?

372
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,042
You.

373
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,921
Didn't you feel guilty
when you didn't do anything?

374
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,640
You just watched us too, right?

375
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,643
You just allowed it to happen.

376
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,062
How are we different?

377
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,347
Vivian, how are we different?

378
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,515
Tell me!

379
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,392
What?

380
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,521
Ma'am.

381
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,481
What's going on?

382
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,691
Ma'am Vivs!

383
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,902
Ma'am Vivian, shall we start now?

384
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,113
Goodness. Mommy!

385
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,614
Mommy, come here!

386
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,409

387
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,577

388
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,038
They're the ones
who violated your daughter!

389
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,916
They crushed your baby!

390
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,960
Unleash your rage!

391
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,211

394
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,133

395

402
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,071
The editor was able to fix it.

403
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,867
I'm really sorry.

404
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,869
Don't be bitter.

405
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,330
Be better.

406
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,041
That's such a nice quote, right?

407
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,667
I got it from FB.

408
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,883
This is the first time
I've seen you buffering like that.

409
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,801
You're even worse than Joe Biden.

410
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,263
Well…

411
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,019
the bracelet

413
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,566
Quiapo.

414
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,903
Go on, you can do it.

415
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,947
Nothing.

416
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,990
Nothing.

417
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,075
Ma'am.

418
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,327

419
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,290
Well, I'm excited for your live tomorrow.

420
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,334

421
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,606

431

We got a tip that
the people from Cateland Development

432
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:51,740
have invited some residents for
an alleged secret negotiation.

433

But according to LHALO,

434
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:58,830
they are not convinced that
Cateland Development has good intentions.

435
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,124
Here.

436
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,545
These are the bodies
of the informal settlers

437
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,841
who allegedly went to negotiate
with the people of Cateland Development.

438
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,677

I hope you can make Ernesto confess.

522

But he got acquitted.
He was released by the court.

523

524
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,273

00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,824
Do you really have to ask twice?
Think you're being cute?

539
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,993
Chat me up sometimes,

540
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,329
or give a heart react to My Day posts.

541
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,372
Aren't we going to start?

542
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,665
Aren't we going to roll?

543
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,209
We are live! Stand by!

544
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,669
Rolling! Five, four, three, two!

545
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,796
Rolling!

546
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,214
Action!

547
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,675
Mr. Ernesto Malugay.

548
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,804
The person they say I helped put in jail,

549
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,515
but who is now here in front of me

550
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,016
totally free.

551
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,684
Many say that

552
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,773
a three-year imprisonment was not enough
for the crime you committed.

553
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,026
In our world,

554
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,861
there are a lot of hypocrites.

555
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,655
Yes,

556
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,866
the people I let enter the construction
site turned out to be killers,

557
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,076
and I'm sorry for that,

558
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,496
but the truth is,

559
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,082
there's someone
who gained more from it than me.

560
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,959
That person even became famous.

561
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,089
That person is more like
an accomplice of mine.

562
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,593
They say

563
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,055
you can finally see them.

564
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:49,772
Mr. Malugay, who are these people
I'm supposedly seeing?

565
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,614
Them.

566
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,951
You don't see them?

567
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,248
At the corner of your eye.

568
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,168
In the dark corners.

569
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,337
At the edge of your bed at night.

570
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,603
They say you're next.

571
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,314
I'm so happy.

572
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,984
And one of these days,

573
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,236
they will get you.

574
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,251
I can't take this anymore.

575
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,628
I need to know what's happening
to Ma'am Vivs.

576
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,380
It's like she's cursed.

577
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,757
So Ernesto was killed on air?

578
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,262
That's why you need to help me
find out what Ma'am Viv did.

579
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,307
So you think what happened
is all Vivian's fault?

580
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,643
Ma'am Vivian's my idol,

581
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,603
but she's really suspicious.

582
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,108
I mean, she froze when Ernesto asked her
if she knew anything about the massacre.

583
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,116
<i>But according to LHALO,</i>

584
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,912
<i>they are not convinced that</i>
<i>Cateland Development has good intentions.</i>

585
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,292
<i>We are currently seeing</i>

586
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,461
<i>the informal settlers</i>
<i>who were invited here.</i>

587
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,381
There you go.

588
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,674
Now you've seen everything.

589
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,758
Wait.

590
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,428
It's obvious the video was spliced.

591
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,888
- What's this portion?
<i>- We are currently seeing…</i>

592
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,474
<i>…the informal settlers</i>
<i>who were invited here.</i>

593
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,185
Is this why you chose
to work at the archives?

594
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,646
To change that portion?

595
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,357
I am here

596
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,568
to stay away from Vivian.

597
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,695
Why are you here?

598
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,032
To replace Ma'am Vivian.

599
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,367
Benjie, let's play it again.

600
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,018
Sir Benjie, what are you looking at?

601
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,688
I'll give you what you want.

602
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,899
Sir Benjie?

603
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:27,239
I don't have the footage
you're looking for

604
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,952
because when Vivian passed it to me,
it was already deleted.

605
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,829
Here. Kitty Marie.

606
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,048
Kitty Marie?

607
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,926
- The cat.
- Cat?

608
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,136
She's the reason…

609
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,848
why Elaine died.

610
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,363
<i>Sator arepo tenet opera rotas.</i>

611
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,658
<i>Sator arepo tenet opera rotas.</i>

612
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,387
Mom.

613
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,638
<i>Hello? My child?</i>

614
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,474
<i>Why did you call me? Is there a problem?</i>

615
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,894
Can't I just call my mom when I miss her?

616
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,106
<i>That's all?</i>

617
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,983
<i>You're right,</i>

618
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:49,864
<i>the star reporter Vivian Vera</i>
<i>doesn't mess up.</i>

619
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,990
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

620
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,783
<i>Someone's ordering in the canteen.</i>

621
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,043
Vivian.

622
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,213
I'm Dr. Annapurna Guatlo.

623
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,383
I am your network-approved counselor.

624
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,224
Cats are so cute, right?

625
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,936
Those are toys for my pediatric patient.

626
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,396
Do you want to try them?

627
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,818
Okay.

628
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,532
I would have advised Sylvia
not to assign you to the criminal,

629
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,700
but we're here now.

630
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,410
There's nothing we can--

631
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,037
The prediction came true, Doc.

632
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,249
Something changed in me.

633
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,085
Something opened in me.

634
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,631
I can see spirits.

635
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,426
Vivian, you witnessed a murder.

636
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,678
That's why it's not impossible
for you to be confused.

637
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,307
So you think I'm only confused?

638
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,976
What am I? Lost like Google Maps? Waze?

639
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,605
I'm telling you,

640
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,192
there was a ghost
next to the person who got shot.

641
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,195
Do you know what it told me?

642
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,821
- What?
- They're out to get me.

643
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,490
- What?
- I am next.

644
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,674
Doc?

645
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,551
Yes?

646
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,012
Are there ghosts in Canada?

647
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,305
Canada?

648
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,975
Benjie has been asking me
to go live there,

649
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,268
but I refused.

650
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,228
I guess that's why this
is happening to me.

651
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,189
Vivian, let's go back
to the Philippines, okay?

652
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,775
Can you tell me everything that happened?

653
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,236
What do I need to explain?

654
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,280
I can see spirits.

655
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,115
I saw some

656
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,117
rocks.

657
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,201
Like…

658
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,079
cement.

659
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,414
It was so ugly.

660
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,207
Doc.

661
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,376
Some rocks.

662
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,169
Some cement.

663
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,921
A monument.

664
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,593
Nothing. It just reminds me
of a nursery rhyme.

665
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,719
Please continue.

666
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,722
This was a mistake.

667
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,890
- I'll go.
- Wait!

668
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,975
It's okay.

669
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,476
Sit down, settle down.

670
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,519
Fine.

671
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,396
These ghosts?

672
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:32,359
The clinical or psychological term
for them is hallucinations.

673
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,862
Right? Hallucinations.

674
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,155
A classic symptom.

675
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,490
A classic symptom of a curse.

676
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,908
- A curse?
- That's right!

677
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,535
- I'm right.
- Curse?

678
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,413
- A curse…?
- Someone put a curse on me.

679
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:48,042
It's all because of this.
Because of this damn bracelet.

680
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,668
I'm right, aren't I?

681
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,046
Someone put a curse on me.
I was cursed, right?

682
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,507
It's not in the medical books.

683
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,092
Then put it there!

684
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,978
Sorry.

685
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,816
I'm just really stressed out, Doctor.

686
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,942
Sorry.

687
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,486
It's okay, it's okay.

688
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,031
What I am about to say is,

689
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,991
hallucinations are,

690
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,911
you know, classic symptoms of PTSD.

691
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,497
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

692
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,916
Can you recall everything that happened?

693
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,751
Can you tell me about it?

694
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,466
Everything you say

695
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,176
stays in this room.

696
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,784
Vivian, come on.

697
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,786
Tell me everything from the beginning.

698
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,746
Okay. Okay.

699
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,126
<i>Mom! What happened?</i>

700
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,504
She was singing an Aegis song
when she suddenly collapsed.

701
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,798
They gave her gin with pomelo juice.

702
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,799
Oh, please.

703
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,343
My child, it's nothing.

704
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:26,890
Dr. Pancho is really good.
He often visits our canteen, you know.

705
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,309
First of all, I'm not a doctor yet.

706
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,689
Ms. Viv, you should see a real doctor.

707
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,650
Why? What's the problem?

708
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,486
Your mom talked to me last week.

709
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,365
There's a tumor
on the left side of her breast.

710
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,368
Hey.

711
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,497
Your company has a medical program
for the family of its employees.

712
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,415
I assume.

713
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,501
We don't have one. I can only get a loan.

714
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,880
Goodness! What are you waiting for?

715
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,382
Do it now.

716
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,303
But I'm not a regular employee yet.

717
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,221
I'm okay.

718
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,639
Don't worry.

719
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,934
Great ideas, Elaine.

720
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:11,935
Super!

721
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,854
We're doing great online. Did you see?

722
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,063
Did you see on YT?

723
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,399
But here. Here's the thing.

724
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,318
The network called

725
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,821
and they want to pick it up
to be a documentary.

726
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,114
So are we in?

727
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,491
Me and Vivian?

728
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:32,539
The thing about that is
there is only one slot available.

729
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,625
And then, Vivian, you know,

730
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:40,672
she works hard,
but she doesn't have ideas, right?

731
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:45,761
Vivian?

732
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,137
Ma'am?

733
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,972
- Is that my coffee?
- Yes, ma'am.

734
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,682
- And my papers?
- Yes, ma'am.

735
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,393
Okay. Just leave it at the desk, please.

736
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,770
Unless you have something to say?

737
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,271
- Nothing, ma'am.
- All right.

738
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,481
- Thank you.
- Okay.

739
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,482
<i>Elaine!</i>

740
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,568
Hey. About…

741
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,238
About earlier…

742
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,783
Vivian, it was nothing.

743
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,409
Nothing's decided.

744
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,329
You should pitch ideas.

745
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,581
I can't think of anything right now.

746
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,251
My mom is sick.

747
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,045
I love her so much.

748
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,339
She's very important to me.

749
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,716
And another thing.

750
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,134
She's so proud of me,

751
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,804
and now she's going to find out that
I'm going to be fired from my job.

752
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,681
Please help me.

753
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,015
Why don't you recycle?

754
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,184
Recycle your ideas.

755
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,105
I have something to pitch.

756
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,816
Our maid is telling me something.

757
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,610
The food, <i>bopis, sisig</i> and <i>menudo</i>…

758
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,778
Check this out.

759
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,114
They use

760
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,032
cat meat.

761
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,535
Is that true?

762
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,412
I don't know!

763
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,205
I'm going to investigate it.

764
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,584
I want to record a video on
how they cook a cat.

765
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,668
So, boom!

766
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,877
Scoop!

767
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,921
That's how you do it.

768
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,221
Do you only sell <i>mami</i>?

769
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,723
Don't you have <i>sisig</i>?

770
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,017
How much is the <i>pares</i>?

771
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,894
If only that were cat meat,
it would be my scoop.

772
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,648
- Mom.
- It's already twelve.

773
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,358
Time to sleep.

774
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,944
You go first.
I still have something to do.

775
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,738
Okay.

776
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,822
Hurry up.

777
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,092
Kitty Marie.

778
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,554
Come here.

779
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,642
Good girl. Shh.

780
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,394
This won't hurt.

781
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,897
Just go to sleep.

782
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,170
My child.

783
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,339
What are you recording here?

784
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,382
A cooking show?

785
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,927
Wait.

786
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,932
Yummy!

787
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,479
Wake up.

788
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,272
Go upstairs.

789
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,316
There are lots of mosquitoes here.
Let's go.

790
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:17,180
<i>We have eaten lots of delicious food</i>

791
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,684
<i>but we didn't know that</i>
<i>they were made of cat meat.</i>

792
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,686
Wow.

793
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,313
So you just used your phone for this,

794
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,816
and then you were able to record it
in close-up?

795
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,194
I was hiding behind the pot.

796
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,697
That's very, very risky.

797
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,158
But brave.

798
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,456
Make this a full-length feature.

799
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:53,049
But, ma'am, we can't
show the name of the restaurant…

800
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,594
Of course,
so that they can't file a lawsuit.

801
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,137
That's right. Good job.

802
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,180
You're hired.

803
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,307
You got the slot.

804
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,442
Hold on to me.

805
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,195
I'll do it.

806
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,532
- Madam!
- You're back! How are you?

807
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,910
It's like you didn't have a surgery.

808
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,955
You look like you just had
cosmetic surgery.

809
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,501
Don't make me laugh.

810
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,336
- My stitches might pop open.
- Yeah.

811
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,837
I'm sorry.

812
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,047
You know what?

813
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,758
- It's benign.
- Thank God.

814
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,092
Thanks, God. Oh my…

815
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,221
Mom, let's go upstairs. You need to rest.

816
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,097
- I'll come with you.
- Okay.

817
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,432
So how are you?

818
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,601
- I can handle it.
- Which hospital did you come from?

819
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,269
It's in San Mariano.

820
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,939
What did you do to Kitty Marie?

821
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,275
Kitty Marie? Nothing.

822
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,070
Maybe your cat is somewhere around here.

823
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:58,114
No. I know you hurt Kitty Marie!

824
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,533
You're bad.

825
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,368
How do you know that?

826
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,702
I have a feeling.

827
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,204
Well, you're wrong.

828
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,875
Miss Vivian didn't do anything wrong
to your Kitty Marie.

829
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,418
Maybe she ran away,

830
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,547
or maybe she found a better owner
than you.

831
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,549
So go away now.

832
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,550
Kitty Marie!

833
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,010
Kitty!

834
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,095
<i>Vivian.</i>

835
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,057
Come on.

836
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,270
Tell me everything from the beginning.

837
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,399
I chopped off the pussy's head.

838
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,402
Vivian, pussies don't have heads.

839
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,077
Tell me everything.

840
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,287
From the beginning.

841
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,414
I just told you.

842
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,458
The cat meat was cooked as <i>sisig</i>.

843
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,627
The cat meat was cooked as <i>bopis</i>.

844
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,671
Doc, you're not listening.

845
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,591
Vivian, I said,
let's start from the beginning.

846
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,050
Come on, tell me.

847
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,218
What do you mean?

848
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,928
I've been talking here.

849
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,388
I've told you so many things.

850
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,848
As in, right now.

851
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:05,765
Right now.

852
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,850
As in.

853
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,103
You're not telling me anything.

854
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,156
Are you okay?

855
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,288
I have to go.

856
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:33,043
Vivian, I will file this session
in my HR report, you know that.

857
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,103
Louise?

858
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,856
Louise?

859
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,527
Louise?

860
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,572
Louise?

861
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,378
That's Miss Vivian.

862
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,548
Miss Vivian, are you okay?

863
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,890
Do I look like I'm not okay?

864
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,185
Okay.

865
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,884
This has to end!

866
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:18,606
Hello, Sylvia.

867
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,776
I will interview Amanda, okay?

868
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,071
<i>Amanda needs to tell me why they're back.</i>

869
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,577
Come here, Vivian. I won't hurt you.

870
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,044
Boo!

871
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,177
You get frightened easily.

872
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,180
Boo!

873
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,639
Stop it, please.

874
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,142
Fine. I'll stop.

875
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:58,813
Where is it?

876
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,445
Mama!

877
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,448
Wait!

878
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,495
The police said you can only look.

879
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,705
You can't touch it.

880
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,665
You're on suicide alert, Amanda.

881
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,420
Mama,

882
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,547
I'm sorry.

883
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,216
She doesn't want me to touch it.

884
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,596
Why did you kill Ernesto?

885
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,432
I'm only obeying my mother.

886
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,477
She's Teresa Teotico.

887
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:48,404
<i>Sator arepo tenet opera rotas.</i>

888
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:55,203
<i>Sator arepo tenet opera rotas.</i>

889
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,831
You don't know
who you're fighting against.

890
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,584
My mother is not an ordinary person.

891
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,589
Every year, she climbs Mount Banahaw
on Good Friday.

892
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,634
She prays in the middle of the night.

893
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,974
Please.

894
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:16,975
Amanda, please.

895
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,226
Make them go away.

896
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,395
What does she want from me?

897
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,021
What does she want to happen?

898
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:27,944
<i>Tempus ad judicandum omni re.</i>

899
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,156
It's time to judge everything
that has been done.

900
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,744
<i>Teneborsa sicut nox.</i>

901
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,624
The day is as dark as night.

902
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,671
<i>Nil inultum remanebit.</i>

903
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,424
No one will be left unpunished.

904
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,385
They'll punish us all.

905
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,387
But you didn't do anything wrong.

906
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,638
You're the victim's daughter.

907
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,474
Why were you dragged into this?

908
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,521
I was the one who sent them there.

909
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,024
To the meeting?

910
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,862
Fine.

911
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,324
I was blinded by the money given to me.

912
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,703
But I didn't know.

913
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,372
I didn't know

914
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,958
that my mother was there.

915
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,668
That she'd go with them.

916
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,130
My mother was one of those who died there.

917
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,887
I killed my mother.

918
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,225
Amanda.

919
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,772
Don't you dare call my name!

920
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,065
It's your fault!

921
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,360
It wasn't my fault! I didn't kill them!

922
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,277
Ouch!

923
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,280
If a person sees something wrong
and does nothing,

924
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,074
that person is as evil as them!

925
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,869
So many people watch,
laughing over wrongdoings.

926
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,455
Wait for judgment day.

927
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,082
Let me go!

928
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,875
Officer!

929
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,043
Officer!

930
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,003
Go ahead.

931
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,714
Shout.

932
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:16,135
I'll tell everyone
about those people you killed.

933
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,012
Like Elaine.

934
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,391
Let me go.

935
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,142
Let me go!

936
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,357
Mama, I'm sorry.

937
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,068
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

938
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,737
I didn't know you'd gone there.

939
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,197
Okay, Mama.

940
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,660
I think you'll forgive me this time.

941
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,527
Ms. Vivian, what happened?

942
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,553
Ma'am Vivian,

943
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,847
why are you calling at this time?

944
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,101
Yes? What's up?

945
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,479
<i>Jasper, let's have dinner.</i>

946
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,440
<i>And I'll sleep at your place.</i>

947
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,777
Uh, okay.

948
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,987
<i>Ah, okay.</i>

949
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,155
<i>Game!</i>

950
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,538
What? You visited her?

951
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:11,751
I saved you from Amanda,
but you went to see her?

952
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,881
I feel like I'm going to lose it.

953
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,428
Because everyone involved
in the Cement Massacre

954
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,513
is dying.

955
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,474
Ernesto Malugay.

956
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:28,768
Amanda.

957
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,396
Amanda?

958
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,313
When?

959
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,398
Earlier today.

960
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,735
I saw her in the precinct.

961
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,279
Really?

962
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,201
I called those in National Jail.

963
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:48,371
Three of the four killers were dead.

964
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,789
They died long ago.

965
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,251
They died in riots, gang wars…

966
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,086
All of them are dead.

967
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:59,382
But Sir Benjie,

968
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,342
the one in the archives, your ex.

969
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,885
See?

970
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,387
He's still alive.

971
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,347
He doesn't want to talk to me.

972
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,230
What a coincidence.

973
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,816
He lives there.

974
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,488
Where's our order?

975
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,865
Where's their order?

976
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,492
Actually…

977
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,828
- It's not a coincidence.
- Excuse me.

978
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,330
Thank you.

979
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,833
Spaghetti?

980
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,127
That's Benjie's favorite.

981
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,379
I know you miss Benjie,

982
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,757
and you want to talk to him.

983
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,300
That's why

984
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,593
I brought you here.

985
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:44,927
He's coming, for sure.

986
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,512
Let's eat.

987
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,726
Hey! Look over there!

988
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,061
There's a naked guy right there!

989
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:54,979
Watch out.

990
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,773
Over there.

991
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,483
- Where?
- Over there.

992
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,034
Benj?

993
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,579
Vivian, how are you?

994
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,129
Benj?

995
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,965
Don't get offended.

996
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,595
I think you forgot to put on some clothes.

997
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,016
Tell my family,

998
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,393
at my funeral,

999
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,063
I'll wear a barong.

1000
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,320
There are no meatballs.

1001
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,217
Jasper?

1002
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,983
Jasper?

1003
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,747
Ma'am Vivian!

1004
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,958
Ma'am Vivian! Hey!

1005
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,585
It's me, Jasper.

1006
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,461
What happened? Why are you screaming?

1007
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,964
Ma'am Vivian, are you okay?

1008
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,551
Come, sit down here.

1009
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:53,139
Why are you saying that Benji is dead?
He came to work yesterday.

1010
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,224
I think you had a nightmare, Ma'am Vivian.

1011
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,517
Here. Water.

1012
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,063
My God, Ma'am Vivian, I thought
something bad had happened to you.

1013
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,191
Wait. Someone texted.

1014
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,869
Ma'am Vivian, it's…

1015
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,747
it's Benjie.

1016
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,624
What about him?

1017
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,170
They said that he bled to death.

1018
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,089
He stabbed his eye with a fork.

1019
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,728
Is she Benjie's former girlfriend?
Vivian Vera?

1020
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:42,980
Yeah, that's her.

1021
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,275
Isn't that her?
The one who captured the suicide?

1022
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,907
Do you know what that is?

1023
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,995
Benjie's savings.

1024
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,708
For your tickets to Canada.

1025
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,801
He might look for his vape.

1026
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,930
He can't use that now.

1027
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,431
Make him use it.

1028
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,310
It's the least you can do for him.

1029
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,920
It's done.

1030
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,880
That's good.

1031
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,458
- I don't believe her.
- Ma'am Vivian, wake up.

1032
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,168
- She's just making a scene.
- What happened?

1033
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,085
Water, please.

1034
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,172
You two are gossiping.
Will you stop that?

1035
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,176
Ma'am Viv,
we need to go back to the office now.

1036
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,596
Why are they calling you to
the office at this hour?

1037
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,316
Let's go.

1038
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:06,373
You can't hold off on talking to me
until Benjie's buried.

1039
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,336
Why? You guys broke up months ago, right?

1040
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:13,047
Or are you just putting on a sad face?

1041
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,632
Louise?

1042
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,846
I was the last person Benjie talked to
before he did the

1043
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,682
first fork suicide in human history.

1044
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:30,481
And Benjie also gave me
your unedited pussy cat food exposé.

1045
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:39,782
See?

1046
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,992
You're in the video.

1047
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:43,869
You're seen.

1048
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,747
Benjie edited it out to keep you safe.

1049
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:50,543
Because you're the one who
actually killed the cat.

1050
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,920
You're a kitty cat killer.

1051
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:58,801
If this is going to get worse,
I need a lawyer.

1052
01:08:58,884 --> 01:08:59,885
You wish.

1053
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,596
If we're going to court,
it's not about this.

1054
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,099
Louise?

1055
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,852
Benjie told me that

1056
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,563
you and Elaine had an argument

1057
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,774
because of your plagiarism
of her cat concept.

1058
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,193
Plagiarism? What?

1059
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:20,239
You're a good newscaster,
but you're not a good actress.

1060
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,116
Louise?

1061
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:27,246
Benjie also told me that you were
responsible for Elaine's death.

1062
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,958
How would Benjie know that?

1063
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,043
Just answer the question.

1064
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,963
Did you and Elaine get into a fight?

1065
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,132
Were you there when it happened?

1066
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,010
Are you to blame for her accident?

1067
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,262
No.

1068
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,140
No.

1069
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,517
I won't say anything.

1070
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,935
Nothing.

1071
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,862
<i>Vivian?</i>

1072
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,699
Where's Vivian?

1073
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,534
Miss Elaine.

1074
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:11,498
Did you see Viv's cat exposé?
There were a lot of views.

1075
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,335
Where's your bestie, the thief?

1076
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,587
What thief?

1077
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,591
Maybe she went down to buy Pods.

1078
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,594
So there.

1079
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,721
Now she has money to spend.

1080
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,059
Oh, wait. That's Vivian's.

1081
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:31,894
I know.

1082
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,354
I'll take this to her.

1083
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,566
Vivian, I know what you did.
You're a thief.

1084
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,902
You stole my story.

1085
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:46,158
Elaine, you know about my mother, right?

1086
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,159
I'm sorry.

1087
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,535
You bitch!

1088
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,663
You even faked the story.

1089
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,457
What now?

1090
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:56,919
Are you going to tell the truth to Sylvia,
or am I going to expose you?

1091
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,463
Elaine, don't do that.

1092
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:02,800
Come to think of it,

1093
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,179
it's better if I'll just expose you
in a news report.

1094
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,223
"Newbie reporter is a faker."

1095
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:12,685
So that your beloved mother can watch it.

1096
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,312
Don't.

1097
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,397
Here.

1098
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,732
The raw footage is here.

1099
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,025
It's on your cell phone.

1100
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,612
- Elaine, please.
- Let me go.

1101
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,406
- How dare you?
- Give me that.

1102
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,992
- Let it go!
- Give me my cell phone!

1103
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,831
- Hey!
- Oh my God!

1104
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,007
Poor girl.

1105
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,817
Vivian? Vivian, are you still with us?

1106
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:02,735
Vivian!

1107
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,530
I'm not going to tell you anything.

1108
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:07,823
Nothing.

1109
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,162
You just told us the story now.

1110
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:19,084
Elaine followed you on the street
while holding the cell phone

1111
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:23,172
with the raw footage
of the butchered cat on it.

1112
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:24,631
And you guys fought over it?

1113
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,216
You fought over it.

1114
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,135
That's why she was hit by the bus.

1115
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:32,264
I said all that?

1116
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,934
You just told us the story.
What's with your memory gap?

1117
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:41,398
Or wait.

1118
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,984
The more important question is,

1119
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,696
who else did you kill?

1120
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,781
Wait.

1121
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,659
You are accusing me of murder

1122
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,788
based on your, what, imagination?

1123
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,749
Vivian, of course,
we still have to investigate.

1124
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,003
But I think you need to go on vacation.

1125
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,004
No.

1126
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,132
I'm not going on vacation, boss.

1127
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,884
I need to solve this.

1128
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,512
Well, then, you're suspended.

1129
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:14,765
Louise, you take over her slot for now.

1130
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,768
My child…

1131
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,075
<i>This is Vivian Vera reporting.</i>

1132
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,328
<i>Oh God, stop playing.</i>

1133
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,998
<i>- I'm still going to sing, Papu.</i>
<i>- Hey, that's different.</i>

1134
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,252
I always talk to your dad
when I have a problem.

1135
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,255
When I got sick, I talked to him.

1136
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,841
I asked him to help us.

1137
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:52,594
All of a sudden, you had loan money.

1138
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,055
But you spent everything

1139
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,014
on me.

1140
01:13:58,767 --> 01:13:59,726
Mom,

1141
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:04,148
you know that I'd do anything
for you, right?

1142
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,618
In your opinion,

1143
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,833
what would Papu say…

1144
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:32,050
if as a result of my efforts,

1145
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:38,974
I've drifted away from what is right?

1146
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:43,353
I've also thought about it.

1147
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,983
The reporters were saying here that…

1148
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:53,572
you're the most ruthless boss.

1149
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,285
They say that you're fearless.

1150
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,413
They said that sometimes…

1151
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,626
you just make up stories.

1152
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:07,920
But you know what?

1153
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:12,591
To me, you're still the best daughter
in the whole world.

1154
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,261
This is all my fault.

1155
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,348
How is it your fault?

1156
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:24,269
I gave you the wrong idol.

1157
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,855
Mom, I don't understand.

1158
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,565
What are you trying to say?

1159
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:32,569
When you were young,

1160
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,489
I always told you that

1161
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:39,201
Gerald was a good person.

1162
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:40,994
That he was honest.

1163
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,164
That he had principles.

1164
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,923
The truth is, your father was corrupt.

1165
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,511
He was on politicians' payrolls.

1166
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:00,097
Loggers paid him.

1167
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,975
Cockfight gamblers.

1168
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:07,771
I loved a man…

1169
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,692
who was married

1170
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:13,735
and corrupt.

1171
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,283
Why are you only telling me all this now?

1172
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:23,787
You…

1173
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,707
You told me

1174
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,959
that he died in an accident.

1175
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,420
Is that true?

1176
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,674
He was just smoking.

1177
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:44,933
Someone stabbed his nape with an ice pick

1178
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,436
and it went through his eye.

1179
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,188
He fell to the ground.

1180
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:53,567
They don't know

1181
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,320
who paid to have him killed.

1182
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,239
That's what they say.

1183
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,576
People who live by the sword…

1184
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,164
…die by the sword.

1185
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:17,382
I told you, this is the answer.

1186
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,603
Ma'am Vivian.

1187
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:33,273
- Here.
- Why are you here?

1188
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,567
What?

1189
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,736
I've been talking to you for a while now.

1190
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:40,989
What's wrong with you?

1191
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,078
Jasper,

1192
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,039
you're a good person.

1193
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,375
I don't want you to get hurt.

1194
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,294
I'm next.

1195
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,423
I'm going to die.

1196
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:11,061
Are you crazy now?

1197
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:13,230
You're just a bit drunk
and now you surrender?

1198
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:14,189
Really?

1199
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,691
You must fight.

1200
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,236
That's not the Ma'am Vivian I know.

1201
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,409
That's not the Ma'am Vivian I love.

1202
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,707
You came over just to pour coffee on me?

1203
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,462
A refill, just in case.

1204
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:40,549
You're crazy too.

1205
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:45,429
Ma'am Vivian, I'm so eager
to defend you to the bosses,

1206
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,097
but I need proof!

1207
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,183
You know what? Wait.

1208
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,811
Just a little more and we'll have proof.

1209
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,521
Check it out.

1210
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:57,190
This woman is the one
who cursed you, right?

1211
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,613
We won't find her.

1212
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,450
No.

1213
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,368
I found her.

1214
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:13,623
I used a facial recognition app
and connected it to the news database.

1215
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:15,876
Gen Z.

1216
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:17,878
Boomer.

1217
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:21,798
Anyway, her name is Diana Santillan.

1218
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:25,302
She's the mother of one of the victims
of the Cement Massacre.

1219
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,304
I found her address.

1220
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:34,561
<i>They say she always</i>
<i>visits her child at the cemetery.</i>

1221
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,535
I think that's her.

1222
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,254
I'm Vivian Vera.

1223
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:03,423
I'm a journalist.

1224
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,758
I know who you are.

1225
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,930
It's attached to you.

1226
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:14,684
I pray over it while they wear it.

1227
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:21,983
Are they the ones…

1228
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,068
Yes.

1229
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:27,155
They are the people who got stuck together

1230
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,783
because you let them
be buried in the cement.

1231
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:36,748
Mrs. Santillan,

1232
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:42,170
please tell me how to remove the curse.

1233
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,965
And why would I do that?

1234
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:48,510
You need to pay.

1235
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,428
Repent.

1236
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,972
Suffer.

1237
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,516
You picked the wrong enemy.

1238
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:58,812
Do you think that because we're poor,
we'll just be silent?

1239
01:20:58,895 --> 01:21:01,356
We have the power to fight back.

1240
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,609
Our Supreme leader, Mother Teresa,

1241
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,572
will enter your mind
and destroy you there!

1242
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,782

Let me go.

Let me go.

1249
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:27,507
Let me go.

1250
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,842
Let you go?

1251
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:31,469
I'm not holding you.

1252
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:44,232
Tell me how to stop this.
How do I stop this?

1253
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,650
Tell me.

1254
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:48,028
Mrs. Santillan! Please!

1255
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,989
You're getting on my nerves!

1256
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,139
- Help!
- Ma'am Viv!

1257
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,767
Help me! Jasper!

1258
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,518
- Come here. Come on.
- Jasper!

1259
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,312
Hold on.

1260
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,147
There. Hold on.

1261
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:27,943
Hey, are you okay?

1262
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,320
Didn't you see?

1263
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,530
There were corpses trying to hurt me.

1264
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,990
What corpses are you talking about?

1265
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,951
You just fell down the hole
and got all muddy.

1266
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,327
You're overreacting.

1267
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,244
Let's go.

1268
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,663
Why don't you believe me?

1269
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:43,375
There were people stuck together.
They were trying to take me.

1270
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,502
Okay. Fine.

1271
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:47,462
Ma'am Vivian.

1272
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,423
We will not leave

1273
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,009
until you tell me what really happened

1274
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:55,804
at the massacre.

1275
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,017
<i>Some orders are not ready yet.</i>

1276
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,894
They're still at the market.

1277
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,479
I'm sorry, guys.

1278
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:09,109
What's your order?

1279
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,735
For me, <i>Shanghai</i>.

1280
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:12,529
Okay.

1281
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:14,197
<i>- Tapa.</i>
<i>- Tapa.</i>

1282
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,116
<i>- Sisig.</i>
<i>- Sisig.</i>

1283
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,534
Okay.

1284
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,833
Are you sure you can open the gate?

1285
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,795
I'll ask Joshua and Evelyn to go there.
Something might go wrong.

1286
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,341
Here's my ID.

1287
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:39,055
{\an8}Ernesto Malugay.
Cateland Development Security Staff.

1288
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:42,517
Tomorrow,

1289
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:45,395
open the gate at 9:00 p.m.

1290
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:46,896
My people will come.

1291
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,108
And you, Amanda,

1292
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,485
bring your friends.

1293
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,321
And?

1294
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:57,073
Excuse me, who ordered the <i>Tapa</i>?

1295
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,536
<i>Shanghai?</i>

1296
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,293
And

1297
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,462
you don't need to know anything else.

1298
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:11,838
Here's your money.

1299
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,382
This is your down payment, Ernesto.

1300
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,467
Here.

1301
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:19,846
By the way, what's your number?

1302
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:29,105
099-123-129-453.

1303
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:43,870
Thank you.

1304
01:24:58,384 --> 01:24:59,511
Ernesto Malugay.

1305
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:02,889
We're here in front of a motel

1306
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:07,310
where Congresswoman Zaragoza
was caught up in a scandal.

1307
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:09,604
Genuine, or a deepfake?

1308
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:12,398
{\an8}That's what we'll find out on <i>Untold.</i>

1309
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,067
{\an8}And cut.

1310
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,444
Are you good with that, Vivs?
Or should we do a take two?

1311
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,946
Yes, I'm good with it.

1312
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:18,947
That's a first.

1313
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,699
Was it good?

1314
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:22,700
- The lines?
- Yes, sir.

1315
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:26,204
You know what we're going to do, right?

1316
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,289
<i>You don't need to remind me.</i>

1317
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,834
<i>Kill them. What else?</i>

1318
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,009
<i>We're going to the mixer, right?</i>

1319
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:53,731
Vivs.

1320
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,233
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

1321
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:01,990
<i>The number you have reached</i>
<i>is not in service at this time,</i>

1322
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:03,867
<i>and there is no known number.</i>

1323
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:10,874
{\an8}<i>- Genuine, or a deepfake video?</i>
- Vivian! Congrats!

1324
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:14,127
{\an8}<i>- That's what we'll find out on </i>Untold.
- You're so good, Viv! Congrats!

1325
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:24,345
Hey, I hope you're happy for me.

1326
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,347
Where did you get the video?

1327
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,433
The scandal video insert.

1328
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,227
Benj, you're acting like
it's your first day at work.

1329
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,312
When it comes to our job,

1330
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:35,148
when you enter some places,
you won't be able to get out.

1331
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:38,401
And if you dance with a demon,

1332
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:42,405
the dance won't stop until it says so.

1333
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,407
The dance will not stop.

1334
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:49,704
I'm just doing all of these things
to reveal the truth.

1335
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:52,290
Just admit it, Vivs.

1336
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:57,086
Underneath your good intentions are--

1337
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,296
What?

1338
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,089
Your ambition.

1339
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:02,550
You just want to be famous.

1340
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,177
You're doing everything you can for that.

1341
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,973
About that burner phone…
who did you call earlier?

1342
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:13,228
What are you getting into now?

1343
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,939
Hey, Vivs, I'm talking to you.

1344
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,483
I'm going to cover an exposé.

1345
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,861
But I'm not going to include you,
because like you said,

1346
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:23,321
it's dangerous.

1347
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,365
Vivs.

1348
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,664
Did you park your motorcycle
far from here?

1349
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,124
Viv, shouldn't we call the police?

1350
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,501
How can I get a scoop then?

1351
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,543
What?

1352
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,463
I mean, yes, I called them.

1353
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:42,298
They're coming any minute now.

1354
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:43,424
Let's hide over here.

1355
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:49,889
The camera.

1356
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,892
Come on. Let's go!

1357
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,019
Okay.

1358
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,689
- Take this shot.
- Okay.

1359
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,440
Three, two, go.

1360
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:03,319
We're here right now at
Cateland Development's construction site,

1361
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:08,741
where they have invited
some of the residents

1362
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,369
for an alleged

1363
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,079
{\an8}secret negotiation.

1364
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:17,041
Benj, Benj, take two.

1365
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,835
Kill them there.

1366
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:20,712
- Benjie!
- What?!

1367
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:21,713
Take two!

1368
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:23,339
Wait a minute.

1369
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,882
I'm getting nervous.

1370
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,759
Are the police coming?

1371
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:28,303
Maybe.

1372
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:30,555
"Maybe"? Did you call them or not?

1373
01:28:32,348 --> 01:28:33,266
Fine. I'll call them.

1374
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:36,519
Damn it, Vivs.
Do you really want a scoop that bad?

1375
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:37,937
They're coming.

1376
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,397
What?

1377
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,190
I don't have any signal.
Give me your phone.

1378
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:42,358
Please have mercy.

1379
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:43,860
I don't have any signal either.

1380
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:45,695
Let's go now. Let's call the police.

1381
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:46,863
Move!

1382
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:49,490
- Go there.
- What are you going to do to us?

1383
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,784
- We can't go.
- What?

1384
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,495
Didn't you hear?
They're going to kill the people.

1385
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,581
You said we still had an hour.

1386
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,958
I don't know,
maybe they decided to kill them early.

1387
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,376
Hurry. Turn the camera on.

1388
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:03,838
Is this more important than
calling the police?

1389
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,590
Focus the camera.

1390
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:06,799
Go ahead.

1391
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:08,217
You're going to kill us?

1392
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,427
{\an8}Let's see now.

1393
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:12,096
{\an8}There's no way you can complain now.

1394
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,266
{\an8}- Please, don't!
- Have mercy!

1395
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:17,977
Sir, have mercy!

1396
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:22,565
{\an8}You said that if we came,
you would listen to us.

1397
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,360
{\an8}It was Amanda who told us!

1398
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,403
{\an8}Your daughter told us, Teresa!

1399
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,781
{\an8}Your daughter's behind this!

1400
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:32,658
{\an8}She doesn't know you're here, right?

1401
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:35,745
{\an8}Vivs, I can't do this.

1402
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,248
Vivs, no, I can't take this anymore.

1403
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:42,710
We're not doing anything bad here.
We're just reporting here.

1404
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,629
They're killing people.

1405
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,714
The police won't get here in time.

1406
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,758
You didn't call them, so let's go.

1407
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:49,967
Bro!

1408
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,594
Did you hear something?

1409
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:53,221
No.

1410
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:55,264
I thought we were all good here.

1411
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:56,808
Yes, but maybe

1412
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:59,268
someone heard about our meeting at the…

1413
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,604
At the canteen!

1414
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,277
Do you know the killers?

1415
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,988
I don't know anything about that.

1416
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,031
Please have mercy!

1417
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,160
- Go! Hurry!
- Let's go.

1418
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:20,414
Since when did you know about this?

1419
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:22,708
You have no conscience!

1420
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,460
You even dragged me here!

1421
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:25,711
What's happened to you?

1422
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,922
What about your conscience?

1423
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:31,092
And for what? Why did you do this?

1424
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:54,740
Here.

1425
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:59,120
{\an8}These are the bodies
of the informal settlers

1426
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:03,583
{\an8}who allegedly went to negotiate
with the people of Cateland Development.

1427
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:06,210
{\an8}They are now buried in the cement.

1428
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:10,548
{\an8}Vivian Vera here,
reporting for <i>Untold.</i>

1429
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:19,849
If I'd only put other people's lives
ahead of my ambition,

1430
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,644
they would still be alive.

1431
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,355
Benj would have been alive.

1432
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,776
I wouldn't be cursed.

1433
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:34,530
I'm not sure if

1434
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:37,325
what you did was a crime.

1435
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:42,079
What I know is a curse is all in the head.

1436
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,584
Maybe it's guilt.

1437
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:51,464
I have to take this.

1438
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:53,633
What?

1439
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:57,637
No one's calling you.

1440
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,430
<i>My child?</i>

1441
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:01,182
Mom.

1442
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,267
<i>You're the only one missing, Vivian.</i>

1443
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,269
<i>We've all been waiting for you.</i>

1444
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,898
What will you do to my mom?

1445
01:32:09,523 --> 01:32:12,860
<i>If you can't make it, let's swap lives.</i>

1446
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:16,405
<i>I'll bury your mom in the cement,</i>

1447
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,741
<i>just like my victims back then.</i>

1448
01:32:18,824 --> 01:32:20,117
<i>I mean,</i>

1449
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,786
<i>our victims.</i>

1450
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:25,039
Jasper! Jasper, hurry!

1451
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:26,499
- What's happened?
- It's Mom!

1452
01:32:26,582 --> 01:32:27,416
Oh! Let's go.

1453
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,835
We need to go to Cateland. Mom's there.

1454
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:42,390
- Are you sure this is the right way?
- Yes.

1455
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:43,683
We'd better check. Wait.

1456
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:46,394
- Mom?
- Wait!

1457
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:47,895
Oh God.

1458
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:48,813
Mom?

1459
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,821
Where's my mom?

1460
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,615
<i>Didn't I tell you to come alone?</i>

1461
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:03,703
I had someone with me.
What was I supposed to do?

1462
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:08,040
<i>That's up to you.</i>
<i>Just make sure you're alone.</i>

1463
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:13,963
Mom?

1464
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:16,549
Mom?

1465
01:33:18,217 --> 01:33:19,343
Vivs!

1466
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:23,723
Ma'am Vivs!

1467
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:28,686
Ma'am Viv!

1468
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:32,898
Ma'am Viv, where are you?

1469
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:41,032
Sorry.

1470
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:42,199
Vivian?

1471
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:46,037
Mom.

1472
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:48,706
Mom?

1473
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,712
Mom!

1474
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:57,590
Mom!

1475
01:34:04,638 --> 01:34:05,598
Mom!

1476
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:08,059
Where are you?

1477
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,146
Vivian, my child!

1478
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:13,689
Mom, where are you?

1479
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:15,983
My child.

1480
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,151
Mom?

1481
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:21,697
Mom, don't move.

1482
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:23,240
My child, where are you?

1483
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:26,535
Mom, I'm right here. Don't move, okay?

1484
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:29,747
Mom.

1485
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:34,085
Mom.

1486
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:54,980
Mom!

1487
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:56,107
Mom!

1488
01:34:57,608 --> 01:34:58,567
Mom!

1489
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:11,205
Mom?

1490
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:13,124
My child?

1491
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:14,959
Mom, wait!

1492
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:17,378
Mom!

1493
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:18,963
Mom?

1494
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,008
My child?

1495
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:24,885
Mom!

1496
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:26,095
Mom.

1497
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:27,638
Mom!

1498
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:35,479
Are you okay?

1499
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,898
Yes, I'm okay.

1500
01:35:38,732 --> 01:35:40,234
Why did you ask me to come here?

1501
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:41,360
Mom.

1502
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:45,948
Don't go with people you don't know.

1503
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:48,826
That guy who called you was dead.

1504
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:51,370
I didn't go with anyone else.

1505
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:53,789
I was in the market when you called me.

1506
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,749
You told me to come here.

1507
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,127
I didn't call you.

1508
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,046
You called me.

1509
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:05,134
We even FaceTimed.
You said it was an emergency.

1510
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:08,179
What's going on?
Why did you ask me to come here?

1511
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:09,388
It wasn't me.

1512
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,348
They were just pretending to be me.

1513
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,309
They're bad people.

1514
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:17,062
Let's go.

1515
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:19,148
Get away from me.

1516
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:20,774
Mom, it's me, Vivian.

1517
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:24,695
- Come on, let's go home.
- I don't want to.

1518
01:36:24,778 --> 01:36:26,280
What's wrong?

1519
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:28,866
Prove first that it's really you.

1520
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:33,704
Prove that it's really you, Vivian,
and not the bad people.

1521
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:36,665
Admit it.

1522
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:39,168
Is it really you, Vivian?

1523
01:36:39,251 --> 01:36:41,795
Or are you the bad person?

1524
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:44,465
Yes, it's me, Vivian.

1525
01:36:44,548 --> 01:36:46,842
But I'm also the bad person.

1526
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:49,386
Mom, I did a bad thing to those people.

1527
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:51,555
They died because of me.

1528
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:56,727
I told myself that I was
doing everything for your sake.

1529
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:59,688
So that you'd always be happy.

1530
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:03,025
So that you'd always be proud of me.

1531
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,570
Yes, we needed money,

1532
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:09,740
but deep down, I wanted to be famous.

1533
01:37:09,823 --> 01:37:11,242
I wanted to be successful.

1534
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:15,329
I'm as bad as those people
who killed them.

1535
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:20,501
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

1536
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:25,756
You need to pay for your sins.

1537
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:29,843
What do I have to do?

1538
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:36,767
Jump off the building.

1539
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,105
What?

1540
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:58,831
All forgiveness requires atonement.

1541
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:02,835
My child!

1542
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:06,505
Where are you, my child?

1543
01:38:08,632 --> 01:38:10,676
Why did you ask me to come here?

1544
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,796
My child?

1545
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,802
Vivian!

1546
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:54,762
Vivian!

1547
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:56,764
Ma'am Viv!

1548
01:38:57,514 --> 01:38:58,932
Ma'am Viv, hold on!

1549
01:39:02,936 --> 01:39:04,772
Jasper. Jasper!

1550
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:07,775
Please hold on tight. Please!

1551
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:09,568
Ma'am Vivian, hold on tight!

1552
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:12,696
Thank you.

1553
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,577
Vivian!

1554
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:20,996
Vivian! My child!

1555
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:22,665
My child!

1556
01:39:32,174 --> 01:39:33,634
Merry Christmas.

1557
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:36,095
Papu,

1558
01:39:36,178 --> 01:39:39,807
are you leaving already?

1559
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,809
What about my Mariah song?

1560
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:44,186
Don't you want me to sing?

1561
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:53,654
It was reported that Geraldo Vera will be
spending Christmas here in Manila

1562
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:57,324
because he loves his daughter,
Vivian Vera.

1563
01:39:59,451 --> 01:40:00,536
My child!

1564
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:02,371
My child!

1565
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:03,539
My child!

1566
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:08,752
My child!

1567
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:11,171
Ma'am Viv!

1568
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:14,007
- My child!
- I called an ambulance.

1569
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:16,009
Ma'am Viv, please, stay with us.

1570
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:17,803
Please, don't leave us.

1571
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:18,721
My child.

1572
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:23,016
That is my scoop for you this Christmas.

1573
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:27,271
Papu, am I a good reporter?

1574
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:34,653
I promise I'll be a reporter
so you won't leave us.

1575
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:39,199
I'm sorry, my child.

1576
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:45,414
My child.

1577
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,124
My child!

1578

{\an8}<i>Finally, the investigation of the tragic</i>

1579
01:41:53,106 --> 01:41:57,027

Ma'am.

- These are for Ma'am Vivian.
- Go ahead.

1588
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:18,882
Thank you, ma'am.

1589
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:24,805
Vivian?

1590
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:27,099
Didn't I tell you

1591
01:42:27,182 --> 01:42:29,935
that I don't want your picture
on the altar?

1592
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:35,858
Vivian, people will think you're dead.

1593
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:37,442
Don't put it here.

1594
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,444
- Lucy.
- Yes?

1595
01:42:39,528 --> 01:42:41,405
- Take this.
- Okay.

1596
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:46,702
You just need to rest and recover.

1597
01:42:46,785 --> 01:42:52,541
Then you'll fulfill your dream
of becoming a star reporter.

1598
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:54,668
Oh, my dear.

1599
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,296
She's my daughter.

1600
01:42:57,379 --> 01:42:59,715
She's just resting now,

1601
01:42:59,798 --> 01:43:02,968
but she'll be back on TV soon.

1602
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:05,012
Let's watch out for her.

1603
01:43:05,095 --> 01:43:06,430
Let's watch out.

1604
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:08,849
Ma'am Vivian.

1605
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:17,065
All right then.

1606
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:18,233

1607
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:20,611

1608
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,279
- Yes.
- Give it to me.

- Thanks.
- Karaoke time!

1610
01:43:24,823 --> 01:43:25,949
Yes!

1611
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:28,285
Here's your drink.

1612
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:31,455
What are we going to sing?

1613
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:32,789
