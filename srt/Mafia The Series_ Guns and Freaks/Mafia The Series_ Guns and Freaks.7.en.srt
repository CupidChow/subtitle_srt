1
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:12,760
Hey!

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,199
His uniform looks like
the people who shoot my father.

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,079
What happened!?

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,920
I was followed by an assassin

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,599
who uses Samurai sword!

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,480
There’s no need to be afraid.

7
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,119
What do you want from me?

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
I don’t think I need to introduce myself.

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,920
You should’ve known everything by now.

10
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,639
Mr. West, the Godfather of Mafia Society.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,840
So you know my title.

12
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,920
But do you know what I am capable of?

13
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,480
Why can’t people just mind their own business, nowadays?

14
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,719
You must be new to the special force, huh?

15
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,960
Take it easy next time, you know?

16
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,360
S.L.A.P. would never let you guys get away
with this, fuckers!

17
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,559
Hey. Hey. Hey.

18
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,159
Don’t get full of yourself.

19
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,199
How can a special force

20
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,199
be able to fight with the Mafia?

21
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,840
It’s too damn early for you.
Might need another thousand years.

22
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,639
Intenso!

23
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,039
You ink-ass!

24
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,800
What?

25
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,119
I was going to let him live!

26
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,159
The hell?

27
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,360
Old Man.

28
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,119
Can't you let me know sooner?

29
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,920
The hell you have to rush for?

30
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,440
How the hell am I supposed to know?

31
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,320
Dammit, what are we going to do?

32
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,559
And, old man, do me a favor.

33
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:29,360
Nobody in the world says the word ink-ass.

34
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,199
And next time, just tell me earlier.

35
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,280
Who the hell would’ve known that you’re gonna kill him, huh?

36
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,079
My knife was already at his throat, can’t you frickin’ see?

37
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,599
Then wait for my command!

38
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,559
Don’t just go and kill and kill and kill.
It’s always killing with you.

39
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,199
You hired me to kill.

40
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,880
Now we have to call the cleaner team. What a waste of money.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,679
Did you go to see her?

42
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

43
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:29,279
What did you do?

44
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,520
None of your concern.

45
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,679
Oh, that mouth of yours.

46
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Yours too.

47
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,920
What?

48
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,000
This is not real.

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Not real.

50
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,239
Beam.

51
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,960
I’m talking to Sven about love.

52
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,279
Can you not interrupt?

53
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,960
Anna.

54
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,399
Sven,

55
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,719
Mr. Non is dead.

56
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,759
Let me take a look.

57
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,160
What’s the cause of death?

58
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,120
Slashed in the throat.

59
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,399
Knife? Definitely Violet of Big Head gang.

60
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
Intenso.

61
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Why are we having a different opinion on this?

62
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,679
If it was Intenso,

63
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,440
then Tan must surely know something.

64
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,600
Pack your stuff, we’ll go smash his head.

65
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,960
Let me use the bathroom first.

66
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,560
Holy Shit!

67
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,480
Ouch!

68
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,759
Ouch!

69
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,879
Anna.

70
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,199
What do you want this time?

71
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,560
Stop lying and tell me the truth.

72
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,040
Why did Mr. West kill the special force police?

73
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,680
I know nothing.

74
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,840
Suit yourself.

75
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,760
Enough, Anna.

76
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
I really know nothing.

77
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,319
I haven’t reached Mr. West’s office.

78
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,920
But you left since morning.

79
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,479
How is it possible that you haven’t got there?

80
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,519
I went to queue up at Donuttio’s.

81
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,559
Now where are my donuts?

82
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,439
Anna…

83
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,239
Right now, the police forces are investigating

84
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:04,359
on the matter of the dead special force.

85
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:09,160
Three polices have been found dead

86
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,279
since the passing of Mr. Rachen.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,720
Mr. West.

88
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,760
You have a very wide connection.

89
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,800
Don’t you have any information regarding this matter?

90
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,399
Do we really have to take any further action
when we all know that

91
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,439
the Big Head gang and their human trafficking business
are the one behind all three cases.

92
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,720
To make things up,

93
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,439
we should send a warning letter to Big Head gang

94
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,519
before all the other gangs get crossed in the crossfire.

95
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,040
If that’s what we come up then,

96
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,080
I volunteer to take care of this.

97
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,800
Oh, Miss Gasolina is going to take action.

98
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,960
If it’s you then this matter should
end faster than expected.

99
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,760
We leave this to you then, Gasolina.

100
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
My pleasure.

101
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,439
Let’s go.

102
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,639
Then I’ll be leaving as well.

103
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,120
Old man.

104
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,639
Why do we need to keep lying to them?

105
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,120
Can’t we just kill them all?

106
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,680
Didn’t you see Gasolina’s eyes?

107
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,559
What eyes?

108
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,040
The eyes of untamed animal.

109
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,800
Tan, this is me.

110
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:58,639
I think Big Head is behind
the death of the special force police.

111
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,000
Be careful.

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Talk to you later.

113
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,800
Your mom taught you?

114
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,800
The hell you talking about?

115
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
Lying with that sound. Pretty solid.

116
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,359
Old trickster.

117
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,519
See, I told you Mr. West didn’t kill Mr. Non.

118
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:26,720
Is it Big Head again?

119
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,720
I think I need to visit Big Head.

120
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
Anna.

121
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,840
Are you really going to the enemy’s base?

122
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,800
That’s extremely dangerous.

123
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,680
Ooh, I couldn’t agree more.

124
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,800
Who should I take with me then?

125
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:52,920
I have to start working on my presentation.

126
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,519
Then Sven, you go with Anna.

127
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,239
Are you idiot? If Sven’s gone then
who’s going to guard the house?

128
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,000
Then there’s only one person left.

129
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,960
Right.

130
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,439
Me?

131
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:15,279
Sounds fun to me.

132
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,239
Shoot my face.

133
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,319
Anna.

134
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,920
Can I wait here?

135
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,680
Are you nuts? Who would want a man like you to be boyfriend?

136
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,800
Follow me!

137
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,519
Oh no, Anna.

138
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,519
Sven.

139
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,960
It’s me.

140
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,080
Sven.

141
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,519
Sorry about that.

142
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,160
I want to apologize to you regarding yesterday.

143
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,040
Why’s that?

144
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,639
If I was more concentrated then

145
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,359
It wouldn’t turn out like this.

146
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,000
You mean when you saw Batman, huh?

147
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,359
Yes.

148
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,239
No need to overthink it.

149
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,040
How can I not?

150
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,639
You’ve helped me countless of times.

151
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,399
But I’ve never done anything by myself.

152
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,639
I wasn’t talking about masturbation.

153
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:01,279
What I wanted to say is

154
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,680
thank you for everything.

155
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,040
Chill.

156
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,599
Since you are here,

157
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,279
you can be my practice partner.

158
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,760
B..b...but....

159
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,840
What a warm-hearted welcoming.

160
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,000
(Speaking in Japanese)

161
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,040
Can you speak English?

162
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,439
Do you come to to die?

163
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,399
(Speaking in Japanese)

164
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,080
(Speaking in Japanese)

165
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,840
Umami (Delicious)

166
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,639
That’s wrong.

167
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,960
Huh, really?

168
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,399
That means delicious.

169
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,199
So what business do you have coming here?

170
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,840
Venomous Snake.

171
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:22,559
It’s kind of exciting to see the owner
of the house comes and welcomes me.

172
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:26,120
Watch your tongue.

173
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,479
When a snake slithers into the house,

174
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,880
no owner would not come and kill it off.

175
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,519
You know, some snakes can really

176
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:38,000
kill all the members in the house easily.

177
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,840
No need to brag.

178
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:45,840
What do you want?

179
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,760
There’s a dead special force.

180
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,760
I’d like to ask if you know anything of it.

181
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,120
Or if anyone of you involved with the case.

182
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,880
If you’re talking about the police named Non

183
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,559
who was found dead this morning.

184
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,120
All I can really say is

185
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,880
my Big Head gang has nothing to do with it.

186
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,080
From the information we received,

187
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,599
it was Big Head that killed him.

188
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,000
Believe whatever you want,

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,639
I’ve told you everything.

190
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,000
Now, leave.

191
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:26,639
We’re not in any good term.

192
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,559
Yeah, we must be in very bad term that

193
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,359
you have to send an Assassin
from Japan to kill a college student.

194
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,040
Can you just leave now?

195
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Please give me some more time

196
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,960
to appreciate your healthy and shiny hair.

197
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:55,279
Even if you’re the most dangerous hitwoman
it doesn’t mean you can’t die, Anna.

198
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,080
Then let me ask you a simple question.

199
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,040
Can any of you here beat me?

200
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,439
But let’s not find out

201
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,359
because in the next life,

202
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
your hair might not be this healthy.

203
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,319
Tan, back!

204
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,519
Should we really let them go like this, Mr. Jay?

205
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,720
Looks like the inside of Nemesis is shaking.

206
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,760
Let them go.

207
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,760
I thought I was going to rot in hell, Anna.

208
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,239
Calm the hell down.

209
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:01,479
I need you to use your genius brain to think

210
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:05,760
if it wasn’t Big Head that kills Non then

211
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,239
who did it.

212
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,040
You really believed what they said back there?

213
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,680
From my experience,

214
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,639
they didn’t look like they were lying.

215
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:34,439
Greetings, Anna Kondra.

216
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:37,720
Hi, Miss Gasolina.

217
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,960
What are you doing here?

218
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,160
I’ve spoken to Mr. West regarding what Big Head did

219
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
to the special force police.

220
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,960
I just left their base.

221
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,920
I don’t think they have anything to do with the death of
that policeman.

222
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,000
Neither do I.

223
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,160
But still, I need to have a serious talk with Mr. Jay.

224
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,479
Any information I find, I’ll report to Mr. West.

225
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,840
Still, please be careful in there.

226
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,720
There are so many armed guards in there.

227
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,359
There’s no need to worry about the safety of the mistress

228
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,479
because Anna Kondra is not the only person

229
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:21,279
whose combat score is above human level.

230
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,720
Excuse me then.

231
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,559
That was the Mistress of Death, Anna.

232
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,639
Who cares? Let’s go.

233
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,160
Only a fool

234
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,000
would believe that Big Head killed that police.

235
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,720
The one who killed that police was West,

236
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,040
the only son of a bitch who dares to do ugly shit
and never admits them.

237
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,080
Listen to me, you prick.

238
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,239
These actions will impact the Mafia society in long term.

239
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:18,559
If we let this continue,
then my drug business will surely die.

240
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,880
Now is the time that we unite
and get rid of this Nemesis shit.

241
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,960
James.

242
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:34,399
Get me some whiskey.

243
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,519
Mother Freaker!

244
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,000
So West really was the one who killed the police.

245
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,559
Beam.

246
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,960
I think this book is interesting.

247
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,080
But it’s topic has nothing to do
with the presentation I’m having.

248
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,519
I thought you’re having a presentation about tourism.

249
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,239
Tourism in the southern part of the country,
not the central.

250
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,760
You could’ve said something earlier.

251
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,960
Are you guys watching porn together?

252
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,080
Sven is helping me working for my presentation.

253
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:24,840
Out of all the people and you asked Sven to help?

254
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,040
Hey!

255
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,319
I know how to prepare for the presentation too, Anna.

256
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,760
Let’s skip this topic for now.

257
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,760
I went to see the leader of Big Head.

258
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,399
I don’t think they have anything
to do with the death of Non.

259
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,160
What does that mean?

260
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,000
It means other Mafia gang

261
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,920
was behind the death of this policeman.

262
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,840
Other gang?

263
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,120
I say our gang.

264
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,599
Our gang?

265
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,720
I didn’t kill him!

266
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,960
You guys weren’t talking about me.

267
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,399
Intenso.

268
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,760
Yes.

269
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,199
If it’s really Intenso then we have to be much more careful.

270
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,680
Until now you still think that
Mr. West was involved with it, huh?

271
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:36,000
And until now you still think
he’s not involved with any of this?

272
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:46,720
West killed the special force police.

273
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,559
Huh?

274
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,439
What do you mean?

275
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,040
Sonya texted me this.

276
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,120
Great, I’m getting some rest upstairs.

277
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,359
Enjoy working.

278
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,279
Tan.

279
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,639
You got free time?

280
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,239
Why?

281
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,239
Help Beam on the presentation.

282
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,800
I’ll grab some coffee.

283
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Cheer up.

284
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,080
I’m leaving this to you.

285
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,420
All done.

286
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,800
(Come to have a good time in travelling in Thailand!
Presented by Beam.)

287
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,180
Wait...

288
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,699
why are his slides all black and white, Sven?

289
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,859
What’s wrong with it?

290
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:09,300
It’s simple to look

291
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:11,420
and easy to understand.

292
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:13,739
But this is nothing like what we did yesterday.

293
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,980
Sven…

294
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,140
I decided to make some modification last night.

295
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,659
But the topic is how to make tourists visiting southern part
of our country.

296
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,859
(Come to have a good time in travelling in Thailand!)
This is great, Sven.

297
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:37,539
Now the slides look like it’s about our country
after the fifth world war.

298
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,060
Don’t blame Sven on this.

299
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,739
I believe Sven did the best he really
could, according to his skill.

300
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,260
What am I supposed to do now?

301
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
The presentation starts at the morning class.

302
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:01,659
Beam. Look who’s here. Let me handle it.

303
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:11,060
The first thing to attract more tourists is to

304
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,579
provide free selfie-sticks to them

305
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,819
when they stepped out of the planes.

306
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,180
Dammit, her brain is really full of selfie-sticks.

307
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,060
This is an earbud that I built.

308
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,859
It weights around a third of normal earbud.

309
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,899
Wait. Who’d care the weight of the earbud?

310
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,619
No one gives a single shot about it.

311
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,980
Whatever, just put them on when it’s your turn to present.

312
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,340
We’ll take care of the rest.

313
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,180
Like I’m in James Bond movies.

314
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,899
Thank you (in pretentious accent).

315
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,739
A round of applause for Earthly, please.

316
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:14,020
Thank you. Thank you.

317
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:22,380
Next up is Beam. Your turn now. Please come out.

318
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,220
Yes.

319
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,459
Yes.

320
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,340
Hey! Can’t you hurry? I thought you are the best at this.

321
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,420
Stop complaining already. I’m rushing.

322
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,980
Alright, we have accessed the system now.

323
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,980
Hello, Beam. If you hear me, repeat after me.

324
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,100
Hey, bitches.

325
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:31,499
Hey, bitches.

326
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,659
Hello, guys.

327
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:36,859
Hello, guys.

328
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,579
Miss sexy will…

329
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,779
Miss sexy will…

330
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:44,579
I will

331
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,060
present to you in the topic of

332
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,819
“Ways to Attract

333
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,140
More Tourists to the

334
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,180
Southern Part of the Country.

335
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,819
Umm.. nail spas

336
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:09,659
in our country has a lower price
comparing to the neighbours.

337
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,220
If we focus on these nail spas

338
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,659
and promote them, giving discount

339
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,899
umm… we will surely attract more tourists.

340
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,260
I think we had a great start.

341
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,699
Is this really a good idea?

342
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,659
Trust me, fool. Next slide.

343
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,459
The best of Thailand.

344
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,940
Huh?

345
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,060
Hey!

346
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,060
Errr… next up is

347
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,340
the bodies of tan men

348
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,619
work like a tourist magnet.

349
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:06,940
We need a shirtless festival

350
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,739
Shirtless Festival….?

351
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:15,420
Parade

352
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,100
in the center of town.

353
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:22,619
The festival will attract a whole lot of single ladies

354
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,420
from the West part.

355
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:28,619
What a magnificent idea. Wow!

356
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,899
Tan, you slow-ass! Can’t you go faster than this, huh?

357
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,420
Give me next slide already.

358
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,140
Alright, you can do whatever you want.

359
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,100
I’ve synced your phone with the classroom’s projector.

360
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,980
That’s lovely.

361
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:14,020
And this lady should already be called

362
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,100
the most beautiful lady in the world.

363
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,140
And how can this lady help

364
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,459
to attract more tourists?

365
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,739
Umm..

366
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,420
Err….

367
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:43,899
Wait, Anna! What are you doing?

368
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,899
I just told you that your phone is
synced to the classroom’s projector.

369
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,420
Oops.

370
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:55,420
I thought the presentation is over.

371
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,340
Is this one sexy enough?

372
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,300
Give it to me!

373
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,899
No way!

374
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,300
This is my best friend!

375
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:08,659
Is this all you guys can think about?

376
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,060
More. More. I need the whole album.

377
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,100
In conclusion to everything I’ve said so far,

378
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,659
if we are able to find our uniqueness

379
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,899
and show them to the foreigners,

380
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:38,499
and let them see and let them feel our uniqueness.

381
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,579
I completely believe that they will surely

382
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:45,659
want to come and visit our country.

383
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,060
Thank you.

384
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,380
Thank you, bitches.

385
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,260
Beam.

386
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,739
What the hell were you thinking?

387
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,100
Err…

388
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,659
How the hell did you come up with that!?

389
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,659
That was the best presentation I’ve ever seen

390
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,420
in my whole life!

391
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,140
Bravo!

392
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:19,060
Superb superb.

393
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,340
Beam is so great.

394
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,699
The greatest.

395
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:30,739
How’s that possible?

396
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,300
It was the best presentation.

397
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,539
You didn’t listen to him at all.
You were playing with your phone.

398
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:42,499
My ears were listening.

399
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,659
Beam, you were so good at presenting.

400
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:02,779
You should be the one presenting our last group project.

401
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,060
I was just lucky.

402
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,739
You don’t have to be modest.

403
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,659
Our project will definitely get full mark

404
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,980
if you do the presentation.

405
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,819
Agreed.

406
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:25,539
How was it?

407
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,220
You don’t even have to ask. The teacher said

408
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,100
it was the best presentation.

409
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,699
I think she has such a weird taste.

410
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,060
What now?

411
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:40,499
Where are you going after this?

412
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,140
I think I’m going to have nails treatment.

413
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,699
I’ll let Tan take me.

414
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:46,499
And we can meet at home in the evening.

415
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:48,819
Sure.

416
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,499
But don’t you need an oxygen tank

417
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,220
staying in his van?

418
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,699
Who said I don’t?

419
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,020
Equally stinks as Sven's.

420
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,980
Wanna try?

421
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,499
If West did kill the police then

422
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:20,859
Beam must surely be in grave danger.

423
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,859
But you were hating him before.

424
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:28,779
That was before. Now my heart belongs to him.

425
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,619
You are so promiscuous.

426
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,140
Don’t you know the feeling when you’re trembling?

427
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,300
Tremble?

428
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,739
That shaken feeling

429
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,020
at the heart?

430
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,779
That’s it.

431
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:51,459
I might have experienced that

432
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:53,140
before coming here.

433
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,180
Do you think you will be able to regain your lost memories?

434
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:02,659
Even if I don’t,

435
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:04,100
It’s completely fine.

436
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,859
Because I’m already happy

437
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,859
staying here with you.

438
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,300
The first kiss is not the most important.

439
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,980
The last kiss is.

440
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,260
Why are you standing in front of the men restroom?

441
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,140
Are you a psycho!?

442
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,859
Your zipper is down!

443
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,060
You stared at it? What a psycho!

444
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,619
I’m not a psycho!

445
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,220
And I’m not here to do some dirty stuffs.

446
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,539
I’m just walking by. That’s all.

447
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:03,819
Don’t get so full of yourself.

448
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:07,539
Since you are here. I’ve got something to ask.

449
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,459
What do you want to ask a freak like me?

450
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,060
I want to know if

451
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,539
you

452
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:21,300
like me.

453
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:30,380
You really fell for that?

454
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,260
I was going to ask about the group project.

455
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,420
When are we going to start working on it?

456
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,659
And what were you about to say?

457
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,260
It’s..

458
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,060
I…

459
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,659
M!

460
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,020
Been looking for you.

461
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,140
Hey, the yesterday girl.

462
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,539
I went to buy donuts for you.

463
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,539
The queue was so long.

464
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,180
Donuttio’s always has a long waiting queue.

465
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,499
But why do you want to give me these donuts?

466
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:20,380
Well, I couldn’t stop thinking about you since yesterday.

467
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,659
So you fell for my charm?

468
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:30,020
But thanks a lot.

469
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,340
If you are free after this, shall we have dinner?

470
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,619
After class?

471
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:38,539
Yes.

472
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:41,459
Let’s don’t wait for after class. Let’s go now.

473
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,579
My treat.

474
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:45,539
That’s great.

475
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:48,619
We will talk about our group project later. Bye.

476
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,579
Let’s go, ma’am.

477
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:56,579
Let me help you hold them.

478
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:15,260
She’s here.

479
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,300
Mina, are you alright?

480
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:23,819
I’m totally fine.

481
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:25,300
I’m okay.

482
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,260
You like him.

483
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,739
Yes, but it’s over.

484
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:35,940
It’s over before it even has a chance to start.

485
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,220
Go confess your love to him

486
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,020
before you decide if it’s over.

487
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:45,499
That idiot has no idea that you like him.

488
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:48,180
Next time, shout it out loud.

489
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,779
Sure.

490
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,020
M!

491
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,340
I love you!

492
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:08,619
M!

493
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,699
Saranghae!

494
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,380
What?

495
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,060
We need to find more info on these.

496
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,020
But it’s also impossible to go ask directly from the

497
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,020
powerful outlaw people.

498
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,659
I think so too.

499
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:47,180
What Mafia would allow us to interview them?

500
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,180
The data we found are definitely not enough for the project.

501
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:00,180
I agree with you.

502
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,739
I’m not sure who’d be able to find us a Mafia

503
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:08,020
to interview.

504
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,779
We’re just normal college students.

505
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
No one would have a connection like that.

506
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,140
That’s bad.

507
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,779
But maybe I could find one.

508
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:39,539
Wait. Why suddenly possible

509
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,659
when Baifern asked?

510
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,940
Huh, what?

511
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,819
Beam secretly likes Baifern?

512
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,899
No.

513
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,819
I just want our project to be the best as it can.

514
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,300
Plus,

515
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,060
there’s so many people having a crush on her.

516
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,100
I’d never have a chance.

517
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:06,859
But I think you two

518
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:09,579
would make a cute couple.

519
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,980
Noon, don’t say that.

520
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,819
He’s blushing.

521
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:19,100
Alright, I will stop now.

522
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,659
But Baifern,

523
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:24,779
you’re also blushing.

524
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:27,300
True.

525
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,060
It’s just hot here.

526
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,499
Hot.

527
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,499
Yours is red as well.

528
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,140
Mop until it’s clean and shiny.
I can still see footprint there.

529
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:54,300
Miss Complain World 2022.

530
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,420
Miss Complain?

531
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,180
Nothing.

532
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:10,940
Are you in love?

533
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,579
Are you in love?

534
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:12,819
Huh?

535
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:15,859
What are you saying?

536
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:19,899
Your heart beats faster than it normally does.

537
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:25,659
Wow. Can human ears really hear that?

538
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:28,819
Don’t you dare forget that
I’m the most dangerous hitwoman in the world.

539
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:32,020
Hearing enemies’ heart beat

540
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,899
is what I always do.

541
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:37,100
By the way, where’s your appreciation?

542
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,420
Huh?

543
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,819
I’m talking about thank you Anna

544
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:44,779
for making the best presentation ever.

545
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,859
You? Deserved to be thank?

546
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,579
Stop talking and start mopping.

547
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,340
Well, the teacher did say it was

548
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,699
the best presentation ever.

549
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,659
So I would like to thank everyone.

550
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,100
Everyone? Including Sven?

551
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,100
You still want to go on with this, Anna?

552
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:15,659
Your presentation slides were like a funeral presentation.

553
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,260
People like you will never understand the world “art”.

554
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:27,260
What you call “Art”, I call “Ass”.

555
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:37,420
Sven.

556
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:58,779
Hello, P’ Sven.

557
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,899
Is it possible for me to interview you?

558
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:07,539
It’s for my group project.

559
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,699
Thank you.

560
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,140
Anna should be a better candidate than me.

561
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:26,180
If I ask Anna, then she’d surely kill us.

562
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:30,859
Thank you so much P’ Sven for letting me interview.

563
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:32,659
It’s fine.

564
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,499
Thank you.

565
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,100
Nut.

566
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,579
Give me a moment. I need to go pee.

567
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,699
Be right back. Be right back.

568
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:53,180
How should I start?

569
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:59,619
I’ll start with simple questions then.

570
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,579
Of course.

571
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,940
What do you do for a living?

572
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:09,980
I safeguard Master.

573
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,980
Master means the leader of the organization, am I correct?

574
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,340
You’re correct.

575
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,180
And…

576
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:36,579
For you, do you think the Nemesis

577
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:39,100
is a powerful organization?

578
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,699
Nemesis helps maintain peace in the society

579
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,499
without exposing themselves.

580
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,899
Can you give me three examples

581
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:05,380
of what Nemesis does to the society?

582
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,060
I really don’t know where to start here.

583
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,980
Should I start with the good things

584
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,260
or the bad?

585
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,140
Let’s start from..

586
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,180
P’ Sven.

587
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,859
Wait for me, P’.

588
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,340
Tan.

589
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,739
Doing like that will never make it clean.

590
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,779
Use your brain. Move those things and then brush.

591
00:46:49,779 --> 00:46:50,739
Do I need to teach you everything?

592
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:54,220
You can’t achieve anything if you’re this lazy.

593
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,260
Or do you plan on starring at the computers all day, huh?

594
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,899
Beam.

595
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:04,899
Help me.

596
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,300
Lazy ass.

597
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,699
Tan!

598
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:19,260
The dust.

599
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,619
Bloodlust.

600
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,699
And an intense one.

601
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,579
Hey!

602
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,020
I'm here

603
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,579
as an ally.

604
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,859
What are you talking about?

605
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:05,260
I'm talking about crushing Nemesis.

606
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,899
But your Gasolina gang

607
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,980
is already in the alliance force of Nemesis.

608
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,100
Burnt.

609
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,260
But the person with the highest score,

610
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,300
can become the right hand of the next Master.

611
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:21,579
After Master's death,

612
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:24,459
the person who was the most suspicious is

613
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,699
the one who knows the most about Nemesis.

614
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:32,420
But the person who benefits the most is you.
