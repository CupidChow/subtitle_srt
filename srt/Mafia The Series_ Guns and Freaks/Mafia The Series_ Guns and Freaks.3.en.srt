1
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,480
It is now the time for our

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Mockingbird Family to spread it's wing.

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,710
Are you ready for the field trip?

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,670
Mafia, is it?

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,800
The whole university just called you a hero.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,360
You're such a beauty. I can't wait any longer.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,110
Really?

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,480
Of course.

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,880
Your beauty aroused me.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,280
Where do you want to do it?

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,480
Here.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,400
Take it easy.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,960
I will take you hard.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,360
Can you wait a moment?

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,000
I can't wait now.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,630
Calm down.

17
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,000
Why?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's get in the car so we can leave.

19
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,760
I'm now reporting news in front of Epic pub.

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,110
There had been a murderous case.

21
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,070
Lieutenant Colonel Yuth Phichitwong was murdered

22
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,590
in his own vehicle.

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,590
The polices are currently investigating on this case.

24
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,670
Right now, they have found nothing

25
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,920
that can link to the culprit.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why the hell did you order an officer
to the field without telling me?

27
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,230
I'm sorry, Mr. Non. But last time I checked

28
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,920
I'm not working under you or your special force.

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,710
Good.

30
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,840
Everything's your fault.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,630
And don't forget to give his family condolences.

32
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,190
Yes.

33
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,320
I did send Yuth on the field.

34
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,030
But the reason he's dead is because he was playing around

35
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,670
regardless of safety protocol and the mission.

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,440
You can keep making excuses.

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,710
It doesn't change the fact,

38
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,070
that he died because of your order!

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,590
Next time, consult me before taking any action!

40
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,920
Stop right now, you gangsters

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,960
picking up on the weaks.

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Boy, do you want to keep on living?

43
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,840
Yes, I do.

44
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,320
If so, stamp onto this contract

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,480
with your blood.

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,190
Then I will take care of these gangsters for you.

47
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,670
With my blood?

48
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,760
Hurry! We don't have much time.

49
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,230
The contract has finally been stamped.

50
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,230
Time for me to take care of them.

51
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,440
Hold.

52
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,550
This way.

53
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,510
Knee. Knee. Knee. Knee.

54
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,880
Push. Push.

55
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,070
No kick.

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
Paying respect for what!?

57
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,590
Punch.

58
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,550
The queues are over. Leave.

59
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,150
Who is she? Why is she so strong?

60
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,550
She's too tough. Her punches are so deadly!

61
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,320
She's definitely above level 9,999.

62
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's leave. We can't stay here.

63
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,760
Thank you, both of you.

64
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,800
Without your help, I'd be killed.

65
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,110
You're welcome.

66
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,480
By the way, who are you two?

67
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,880
Why are you so well trained?

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,510
I am Sonya. The only daughter of Ron

69
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,920
of the Mockingbird Family.

70
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,000
And this is Bunny, my personal bodyguard.

71
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,510
I am Beam.

72
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,190
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,070
It's good that you're safe. Excuse us then.

74
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,360
These weaklings didn't even break my sweat.

75
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,150
Wait.

76
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,230
Your hat.

77
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,320
Wait!

78
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,920
What was that blood contract for?

79
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,960
So Beam's cousins are that strong?

80
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,670
Yes.

81
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,360
I was curious since the day they rescued me.

82
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,670
Plus there's this gorgeous lady,

83
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,110
slapping the villains with gun!

84
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,630
Hell!

85
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,550
Who the hell are these people?

86
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,550
That, I want to know.

87
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,960
But I didn't want to bother Beam too much.

88
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
I've got a plan.

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,150
What kind of plan?

90
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,510
Let's crash his place.

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,440
Huh?

92
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,000
Wouldn't that bother Beam too much?

93
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,440
Don't think of it as bothering him.

94
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,840
We're visiting him as lovely friends.

95
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,440
What the..?

96
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,760
See? All we need to do is changing our mindset.

97
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,630
Think it through, M.

98
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,150
I'm home!

99
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,760
Ooh, what is this?

100
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,550
It must definitely be from Anna.

101
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Don't open!

102
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,630
Ouch!

103
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,550
My Explosion Giftbox Prototype! I made it for 3 whole days.

104
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,310
Who the hell gave you permission to open it?

105
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,150
No manner at all!

106
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,030
But it's written 'Open Me' on the box.

107
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,840
I thought Anna gave me a present.

108
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,800
Are you an idiot?

109
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,760
Can't you see that it's completely a trap box?

110
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,760
So idiotic! I am so disappointed in you.

111
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,230
I apologize.

112
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,190
3 whole days of making, dammit.

113
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,070
NO!

115
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,350
Where's the stair?

116
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,470
Beam.

117
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,520
Why the hell are these guys here right now?

118
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,310
Hello, friend.

119
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
This way.

120
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
Who are you talking to?

121
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,270
Enough!

122
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,350
Are you okay?

123
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,190
You see,

124
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,150
since my dad passed away,

125
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,270
no one cooks for me.

126
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
Therefore, I have to learn how to cook.

127
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,840
And the result is what you're seeing.

128
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,030
Really?

129
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,880
Why are you guys here anyway?

130
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,470
We.....

131
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,110
We were worried about you.

132
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,600
Yes.

133
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,840
We're visiting you because you looked sad today.

134
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Yes.

135
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,310
Well, I'm not done with my food yet.

136
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,760
You guys should go back home first.

137
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,350
I'll see you later.

138
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,840
Okay....

139
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,720
I'm going in!

140
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,600
M!

141
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,350
Nut, give him a hand.

142
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,880
Why don't you help him too?

143
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,520
Nah, he's disgusting in this form.

144
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,680
Can't you guys go back?

145
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,960
Sit down.

146
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,390
Nut.

147
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,310
You're with him now?

148
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,960
We just want to know if there's anything
you're hiding from us.

149
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,390
And what would I hide from you guys?

150
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,470
For example, you're a hitman in free time.

151
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,920
The hell are you guys talking about?

152
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,720
Me? A hitman?

153
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,390
Beam, since you destroyed my Exploding Giftbox.

154
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
You shall be punished!

155
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,470
I'm just a housekeeper.

156
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,880
This is a vacuum cleaner.

157
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,600
Beam!

158
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,920
Nemesis Assemble, huh?

159
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,110
A gardener.

160
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,190
That!

161
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,190
And that!

162
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,880
Spit it all out now!

163
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,270
Sure.

164
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,470
I'll tell you everything.

165
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,680
To summarize, your dad's a Mafia boss.

166
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,920
And since he passed away,
you have to step up and become one.

167
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,720
Something like that.

168
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,840
See? I told you he's a Mafia boss.

169
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,560
You didn't tell me anything.

170
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,520
I just told you, a second ago.

171
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
If

172
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,030
you're a Mafia boss.

173
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,560
Can two of us become members of your gang?

174
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,390
Including me?

175
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,310
Yes.

176
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,310
No.

177
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,070
Yes.

178
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,800
No.

179
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
Stop talking.

180
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,720
The reason why I want to be in your gang is because

181
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,640
a research says that being a Mafia

182
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,070
attracts chicks.

183
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,230
M.

184
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,110
You completely misunderstand the word Mafia.

185
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,600
It's not what you think.

186
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,560
I told you everything you asked for.

187
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,720
Now, leave.

188
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Leave.

189
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,520
Safe trip home, Nut.

190
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,390
You're coming with me, fool.

191
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,190
Hey.

192
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,800
You sure you don't want us?

193
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,880
You want my face?

194
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,270
Completely sure?

195
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,110
Come!

196
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,230
What kind of day is this!?

197
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,110
With this contract, I can use the power of Nemesis

198
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,110
to stop my old man from manufacturing those drugs.

199
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't you feel bad for him?

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,430
He looked so innocent.

201
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,430
The sap usually doesn't fall far from the tree.

202
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,110
The son of someone as evil as Rachen,
is definitely equally evil as his father.

203
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,000
By the way, we were so good today.

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,920
He definitely believed us.

205
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,190
What do you mean you stamped the blood contract with Sonya?

206
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,310
I was in an emergency situation.

207
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,470
You didn't even read the contract?

208
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,190
So destroying my giftbox was not enough?

209
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,390
Anna, please calm down.

210
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,230
Calm down?

211
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,470
I didn't do it on purpose.

212
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,560
Anna.

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,640
Everything that happened

214
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
is my fault.

215
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,230
If I stayed at the college then
these things wouldn't happen.

216
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,470
Anna.

217
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,960
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,030
Sure.

219
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,880
Good for you that Sven took the blame.

220
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,350
I forgive you.

221
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,920
Do you really think I would say that!?

222
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,840
No one can save your ass.

223
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,680
You're such a troublemaker.

224
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,190
Sorry, but what is this so called 'Blood Contract'?

225
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,640
Blood contracts are contracts that are unbreakable.

226
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,880
Understand now?

227
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,560
I don't understand anything.

228
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,920
If I break the blood contract,

229
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,230
what will they do to me?

230
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,390
Sue me in the court?

231
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,680
Correct.

232
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,000
But not the court as you know.

233
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,430
It's called the Mafia Court.

234
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,310
And people who broke the blood contract
ends up being penalized.

235
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,070
Understand?

236
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,150
Penalized?

237
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,880
Like what?

238
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,560
Dead!

239
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,070
Get it now?

240
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,310
I don't want to be dead.

241
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,720
Please help me, Anna.

242
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,960
Sven.

243
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,520
What time is it?

244
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,960
You have a meeting after, Anna?

245
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,030
You don't need to know. Go clean up!

246
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,920
We don't have much time.

247
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,000
Go clean up!

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,110
Yes. Yes.

249
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,110
Troublemaker.

250
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,150
I'm bringing you to an exciting mission today.

251
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,230
Don't tell me your exciting mission is
hitting people's head with a gun.

252
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,640
The situation looks so familiar.

253
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,800
He's here.

254
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,920
Bring it home and eat it home. Home. Home.

255
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Eat it home...

256
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,470
What!? That's my favorite donut brand.

257
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Don't tell me it's from Donuttio.

258
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,270
My fave as well.

259
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,030
Donuttio? My favorite too!

260
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,840
But I didn't have much chance to eat it.

261
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,030
The queue is always too long.

262
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,390
Stop it! Both of you.

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
There's not enough donuts for all of us.

264
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Bye.

265
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,350
Donuttio!

266
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Get in my mouth now!

267
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Ouch!

268
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,150
So you've recovered?

269
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Hi.

270
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,110
Let's get to the point.

271
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,800
I need your assistance.

272
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,720
Hey!

273
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,470
You took all of my donuts?

274
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,640
The point is

275
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,070
I need you to look up the information on Mockingbird.

276
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,310
Especially the girl named Sonya.

277
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,310
I was standing in the queue for thirty minutes!

278
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,880
And the rabbit ears girl, Bunny.

279
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,430
Because they just made Beam stamped on the blood contract.

280
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,150
And that was the limited edition flavor!

281
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,600
Stop talking about Donut and listen to me!

282
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,880
Fuuuu....

283
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Anna.

284
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,560
Please calm down.

285
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,350
Don't help him.

286
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,430
It's all because of you stamping on the blood contract.

287
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,310
Tan wouldn't be here without you.

288
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,800
Telling me to calm down?

289
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,680
Tell that to yourself first!

290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Don't yell at Beam, Anna.

291
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,960
You can also call Tan on the phone
and ask for his help nicely.

292
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,800
Yes.

293
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,070
Sven, if you're just protecting Beam because you didn't get
your share of donut.

294
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,470
Go stand with Beam quietly.

295
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,800
What?

296
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Is that really the reason?

297
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,680
It's my favorite donut brand.

298
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,310
Alright, Tan. Let's continue.

299
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,070
Anna, if you want to ask for someone's help.

300
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,350
It shouldn't start with walking behind him,

301
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,600
hitting him in the head, stealing his donut
and tie him up like this.

302
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,840
First thing you need to know is I'm not asking for help.

303
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,390
This is an order.

304
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,960
Okay okay.

305
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,030
Mockingbird. Sonya.

306
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Yes.

307
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,310
You get it fast.

308
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,110
I think you just look a little bit more handsome.

309
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,600
I can't help you when I'm tied up like this.

310
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,680
Sven, please.

311
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,350
Hey!

312
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,680
Entering password. Accessing the organization's database.

313
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,840
Mockingbird.

314
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,840
These are all the information we have.

315
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,520
Sonya Mockingbird, the only daughter of Ron Mockingbird.

316
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,310
Age 23.

317
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:59,150
Has the title of Angel of Mafia Society.

318
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,800
In the meatime, someone has a title of Venomous Snake.

319
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,920
No wonder.

320
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,640
I heard you.

321
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,960
Let's continue.

322
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,720
Fighting skill equals to zero.

323
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,150
That's wrong.

324
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,230
When she was fighting, she looked so strong.

325
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,720
Like Wonder Woman.

326
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,840
Next, look for Bunny.

327
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,470
Access denied.

328
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,150
Accessing this information required a higher rank user.

329
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,190
What do you mean?

330
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,390
I mean there're only two people who can

331
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,000
access this information which are

332
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,600
Master and Mr. West.

333
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Wait.

334
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,190
You want me to go ask Mr. West

335
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,840
who I suspect killed Master for this information?

336
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,070
No way.

337
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,230
I mean, you guys are staying at Master's place.

338
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,190
Why don't you access his computer

339
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,190
and log into the server?

340
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,030
Wait.

341
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,960
I don't think my father had a computer.

342
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,560
He didn't even know how to send an email.

343
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,960
And I've never seen him use one.

344
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,680
Hey.

345
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,110
Shouldn't you realize now that your father is different from
who you thought he'd be?

346
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,270
I've just never seen him.

347
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,350
Tan, how do you know that his computer is at his place?

348
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:09,230
The last location he used his computer
to log into the server

349
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,470
is the same place you guys are living.

350
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,800
Thank you. There's no more use of you.

351
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,150
Bye.

352
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Hey.

353
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,840
Here goes nothing.

354
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,270
On the rock.

355
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,270
.............. Anna Kondra

356
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,150
Anacondra?

357
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,230
They're talking about snakes or something?

358
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,920
Only Ryo can take care of this.

359
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,070
............Lipstick.

360
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,800
Anacondra

361
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,310
and Lipstick?

362
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,310
Don't tell me

363
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,880
that Big Head Gang was planning a zoo-themed fashion show.

364
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,680
Excuse me. Is there something I can help you with?

365
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,150
Oh, an angel!

366
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,000
Can you please take me to the restroom?

367
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,350
I just can't find it.

368
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Restroom?

369
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,070
This way.

370
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
Do not allow anyone else to enter.

371
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,470
Ouch.

372
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,270
Where're you going, Mr. Police?

373
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,560
I'm not a police.

374
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,350
The last person also said the same.
His name's Yuth.

375
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,070
You killed Yuth!

376
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,720
I just slashed his neck slowly

377
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,680
and let him died by himself.

378
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,000
You guys are behind everything?

379
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,390
Do you know how he died?

380
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,230
Quiet.

381
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Freeze!

382
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Hands!

383
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,600
Show your hands!

384
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,430
You're not so bad.

385
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,230
Neither do you.

386
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,880
Stop!

387
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,800
Drop your weapon!

388
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,190
Next time, you die.

389
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I'm sorry.

390
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
Don't mention it.

391
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,800
Call an ambulance!

392
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,030
Now!

393
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:36,030
Big Hea... Big Head.

394
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,430
Hey!

395
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,150
Why does this shit need to happen?!

396
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,600
What's our next step, Mr. Non?

397
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,270
Close this place. No one in or out!

398
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,960
Check every inch, get me all the evidences!

399
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes, sir.

400
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,310
And get me all the information we got so far!

401
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,070
Yes, sir.

402
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,760
I think we should quit now.

403
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,390
It's been 3 hours.

404
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,520
And I don't recall my dad ever had a computer.

405
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,350
Stop complaining. Everyone is tired too.

406
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,230
Hey, Anna.

407
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,640
You've been at that spot for 2 hours.

408
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,070
I wonder if there's something around here.

409
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,840
Turn around.

410
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,680
Sven. I'm trying to find the computer.
Why would I turn around?

411
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,720
I told you to turn around!

412
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,430
Well, I'm just thirsty.

413
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,880
Anna!

414
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,310
At least, I checked this spot.

415
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,960
Unbelieveable.

416
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,390
Hey, Beam. Don't you dare.

417
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,110
Don't you ever say that again.

418
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,680
Well, we've checked around the house

419
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,600
and haven't found the computer.

420
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,350
True.

421
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,680
Me and Sven searched the whole house.

422
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,030
Does that mean dad's computer

423
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,760
could be outside the house?

424
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,600
A sound theory. Keep on thinking.

425
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,920
What does Master love to do in his freetime?

426
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,960
Think slowly.

427
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,880
His freetime?

428
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,720
Well.

429
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,470
When I played games at night,

430
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,520
my dad used to go gardening outside.

431
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,470
In the garden?

432
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,190
Is it possible?

433
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
The garden?

434
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,640
Let's hope nothing weird happens today.

435
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,030
Coming.

436
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,920
Anna, what happened!?

437
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,680
I can't take it anymore, Beam.

438
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,150
I was digging all night. Haven't slept yet.

439
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,230
Why don't you call me?

440
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,560
I saw you sleeping.

441
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,720
Can you skip class today and help me dig
please? I'm so sleepy.

442
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Sure. I'll skip class today, then.

443
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,920
Get some rest, Anna.

444
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,760
Thank you, Beam.

445
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,270
Always let others work for you, Beam.

446
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,920
What a big hole.

447
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,640
Anna must have been so tired.

448
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,230
Morning.

449
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,960
Good morning, Sven.

450
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,190
How are you?

451
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,760
I'll just keep on digging until I find something.

452
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,600
Why aren't you dressed up and prepared for school yet?

453
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,270
I'm skipping today.

454
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,560
Anna said she'd been digging since last night.

455
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Let's help her continue.

456
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,640
Anna drank all the wine

457
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,390
and went to bed since midnight!

458
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,760
I've been digging since then until now!

459
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,800
What?

460
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,030
Sven, can I have that?

461
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,230
Anna!

462
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,560
What!?

463
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,390
Anna, open the door!

464
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,600
Coming!

465
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,680
Why do you have to wake me? I haven't slept.

466
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,150
It's me who haven't slept!

467
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,070
Hi, Sven.

468
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,000
Go out and dig now, Anna.

469
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,520
Everyone, let's take selfie and put
'We're working' as the caption.

470
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,880
Nah. I'm lazy.

471
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,840
Oh no! This kiss must be Romeo's only!

472
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Go ahead, friends.

473
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,110
Beam! Beam!

474
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,030
Help me. Save me.

475
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,680
What happened?

476
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,030
Look at my group.

477
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,430
They're all freaks. I don't want to work with them.

478
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,230
You're just overthinking it.

479
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,390
Oh no! You stole Romeo's kiss! No! No!

480
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,230
Am I overthinking it?

481
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I understand you now.

482
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,350
You do?

483
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,600
I've got class to attend now.

484
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,190
Beam. Don't leave me. Help me.

485
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,680
Stay strong.

486
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Beam. Beam.

487
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,110
Beam! Beam!

488
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,600
Bye, friend.

489
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,030
Mr. Non from the special force is on the field.

490
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,470
This job is going to end faster than we expected.

491
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Agreed.

492
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,000
But damn, the girl from last night was so scary.

493
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,270
Yes, she didn't even hesitate to kill a cop.

494
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,920
Definitely, someone powerful is backing her up.

495
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,390
The people who killed officer
Yuth must have known we're coming.

496
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,560
Do we not obtain any evidence?

497
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,880
Luckily, they missed this.

498
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,310
This is the same type of bullet that

499
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,520
we found on Rachen's car.

500
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,350
That means.....

501
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Correct.

502
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,920
The people who killed Yuth, Thana
and Mr. Rachen are of the same group.

503
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,390
What's that?

504
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,800
Concentrate on finding the treasure, children.

505
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,560
Because the winning team is getting

506
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
5,000 baht.

507
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,430
But the losing team can get 10 tomatoes.

508
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,470
Do your best.

509
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,350
Ewww!

510
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,430
I swear I could vomit from just hearing
the word tomato.

511
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,030
We can't lose.

512
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,310
I don't want to eat tomatoes!

513
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,880
It's quite delicious.

514
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,310
Hey, guys.

515
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,230
I invited children around here to dig for the treasure.

516
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,600
How's my idea? Awesome?

517
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,680
Isn't it illegal using children's labor?

518
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,880
It's completely illegal.

519
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,270
You guys are so boring.

520
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,600
I'm going in.

521
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,310
Make yourselves useful.

522
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,760
Monitor these children. If they find something, let me know.

523
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,470
I'll go have my face masked.

524
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,800
Bye, children.

525
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,350
Bye!

526
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,960
Rooting for you, children.

527
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,680
Anna.

528
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,000
We found something.

529
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,840
Really?

530
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,920
Really!?

531
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,030
Go.

532
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,070
Oh, wait up. Go.

533
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,470
Which one of you found the treasure?

534
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,560
Me!

535
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,800
Come here.

536
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,390
Do you know you're the hero who saved the day?

537
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,640
Hold that for me.

538
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,350
Let's see what's inside.

539
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,110
I've been digging the whole day for baby teeth box!?

540
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,840
You didn't even dig by yourself, Anna.

541
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,230
The hell do you know? Before the children are here

542
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,720
I've been digging for 4 hours!

543
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,190
Not true. You digged for 12 seconds

544
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,960
and you forced us here for the rest of the time.

545
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,350
Yes. Yes. Yes.

546
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,270
Wait, Anna.

547
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,070
12 seconds?

548
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,520
I'd be more surprised

549
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,070
if Anna digged for over a minute.

550
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,270
Sis, I think I found something.

551
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,640
Let's hope it's not your sextoy box this time.

552
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,800
I think it's the ceiling to an underground basement.

553
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:19,110
Sven, see that these children get home safety.

554
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,110
I'll go get reinforcement.

555
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Wait, sissy.

556
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,600
Where's our prize?

557
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,430
Oh, yes. The prize.

558
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,430
Sven, manage the prize.

559
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,390
Wait, Anna. Wait!

560
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,880
5,000, sir.

561
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,070
5,000?

562
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,720
Beam, you got any?

563
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,520
Take this instead.

564
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,880
If you're going to give me 5, can I get 10 instead?

565
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
Sure.

566
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,110
But come get the rest next time.

567
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,760
Let's go, Beam.

568
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,070
Maybe the switch to the secret room
is behind these pictures!

569
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,720
It must be.

570
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,390
Embarrassment to your face.

571
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,070
Maybe these books

572
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,430
are the switch like in the movies.

573
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,520
Sven.

574
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,470
Return them exactly to where they were.

575
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,230
What's this!?

576
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,230
Hey!

577
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,030
This is the electro-magnetic scanner
that I built for 2 years.

578
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,000
It can detect more than 200 types of waves.

579
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,600
And if the secret room exists,

580
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,880
it must definitely release some form
of magnetic wave from it.

581
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,560
Can I try it?

582
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,190
Sorry, I hit Tan's head and brought him here.

583
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,680
I get to play first!

584
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,640
Hey!

585
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,840
Anna.

586
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,030
This is not just a normal electro-magnetic scanner.

587
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:40,350
The current price of it in the market is around

588
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,800
6 million baht.

589
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,350
What? 6 million?

590
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,110
This machine is completely useless.

591
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,000
It won't help us find the secret room
even if it's given ten centuries.

592
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,680
I think the traditional way is already working.

593
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,600
I knew it must be thrown that way!

594
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,640
What are you guys looking at?

595
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,560
It's all calculated.

596
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,190
So my house does have a secret room?

597
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,920
Lady first. Sven!

598
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,150
Get in. Aren't you curious what's in there?

599
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,070
Great job, daughter.

600
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,520
Today, Mockingbird Family will be proud of you.

601
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,230
Bring them to base and cage them.

602
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,640
You guys hurry and get out of here.

603
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,230
I'm here because I thought you could help me!

604
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,390
Stop saying stupid stuff like that.
