1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,360
Haven't seen you for so long, Ron.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,920
And how are we able to kill the Venomous Snake?

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,920
Regarding that,

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
there's more to our alliance than this.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,960
Time to wipe all of the remaining Nemesis' blood

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,360
Everyone, behind me!

7
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,360
Hello, kids.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,400
So... which one of you is Beam?

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
It's me.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,800
I am Beam.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,599
If I am the one you want, then take me.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,920
But you have to promise not to hurt any of my friends.

13
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:10,039
I believe you misunderstand something.

14
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,000
Does it look like you can negotiate in this situation?

15
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,880
I know I have no rights to negotiate.

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,719
But won't it be better if

17
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,360
you can take me without hurting anyone?

18
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,920
That's true. But there'll be no fun if no one dies.

19
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,519
Mina.

20
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,880
Your neck.

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,559
Oh gosh! Blood! Blood!

22
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,159
Blood!! Blood!!!

23
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,320
Are you okay?

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,719
Bloody Hell!

25
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,199
Mina!

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,360
She'll still end up dead.

27
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,079
Beam.

28
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,960
Run.

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,599
You want me to leave you to fight alone again?

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,360
Let's go, everyone. Hurry.

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,840
Why is it so quiet today?

32
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,360
Oh no! I must have slept for thousand years

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,199
passing the extinction of humanity!

34
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,360
So you're awake, Miss.

35
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you okay, Miss?

36
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,800
I thought I'm the only one left in this world.

37
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,519
Everyone is still here, Miss.

38
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,880
You have to calm down, Miss.

39
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,400
Then where did everybody go?

40
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,719
Mr. Ron said that

41
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,519
a Mafia War is happening.

42
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,760
Mafia War?

43
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,119
Beam!

44
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,000
Wait, Miss.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Mr. Ron told me not to allow you out of the mansion.

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,960
Release me! Release me!

47
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,320
Please, Miss.

48
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,400
If you go out then I'm surely dead.

49
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,320
Alright. Alright. I'm staying.

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,719
I'm really staying.

51
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:45,280
Please go rest in your room.

52
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,280
Oh my god! It hurts!

53
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,480
It hurts so bad!

54
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:00,880
Are you okay, Miss?

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm having that time of the month. Oh no!

56
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:07,280
Stay here. I will get you some medicines.

57
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,960
Hurry.

58
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,440
Give me a moment, Miss.

59
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,719
Bye, ro-bitch.

60
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,159
Damn, this time it really hurts.

61
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,199
I'm hurting for real.

62
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
What are you doing?

63
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,800
Please don't do this, Miss.

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,039
Miss Sonya planned to escape the mansion, Miss Bunny.

65
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,440
I won't let you go anywhere.

66
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,159
Come with me.

67
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:13,360
I hid it in it the deepest part of the fridge.

68
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,679
And I even put other stuffs to cover it.

69
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,800
If it's not you then who took my donuts?

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
Sven!

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,079
I saw Sven left the house with donut boxes.
It's definitely Sven.

72
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,599
I was there

73
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
when Sven left this house.

74
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,440
He did not take anything with him.

75
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,920
Well,

76
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,280
I really think that I saw Sven took them.

77
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,159
The hell you guys arguing about?

78
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,679
Hey, Anna. Thanks for this. Tastes nice.

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,199
Intenso.

80
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,039
Where'd you get these?

81
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,760
Why do you ask?

82
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,320
Anna gave me.

83
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,719
She didn't give you any?

84
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:58,840
No.

85
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,079
Errr....

86
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,920
First of all, this fridge

87
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,039
is for everyone in this house.

88
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,840
Which leads to everything in the fridge is for everyone.

89
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,880
And third, you didn't even put your name on the box, idiot.

90
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:19,719
But you just said that you didn't take them.

91
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,880
Plus, you said Sven took them.

92
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
What does that mean?

93
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,320
Am I staying with elementary school kids?

94
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
So frickin' chaotic.

95
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,440
What's up?

96
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,000
Help me! I'm being hunted down by Mafias.

97
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:46,400
Call earlier next time. Now run!

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,000
Something happened.

99
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,719
Enough! My eyes hurt.

100
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll go get change. This outfit's not elegant.

101
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,320
Right.

102
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,479
Go get dressed.

103
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,920
But what about my donuts?

104
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,399
Where did you put them, Intenso?

105
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,760
Take a deep breath and drink this.

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,880
Don't worry about Sonya. I won't let her go anywhere.

107
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you, Miss Bunny.

108
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,199
So you want to go help Beam?

109
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Of course, I will never let my husbando be
in harmful situation.

110
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,319
Then let's go already.

111
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,760
But...

112
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,399
I am so happy to secretly be lesbian.

113
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Hurry. We have to leave now.

114
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,479
Blood!?

115
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,600
Mina, wait for me.

116
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,520
So freaking hot! What kind of country am I living in!?

117
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,239
Wait for me!

118
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:04,439
Hey, wait. Wait.

119
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,039
Can anyone here tell me what is going on?

120
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,760
Everyone, I am sorry to drag you all into this.

121
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,319
I promise I'll tell you guys everything.

122
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
But now we have to focus on getting out of here.

123
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,039
Hey, Beam.

124
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,239
Will P' Sven be alright?

125
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
I cannot answer.

126
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,239
Sorry for the interruption but

127
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,359
we still don't know how many villains are around here.

128
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:36,840
Arguing here will just waste our time for nothing.

129
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,159
We have to run now.

130
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,399
Baifern, I can't afford to die now

131
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,439
because I haven't confessed my love to N' Flook and P' Jo.

132
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,119
I just can't choose!

133
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,319
Why do you have to get so serious?

134
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:52,960
This kind of situation should get you excited with the
adrenaline rushing.

135
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,600
You know what? Let's run.

136
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,399
Yes, let's go.

137
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,720
Let's not waste any more time.

138
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,119
You have to stop now, Mina.

139
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Isn't there supposed to be a hero in this kind of situation?

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,720
This is not the novel that you read.
No knight will come and save the princess.

141
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,279
But a knight will definitely come
and save a prince like you.

142
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,479
Alright, a knight will come and save a prince like me.

143
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay?

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay.

145
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,560
Try to concentrate.

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,239
Concentrate. Concentrate. Okay.

147
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,960
Don't get too noisy.

148
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:47,800
What am I supposed to do to make you stop freaking out.

149
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,800
How am I supposed to control myself

150
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,560
when someone is coming to kill me?

151
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,800
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to die.

152
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,960
That should work.

153
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,239
He's gone.

154
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,600
Are you hurt?

155
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:23,079
What's the rush?

156
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,520
You are Sonya's father.

157
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,399
Please, you have to help us.

158
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,439
Hey!

159
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,840
The hell are you talking about?

160
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,439
We're here to kill you, boy.

161
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Why are you guys standing there for? Kill them.

162
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,079
And now,

163
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,920
our Mockingbird Family will be the head gang of the guild.

164
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,960
If you're going to shoot Beam, then shoot through me,

165
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,920
Sonya!

166
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,079
What do you think you're doing?

167
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,520
Please do the right thing for once, dad.

168
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,039
Guns down, boys.

169
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,359
Is Nemesis mind controlling you, huh?

170
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,560
Answer me this, dad.

171
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,479
Has Beam ever caused a single problem to our family?

172
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,159
Has Beam ever harmed our family?

173
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,479
You don't know a single thing about Beam.

174
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,920
How are you able to kill him?

175
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,399
If you're not moving out,

176
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,359
I'll show you no more mercy.

177
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,159
Even the daughter of Ron

178
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,640
will need to die if she ever compromises the mission.

179
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
Chicolon,

180
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
ignore the Mockingbirds.

181
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,319
Shoot right through Ron's daughter.

182
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:07,359
This is my family's business. I can take care of it myself.

183
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,039
But if there's any scratch on my daughter,

184
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,239
you die.

185
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,640
Are you sure

186
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,800
that your combat power can compare to mine?

187
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,279
Triggerring that gun means your family

188
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,520
will be dead for nothing.

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,520
Now is the time. Go.

190
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,479
You wasted my time for nothing.

191
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:48,920
And the only way to compensate for that is your death.

192
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,319
Stop!

193
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:06,880
We're not dogs that come
and bite each other during this time.

194
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,359
Lower down your weapons.

195
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,119
Mr. Ron.

196
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,640
If you still cannot control your daughter

197
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,199
then don't say that I didn't warn you.

198
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,720
I can do anything for our alliance

199
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,159
but Sonya's life is beyond that.

200
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:38,119
You should know better what will happen if our mission
should fail.

201
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,079
The Nemesis

202
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,079
will surely declare an official Mafia War upon us.

203
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,520
And if it ever comes to that, not only your daughter,

204
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,359
but your lovely family will be wiped out to nothingness.

205
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,800
I know that.

206
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,600
You don't have to teach me.

207
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,720
Our mission today is to

208
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,640
kidnap Rachen's son.

209
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,079
Which is simple considering

210
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,039
three gangs are cooperating.

211
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,640
But if by forming alliance

212
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,680
causes you two to bite each other like dogs then

213
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,920
you might want to quit being a Mafia.

214
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,600
Oh.

215
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,119
They still think

216
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,800
that our mission today is

217
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,239
Rachen's son.

218
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,159
Oh no, I'm so tired.

219
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,840
Can you go any further?

220
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,920
Beam, I'm so exhausted.

221
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,840
Please don't leave me.

222
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,199
Sonya, you saved me.

223
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,439
I will never leave you.

224
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,119
The path ahead is cleared.

225
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,720
Bunny, this is the worst time to interrupt.

226
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,359
In situation like this,

227
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,680
my adrenaline rushes that my hands are shaking
and can't take any selfie.

228
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,239
Earthly,

229
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,520
will you be fine?

230
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,600
It's a good thing to bring a selfie-stick.

231
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,079
Glad to hear that your pictures will be as clear as before.

232
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,359
If you guys are going to be slowpokes then Earthly ain't
gonna wait.

233
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,479
Nice chests.

234
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,039
Thank you.

235
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,039
Will M and Mina be alright?

236
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Nut too, he's gone.

237
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,319
I have no clue what happened to our friends.

238
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:21,399
Beam, you have to explain now.

239
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,319
To be honest,

240
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,319
I have no idea too.

241
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,399
How can you not know when the problem is so big now.

242
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,239
Hey, lady. Watch your tongue.

243
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,520
Can't you show some respect to the leader
of all Mafias in the future?

244
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,199
Wait. Weren't you about to faint a moment ago?

245
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,239
Oh no, I'm blacking out now, Beam.

246
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,239
Noon, you can blame me all you want.

247
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,119
But please, focus on escaping for now.

248
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,199
I beg you.

249
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,199
Sure.

250
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,319
Okay.

251
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,920
Let us go.

252
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,359
Passing these cactuses

253
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,439
and we should be in a safer area.

254
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,399
Ain't nobody stopping me now.

255
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh.

256
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,199
After you, Beam. I'll guard your back.

257
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,560
Try to hurry.

258
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,079
Sonya, are you alright?

259
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:03,000
Here.

260
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,439
Let me carry you.

261
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,439
Jump up.

262
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:10,520
Ouch!

263
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,000
Ouchhh!

264
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,239
Ouchhh!

265
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,119
Try going to spa more often, alright?

266
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,600
Are you crazy? Those are cactus' needles, not my....

267
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,680
Ouch!

268
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,119
What the...

269
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,880
#%$#*$#$(#%)

270
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,359
Is Beam going to be alive right now?

271
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,159
#$@%#$$%$^@#

272
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,399
Nah, he should be dead already. Now it's your turn!

273
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,399
I am hearing footsteps.

274
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:03,239
I am sensing killer's aura.

275
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,600
There!

276
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:09,159
Mina. M.

277
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,359
Killer's aura, you said?

278
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,640
Get away from me.

279
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,960
Are you guys safe?

280
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,880
Of course, I am the right hand man of Nemesis' leader.

281
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,760
Where's P' Sven?

282
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,319
He stayed behind to fight the assassins.

283
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
And you let him?

284
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,119
He can die too!

285
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,359
I'm worried about him as well.

286
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,960
But I have to get you guys out of here.

287
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,319
Hey? Where's Nut?

288
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,479
I thought he was following.

289
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,479
He's always a slow guy. He'll catch up in time.

290
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,600
Where the hell am I?

291
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,119
Oh no.

292
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,920
Alright. Let's keep going.

293
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Wait for me.

294
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:22,439
Sven, looks like you're keeping all the fun to yourself.

295
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
#!?$@!#!~#$%

296
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,359
Why the hell are you so late?

297
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,520
The traffic.

298
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,399
That hair color. You must be Intenso.

299
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,680
That hair style. You're Violet.

300
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,159
Never thought I'd find you here.

301
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,319
But your coming here won't make any difference.

302
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,880
And what gives you that idea?

303
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,079
Look at your hair. Dry and unhealthy.

304
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,159
Who can you possibly save?

305
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,079
Hey. Shut up damn mouth there.

306
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,680
In order to dye my hair this color
I have to bleach my hair first.

307
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,920
It's only normal for my hair to be dry and unhealthy.

308
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,760
Can you see how noob you are?

309
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,640
Then I will challenge you

310
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,239
to fight with the stake of hair's pride.

311
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:20,039
Challenge accepted.

312
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,840
You look like shit.

313
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,720
Try to speak lesser.

314
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,520
Boring. Where's your sense of humour?

315
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,119
Go!

316
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:57,920
Now what?

317
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,840
Mr. Beam. We were sent

318
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,399
to rescue you and your friends to the safezone.

319
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,199
There's a van waiting at another side.

320
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,960
Wait. You guys again?

321
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,800
I don't trust any of them.

322
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,119
Bunny, hit them all.

323
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,760
Wait. Wait. They're my guys.

324
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,720
Can you guys take my friends to the safezone?

325
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,840
Won't you come with us, Mr. Beam?

326
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm going back for Sven.

327
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,920
But Mr. West did insist to take you back with us

328
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,800
without any excuse.

329
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,680
Then I am using my authority

330
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,520
as the next leader of Nemesis

331
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,279
to order you guys to take my friends to the safezone

332
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,560
and leave me here.

333
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,039
Roger that.

334
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,560
Yes, sir.

335
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,720
Yes, Master.

336
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
Everyone, go with these guys.

337
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,279
I'm staying with Beam.

338
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,840
Are you really not going back with us?

339
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,600
I've decided.

340
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,520
There's no need to worry.

341
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,239
I'll be fine.

342
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm going with Beam too.

343
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,079
You can't even catch up with friends.

344
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,560
I guess I can't ask you guys

345
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,159
to go to the safezone, huh?

346
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,279
I never listen to the teachers. Who do you think you are?

347
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,920
Then, O. Take care of the girls.

348
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,800
You can count on me.

349
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,920
You know what? I'm staying with Beam.

350
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,399
Sure. Then it's a plan.

351
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,520
Stay safe, everyone.

352
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,960
Let's go.

353
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,079
Beam.

354
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,279
Promise me you'll come back safe.

355
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,319
I promise.

356
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,960
She is so flirty. She may be quiet outside

357
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,199
but so slutty inside.

358
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,399
Master, go ahead.

359
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,560
Go.

360
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,479
Go.

361
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,479
Can I have one of the gun?

362
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,239
You go first.

363
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,760
I'll go after you.

364
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,560
Enough.

365
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,560
Hey! Hair dyes on discount!

366
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:34,640
Huh?

367
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,920
Darn it.

368
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,359
Darn it...

369
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,399
Hair dyes on discount?

370
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,039
That Violet.

371
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,000
What a trickster.

372
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,880
How can there be hair dyes on discount here?

373
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,880
Looks like someone wants to change his hair color again.

374
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,920
What?

375
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,520
Let's go find Beam.

376
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:37,800
Wait.

377
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,000
No one knows about this, Sven.

378
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,159
I'll give you 10,000.

379
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,560
Alright.

380
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
What a greedy man.

381
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,960
Sonya. You need to get back to the mansion now.

382
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,880
Stop it already, dad. Everything is so messed up now.

383
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,079
James, go get Sonya.

384
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,439
Yes, sir.

385
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,760
Stop it, Muncho.

386
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,239
Or James dies.

387
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,079
You're betraying our family again, Bunny?

388
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:34,279
Mr. Ron asked me to protect Sonya with my life.

389
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm doing it now.

390
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,760
Dad, do you remember what you used to tell me?

391
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,159
You said Mockingbird Family is the only gang in this country

392
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,439
to use the word Family after it's name.

393
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:55,000
Meaning that each and every member of the gang

394
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,479
will be treated like we're from the same family.

395
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,720
But all these times, I've never felt for once

396
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,880
that I am a part of this family!

397
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,319
So this time, I beg you

398
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:14,119
as a part of your family

399
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,680
as a part of your gang

400
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,600
and as your only daughter.

401
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Please do not hurt Beam anymore.

402
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:32,159
Then answer me this.

403
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,279
What causes you to risk your life for Nemesis?

404
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,920
Because Beam is too kind.

405
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,000
He is way too innocent.

406
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,279
And the last one is

407
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,319
he is the one I love.

408
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,079
Muncho.

409
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,840
Sir.

410
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,960
Tell our men that our mission has ended.

411
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:18,479
Let's go back now.

412
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,359
Dad...

413
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:51,319
Looks like my assassins have lost

414
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,119
to Nemesis.

415
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,800
I really hope that

416
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,439
Big Head has more to offer than those two assassins.

417
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,000
Don't underestimate me.

418
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,880
Skilled reinforcements are on their way here.

419
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,399
Mistress.

420
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,760
Has Ron of Mockingbird Family

421
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,399
left our alliance?

422
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,760
Looks like it.

423
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,000
A shame.

424
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:33,079
We should have killed that Sonya.

425
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,000
Things should be over by now.

426
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,479
Do you want me to

427
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,720
go and slay all of the Mockingbirds?

428
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,239
Not yet.

429
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,279
There's only one thing to our mission.

430
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,520
To lure Anna Kondra out

431
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,840
and kill her.

432
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,439
And after that

433
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,520
I give you full permission

434
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,359
to kill whoever you want.

435
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:02,199
Yes, Mistress.

436
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,760
Damn, Tan.

437
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:39,159
How the hell can you fall for her?

438
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,399
Think of what life after marriage would be like.

439
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,760
What the hell are you saying?

440
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,479
How can our reinforcements be intercepted?

441
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,079
Anna Kondra is there?

442
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:08,920
How can dozens of you

443
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,239
lose to a single woman?

444
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,319
So the snake has come out.

445
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,039
Sven!

446
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,399
Are you okay?

447
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Are there more enemies to kill?

448
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,800
You're Ron's daughter.

449
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,600
Wait, it's...

450
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,119
Sonya is one of our friends.

451
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,079
I'm alive because of her.

452
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,720
Are you certain?

453
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,039
Are you sure?

454
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,199
Yes.

455
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,560
Sorry 'bout that.

456
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,920
Fine.

457
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,279
It's Selfie Time.

458
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,479
Let us group up.

459
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,880
Selfie!

460
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,079
What the hell?

461
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,279
Is her brain fine?

462
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:30,700
Let's take a selfie, 1 2 3!

463
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:36,800
Perfect picture!

464
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,720
Let us make haste. Beam is in danger.

465
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,600
How'd you done all that?

466
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:14,920
Do what?

467
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:16,359
Like...

468
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,199
I saw them shooting at you.

469
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:21,920
But you're completely fine.

470
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,600
Are you crazy!? Was I supposed to let them shoot me?

471
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,000
Of course, I dodged the bullets.

472
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:29,680
Get in the car.

473
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,039
I know! I know.

474
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm getting in the car.

475
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,039
Stop complaining. I'm saving your ass once again.

476
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:55,680
Saving my ass?

477
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,039
Miss Bunny's dress is gorgeous.

478
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,159
What about mine?

479
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,399
Yours?

480
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:20,279
Sucks.

481
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,000
I was asking Beam. Plus,

482
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:28,039
this dress is imported from Italy.

483
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,000
Come on, let's not fight each other.

484
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,039
Hey, playtime is over.

485
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,079
Sven.

486
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,600
The end of Nemesis is here.

487
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,560
Nemesis is at its end.

488
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,439
The hell did you repeat that for?

489
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:03,840
Sven.

490
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,479
you take the right one.

491
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,920
Rabbit girl,

492
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,399
you take left.

493
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,000
I'll get the big guy.

494
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,560
Well, thanks

495
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,039
for managing everything.

496
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,640
Never thought I'd have to fight together
with a member of Mockingbird.

497
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,279
Everyone, get ready!

498
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,680
Never thought this day would come.

499
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,079
You were supposed to be dead.

500
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,760
God sent me back to defeat Nemesis.

501
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,159
Shoot!

502
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:51,880
Beam!

503
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:56,560
The situation right now,

504
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,880
There's no chance you're winning this.

505
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,039
Do you forget that

506
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:06,359
We have Anna Kondra.
