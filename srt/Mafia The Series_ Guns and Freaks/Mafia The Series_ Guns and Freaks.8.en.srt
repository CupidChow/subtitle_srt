1
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:13,360
How can a special force

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,239
be able to fight with the Mafia?

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,400
Intenso!

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
I was going to let him live!

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,960
Mr. Non is dead.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,239
Let me take a look.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,760
Is there no one here?

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,440
Been ringing the bell for a while.

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
Is that your weapon, Tan?

10
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,760
Excuse me, but whose Golden Retriever just got loose?

11
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,719
Mine.

12
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,280
Old man.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,480
Is there a problem, Anna?

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,639
Is there a reason why

15
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,679
you bring this dog here?

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,159
Stop biting already.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Then answer me. Why are you here?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
Lower your weapon.

19
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
I wasn't talking about you, Anna.

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,920
So what you're saying is

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,400
you killed Mr. Non.

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,679
Tadaaaa!

23
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,079
The truth is, your Mr. Non

24
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,760
was working for a Mafia gang.

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,760
What do you mean?

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,000
Mr. Non was in the special force that

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,719
is considered the best of the country.

28
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:41,119
That's true. But everyone has weakness.

29
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,800
For Master, it's you.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,320
How do you know about this?

31
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:55,119
If that is your question then,
this old man sent me to guard you secretly.

32
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey!

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
What are you guys playing?

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Can I join the game?

35
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,960
Slowpoke.

36
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,519
See you later in hell.

37
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,320
Why do you have to group up

38
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,599
just to kill a single ant.

39
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,039
Tell me.

40
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,440
Who sent you?

41
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,679
Hey!

42
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,159
Hey!

43
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:15,320
Hey!

44
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,039
Damn Cyanide.

45
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,599
Damn it.

46
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:30,440
How are these things connected to Mr. Non?

47
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,920
Tan.

48
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,440
Use some of your brain.

49
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,599
Not a single Mafia uses Cyanide.

50
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,719
You fool.

51
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,719
But still, this doesn't link to Mr. Non at all.

52
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,840
Old man,

53
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,119
is this child our new Master?

54
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,199
After that incident, I tracked Non

55
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,679
who was working on your father's case

56
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,679
covertly.

57
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,760
And did you find anything?

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
It was a second but I was confident,

59
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:21,199
it was a blood contract.

60
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,760
The story that you just told us

61
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,079
sounds sexy and naughty

62
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,760
but where's the evidence?

63
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,199
Without evidence, how do you expect us to trust you?

64
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,960
Undestandable, because this old man is a pretty good liar

65
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,000
but a man like Intenso never lies.

66
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,199
Take a look at this.

67
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,519
Out of focus and low quality.

68
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,000
You took this?

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,519
Yes.

70
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,079
No wonder the quality sucks.

71
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:58,800
Anna.

72
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Believe me.

73
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,559
And I saved your ass back there

74
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,119
so learn to be grateful, Tan.

75
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,039
Mr. West.

76
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,559
But we met at the annual Mafia meeting.

77
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,519
You could have told us about this.

78
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,320
After the death of our Master,

79
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,639
I couldn't trust anyone.

80
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,480
Just like you.

81
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,239
But surely you must know that
I'd never betray the organization.

82
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,679
Oh, to be fair then you should know as well that

83
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:37,679
this old man would never betray Nemesis.

84
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,039
After Master's death,

85
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,639
the person who was the most suspicious is

86
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,960
the one who knows the most about Nemesis.

87
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,639
But the person who benefits the most is you.

88
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,880
Hey.

89
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,679
Stop it.

90
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,239
Why don't we discuss what to do next?

91
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,360
Excuse me.

92
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,599
I'd like to ask something.

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,920
SInce I'm an outsider,

94
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:23,399
are you guys going to kill me for knowing this much?

95
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,600
Why?

96
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,960
Scare that your lovely face would have scar on it?

97
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,039
Intenso!

98
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,119
Sorry about that, I taught him manners

99
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,960
but he never learns.

100
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,960
I was just messing around, old man.

101
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,479
You're so old-fashioned.

102
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,279
Beam.

103
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,560
Can I check on something?

104
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,359
Yes.

105
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,159
Why couldn't Master place a secret room
somewhere harder to notice?

106
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,920
I believe this is hard enough.

107
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,039
Just as I expected.

108
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,359
All the blood contracts are gone.

109
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,479
But I saw it recently.

110
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,079
There's no need to guess

111
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
who killed Master anymore.

112
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,680
One of our allies.

113
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,920
Mistress, everything was according to our plan.

114
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,720
What are we going to do with the police's daughter?

115
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,520
Non did what he promised.

116
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,399
It's our turn to do ours.

117
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,399
But she'll be back without a father anymore.

118
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,479
We didn't kill her father.

119
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,439
It was Nemesis.

120
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,319
Don't you feel any regret, Chicolo.

121
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,640
And now,

122
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:37,439
Nemesis already knows what we did.

123
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,279
Try to be careful

124
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,119
before taking any action.

125
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:49,279
Since they've already known everything,

126
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,039
do you want me to go and kill Anna Kondra now?

127
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,000
Not yet.

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The time will come.

129
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,920
Apology, Mistress.

130
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,279
My adrenaline was rushing.

131
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,199
We just burned the contract,

132
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,079
and your adrenaline is already rushing, Boy?

133
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,720
Why? Don't you want to see Anna Kodra die?

134
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:24,800
You are such an evil mistress,

135
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,920
Gasolina.

136
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
You're not so bad yourself, Mr. Krit.

137
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,800
Resurrected from the dead, I see.

138
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,840
Time to wipe all of the remaining Nemesis' blood
for real this time.

139
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,039
I'm sorry

140
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
but your father's dead.

141
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
Why are you people doing this?

142
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,560
Why did you kill my father?

143
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:26,039
You said it yourself that after this job is done,
my father will be safe.

144
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,119
I'm truly sorry

145
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,640
but it was not our gang that kill your father.

146
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,680
But everything that happened was originated from you!

147
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:44,359
If you did not abduct me and force
my father to work for you, my father would still be alive!

148
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,680
Go ahead.

149
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,760
I already felt like a dead person anyway.

150
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Go ahead and kill me so that I can go see my father!

151
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:42,359
Everybody has experienced losing their love ones.

152
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,560
But human needs to learn to live on with their grief.

153
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,920
That quote won't change anything.

154
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:52,439
Bad people like you will still be bad.

155
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:58,319
Not to mention your lovely father had killed
dozen of my gangsters.

156
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:00,560
He is not different than us Mafias after all.

157
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,119
All Mafias are terrible!

158
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,439
Not all Mafias are terrible.

159
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,880
We spoke to Mr. West so late last night.

160
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,319
And I have an exam today.

161
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:35,039
Why didn't you tell me that?

162
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,399
Tan, hack into the college system and
access the exam questions.

163
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,840
Have you heard of the phrase

164
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,319
No Cheating?

165
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,880
We're Mafia. Plus,

166
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,720
who never cheated in their entire life?

167
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,680
Errr....

168
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:59,039
Sven. Sven never cheats.

169
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,199
He's the cheatest of all cheaters.

170
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,880
And since when did I ever cheat?

171
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,279
Your car's exhaust causes pollution

172
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,720
above the amount that the law allows.

173
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,840
This time, I agree with Anna.

174
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,359
Sometimes when I'm on Sven's car,

175
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,720
I want to borrow Anna's oxygen tank.

176
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,560
Great.

177
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,560
Consider walking to college by yourself today.

178
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,680
Oooh, it's not my fault.

179
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I mean,

180
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,279
your car is awesome.

181
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,239
It's classic.

182
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,560
A classic disaster.

183
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:56,680
How dare Gasolina threatened me to stop my Windmill drugs.

184
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,560
How are we going to do business from now on!?

185
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,319
God damn it!

186
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,079
Is this how Mockingbird

187
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,079
welcome their guests?

188
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,359
Gasolina.

189
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,439
You must be confident

190
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,720
to dare to step into this place.

191
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,680
I'm here

192
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,439
not as an enemy.

193
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:35,199
But as an ally.

194
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,039
What are you talking about?

195
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm talking about crushing Nemesis.

196
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:49,199
But your Gasolina gang

197
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,960
is already in the alliance force of Nemesis.

198
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,760
Burnt.

199
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,960
What?

200
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,760
The blood contract.

201
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:17,960
Haven't seen you for so long, Ron.

202
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,840
Krit of Blue Moon.

203
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,920
You're still alive?

204
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,279
Mina.

205
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,079
Let me copy your answer.

206
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,520
Her brain must be full of selfie sticks.

207
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,960
Nut.

208
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,279
O' random god please tell me

209
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,279
what the answer is.

210
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,279
Is it an A, B, C, or D?

211
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,000
If what you said is true,

212
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,640
then Nemesis will surely be crushed into pieces.

213
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,119
And after this,

214
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,760
I don't demand any power nor money.

215
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,479
When Nemesis is gone,

216
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:14,479
you can have its throne.

217
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,279
If you don't seek the throne,

218
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,399
then why are you doing all of this?

219
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:25,079
There's only one thing in my mission,

220
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,760
I want Anna Kondra to be dead.

221
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
And I

222
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,640
want revenge for what they did to my Blue Moon.

223
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,880
Our plan is to

224
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,760
use Rachen's son to lure them all out.

225
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,960
And how are we able to kill the Venomous Snake?

226
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,800
Regarding that,

227
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,359
there's more to our alliance than this.

228
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Do you realize how evil you are, Gasolina?

229
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Are you joining my alliance?

230
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:22,199
I promise you that Mockingbird Family

231
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:27,840
will do everything to achieve our plan.

232
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,560
Freak.

233
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,479
Stop following me, you psycho!

234
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,359
Freak.

235
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,560
What?

236
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,840
What do you want from me?

237
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,880
We're friends.

238
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,239
Why

239
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:04,760
didn't you let me see your answer sheet?

240
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,000
You knew that we're having an exam today.

241
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,439
Why didn't you prepare for it?

242
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,680
You always want to copy someone else's.

243
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,319
Plus,

244
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,399
who do I need to help someone as selfish as you.

245
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:21,359
I thought our

246
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,359
feelings are mutual.

247
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,000
Huh?

248
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,960
You're saying?

249
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,399
Don't tell me that you

250
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,960
like...

251
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,399
Of course, I do.

252
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,359
We're friends.

253
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,119
And...

254
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,720
I'd do anything for you.

255
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,479
So I thought you would feel the same way.

256
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,319
Turned out I was wrong.

257
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,720
You did not feel the same way at all.

258
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,359
That's right!

259
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,479
Our feelings are not mutual.

260
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,880
Not even a bit.

261
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,319
And never was!

262
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,319
Alright, then

263
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,439
sorry.

264
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,640
I won't

265
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,239
intervene with you again.

266
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,560
Are you okay, M?

267
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,960
It's Mina.

268
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,039
She wouldn't let me copy.

269
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,119
And I don't want to talk about Earthly.

270
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,079
Why's that?

271
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,760
She took selfies in exam room. That's so illegal.

272
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,039
Poor you.

273
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,000
Hey.

274
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,439
It's Baifern.

275
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,279
Do you want to have lunch together?

276
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,199
Sure, let's go.

277
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:06,119
Shall we go for sushi?

278
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,000
Beam.

279
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,319
Why don't you take some action?

280
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:14,319
She's a star.

281
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,199
It's only normal if someone asks her out.

282
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:20,000
But if I were you,

283
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,479
I will walk to him.

284
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:24,119
Then what's next?

285
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,600
I don't know. Haven't thought about it.

286
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Damn, I was expecting something.

287
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,199
But if you don't take any action then,

288
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,239
all there's left is losing.

289
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,840
I should know from the start,

290
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,239
she's way out of my league.

291
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,199
But you're Mafia boss.

292
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,680
Not to mention, your bodyguard is P' Sven.

293
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,880
He's cool and you're also handsome.

294
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,720
And you have a such a big and long....

295
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,359
Wait, what?

296
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,560
authority.

297
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Oh.

298
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,960
Come on, help me.

299
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,720
But I...

300
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,319
Hey, there's no need to be down like that.

301
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,840
Don't be sad.

302
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,800
We're going to your place.

303
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,399
Alright?

304
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,119
Sure.

305
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,000
Don't be sad.

306
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,920
How dare they walk this way.

307
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,920
And even hold hands.

308
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,479
And that smile.

309
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:41,159
He wanted a piece of me!

310
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:41,720
Easy.

311
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,079
Nut.

312
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,159
Hold me tight.

313
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:46,640
Why?

314
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,039
Lucky for you.

315
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,560
- My friend was holding me back.
- If he wasn't, then you'd be dead.

316
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,359
You shouldn't hold me back, Nut.

317
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,720
Apology.

318
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,880
Tan.

319
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,600
Can you...

320
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,920
help me find a discount dye?

321
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,159
Why don't you go to a salon?

322
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,640
It's expensive!

323
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,800
What is Mr. West thinking

324
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,880
sending you here?

325
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,560
Do you think I want to be here with the insects

326
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,560
if it's not his order?

327
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,039
Insect? Are you talking about yourself?

328
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,039
Shall we go for another round?

329
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,119
Sure, it's been a while since I kill someone.

330
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,079
How many boxes?

331
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,520
Enough for everyone.

332
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,199
What are you waiting for?

333
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,000
Release.

334
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,159
Tan.

335
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,039
Focus.

336
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,920
- Come on already.
- Hurry.

337
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:11,600
So I'll officially become a Mafia

338
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,840
if I pass this training.

339
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,039
You're correct.

340
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,279
And this training, we will pair up

341
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,800
one instructor per one student.

342
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,920
It'll be fun.

343
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,119
Anna,

344
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,279
you can't drag my friends to train like this.

345
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,439
They never agree to this.

346
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,359
Any objection?

347
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,960
I've been waiting for whole life for this.

348
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,840
Good.

349
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,680
And I want to become a Mafia like everyone.

350
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,760
Nut.

351
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
You want to be a Mafia?

352
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:51,239
I thought you said you never wanted this.

353
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,279
I've changed my mind.

354
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,800
Alright, let's start pairing up now.

355
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,279
Wait, Anna.

356
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
There are three students but four of us.

357
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,319
How are we going to pair up?

358
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:15,720
Tan, do you want to teach these kids
to use cleaning brush to fight?

359
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,840
Agreed.

360
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,760
Tan, you have no rights to teach them.

361
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,239
Totally agreed with them.

362
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,279
Teamwork all of a sudden, huh?

363
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,920
Alright, time to pair up.

364
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,600
Give it back.

365
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,119
You might die before the training.

366
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,720
True.

367
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,680
Pew pew.

368
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,079
M, you die first.

369
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Okay, I've set up a program to evaluate
the efficiency of this training.

370
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,920
If your score is lower than the standard then

371
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,640
you will not be able to become a Mafia.

372
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:14,000
But the person with the highest score,

373
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,760
can become the right hand of the next Master.

374
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,760
I'll do my best.

375
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,039
Do I have to train with Anna?

376
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,239
Yes.

377
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,560
Excuse me but what's wrong with training with me?

378
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,640
Am I not strong, huh? Answer me!

379
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,880
Alright, alright.

380
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,840
Let's separate and train. Ready?

381
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,479
Let's go, Sven.

382
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:45,000
Life has never been this amazing.

383
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,560
Do your best, Sven.

384
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,439
Ready?

385
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,439
Listen and memorize this.

386
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:01,079
The advantage of kunai or knives is their weight

387
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,520
does not compromise your speed.

388
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,439
Understand?

389
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,159
Yes...

390
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,079
but I'm curious.

391
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,960
How are we able to fight with gunners?

392
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,800
Guns are range weapons.

393
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,439
You will already win the fight once you get close to them.

394
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,079
But I'd surely be dead before I get close to them.

395
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,199
Then do not hesitate to stuck a knife into their faces.

396
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,039
Let's train.

397
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,960
Okay.

398
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,960
I don't know how to use guns

399
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,640
so I'll train you to use swords.

400
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,439
And how are we going to use our "swords"?

401
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,600
I mean...

402
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,159
I don't even know how to hold them.

403
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,039
Here.

404
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,199
Take my sword.

405
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,279
Thank you.

406
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,279
Your sword is big, P' Sven.

407
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,840
Be careful with it.

408
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,399
Yes.

409
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,880
Here's your gun.

410
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,319
Shoot the target.

411
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Don't trigger the gun.

412
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,920
Concentrate.

413
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,439
Aim and shoot the target.

414
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:46,039
You know what?

415
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,640
Let me show you.

416
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,880
Watch and learn, Beam.

417
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,079
Simple. Now your turn.

418
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,000
Go do it.

419
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,119
Can you show me one more time?

420
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,720
Now.

421
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,119
Didn't you watch me?

422
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,720
Ooh, pretty.

423
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,359
Use your instinct when throwing weapons.

424
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:29,680
Yes, sir.

425
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,079
Look closely.

426
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,239
Wow.

427
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,279
Try it.

428
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,560
Instinct. Instinct.

429
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,279
Hey.

430
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,520
Not bad for a beginner.

431
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,359
How's my instinct?

432
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,720
It's so so. Try again.

433
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,239
I got a question.

434
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:52,960
What is it?

435
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,319
What does instinct mean?

436
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,800
Let's start now.

437
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,159
But in this circumstance, I'll surely be destroyed by you.

438
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,880
There's no need to be afraid, I'll go easy and slowly.

439
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,479
But I'm still scared.

440
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,399
It's only scary for the first time.

441
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,640
Let's do it.

442
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,800
Raise your sword.

443
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,359
Slash.

444
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,119
Focus.

445
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:44,439
Isn't there a better picture for you to use, Anna?

446
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,600
Why? These are cute. Look at that.

447
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,560
Beam, stop it. Lower your gun.

448
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:01,640
Didn't you listen to me? Didn't you see me?

449
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,000
The legs are wrong. Where are the spinning?

450
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,840
And what were you shooting at, huh?

451
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,119
I tried my best.

452
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,680
That was impossible to do.

453
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,640
Do I expect me to do this?

454
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,560
More bitchy.

455
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Oh, my shot landed on the target!

456
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,079
My student.

457
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
Beam. Beam. Beam.

458
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,600
Do not hold gun and dance at the same time.

459
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,000
Try again.

460
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,359
Make it a combo.

461
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,039
And don't forget your ass.

462
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,720
How's it, Tan?

463
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,359
Let's look at the evaluation for today's training

464
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,479
according to Nemesis' standard.

465
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,039
Nut.

466
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,680
Your combat power is 1.8 out of 10.

467
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,239
I got just 1.8?

468
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
This is the most accurate system.

469
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:21,840
It sure is. You're the one who wrote the damn program.

470
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,159
Next up is Beam.

471
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,520
Your combat power is 1.5 out of 10.

472
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,359
Wait. I got lesser than Nut.

473
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,239
You're right.

474
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,119
You shame me!

475
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:46,039
But the score of your battle style and gesture

476
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:46,920
increased a lot.

477
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,600
Of course.

478
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,680
Next up is M.

479
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,520
Your combat power is 3.4 out of 10.

480
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,520
3.4?

481
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,560
This is what I called a professional training.

482
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,960
You have to consider the widsom of the student.

483
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:09,359
Who gave me Beam to train?

484
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Trust me, even Reborn can't help
him get higher score than this.

485
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,600
You picked him yourself.

486
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,199
Okay,

487
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,439
that's enough for today.

488
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,680
Let's go home and rest up.

489
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:27,800
Go away, you low score brats.

490
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,159
Stop talking, M.

491
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,439
Professional. Professional.

492
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:45,479
How shameful.

493
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:52,640
Hey.

494
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,279
So no one is going to talk about

495
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,239
my student having a higher score

496
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,479
than both yours combined?

497
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Brag bitch.

498
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,119
Tan, access the server.

499
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,760
Take a look at Intenso's score.

500
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,359
Sure.

501
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,640
Intenso.

502
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,920
Titled as the Reaper. Specialized
in using kunais and knives.

503
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Combat power 9.7 out of 10.

504
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,359
What?

505
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,319
Titled as the Reaper?

506
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,039
That's so cool. I want a title too.

507
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:37,960
Chill.

508
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:41,880
9.7 out of 10. That's amazing.

509
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,439
Tan, access the combat power of Beauty Queen Anna Kondra.

510
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,159
Anna Kondra.

511
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,680
Titled as Venomous Snake.

512
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,039
Combat power higher than the system can evaluate.

513
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,479
The system sucks.

514
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,439
And also faker than a cheap nose job surgery.

515
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,279
What about P' Sven?

516
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,439
Sven.

517
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,920
God Hand guild hasn't titled Sven.

518
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,800
Combat power is...

519
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,079
That's enough, Tan. I don't want to be compared with others.

520
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,439
Sven, are you shy?

521
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,840
I should leave now, there's a project to submit tomorrow.

522
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
Bye.

523
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,119
You're coming with me.

524
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:49,920
Is it?

525
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,359
Yes.

526
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,760
Good bye.

527
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,680
Bye bye.

528
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,079
See you guys later.

529
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,560
Hey, little brat.

530
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,800
You go train by yourself some more.

531
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,439
Next time we meet, you're getting above 5.

532
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,479
Yes, instructor.

533
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:12,199
I'm taking one of these.

534
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,479
Go.

535
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,199
He seems like he can be a good killer.

536
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,560
That's my classmate.

537
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,520
Doesn't mean he can't kill anyone.

538
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:34,039
What about Nut, Sven? How's he?

539
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:37,960
He was fine.

540
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,279
Stop putting interest on others.

541
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,319
You're the worst of all.

542
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,640
You keep complaining but

543
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,560
what we did today can't even be called training.

544
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,600
Well, I apologize. When it comes to teaching I'm the worst.

545
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,119
Even though, I'm best at killing.

546
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,359
Then why did you pair us up for this training?

547
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,279
I thought it'd be fun.

548
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,520
You know, doing group activities.

549
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,960
It could heal you from what you've been suffering inside.

550
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,039
I'm going inside.

551
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,880
That's impressive.

552
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,359
Saying things like that.

553
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,000
So unlike you, Anna.

554
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,319
Me?

555
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,479
I bet he's crying up there.

556
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,479
Because of me?

557
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,600
Can a cry-baby like him lead us in the future?

558
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,640
Trust me. This boy will change the whole Mafia society.

559
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,600
Sven.

560
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,680
Thank you.

561
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,159
I can't believe a wicked person like you

562
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,600
can cook.

563
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,199
Don't insult me.

564
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,039
When I was training in Italy
I had to slice living wolves to eat for weeks.

565
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,399
No wonder, your mouth is so foul.

566
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:40,840
The wolves are still in there.

567
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,399
Sven, when you trained in Japan,

568
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:45,920
don't you need to slice the fish and eat them?

569
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,319
I was in the city and there are restaurants.

570
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:50,399
Oh.

571
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,279
Only idiots would train in the forest.

572
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:59,399
But didn't you train in the forest, Anna?

573
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,359
What do you mean?

574
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,239
Your name, Anna Kondra.

575
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:06,760
Didn't it come from Anacondra living in Amazon Rainforest?

576
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,439
My first name is Anna. Last name Kondra.

577
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,560
Memorize it in your brain.

578
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,239
But you do snatch so well like a snake.

579
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,359
Sven, I have a meeting today in order to
finish the group project.

580
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:21,399
Okay.

581
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:24,119
And breakfast is so delicious today.

582
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,279
Didn't expect Intenso to be such a great chef.

583
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,359
Of course, Beam.

584
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,920
Don't compare me to some Red Chicken.

585
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,439
Tell you one thing:

586
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,920
That Red Chicken can never cook actual food.

587
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:46,520
But your food stinks. It's like I'm living
in Sven's car all of a sudden.

588
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:51,960
You said it stinks but you ate all of them, Anna.

589
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:57,720
Admit it. It's delicious. It's tasty.

590
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:00,479
You want some more?

591
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,399
No.

592
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,359
It's very fun staying together like this.

593
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,479
I totally forgot. Why are we here?

594
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,239
You selfie-stick-brain! We're here to work on our project.

595
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,800
Oh, is it?

596
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,760
O, are you going to work or what?

597
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,039
Huh?

598
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:30,279
Did you just speak to me?

599
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:34,560
Hey.

600
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,880
And now this freak.

601
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,920
Will the project be done in time?

602
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,880
Baifern.

603
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:57,479
Two groups working together is kind of fun.

604
00:43:57,479 --> 00:44:00,039
Yes, since we all know each other.

605
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,319
I think it's just your group that will be working.

606
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:05,079
Look at mine.

607
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,319
A bunch of idiots.

608
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,039
You have to learn to be the one to start the work, M.

609
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,560
Everyone, behind me!

610
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,920
So which one of you is Beam?

611
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,279
I am Beam.

612
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,319
Beam, run.

613
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:11,319
Our mission is to lure Anna Kondra out and kill her.

614
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,479
Do you want to have lunch together?

615
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:24,159
Shall we go for sushi?

616
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,319
Sure

617
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,439
Why don't you take some action?

618
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,239
She's a star.

619
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,960
It's only normal if someone asks her out.

620
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,039
There's something I want to ask.

621
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,159
It's that...

622
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,479
I want to ask Beam out.

623
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:46,720
Ask Beam out?

624
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,239
Yes.

625
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,479
You like Beam?

626
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:53,479
Kinda...

627
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,520
Well..

628
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,880
I'm not that close to Beam.

629
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,159
Please.

630
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,560
Hey.

631
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,119
No need to be sad.

632
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:13,600
Can't you help me for once?

633
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:16,840
How am I going to help you?

634
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,079
Can I at least get his LINE contact?

635
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,119
His LINE contact?

636
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:25,119
You're a girl. Beam will surely give you.

637
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,600
Please.

638
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,079
Wait up.

639
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,920
I could try.

640
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,680
But no promise on the result.

641
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,800
Okay.

642
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,399
You're cute.

643
00:46:44,399 --> 00:46:45,880
Let's go get lunch.

644
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,600
Okay.

645
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,159
Don't stare at him like that.

646
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,560
He'll know.

647
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,880
Oh, smile, huh?

648
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:58,600
You want a piece of me?
