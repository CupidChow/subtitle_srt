1
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,480
Are you seriously going to take Beam to the meeting?

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,920
We're already at this point.

3
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:18,280
Everyone knows about Beam already!

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,519
This is beyond madness!

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,960
Beam is not ready to become the
head of a crime organization!

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,519
Then who is?

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,480
West?

8
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,079
Why are you crying out here, freak?

9
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:30,079
Your boyfriend found out that you're retarded?

10
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,760
It's Romeo. His first kiss got stolen by someone else.

11
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:40,119
Do you know how important first kiss is?

12
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,320
Hey, first kiss is important but

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,079
losing tear to a novel is kind of non-sense.

14
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,400
It's my tear so it's my own business.

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,480
Go back where you came from.

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,880
What I'm trying to say is

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,920
you should save your tear for your own love story

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,239
not for others'.

19
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,440
Any even though Romeo's first kiss got stolen,

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,239
it doesn't mean that he wouldn't end up

21
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,679
with Juliet in the end.

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,960
What?

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,039
Juliet?

24
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,480
Who the heck is Juliet?

25
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,719
Romeo and Juliet.

26
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,360
But the novel that I've been reading,

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,199
Romeo must end up with Prince Escalus.

28
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,480
Prince Escalus?

29
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,039
Who the hell?

30
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,519
Well, maybe they can end up together.

31
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,079
Guess I'll have to leave now. See you later.

32
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,400
Damn, who's Escalus?

33
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,360
Sven.

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,400
Isn't this too much?

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,039
You're right.

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,519
Hey, Beam.

37
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,480
(Scream)

38
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you want me to shoot her in the head?

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
Are you crazy?

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,239
She's my friend.

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,039
Apology, Mother.

42
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,480
Master, not Mother!

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,559
Hey!

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,119
Get the hell out of our way

45
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,480
or I'm killing you all right now!

46
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,760
Freaking KILLING YOU ALL!!!

47
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,800
Master,

48
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,199
someone's heading this way.

49
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,199
Do you want me to neutralize her?

50
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,199
Who's coming?

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,760
Beam.

52
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,679
Girl, get away!

53
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,800
She's my friend. My friend.

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,159
Your friend?

55
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,599
Beam, let's take selfie together.

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,519
She seems suspicious.

57
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,280
It's our Master's order.

58
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,719
We must take selfie.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
Why are you serious all of a sudden?

60
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,400
Everyone, let's take selfie.

61
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,840
1 2 3.

62
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,039
- Can we do a boomerang?
- Of course.

63
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:29,880
See ya.

64
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,119
See you.

65
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,599
Hell!!!

66
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,039
Sven...

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,239
I'm so embarrassed.

69
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,320
Sir?

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,199
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,800
I meant get the hell out of here!

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,599
This is their last job.

73
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,960
Where are you going next, Sven?

74
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,199
I'm gonna stay around here.

75
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,000
You go to class.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,639
Thank you.

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,400
All my friends are gone.

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,719
It's...

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,000
We've been dating for a couple of months now, Nut.

80
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,639
How can I not know?

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,239
The reason why I don't do those things is
because I respect you, Namwhan.

82
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:58,760
Is it, Nut? Or are you having feelings for someone else.

83
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,960
Why did you say that?

84
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,599
Let me ask you something, Nut.

85
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,760
We've been dating for 3 months and never kiss a single time.

86
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,599
Are we really going to have sex within this year?

87
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:18,559
Nut.

88
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,519
Namwhan. It's...

89
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,840
It's just...

90
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
It's...

91
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,440
I feel like I've been trying all alone all these times.

92
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,239
Is it just me who's trying?

93
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,599
Namwhan.

94
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,719
I......

95
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,639
You don't have to say anything.

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,119
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,440
It's fine.

98
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,079
P' Sven, you took Beam here?

99
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,079
Yes.

100
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:18,519
But why are you here?

101
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,719
I couldn't find the restroom.

102
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,679
Let me take you there.

103
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,280
Okay.

104
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,639
This way, bro.

105
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,840
And then Baifern drifted the car professionally.

106
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,239
Like in the Fast and Furious!

107
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:49,840
But did Baifern take a selfie while drifting?

108
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,440
Err.. No?

109
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,920
If you didn't take a photo,
that moment's gone for the rest of our lives.

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,960
You can't rewind the time and watch it.

111
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,039
You're a freak.

112
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,880
Beam, last time you went to help the kidnapped students.

113
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,559
This time, you skipped the class to drift car.

114
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,719
Don't tell me that you're...

115
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,159
No! I'm definitely not a Mafia.

116
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,439
I didn't say anything about a Mafia.

117
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,680
I was going to say that

118
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,560
you're a superhero!

119
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,159
- Yes, my friend is a superhero.
- Right? Superhero.

120
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,399
- Superhero friend!
- So cool.

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,439
Beam must definitely be a superhero.

122
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,600
But Baifern,

123
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,520
why'd you go out with these guys? They're scary.

124
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,039
I was walking around and heard
that they're going to skip class.

125
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,399
I've always wanted to skip class.

126
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,279
Is that all?

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,039
Really?

128
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,199
Baifern.

129
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,600
If your grade drops then don't blame me.

130
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,520
You can buy me snacks as an apology.

131
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,239
Wait. What's going on here?

132
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,000
Tan. Has anyone told you that

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,840
you're completely useless?

134
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:19,000
There's nothing to be found. What do you expect me to do?

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Able to hack into every bank
in every country within 5 minutes

136
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,359
but can't find me any information on that Bunny.

137
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,439
How is this possible?

138
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
What about you, Anna?

139
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:35,680
You've been through many battlefields.

140
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,199
Have you not seen or heard anything

141
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:39,920
about this lady at all?

142
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,960
Not even once. I've never been ordered
to kill anyone from Mockingbird.

143
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,880
All I know is their leader is Ron and his daughter is Sonya.

144
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,840
Bunny.

145
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,239
Who the hell are you?

146
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:06,880
Feel free to ask me anything.

147
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,520
Understood everything?

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,520
Are you confused?

149
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,079
No? Sure.

150
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,439
Beam.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,560
I've decided.

152
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,840
Regarding?

153
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm going to be a member of your gang.

154
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,560
Since when did I open for register?

155
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,960
Trust me. You need me. I can protect you.

156
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:41,439
Beam doesn't need you, M.

157
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,960
The hell makes you said that?

158
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,079
There.

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,039
What!?

160
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,640
How can he bring a weapon here?

161
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,479
Where are all the securities?

162
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,960
Where is my safety!?

163
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,680
I'm having a headache.

164
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,800
Excuse me, Beam. Am I that boring?

165
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,399
No, Miss.

166
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Whose parent is that?

167
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:21,079
My cousin.

168
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,399
He's kind of hot.

169
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,800
Alright, everyone.

170
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,880
The reason why I asked you all to be here is because

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,119
we have to form the best strategy

172
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:41,479
regarding what to do in the Annual Mafia Meeting.

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,479
What are you two doing here?

174
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:49,760
Huh?

175
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,840
Well, I think Beam needs his own forces and

176
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,279
not just keep relying on the senior Mafia.

177
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,359
That's why I'm here to become one.

178
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,479
I love this beautifully-formed friendship
that you guys have.

179
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:08,359
It's something I expect the next leader would have.

180
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:12,479
It reminds me of myself and this machine gun.

181
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm glad the two of you are here.

182
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,359
So glad, right?

183
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,079
Then,

184
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,159
let's train you to become a real Mafia.

185
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,239
let's train you to become a real Mafia.

186
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,119
Shall we?

187
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:26,960
Okay...

188
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,479
Let's go now!

189
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,359
Here, try this.

190
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,079
Align the front sight with the rear sight.

191
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,159
Develop your sight picture.

192
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,239
Fix the gun on the target.

193
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,279
Load the gun.

194
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,159
Then fire at the target.

195
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,239
Try to aim for the head.

196
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,239
Let's begin.

197
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,319
To be honest,

198
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,720
I didn't even get what you said.

199
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,439
Watch and learn.

200
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:15,600
Let me demonstrate.

201
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,199
I think you missed the target, Anna.

202
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:37,479
This type of shot is used after you caught
your boyfriend cheated on you.

203
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,039
Take a good look.

204
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,920
Why don't we wait until you actually have a boyfriend

205
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,960
before you teach them how to shoot penises.

206
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,479
Sven, do you want to be the target as well?

207
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,399
Try.

208
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,199
I'll try my best.

209
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,079
Damn, you missed it all.

210
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,399
Beam!

211
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,199
Back off.

212
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
M.

213
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,239
Your turn to try.

214
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,840
Yes, my beautiful sister.

215
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,000
You're correct.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Go.

217
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,000
Your future looks brighter than someone around here.

218
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,199
Ha.

219
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,399
There's no need to emphasize on my mistake.

220
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,800
Beam, I wasn't talking about you.

221
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,600
I was talking about...

222
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,199
Sven.

223
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:05,119
Huh?

224
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:10,039
Come on. Let's try.

225
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:13,399
Wait, me?

226
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,079
Yes, you. Come on.

227
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,239
Hurry, Sven. The boys are waiting.

228
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,119
Do you want me to hold your sword in the meantime?

229
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,319
No need.

230
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,279
Children, wait and see.

231
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,159
How's our special show?

232
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,680
Where'd the bullet go?

233
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,439
I think it ended up around there.

234
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,199
Nah, you missed. It's there.

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,680
Even though Sven is Master's personal bodyguard,

236
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,960
his skill in using ranged weapon is equal to 0.

237
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,520
Now, everyone.

238
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,600
We've finished the shooting class.

239
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,960
Now it's time for melee weapons.

240
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:51,239
Wait up, teacher. Let's start from the basics.

241
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,159
If you teach, it's going to be too hard.

242
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,439
Thanks.

243
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,960
Who would like to begin?

244
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,560
Beam.

245
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,319
Come here.

246
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:21,399
Touch me with the sheath.

247
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:24,159
If you success, then you win.

248
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:27,520
Anna, this is too...

249
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Shut!

250
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,880
Do not interrupt me when I'm teaching.

251
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,039
Sure.

252
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,720
But if I win, you'll become my bodyguard at
the college instead from Sven.

253
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,920
It's a promise.

254
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,159
Beam.

255
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,399
Only this time that you can't lose.

256
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,960
Just a touch, huh?

257
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,279
I thought you said melee-weapon class.

258
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:27,439
Lesson number 1: There's no rule in the battlefield.

259
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,880
Oh.

260
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,239
I completely get it now.

261
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,720
Hey!

262
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,479
Next one?

263
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,960
Huh?

264
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,279
Get back here!

265
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,439
Little brats.

266
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,359
How are you?

267
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,600
You've been pale for a while.

268
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:10,479
Bunny, I felt so wrong about Beam.

269
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,279
You should be.

270
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,039
He gladly came to help you without hesitation.

271
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,000
Beam must definitely think the worst of me now.

272
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,239
If you feel sorry then go apologize him
at the Mafia meeting.

273
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,960
He's going to be there.

274
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,960
That's right.

275
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,359
Thank you, Bunny.

276
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

277
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,880
All honorable Mafia members are welcome

278
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,119
to the Annual Mafia Meeting tonight.

279
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,479
I wish everyone a happy Mafia evening tonight.

280
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:12,479
Enjoy the party.

281
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,039
Anna.

282
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,520
Are you sure this outfit is the best for me?

283
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,880
I feel so insecure wearing this.

284
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,680
I picked the best for you. Trust me.

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,399
Wait up, Nut.

286
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,880
Yes, P' Sven.

287
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,039
Thank you.

288
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,880
Everyone, remember what we planned?

289
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,800
Go and perform your missions.

290
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Roger that.

291
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,640
Sven, as soon as you enter the party.
Walk to the Bacon Eater gang.

292
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,840
And get as much information as possible.

293
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,720
This gang definitely has intels that we need.

294
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,600
Hey, Smokey. There's spaghetti on that table.

295
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,880
Mr. Bacon, sir.

296
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,520
Huh?

297
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,720
Do you want me to steal those spaghetti home?

298
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,800
Get load of them and don't let anyone notice you.

299
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,399
M and Nut.

300
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:30,319
Use your innocent faces

301
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,560
to get information from the Raccoon Gang.

302
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,159
This gang surely knows something about Master's death.

303
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,079
I belive she's the leader of Raccoon Gang.

304
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,239
Beam.

305
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,039
You're the only one who can speak to Sonya.

306
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,159
Get intel from her and see

307
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:53,920
if her father was behind

308
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,399
Master's incident.

309
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,359
And most importantly,

310
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,479
find me the secret of the lady name Bunny.

311
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,319
Beam.

312
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,680
You can do it.

313
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,800
Just walk to her and start talking.

314
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,520
It's going to be easy. Easy.

315
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,119
Just walk and...

316
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,079
Damn.

317
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,800
Bunny, I haven't seen him.

318
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,720
Where'd he go?

319
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,520
Me and Tan

320
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,079
will go speak to Mr. West

321
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,600
- regarding the next step of our organization.
- My project wouldn't even start if it weren't for you.

322
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:36,880
My gang will do anything to support Nemesis.

323
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,680
Anything.

324
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,680
Anna. Tan.

325
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
How are you guys?

326
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Hello, everyone.

327
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Anna. Still alive, I see.

328
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,359
Tan.

329
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,079
You haven't been to the office, lately. Everything's fine?

330
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,000
It's...

331
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,359
I have to apologize, Mr. West.

332
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,119
It's the food-poisioning.

333
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,319
Can't leave to toilet.

334
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,039
Hello, beautiful lady.

335
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,720
Well, hello, young ones.

336
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:40,199
This is the first time I've seen Mafia looking this young.

337
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,880
You're too sweet.

338
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,239
I'm all blush now.

339
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,840
How can I forget to introduce myself?

340
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,560
My name is M and this is

341
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,760
my right hand man, named

342
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,279
Nutty.

343
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,199
Yes. Name's Nutty.

344
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:06,520
We're Mafia newbies.

345
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:10,560
By the way, what's your name?

346
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,720
My name is Universe.

347
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,920
But people call me

348
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:29,600
Miss Universe!

349
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Wow. Wow.

350
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,319
This is superb.

351
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,880
Your name matches your beauty.

352
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,840
Wow.

353
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,199
I've got a good taste looking at ladies.

354
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,279
But...

355
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,920
which gang are you from?

356
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,359
We're from Neme...

357
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,880
From Namo-Sisters.

358
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,840
Oh.

359
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,000
A merit-making Mafia.

360
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,239
First time I've ever heard of this.

361
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,359
It's the new line.

362
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,640
We belive there should be merit-making Mafia in this nation.

363
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:24,279
Bravo.

364
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,199
Brilliance. Perfect idea.

365
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,800
From what I see,

366
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,960
if your gang and my gang work together,

367
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,399
our alliance will reach

368
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:45,680
the goal that no one's ever reached.

369
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,119
Completely agree

370
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,399
that our gangs should work together.

371
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,640
Speaking of alliance,

372
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,720
do you know anything about Nemesis' leader incident?

373
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:16,439
We can't speak of this topic in the public.

374
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:23,079
If you are curious about this then

375
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,439
we need to speak in private.

376
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,199
That's great.

377
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:32,439
Shall three of us go to the private zone?

378
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,039
Oh, no. No.

379
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
Three aren't considered private.

380
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,760
It's called Threeso...

381
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,439
Ignore me.

382
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,560
But if you

383
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,199
leave your right hand man here.

384
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,680
I promise that

385
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,920
I'll tell you everything I know about Mr. Rachen's incident.

386
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,840
Well, you can go find something to drink.

387
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:03,720
Boss'll be back soon.

388
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,520
Now, go.

389
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:07,479
Yes, boss.

390
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,159
Follow me.

391
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,680
After you.

392
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,000
Are you sure this is safe?

393
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,720
Don't pussy-out now.

394
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,520
I've always wanted to be a Mafia my whole life.

395
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,319
This is nothing.

396
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,000
Go get something to drink, you right hand man.

397
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,359
Hello.

398
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,199
Excuse us.

399
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,960
Please.

400
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,800
Mr. West.

401
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,600
Any news on Master's incident?

402
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
No. Not a single clue.

403
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
How's Beam?

404
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,119
Yes.

405
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:18,000
Enjoy changing diapers?

406
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,880
More entertaining than coloring hair root.

407
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,000
Do you need to do that everyday?

408
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,680
Hey! Hey! Hey!

409
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,000
Stop it, both of you!

410
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,199
This is so annoying!

411
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,840
Mr. West.

412
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,239
What should our next step be?

413
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:42,239
I've been hacking into every database

414
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,680
but found nothing.

415
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,000
It's like we keep running around in circle.

416
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,439
We can't rush things now.

417
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:54,720
If we aren't careful, we might step into the enemies' trap.

418
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,399
I see it differently.

419
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:02,640
I believe this is the time when you must step
in and become the new leader.

420
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,800
Our members are in need of morale during these hard time.

421
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,880
The throne is free.

422
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,079
I'm not as strong as I used to be.

423
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,039
Besides, the person who deserves the throne is

424
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,720
Master's son, Beam. Not me.

425
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,720
If the boy is not dead before the time.

426
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
How's Beam holding up so far?

427
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,119
He's been through a lot lately.

428
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,439
He needs time.

429
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,439
Hey, Tan.

430
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:40,039
Still staying at the same place?

431
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,239
Well,

432
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,720
I kept moving around.

433
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,439
What's up?

434
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:54,439
Nothing. Just asking.

435
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,600
Welcome.

436
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,079
Wow.

437
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,119
Your room is beautifully decorated.

438
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,239
This is the V.I.P. room.

439
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,000
Let's come and sit on the bed.

440
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,680
I promise I'll tell you everything I know

441
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,880
about Nemesis' leader's death.

442
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,119
Can I

443
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,880
use the restroom?

444
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,239
Please.

445
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,760
Greeting, Mr. Ron.

446
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,000
Hello, Gasolina.

447
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,479
I heard about your Windmill drugs. How's it performing?

448
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,159
I'm not surprised knowing you

449
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,159
having ears everywhere.

450
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,600
But if I remeber correctly,

451
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,039
Nemesis did not allow you to manufacture them anymore.

452
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:28,239
Gasolina. Don't you think that you're an allied of Nemesis

453
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,680
and I have to be afraid of you.

454
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:35,319
I was just asking.

455
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,760
There's no need to show negative expression toward me.

456
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,039
Good.

457
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,760
Because I don't want to have problem with your gang.

458
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,199
If your Windmill drugs are safe,
there wouldn't be any problem.

459
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,640
I wouldn't have any problem, myself.

460
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,960
But from what I heard,

461
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,279
many of the people who took your drugs

462
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,479
died.

463
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,399
What do you mean?

464
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,760
Many of the people who took the drugs died?

465
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:18,159
You heard it correctly, girl.

466
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,520
How dare you, Gasolina!

467
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:25,560
You should know best not to perform any violence
in the Mafia meeting.

468
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,079
Don't risk it.

469
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,560
If you keep on doing this,

470
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,319
don't say I didn't warn you.

471
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,159
Dad, explain to me!

472
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,880
Sonya.

473
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,359
This is none of your business.

474
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,000
Bunny.

475
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,920
Muncho.

476
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:10,760
Sir.

477
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,199
What's our next move?

478
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,039
Halt the process of manufacturing Windmills.

479
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:16,920
Yes, sir.

480
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,600
James.

481
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,560
Order more guards to the factory.

482
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,920
Affirmative, sir.

483
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,359
M.

484
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,199
Yes?

485
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:46,600
Are you ready to listen to the story?

486
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
The hell.

487
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,119
I told you this story is

488
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,960
extremely long

489
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,119
and big in size.

490
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,680
If you're ready then I'm so ready.

491
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,119
I can not wait much longer.

492
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,600
Take a seat here.

493
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,159
Are you not into girls?

494
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,720
I'm into girls.

495
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,800
You're into girls?

496
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,359
Where are you going?

497
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,800
Release me!

498
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,920
Where do you think you're going?

499
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,800
You like it rough?

500
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,760
Ooh, adorable.

501
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,760
You want this?

502
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Yes.

503
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:13,439
Take it. Take it all.

504
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,079
Come on. Come on to Mama. Come on. Come on to Mama.

505
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,199
I'm still a virgin.

506
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,359
A virgin?

507
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Even better.

508
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,279
God damn.

509
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,159
I've faced a hellish monster!

510
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,920
And you're facing these angels?

511
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,720
If I don't get one and you shouldn't get one!

512
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,880
I went to speak with Mr. West.

513
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,000
But I didn't get anything.

514
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,359
And it seems like Mr. West is hiding something from me.

515
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,319
How are you and Sonya?

516
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:58,800
I...

517
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,039
I'm afraid to go talk to her so...

518
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,199
What?

519
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,880
It's been half an hour and you didn't do anything!

520
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,880
Useless.

521
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,439
Sven.

522
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,039
Got anything from the Bacon Eater gang?

523
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:20,399
You know, I'm not good at socializing.

524
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:23,760
So I just stood there for half an hour.

525
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,079
Just stood there for thirty minutes?

526
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,520
Isn't that so weird and awkward?

527
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,359
Damn, Sven.

528
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,199
Nut.

529
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,520
Let's hope I get some good news from the Raccoon gang.

530
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,880
Speak up.

531
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,239
Well, M went to speak to Raccoon leader

532
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,960
regarding the incident of Beam's father.

533
00:37:57,439 --> 00:38:02,359
Oh my. M's future looks so bright as a Mafia.

534
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,439
What the hell happened?

535
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,600
That Miss Universe lady, wanted to defile me!

536
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:21,119
She pulled my pants but I made a great escape.
My pants are still with her.

537
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,479
Every Mafia knows that

538
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:31,840
this Miss Universe

539
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,359
loves to defile children.

540
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:35,800
What!!?

541
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,039
And let me tell you one thing, this lady

542
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:42,239
isn't even from Raccoon gang!

543
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,560
The four of you are comepletely and utterly useless.

544
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,960
This is why female should be the head of the family.

545
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,439
Take a look at me, for instance.

546
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:06,720
Should we go?

547
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,359
Greetings, everyone.

548
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,359
Hello, and you are...

549
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,000
Mr. Jay.

550
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,319
The leader of Big Head gang.

551
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,960
The god father of human trafficking.

552
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,039
There's no need to make those expression.

553
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,119
We're in the Annual Mafia Meeting.

554
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,119
Enjoy yourselves.

555
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,239
You kidnapped students!

556
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,600
Little boy.

557
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,520
This is the Mafia meeting. Not temple.

558
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,720
Take a look around.

559
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:03,439
Look at the Mockingbirds.

560
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:07,680
They spread their drugs and killed thousands.

561
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,840
While Gasolina gang

562
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,119
illegally produced gasoline.

563
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,680
Oh, not to mention our lovely Nemesis.

564
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:20,840
Violet.

565
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,119
You're scaring these children.

566
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,520
What do you want from us?

567
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,800
I would like to make an apology.

568
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,520
I was just doing my business.

569
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,079
Didn't think my trafficking business would one day relate

570
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,319
to the friends of Rachen's son.

571
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,119
Let's leave, Mr. Jay.

572
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,439
So sorry.

573
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:11,439
And now is the time for the guild to announce

574
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:16,920
the Mafia with the highest combat power of this year.

575
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:21,960
And the person with the highest combat power

576
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,199
in the Mafia society this year is

577
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,600
is...

578
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,600
is.....

579
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,079
Anna Kondra from Nemesis Gang.

580
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:47,039
Ever since she became Mafia,

581
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,720
no one else has ever won this title.

582
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,720
What a legendary human being.

583
00:41:57,399 --> 00:42:02,039
I hope you all enjoyed our Annual Mafia meeting.

584
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,239
Before we leave I would like you all to listen

585
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:08,199
to the song from the band

586
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,239
that God Hand chose to perform tonight.

587
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Special thanks to all the guests

588
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,760
for attending the meeting.

589
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,279
I hope we can meet again next year.

590
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:24,039
Stay safe, everyone.

591
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:25,239
Have a wonderful night.

592
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,479
Sonya.

593
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,600
Sonya.

594
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,840
Sonya!

595
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,880
Why did you drag me out here?

596
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:28,239
I haven't got a chance to apologize you, Beam.

597
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:31,199
I don't understand you at all.

598
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,119
Whether you're lying to me

599
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,439
or helping me.

600
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,840
And now you're apologizing me.

601
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:38,399
What do you want from me?

602
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:43,720
I want to explain everything.

603
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,399
It started when my old man

604
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:50,279
started developing the new kind of drug.

605
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,119
I couldn't stop him from doing those things.

606
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,920
That's why I came to trick you

607
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
by sending people to hurt you

608
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
and pretended to come and save you.

609
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,880
Oh.

610
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:11,000
But if that's the story then

611
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,000
you could've come and ask me directly.

612
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,159
There's no need for you to trick me at all.

613
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,000
That's true.

614
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,039
But instead, I decided to trick you into
making a blood contract with me.

615
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,880
It's all my fault.

616
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,960
The contract that said we're going to get married?

617
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,359
I was going to use the contract

618
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,840
to order you to stop my old man.

619
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,359
And what's next?

620
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:47,000
The day I texted you,

621
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,039
I thought you'd bring some strong people with you

622
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,920
from Nemesis, like Anna Kondra

623
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,399
or Intenso.

624
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,840
I didn't expect you to come with your college friends.

625
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:04,920
So I ruined all your plan.

626
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,880
However, I was so shocked that day.

627
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:17,800
I was afraid I dragged you into a dangerous situation.

628
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,119
I never thought you'd be this innocent

629
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:23,520
even though you're the son of Nemesis' leader.

630
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,600
I just know recently that my dad's a Mafia.

631
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,520
By the way,

632
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,760
who's the lady with the bunny ears?

633
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,680
Who's she?

634
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:46,439
You mean Bunny?

635
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,439
How am I going to explain this?

636
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,199
Is she your bodyguard?

637
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:57,520
Do you believe in miracle?

638
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:06,079
It happened when I was just a little girl.

639
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,159
I didn't even know what the world is like.

640
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,640
All I know is my parents were always working.

641
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,359
Leaving me alone for all those years.

642
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:18,760
I grew up feeling lonely.

643
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,399
Almost like a bird in the cage

644
00:47:21,399 --> 00:47:24,760
of the person I called father.

645
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,520
And that night. The night with the full moon on the sky.

646
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,840
The night that the moonlight shined
brighter than it had ever shined.

647
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:54,279
I prayed to the moon that

648
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,119
I wish to have one friend

649
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,279
whom I can love. Whom I can trust.

650
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:02,279
The friend who'd never leave me no matter what.

651
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:07,600
The friend I can speak to no matter what the topic is.

652
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,439
So Bunny came from the moon, then?

653
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,239
I don't know.

654
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,840
But those years that I've grown,

655
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,119
Bunny hadn't aged a bit.

656
00:48:34,399 --> 00:48:35,760
Sonya.

657
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:38,279
Are you messing with me again?

658
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,640
Everything that I said today is the truth.

659
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,399
And don't worry about the blood contract

660
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:47,960
regarding our marriage.

661
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,880
I'll burn it.

662
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,279
But if you burn it then

663
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,239
what about your plan?

664
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,680
My father already stopped the manufacturing
of Windmill drugs.

665
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,680
Gasolina gang, an alliance of Nemesis,

666
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,439
came to stop him.

667
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:07,279
Really?

668
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:09,680
I'm happy for you.

669
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,279
But even if the blood contract is gone.

670
00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:16,600
Try not to be at ease.

671
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,720
Why's that?

672
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,479
Because I'm going to make you fall in love with me

673
00:49:23,479 --> 00:49:26,279
and ask me to be your wife.

674
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:36,960
Sonya.

675
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,560
Yes, I've already fallen for your innocence, Beam.

676
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:09,800
The Mafia meeting has passed peacefully.

677
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,159
Peacefully?

678
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,800
Guess it's just me who passed unvirginly.

679
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,560
Come on, man. At least you're safe.

680
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,199
So how's it, Beam?

681
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:27,479
Any news on Bunny from Sonya?

682
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:31,359
Even if I tell you, you wouldn't believe me.

683
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,640
Just spit it out already, sucker.

684
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,399
Everyone, stay still.

685
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,079
Someone broke into our house when we weren't here.

686
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,279
His uniform looks like

687
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,560
the people who shoot my father.

688
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,439
M. Nut.

689
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:25,920
You guys are staying here tonight.

690
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,279
It's too dangerous to go back right now.

691
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:28,800
Follow the plan.

692
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,039
you go kill the man named Sven.

693
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:32,359
Beam, get in the car.

694
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:33,720
And for Rachen's son.

695
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,840
Kill them all.
