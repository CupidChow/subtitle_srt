1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,760
We're in an emergency situation.

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,880
Master was killed for unknown reason.

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,190
the only person you can trust is me.

4
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,110
Finally, The Master of Nemesis is dead.

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,360
James.

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Grab me some fine whiskey.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,550
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,590
Listen up, everyone.

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,480
Since that son of a bitch

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,360
is dead,

11
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,030
it is now the time for our

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,280
Mockingbird Family to spread it's wing.

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,280
Thank you, James.

14
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,800
Muncho.

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,110
Resume the manufacturing process of Windmill drugs.

16
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,510
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,000
Nothing can satisfy me better than

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,320
hearing this good news!

19
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Bunny, what am I supposed to do?

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,190
My dad resumed those crazy drugs plan again.

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,550
There's nothing we can do since
it's out of our control.

22
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,760
But I can't just sit here doing nothing like this.

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,920
I need to do something.

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,840
Sonya.

25
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,920
You, alone, cannot win against your father.

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,000
Then I will find someone who can.

27
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,480
The person who can win against him

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,000
won't listen to your request.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,550
I just thought of something.

30
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,880
(Scream)

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,150
The hell's that sound?

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,630
Beam.

33
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,360
Follow him.

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Wait for me.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,920
Hey!

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,880
Are you okay?

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,110
I...

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,630
I.......

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,960
I have a period so I was running to buy sanitary napkins.

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,920
But I guess I rushed too hard so I fell.

41
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,510
Oh.

42
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,630
Next time, try to be more careful.

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,280
Sure.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,400
Thanks to you.

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
My friend.

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,510
You are such a gentleman.

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
But it'd be better if

48
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,480
you follow her

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,670
and help her choose the brand of the napkin.

50
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,000
M, you pervert!

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
I was just helping her out. What's your problem?

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
Are you mad at me?

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,150
You know what,

54
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,110
the teacher won't come.

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,070
Come back here, M.

56
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,510
Come.

57
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,550
Get in there.

58
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,230
Half hour late means absence.

59
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,550
She'll come. Get in.

60
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,670
Do you think he's okay?

61
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,670
Hey.

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,590
Take it easy.

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,550
He just lost his beloved dad.

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,480
But he freaked out at every single thing.

65
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,710
Plus, we all know that girls scream all the time.

66
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,070
There's no need to go out and look.

67
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,510
That's also true.

68
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,280
But don't you forget that

69
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,070
his father didn't pass away in ordinary circumstance.

70
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,360
You're right.

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,550
Go sit down.

72
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,710
Hey.

73
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,230
My treat tonight.

74
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,000
Treat me too, my boy.

75
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,920
Who?

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,800
Me.

77
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,590
I meant who is going to treat you.

78
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,110
Huh?

79
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,070
I'm treating Beam.

80
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,510
What?

81
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,670
Beam!

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
What's the rush?

83
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,480
Why are you guys here?

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you feeling better now?

85
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm really fine.

86
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,880
You guys are the ones who're overthinking.

87
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,440
Are you sure you don't want us to sleep over at your place
for tonight?

88
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,590
We can really stay with you at these times, Beam.

89
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,150
No. No. No. Don't. Please don't.

90
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,070
I'm really fine.

91
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
Trust me.

92
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,880
I'll just go now.

93
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,550
That was fast.

94
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,590
The hell is he goin'?

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,280
That man.

96
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,190
Huh, who?

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,880
It's fine.

98
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,110
Anna is waiting at home.

99
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,280
She said there's something urgent that needed discussing.

100
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,510
Then let's hurry.

101
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,840
I don't want to hear her curse at me.

102
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,480
Gotta hurry or Anna's killing me.

103
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,030
Why are you guys here so earl...

104
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,800
I mean....

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,550
Why are you so LATE?

106
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,800
I've been waiting for ages!

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,840
See? I'm waiting

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,710
for ages.

109
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,550
Whatever,

110
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,320
let's start.

111
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,800
Remember what I said last night?

112
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,000
That I suspect Mr. West.

113
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,360
Yes, I remember.

114
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,710
According to my genius brain,

115
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,710
Mr. West must be longing for power.

116
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,960
Thus, he wanted to own the throne.

117
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,670
Which leads to killing Master.

118
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,070
Beam, could you hand me the wine?

119
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,150
The glass. Can't you see?

120
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,710
Don't you dare touch right there!
It'll ruin the temperature.

121
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,550
Don't be stupid.

122
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,400
What a fine wine.

123
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,550
It's god blessed that I brought
it from the last meeting trip at Italy.

124
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,360
One more gulp is a must.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,670
So satisfying and encouraging me to work harder.

126
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,710
Now!

127
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,590
Put it back.

128
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,280
At the glass rod.

129
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,280
You never learn.

130
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,070
Let's continue our discussion.

131
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,920
Mr. West has two main henchmen.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
First one, Intenso.

133
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,840
A mercenary who got the titled of

134
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,680
The Reaper of Mafia society.

135
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,800
Second one, Tan.

136
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,640
The best programmer in Mafia society.

137
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,430
And he could hack into United State's central bank

138
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,000
since 17 years old.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,390
Wow.

140
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm 19 and I still don't know how to use Microsoft Word.

141
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,470
Neither do I.

142
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,560
Neither do I...

143
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,640
but

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I know a hundred ways to use a computer to kill someone.

145
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,520
Now.

146
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,350
Time to do our mission.

147
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,350
Please.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,560
The mission is waiting for you.

149
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,190
After you.

150
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,760
Sure.

151
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,000
Wait!

152
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,000
Release me first.

153
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
Release me.

154
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,190
Hurry.

155
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,920
Wait.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
So what's for dinner?

157
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,720
Chicken?

158
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,310
Cow?

159
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,150
Cup noodle?

160
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,310
Cup noodle.

161
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,190
It's cup noodle for dinner!

162
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,230
Is this the guy

163
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,430
who hacked into United State's central bank?

164
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,430
He looks so immature.

165
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,310
Hey.

166
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,920
Don't judge the person from their looks.

167
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,000
Take me, for instance. I look so hot on the outside.

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,070
But my insides are so sweet and innocent.

169
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,000
WHAT?!

170
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,560
You might wonder where you are

171
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,070
and what happened.

172
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,110
But I assure that you'll be safe

173
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,390
as long as you cooperate.

174
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,150
Alright.

175
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,960
Alright.

176
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
I will cooperate.

177
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,070
Now the first question.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,960
What is your boss planning?

179
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,560
Tell me or you're dead meat.

180
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,150
Hey!

181
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,470
Oh no!

182
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,150
No!

183
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,960
Take it easy!

184
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,840
Nooo!! (in girly voice)

185
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,310
Tell me or I'll shoot you.

186
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,520
Oh.

187
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
I'll shoot your most beloved organ.

188
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,760
I still don't know what you're talking about.

189
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,470
Are we really gonna do this?

190
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,110
Fine.

191
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,190
Say goodbye to this world.

192
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,600
Please, Anna. Please.

193
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,560
I really don't know what you're talking about.

194
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,880
Who?

195
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,390
Who's Anna?

196
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,390
You're the only one who speaks like this in Mafia society.

197
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,800
Is it you?

198
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,110
Tell me what Mr. West is planning!

199
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,760
What are you doing, Anna?

200
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,190
I thought we're on the same side.

201
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,760
Or you're

202
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,000
betraying the organization!

203
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,310
It's your boss who's betraying!

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,390
Tell me what is his plan?

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Three.

206
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:09,960
Two.

207
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,190
One.

208
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,000
- Okay. Okay.
- Answer me.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,680
I just thought of something.

210
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,070
Something strange happened.

211
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,800
Couple of days ago, Mr. West asked Intenso to meet.

212
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,430
And gave him classified files.

213
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,110
But that's all I know.

214
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,920
I don't have any more details.

215
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,760
Sure?

216
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,190
I swear I'd never betray the organization!

217
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,800
Intenso, huh?

218
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,110
If it required Intenso, then

219
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,030
it must be something important.

220
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,600
But you already swear

221
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,230
that you'd never betray the organization!

222
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes, I swear, Anna.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,800
Huh?

224
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,960
I swear!

225
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,190
What will do you if Mr. West betrayed Master?

226
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,350
Mr. West would never.

227
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,470
Even if it's real

228
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,110
and it's Mr. West who raised me.

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,150
I'd never support him.

230
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,840
If you're loyal to our organization then

231
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,190
monitor Mr. West's actions

232
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,350
and report directly to me

233
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,430
secretly.

234
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,800
Because I feel like Mr. West

235
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,310
is involved in Master's incident.

236
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,880
But...

237
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
Shut up!

238
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,190
Do what I asked.

239
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,720
Or I'll shoot your lovely biscuit. Get it?

240
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,000
Alright. Alright.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,560
Okay.

242
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,640
Are we finished, Anna?

243
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,520
Anna.

244
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,270
Are you not gonna untie me?

245
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,470
Sven!

246
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,230
Anna!

247
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,110
Thank you, little Master.

248
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,030
It's fine. Call me Beam.

249
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,430
I'd never betray our organization.

250
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,760
You can trust me.

251
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:28,880
Yes.

252
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,600
I understand.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,800
Sven!

254
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,230
Anna!

255
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,880
Wait for me!

256
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,920
What the hell is she up to this time!

257
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,030
Damn!

258
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,070
From what I saw in the report,

259
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,230
the night before Mr. Rachen's incident.

260
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,880
Mr. Rachen went to pick up his son in front of Epic Pub,

261
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
which the Big Head group owns.

262
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,600
But we haven't concluded

263
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,310
that Big Head is behind Mr. Rachen's death.

264
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,390
Yes, sir.

265
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,520
I'd like to send Lieutenant Yuth
to gather information there.

266
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,800
But sir,

267
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,560
shouldn't we at least inform Mr. Non from S.L.A.P. first?

268
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,600
No.

269
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,000
I got this covered.

270
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,560
When are we gonna finish this?

271
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,230
Everything is still in the schedule.

272
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,760
Don't act like a hot-headed teenager.

273
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,760
Old man.

274
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,270
Anna.

275
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Weren't you too harsh on him?

276
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,390
Harsh? I was at my kindest mode.

277
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,760
That guy, Tan. He doesn't look like he knows anything.

278
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,600
Hey.

279
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,640
I did what I needed to do.

280
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,760
Now it's your turn to do what you needed to do.

281
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,350
And what should I be doing?

282
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,720
200 times of sit-ups. No break.

283
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,720
Why do you need to force me?

284
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
Because your mind is still weak like a baby bitch.

285
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,430
A strong mind requires a strong body.

286
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,230
Go push-up outside.

287
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,070
Sven.

288
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,920
Can't you at least help me?

289
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,190
Sure.

290
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,230
I'll go help you count each rep for you.

291
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,560
Come.

292
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,310
Go.

293
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,470
Always pointing the gun.

294
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,600
Damn tired.

295
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,640
I can't belive I have to face these stuffs.

296
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,470
Anna always has her reasons.

297
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,920
8

298
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,800
9

299
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,150
She kept saying she's the world finest hitwoman.

300
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,680
I seriously doubt that.

301
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,190
Anna is really good.

302
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,560
You mean, good at ordering people?

303
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,520
Just do the sit-ups. 15.

304
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
16

305
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,960
I can't do this anymore.

306
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,520
Hey!

307
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,000
If you take a break over 3 seconds,

308
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,110
I will start from 1.

309
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,110
Do it.

310
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,920
Sven, I thought we were friends.

311
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Do it.

312
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,270
Thought you'd help.

313
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,840
If you keep talking you won't catch your breath.

314
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,230
Don't even stare into my eyes.

315
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,470
I won't go easy on you.

316
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,760
Wait.

317
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,190
I forgot to count.

318
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,470
What?

319
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,190
I told you not to talk. Now let's start over.

320
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,350
That was painful.

321
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,960
Thank you.

322
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,720
Anna, you cooked?

323
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,600
Told you, I didn't know how to cook.

324
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,520
Then what's this?

325
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,960
Your next exercise.

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,350
Try to smell it.

327
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,430
So good.

328
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,520
Smells weird.

329
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,840
Try again.

330
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,310
Wow.

331
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,920
Sweet-scented, right?

332
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,640
I guess.

333
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,230
Do you want to know what it is?

334
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,030
Curious?

335
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,310
Are you ready?

336
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Are you really ready?

337
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Hello.

338
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,310
The penis of a cow.

339
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Doint. Doint.

340
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,000
Penis?

341
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,640
You've already made your body stronger.

342
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,470
Now it's your mind's turn.

343
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,840
Try it.

344
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,920
And I've got a special deal for you tonight.

345
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,190
I allow Sven to help you.

346
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,960
Wanna try it, Sven?

347
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,390
Sven, please help me.

348
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,800
S...Sure.

349
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,070
But I've got to take an immediate shower.

350
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,190
Sven.

351
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,350
Let's try it.

352
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,640
Here.

353
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,270
Let's try this one.

354
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,150
Can I go sit-up some more?

355
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,470
No need. This will make your mind stronger.

356
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,230
A man needs to be determined to his mission.

357
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,960
Put it in your mouth.

358
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,600
Beam,

359
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,110
if you want your mind to be stronger then

360
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,310
you have to try it!

361
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,800
Now.

362
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,470
Take a deep breath.

363
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,030
I'll feed you.

364
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,000
How's it? Pull it slowly.

365
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,600
Slower.

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,680
Can we quit this already?

367
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,560
Must try. Your mind will be stronger.

368
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,000
I assure you.

369
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,070
Eat it.

370
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,190
Swallow it.

371
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,030
Pull it out.

372
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,600
Bite.

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,310
Take it easy.

374
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,070
Shut your god damn mouth.

375
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,960
Yuck! Disgusting!

376
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,310
Take a deeper breath.

377
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,560
Swallow it up.

378
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,350
Bite and chew.

379
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,680
Then chew and bite.

380
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,680
I'll grab you some water.

381
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,190
Did the level of my mind just go up?

382
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,600
What the hell did Anna just force me to eat?

383
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,560
It still stinks.

384
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,070
It's Nut's mother.

385
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,230
What's going on?

386
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,430
Hello.

387
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,150
Beam, are you with Nut?

388
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,270
I'm not with him. What's going on?

389
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,880
I could not contact him.

390
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,470
Plus, the news said students were kidnapped.

391
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,960
I'm afraid Nut is one of them.

392
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,920
I'll try my best to contact him.

393
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,960
Can't believe that boy swallowed that "thing".

394
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,920
We were not talking about anything at all.

395
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,190
Nothing at all, right?

396
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,470
Yes.

397
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,760
Wait. Why are you down here at this time of night?

398
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,150
My friend went missing.

399
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,960
I've heard the news. Nothing to worry about.

400
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,920
Why is it not to worry about?

401
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,760
It's my friend!

402
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,000
They're still teenagers.

403
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,960
Maybe they went to do some night activities.

404
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,430
You wouldn't understand.

405
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,030
What are you talking about?

406
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,310
At your age, Sven also went missing during the night.

407
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,600
You can ask him. He went with the boys.

408
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm talking about my friend.

409
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,150
What I meant was your friends

410
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,270
might go out to do "something" with "someone"

411
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,960
and didn't tell their parents.

412
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,520
But the news said 8 of them are missing!

413
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,520
Maybe I misunderstood.

414
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,390
Eight of them grouped up to do something.

415
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,390
Gosh! Kids these days, Sven.

416
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,640
So you're not going to help me, Anna?

417
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,000
Beam.

418
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,190
This is nothing for me to concern.

419
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,840
Also not related to our organization.

420
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,920
Therefore, I won't step in.

421
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,520
But this is...

422
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,430
Sven.

423
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,960
Don't you step in as well.

424
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,760
Because it doesn't concern us.

425
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,150
Sure.

426
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,270
What am I supposed to do?

427
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,920
What you're supposed to do

428
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,000
is go to bed.

429
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
(Sigh)

430
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,840
Hey.

431
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,000
Are you not being too mean to him?

432
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,840
Sven.

433
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,800
We're not babysitting the boy.

434
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,070
(Evil Bitch)

435
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,350
(Sigh)

436
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,520
Hello, Tan. Do you know anything about

437
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,880
the kidnapped students?

438
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,000
Should you not apologize first?

439
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Huh!? What? I can't hear you.

440
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,230
The signal is weak.

441
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,150
Hurry. Signal sucks!

442
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,350
I've heard the news.

443
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,350
But this doesn't involve Mr. West in anyway.

444
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,960
Really?

445
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,720
You're useless now.

446
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,350
Bye, Tan.

447
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,880
So long.

448
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,470
Hey!

449
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,110
How can she be such an arrogant and self-centered person?

450
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,720
You put on a meanie mouth but helped him in the end.

451
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,110
Hey, Sven.

452
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,800
You rarely speak. But when you do, the damage is critical.

453
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,150
Hey.

454
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,110
Nut is one of the students who got kidnapped.

455
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,560
His mom called me already.

456
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,230
Any others?

457
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,470
My friend, O, is also missing.

458
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,960
Don't tell me, they secretly read books

459
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,640
without telling us.

460
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Freak. If you're not helping then zip your mouth.

461
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,110
Who did you just call freak?

462
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,030
Look at the situation.

463
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,920
Stop fighting. We should be more worried about
the missing friends.

464
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,720
Don't know if they're safe.

465
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,760
But the polices know about this.

466
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,680
Things will turn out fine.

467
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,520
The polices work like a turtle.

468
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,310
I think Nut must have already lost his virginity.

469
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,190
Then what should we do?

470
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,880
We're just students.

471
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,560
We're not superheroes.

472
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,110
But... why do you think Nut has already lost his virginity?

473
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,720
Take a look at the missing people.

474
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,520
Nut.

475
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,920
O.

476
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,070
Don't you agree?

477
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,390
But the other missing students were girls.

478
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,070
Another girl named Khem is also missing.

479
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,150
Freak, stop contradicting me!

480
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,600
I wasn't contradicting.

481
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,560
Should we go find them?

482
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,600
I agreed with Baifern.

483
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,030
I'd love to go adventuring for a long time.

484
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,960
Adventuring, I mean.

485
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,230
This world is not as fantasy as the novel you read.

486
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,720
Baifern.

487
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,720
I know you're worried about friends.

488
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,190
But taking action like this,

489
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,520
also risks us getting kidnapped as well.

490
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,920
You have a point, Beam.

491
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,270
We can't help at all.

492
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,070
Let's go to class.

493
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,310
Maybe, there'll be a superhero who saves our friends.

494
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,430
Superhero!

495
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,310
Eww.

496
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,640
Superhero!

497
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,150
Let's go, Beam.

498
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,960
Superhero flies high and saves the world.

499
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,230
Sven.

500
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,000
I ordered Tan to do some research regarding the kidnapping.

501
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,720
How's it?

502
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,110
After Master's incident,

503
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,070
Big Head gang resumed their human trafficking business.

504
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,390
They kidnap good-looking teenagers,

505
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,960
export and sell them to other countries.

506
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,960
I thought you said this is none of our concern.

507
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,720
Sven, this is definitely our concern.

508
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,960
You're telling me that...

509
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,030
You're correct, sweetheart.

510
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,760
The marketing strategy consists of the 4Ps.

511
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,350
So what are the 4Ps?

512
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,640
First is the product.

513
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,310
Service is also included.

514
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,030
The second one, price.

515
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,230
When we decided the price of the product

516
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,310
we must take a look at the consumers' demand.

517
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,070
The third P is place.

518
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,230
I'm not talking about your ex's house.

519
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,430
Sven, I'm studying. I'll call you back.

520
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,310
This is Queen Anna speaking!

521
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,270
Pack your stuff and come down.

522
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,310
We're going on a field trip.

523
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,150
M.

524
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,720
I'll leave now.

525
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,030
Miss.

526
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,070
Can I go to the restroom?

527
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,110
Go ahead.

528
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,840
You have to take your bag to the restroom?!

529
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,310
Let's continue, students.

530
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,270
Wake me again and see what will happen, Beam.

531
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,150
What will happen?!

532
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,840
Studying hard will happen, Miss.

533
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,430
Good job.

534
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,000
Where'd he go, Miss?

535
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,840
Do I look like a GPS?

536
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,030
Not really.

537
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,230
I have a sore throat.

538
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,390
Anyone got candy?

539
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,680
Sven.

540
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,720
The seats are so uncomfortable and the car stinks.

541
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,640
Where did all your money go?

542
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Next time, I'll let you try my car.

543
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,030
Comfy and scented. Fresh.

544
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,270
I'm here.

545
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,800
What?!

546
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,960
Why do you look so weak and vulnerable?

547
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,000
Are you ready for the field trip?

548
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,800
Where are we field tripping to?

549
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,470
Get in the car.

550
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,840
Get in the car.

551
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,840
Open the door for me.

552
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,640
Hurry!

553
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,840
So uncomfortable

554
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,030
and broken A/C.

555
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,270
Oh hell!

556
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,150
She's so scary. I'm leaving.

557
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,430
Let us in.

558
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,430
An-Anna.

559
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,880
Anna Kondra.

560
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,270
The Venomous Snake of Mafia society.

561
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,390
Welcome. Welcome.

562
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,390
Becareful, Miss Anna.

563
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,560
Wait.

564
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,560
What's a Condom?

565
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,030
Kondra, my last name.

566
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,470
Say it correctly.

567
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,430
Oh.

568
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,760
First name Anna. Last name Kondra.

569
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,070
Together, it's Anna Kondra.

570
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,560
Be quiet.

571
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,520
We're in the enemies' territory.

572
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,030
One more question.

573
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,350
What's the Venomous Snake of Mafia society?

574
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,920
If you won't shut up then go walk with Sven!

575
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,030
Who'd you bring?

576
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,110
Oh guys.

577
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,070
I can't believe the famous Anna Kondra
comes and visits us.

578
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,680
Any business here?

579
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,430
I was just taking the boys for a walk.

580
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,110
Isn't this Rachen's son?

581
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,190
I can't belive the rumor is true.

582
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,270
Do you guys know anything about the kidnapped students?

583
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,760
Please!

584
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,920
Release my friends.

585
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,230
Did you say please?

586
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,150
Cut it and say it again.

587
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,270
Can you release my friends?

588
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,000
Why are you asking him?

589
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,110
Did I tell you to ask him?

590
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Order him.

591
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,760
Huh?

592
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,150
Order.

593
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,070
Order him

594
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,430
or face punishment when we get home.

595
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,430
Release my friends

596
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,840
or you'll regret later in the name of hero.

597
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,960
What the hell is the second sentence for?

598
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,430
What?

599
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,110
Please, I'm already scared.

600
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,600
Anna Kondra with the bounty of 10 million.

601
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,760
Plus, Rachen's son.

602
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,230
Boss.

603
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:05,430
I've heard rumor that she killed 20 people in seconds.

604
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,720
How can you believe in those nonsense rumor!

605
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,230
Those rumors are all made up.

606
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,270
Just to make people afraid of her.

607
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,720
Today!

608
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,030
Huh, you have problem?

609
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,230
Today!

610
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,310
We'll show the world that

611
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,680
the rumors are fake!

612
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,000
I won't waste my time fighting trash like you.

613
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,350
Anna, what's going on?

614
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,840
Or are you afraid?

615
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,640
I'm not afraid.

616
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,350
But the person you'll be fighting is

617
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,350
my pupil, Beam.

618
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,920
And my personal driver, Sven.

619
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,270
A driver as well?

620
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,190
Since when did I become your driver?

621
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,430
I have to fight?

622
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,720
Go ahead.

623
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,310
Catch them alive.

624
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,350
Go.

625
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,840
Hey!!

626
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,640
Can't you fall somewhere else?

627
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,470
Are you really not helping?

628
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,560
Fight, Beam.

629
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,230
Don't disappoint me.

630
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,270
Understand?

631
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,760
Get out there and fight.

632
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,470
I still have chest pain due to yesterday's sit-ups.

633
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,070
Go and fight.

634
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,600
Get the hell there!

635
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,560
Go.

636
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,720
Don't waste my shopping time.

637
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,000
Go.

638
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,150
Hold him tight!

639
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,880
This bag is definitely going to the cart.

640
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,600
You don't get to live, crazy boy!

641
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,390
You.

642
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,840
A group of you versus a single student, and you use gun?

643
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,640
And you still need more training.

644
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,310
Get up.

645
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,960
Sven, can you take this little prince

646
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
to help the kidnapped students there?

647
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,470
I have something to talk to those idiots.

648
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,190
Come.

649
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:44,920
Sven,

650
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,070
can you help me?

651
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,270
Leave!

652
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,680
Sven.

653
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,720
How are you holding up?

654
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,000
Are you okay?

655
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,800
I have pain all over my body.

656
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,190
Endure it.

657
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,720
Did we win?

658
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,430
Everyone!

659
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,190
Take a step back, Beam.

660
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,110
O!

661
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,840
It's all fine. I'm here.

662
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,600
Why you, Beam?

663
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,520
I'll go help someone else now.

664
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,230
Wait. You're Beam, the second year student.

665
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,920
Thank you so much, Beam.

666
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,070
I was so afraid I have to become a prostitute
in other countries.

667
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,470
Let's go.

668
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,600
Why are you, of all people, come here and save us?

669
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,520
My cousins, they have some connection.

670
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,840
How many policemen did you bring

671
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,960
to be able to come save us?

672
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,030
Sven, my cousin, defeated all the bad guys by himself.

673
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,880
Let's hurry up and go.

674
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,840
Anna.

675
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,110
We're also Mafia like you.

676
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,230
Surely you must understand what we did.

677
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,190
Oh, I understand.

678
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,760
And I hope you understand what I'm about to do.

679
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,560
Can you tell me now?

680
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,030
Anna, I seriously don't know.

681
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,470
Prepare to die.

682
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,520
Please, Anna.

683
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,070
There are a lot of students here.

684
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,680
Oh, you're right.

685
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,600
This is a fake gun, kids.

686
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,960
No need to be scared anymore.

687
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,390
There will be ambulances and polices here. So don't worry.

688
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,030
We'll leave first.

689
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,150
Let's go.

690
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,600
Nut, I'll tell everything later.

691
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,470
Beam.

692
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,560
Beam!

693
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,110
Do I have to release them?

694
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,520
Beam!

695
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,840
Run!

696
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,070
Wait.

697
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,110
Why do we have to hurry?

698
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,470
Don't we need to make sure they're safe?

699
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,230
Do you want to police to catch us?

700
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,520
We're not heroes.

701
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,230
We're also terrorists.

702
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,230
Just get in the car!

703
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,520
Open the door for me!

704
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,800
Now!

705
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,190
Full accelerando, Mr. Driver.

706
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,640
I'm not your driver.

707
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,960
Mafia, is it?

708
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,840
Why do I feel more like a hero?

709
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,520
Did something happen to my boyfriend?

710
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,600
Look here?

711
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,600
Namwhan, easy. I'm still in one piece.

712
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,070
I'm still safe.

713
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,070
Hey, Namwhan.

714
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:15,880
Hi, Beam.

715
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
How are you, Nut?

716
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,310
I'm still a virgin.

717
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,390
What's with you?

718
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,680
I just wanted to say that I'm still a virgin.

719
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,430
So how'd you end up kidnapped?

720
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:40,920
I was buying snacks in front of the university.

721
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,390
Suddenly...

722
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,430
a group of people covered a bag over my head

723
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,520
and a moment later I was on the van.

724
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,110
Beam! Beam!

725
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,640
I heard you saved the kidnapped students.

726
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,760
The news are spreading.

727
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,960
I know.

728
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,520
So now you're famous.

729
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,600
I'll be near you all day.

730
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,350
So the girls can see me when they look at you.

731
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,030
What's wrong with you?

732
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,310
We're always together the whole day.

733
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,110
What's wrong with you now?

734
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,470
And since when are you here?

735
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,840
A long time.

736
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,190
How's the kidnapped boy?

737
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,880
Still a virgin.

738
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,600
Virginity saved.

739
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,600
Great.

740
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,600
Whatever.

741
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,150
Move, friend. We're sticking to each other today.

742
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,640
Like this. Don't go any further.

743
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,190
Perfetto.

744
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,350
Homework's done.

745
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,680
All done.

746
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,520
You said that everyday.

747
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,430
It's really done, guys.

748
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,270
Just so you wait.

749
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:58,000
Guys, the teacher said the afternoon class is cancelled.

750
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,600
What the hell?

751
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,800
This is the first time I'm prepared.

752
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,800
Beam.

753
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,110
Err....

754
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,000
O has something to say to you.

755
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:17,800
Sure.

756
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:26,470
I'd like to apologize to you about the shout at Epic pub.

757
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:30,150
And a deep condolence to the passing of your father.

758
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,840
It's fine.

759
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,350
I didn't hold any grudge.

760
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,390
And thank you

761
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:43,000
for saving my life.

762
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,190
Thank you.

763
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,960
All is fine. Don't overthink it.

764
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,720
Beam,

765
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,760
do you know that you are so awesome that

766
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:03,110
the whole university just called you a hero.

767
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,070
It wasn't me.

768
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,960
It was my cousin who saved everyone.

769
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,430
If there's someone who deserves to be called hero,

770
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,270
then my cousins are the ones.

771
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,430
But you had a part in it.

772
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,760
Don't you forget.

773
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,310
Thank you, Baifern.

774
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,310
thank you so much for my friends as well.

775
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,840
You're welcome.

776
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,560
I'll leave now. Bye.

777
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,430
Bye bye.

778
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,350
Don't tell me that...

779
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,150
Stop perving, M.

780
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,390
I was just kidding.

781
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,800
Let's go home.

782
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,350
Totally forgot that the class was cancelled.

783
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,520
And I haven't told Sven yet.

784
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,390
Guess I'll just walk home.

785
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,600
Stop it, you gangsters!

786
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,760
I need you to look up the information on Mockingbird.

787
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,520
Especially the girl named Sonya.

788
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,110
There're only two people who can access
this information which are

789
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,270
Master and Mr. West.

790
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,000
Excuse me. Is there something I can help you with?

791
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,190
Oh, an angel!

792
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,960
Next time, consult me before taking any action.

793
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,880
Where're you going, Mr. Police?
