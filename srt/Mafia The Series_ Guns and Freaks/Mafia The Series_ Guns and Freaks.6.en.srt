1
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,039
But from what I heard,

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,719
many of the people who took your drugs

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:16,840
died.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,159
How dare you, Gasolina!

5
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:20,119
If you keep on doing this,

6
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,599
don't say I didn't warn you.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,320
About the blood contract

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,199
regarding our marriage.

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,519
I'll burn it.

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,679
Yes, I've already fallen for your innocence, Beam.

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,400
Everyone, stay still.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,079
Someone entered our house when we're gone.

13
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,119
Huh?

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,320
What do you mean, someone entered our house?

15
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,800
Shhh... Be quiet.

16
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,360
I'll check the perimeter.

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Tan.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,559
Go search the house.

19
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,039
But why me? I'm also scared.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,280
If I go then who's gonna protect the children?

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,960
But I'm also a child and need protection.

22
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,159
Sure?

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,679
I was just kidding, Anna.

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,360
I mean, I'll go search the whole house.

25
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,559
Good boy.

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,639
And be quiet. Shhh...

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,360
Where are you going?

28
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,000
Helping him.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
Without your pants?

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I saw the culprit.

31
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,719
But I couldn't follow him.

32
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,719
This is bad, everyone.

33
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,000
The secret room was discovered.

34
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,719
I can't believe they invaded our house

35
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,480
when we were at the annual Mafia meeting.

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,679
This is too much. It's my house!

37
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,199
Calm down, Beam.

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,519
Did we lose anything, Tan?

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,639
I'm not sure. Master's computer is still here.

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,960
The weapons are also here.

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,760
Strange.

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,199
Should we go check my van?

43
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,639
I installed a surveillance camera system

44
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,599
in case of emergency.

45
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,119
What?

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,559
Do people really install surveillance
camera system on their car?

47
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:29,760
I'm also curious as well, P' Sven.

48
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,079
What a pervert. So disgusting.

49
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,000
Social Disaster!

50
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,880
I'm sorry, Tan. But this is way too much.

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,480
So are we going?

52
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,920
Sure.

53
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:53,679
But I only want to see the footage of the house.

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,840
Go.

55
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,519
Don't look.

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,119
Damn, I don't even have time to put a new pants on.

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,119
Why would a surveillance camera system on the car
makes me a pervert?

58
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,440
Alright, all the footages are here.

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Hey!

60
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,159
His uniform looks like
the people who shoot my father.

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,639
Yes, Beam. I also remembered.

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,679
M. Nut.

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
You guys are staying here tonight.

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,079
It's too dangerous to go back right now.

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Anna. They know we're here.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,519
Should we really stay here?

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,039
Nothing to worry since I'm here.

68
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,880
But I don't want you to risk your life for us.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,159
No one is risking at all.

70
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,840
Pervert!

71
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,400
Let's go.

72
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,119
You got other video clips?

73
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,400
What?

74
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,199
Other kind of video clips.

75
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,079
Where do you hide your pornos?

76
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,559
I really want to know

77
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,679
how are you holding up?

78
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,239
Nut!

79
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,519
What?

80
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,159
Can't you see Beam is stressing? Change the subject.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm kind of feeling better. Been adapting for a while.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,800
Can you really adapt to being the target of killers?

83
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,400
Nut! I told you to change the subject.

84
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,119
Ok let's talk about

85
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,159
Love.

86
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,960
Alright.

87
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,320
Is there anything to talk about love?

88
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,719
I'm talking about Baifern.

89
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,559
Why don't you ask her out already?

90
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,599
Yes.

91
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,519
I think Baifern likes you.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
What are you guys talking about?

93
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,119
Baifern likes me?

94
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,280
You're the leader of a Mafia gang.

95
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,360
And you're also handsome!

96
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,280
Yes.

97
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,199
And tall.

98
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,840
Yes.

99
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,880
And not to mention you have a big dick.

100
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,440
Well, my father is half European.

101
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,519
But since when did you see my penis?

102
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,079
It's when

103
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,719
you were peeing next to me.

104
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,679
And you looked at Beam's?

105
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,320
Not just Beam's.

106
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,679
Yours too, Nut.

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,440
M!

108
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,679
It was all for research purposes!

109
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,480
Comparing with mine.

110
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,440
And how is the comparation?

111
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,320
Shut up! Let's change the subject.

112
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,119
Oohh... small.

113
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, how's Namwhan?

114
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,199
She said being friend is the best solution.

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,079
Actually, I think she just wanted you to show some love.

116
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Can't you just do that for her?

117
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,800
If I were you,

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,760
I'll give her "love" all the time in every position.

119
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,760
Disgusting. Stop talking.

120
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,039
So all these time, you don't have feeling toward her?

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,199
I felt good.

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,640
But I don't think it's love.

123
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,079
Then who?

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Who what?

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,720
Who stole my friend's heart?

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,600
Who made you broke up without feeling regrets?

127
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,840
Who's that lucky someone?

128
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,760
No one!

129
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm not having any feeling toward any girl right now.

130
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,399
Up until now, we still don't know

131
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,439
who is behind Master's death.

132
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:14,239
Sven, don't you think it's weird?

133
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,960
It's been a while since Master's death.

134
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,279
But our organization still doesn't know

135
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,199
who's behind the incident.

136
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,760
And that police as well.

137
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,920
The villains planned this so well.

138
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,520
I hacked all the database on this planet,

139
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,359
but found nothing.

140
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
What are you gonna do next, Anna?

141
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,880
All I know is the police named Non found bullet

142
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,760
of the same type of Master's incident at Big Head's pub.

143
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,640
Don't you think it's way coincident?

144
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,199
I agree with you. What about West's side?

145
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,359
Any news?

146
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,600
I didn't contact him.

147
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,880
Sven, what if we can't find who killed Master?

148
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,439
What will you do?

149
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,359
I will keep protecting Beam like this.

150
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,279
And what if we found them and kill them already?

151
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,359
I don't know.

152
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,880
Maybe I'll keep protecting Beam like this.

153
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,800
What about you, Anna?

154
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,079
I lived my life on the battlefield.

155
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,319
But ever since I'm here

156
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,760
I felt the need to protect him.

157
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,880
I want to see him grow into a fine man.

158
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,399
This is my family.

159
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,079
I will not let anyone harm my family.

160
00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:00,319
The most dangerous hitwoman in the world

161
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,840
just formed a heart, huh?

162
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
I can't believe someone like Anna Kondra

163
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
would say something like this.

164
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,039
Neither do I.

165
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,520
Hey hey.

166
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,640
What's up?

167
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,800
Oh, does your Asparagus prince in the novel die yet?

168
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,359
His name is Prince Escalus.

169
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,840
Whatever.

170
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,640
Thank you so much for that other day.

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,199
What are you talking about?

172
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:47,279
The ending.

173
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,159
Romeo was in love with Prince Escalus at the end.

174
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Your freaking business.

175
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,800
And I made these cookies

176
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
as an appreciation gift.

177
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,520
Let me get it for you.

178
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,880
Oh?

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,319
Hey, Beam!

180
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,319
What's up?

181
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,239
Are you alright?

182
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,399
I'm fine. Sorry.

183
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,239
I stumbled upon some unknown object and hit you.

184
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:43,720
It's okay. I'm more worried about you.

185
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,720
I'm fine. Is your name M?

186
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,039
What? You know me?

187
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,680
What's your name?

188
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,760
My name is Fierce.

189
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,800
Nice to meet you, Fierce.

190
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,279
Me too.

191
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,720
I'm gonna go sit there.

192
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,960
Okay.

193
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
Watching porns!!?

194
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,000
No!

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,119
Why do you always make the worst of me?

196
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,239
What.

197
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,359
Hey, Anna. Wait.

198
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,359
What the heck?

199
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,600
Isn't there a better place to hide the gun, Anna?

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
Well, hello.

201
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,279
Greetings, sir Police. How may we assist you?

202
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm here to deliver the evidences.

203
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,439
So I would like to speak to Beam a little bit. Is he here?

204
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,680
He has to study today. You can speak to Ann...

205
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,760
Porsche, in the meantime. Name's Porsche.

206
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,439
Well then.

207
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,159
Go ahead.

208
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,800
Sure.

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay, go ahead.

210
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,840
All the evidences are here.

211
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:41,239
Everything is connected.

212
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,880
Has your S.L.A.P. unit

213
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
found the people behind Master's incident yet?

214
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,000
Master?

215
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,439
Master of who?

216
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,199
Oh, I was talking about Beam's father, Mr. Rachen.

217
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,920
He used to teach me about fashion and modeling.

218
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,479
The society called him Master of Fashion World.

219
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,079
Alright.

220
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,960
So.

221
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,880
This case is a very big case.

222
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,960
The police forces have to cooperate with S.L.A.P.

223
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,840
Plus, I just found the same
bullet type of Mr. Rachen's incident

224
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,359
at Big Head's pub, Epic.

225
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,079
So this is really about Mafia?

226
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,239
Porsche is so scared of Mafia.

227
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:39,279
For normal people, it's terrifying.

228
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,399
I completely understand.

229
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,159
But I suspect that Mr. Rachen had some connection

230
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,079
with the Mafias in some way.

231
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,359
And how do you know this?

232
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,279
Well, we received evidences.

233
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,800
Mr. Rachen and Mr. West,

234
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,760
the owner of Westland company, had met before.

235
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,880
And the government suspects that Mr. West

236
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,520
is the big guy in Mafia society.

237
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,680
I have to disagree. I know Mr. West.

238
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
He's a fine and honest businessman.

239
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,680
But we have evidence

240
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,239
regarding the meeting.

241
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:25,560
not to mention importing tons of gears of war.

242
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,319
And your conclusion?

243
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,600
They must have disagreed upon some matter.

244
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,279
And Mr. West lended the imported weapons to

245
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,600
the lower tier gang to kill Mr. Rachen.

246
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,840
You can't make these conclusion!

247
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
All the evidences are here. Check them yourself.

248
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
That's all for today.

249
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,039
I'll be leaving now.

250
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:52,680
Sure.

251
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,600
Good bye.

252
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,520
Byeee.

253
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,399
Anna.

254
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,199
Check them.

255
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,920
Mina, are you alright?

256
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,159
I'm fine.

257
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:26,319
I was taking selfies and saw you at the back.

258
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,399
You look so sad.

259
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,239
I'm fine, really.

260
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:35,880
Thank you for being concerned for me.

261
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,079
What's with the noisy voice?

262
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:50,399
Can't you see me sleeping?

263
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,840
I'm dreaming of

264
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,119
big chest girls.

265
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,199
I was already in the middle of...!

266
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,239
If you want to sleep then go home.

267
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,880
People come here to study.

268
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
You? Study?

269
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,800
Yes.

270
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,560
Study in your dream.

271
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,359
I always saw you reading Yaoi novels. Never study.

272
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,119
Right. You've finished the last novel, haven't you?

273
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,439
Then

274
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,720
go find a new one to read so that you're not free.

275
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,319
Or you can do the group project.

276
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:26,800
Might wanna hurry on that.

277
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,039
Now, where were me in the dream?

278
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,520
Don't you realize

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,560
that I'm still concious?

280
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,039
So I searched the information on

281
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,199
powerful organizations in our country.

282
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,279
Here's what I got.

283
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
Take a look.

284
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,319
What groups are there, Noon?

285
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:05,079
They said the most powerful is Mockingbird.

286
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:09,439
They're behind 75% of drug problems in our country.

287
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,479
Another powerful group is Big Head.

288
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
I can remember this second one because

289
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,319
I almost got kidnapped and sold.

290
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,439
It is rumored that the actual most powerful organization

291
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,359
is called Nemesis.

292
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,439
And what does this group do?

293
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
According to my research,

294
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,079
they sold weapons of war and were behind many massacres.

295
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:45,359
The most famous is the Massacre of Cry Town.

296
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,880
I remembered the news.

297
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,439
Because more than twenty people,

298
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,079
were killed in that incident.

299
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,960
And every witnesses said the same thing that

300
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,000
the killer is only one woman in red dress.

301
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,600
Lady in red?

302
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,000
Sounds familiar.

303
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:16,840
Beam.

304
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,960
Can I have a moment?

305
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,560
Where are we going?

306
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,600
The teacher's almost here.

307
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,199
Just a moment.

308
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Let's go.

309
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,680
We'll be right back.

310
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,199
Baifern, is everything alright?

311
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,399
It's me who should be asking you.

312
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm totally fine.

313
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,880
You're the worst liar.

314
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:59,399
I can see through your eyes.

315
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,479
Smile some more.

316
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
There are things in my mind.

317
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,560
But I can't tell it to anyone.

318
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,800
Regarding..

319
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,000
you're a Mafia?

320
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,800
Baifern.

321
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,840
Where do you get this?

322
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,079
We skipped class together that day. Have you forgotten?

323
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,159
Oh.

324
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,840
So you've known everything.

325
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,479
Actually,

326
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,079
I've just learned

327
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,279
that my dad's a Mafia

328
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,279
after

329
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,800
he's gone.

330
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,199
So

331
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,159
how are you feeling right now?

332
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,439
Confuse.

333
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,520
There are killers living with me at my house.

334
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,680
I don't even know if I'll be alive for the graduation.

335
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,760
I just missed the old days.

336
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,439
The days when

337
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,039
my dad's still here.

338
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,319
I just

339
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,640
miss him so much.

340
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,640
Sorry.

341
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,079
Never said these things to anyone.

342
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,680
It's okay.

343
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:57,840
You're very brave.

344
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,039
Fight.

345
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,479
Should we be entering private property like this?

346
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,680
If someone stops us then, just hit them, Bunny.

347
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,760
But there are only students here.

348
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,319
I think I see Beam.

349
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,159
That bitch again?

350
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,479
Last time, she also came with Beam to the Polo Club.

351
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,239
How dare she sit near my Husbando.

352
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,760
Bunny, slap her face.

353
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,000
This is not Mockingbird Mansion,

354
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,119
where you can do whatever you want.

355
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,920
There's no need to emphasize that.

356
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,640
Are you going to talk to him or not?

357
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,319
He's about to leave there.

358
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,319
Beam.

359
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,319
Sonya, what are you doing here?

360
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,880
I need to speak with you.

361
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,640
What is it about?

362
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,039
Sonya.

363
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,840
Sonya.

364
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,279
Get a hold of yourself.

365
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,920
Oh.

366
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,279
I've heard that Big Head

367
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,840
wants revenge for what you've done to one of their base.

368
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,640
Big Head again?

369
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,800
Yes.

370
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,880
In normal circumstance, I would go kill all of them myself.

371
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,199
How dare they messed with my husband-to-be!

372
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,520
But Sonya

373
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,720
got ripped of all her authority away.

374
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Bunny, you can't tell others about this.

375
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,880
And

376
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,640
do you know if they are coming here to the university?

377
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,840
They wouldn't dare exposing themselves coming here.

378
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,079
I'm relief.

379
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,000
At least my friends are safe.

380
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,479
You're always putting others before yourself, Beam.

381
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,239
That's what I feel.

382
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,199
Who's there!

383
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,399
This idiot stared at my chests.

384
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,479
Goh!

385
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,079
Hey, that's my friend.

386
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,039
Release him, Bunny. You dressed like this

387
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,920
and you blamed him for staring at your boobies?

388
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,000
You picked this outfit.

389
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,359
I'm s-s-s-sorry.

390
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,359
Then, we're off to class, Sonya.

391
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,319
Thank you for the warning about Big Head.

392
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,560
Thanks to Bunny as well.

393
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:24,399
You too, lady. Don't mess with someone else's property.

394
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,079
What's she talking about?

395
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,680
I have no idea.

396
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,520
To class then.

397
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
Poor Goh.

398
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,399
Follow the plan.

399
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,600
Boss.

400
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,800
If you send me to do this job

401
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
it would increase the chance of success.

402
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,239
Right now,

403
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,399
the polices are looking for you.

404
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,720
You have to hide for now, Violet.

405
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,840
Ryo.

406
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,680
Don't mess up.

407
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,079
You

408
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,720
just killed the polices.

409
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,840
Isn't it natural for the weak to be killed?

410
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,000
I never

411
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:34,239
ruin the name of Big Head.

412
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,439
Ryo,

413
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,199
you go kill the man named Sven.

414
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
And for Rachen's son, I want him alive.

415
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,680
But if there's no chance, just kill them all.

416
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,079
I've heard news that Mockingbird

417
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,199
stopped the production of Windmill drug.

418
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,439
Isn't it obvious?

419
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,239
The Empress of Death did speak to him personally.

420
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,560
That's considered a good news.

421
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,920
By the way,

422
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,960
I'm more curious.

423
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,159
When will Mr. West sit on the throne of Nemesis?

424
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:26,319
Listen.

425
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,239
These things are more complicated than we thought.

426
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,920
I don't want "them" to think that

427
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
I wanted to own the organization.

428
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,600
But if you sit on the throne of Nemesis,

429
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:41,920
we will definitely enter the new stage of Mafia society.

430
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,800
There's no new stage of Mafia society.

431
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,000
Who ever sits on the throne,

432
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,680
people will always live the same.

433
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,960
Don't you agree with me,

434
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,079
Gasolina?

435
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:57,359
I think our objective right now

436
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,319
is not when Mr. West will own the throne

437
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,119
but to help each other

438
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:08,039
find the one behind Rachen's death.

439
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,319
Because it matters to all of us, alliance forces.

440
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,439
Correct.

441
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,279
I don't want to step up and become the leader

442
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,199
until I find out who killed Master.

443
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,720
Since we're all in agreement.

444
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:28,920
I'll be leaving.

445
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,359
And you can use this place as you like.

446
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,520
But

447
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,359
be careful.

448
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,079
The dogs are vicious around here.

449
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,359
Apology, Sven.

450
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,159
I was doing the group project, so I'm late.

451
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,119
Fine.

452
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,359
No need to rush.

453
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,079
And.. I drank lots of water.

454
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,399
Might need to pee on the way back.

455
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,319
You can pee at the gas station.

456
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,119
Let's go.

457
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,239
Yes.

458
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,319
I'll be right back. Can't hold anymore.

459
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,680
Is that Batman?

460
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,920
Beam, get in the car.

461
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,159
Get in the car!

462
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,239
Sven!!

463
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,880
What the hell!

464
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,399
Start the engine, Beam.

465
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,119
I don't know how to drive!

466
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,520
Dad never taught me.

467
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,119
Sorry about this.

468
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,479
Ouch!

469
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,279
Hey!

470
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,039
What happened!?

471
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,640
Don't tell me that

472
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,000
you took Beam to an

473
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:44,520
erotic massage?

474
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,479
What?

475
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,600
Hell no!

476
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,920
I was followed by an assassin

477
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,800
who uses Samurai sword.

478
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,159
Ryo.

479
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,039
Who's he?

480
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,960
An elite assassin.

481
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,439
Even the Yakuzas in Japan are afraid of him.

482
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:20,279
And this guy is coming to kill me?

483
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,760
Let' go get you fixed up, Sven.

484
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,680
Can you stand?

485
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,640
So you guys lost?

486
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:47,880
You're not wrong saying that.

487
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,359
If we measured their sword skill,

488
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:54,279
Sven would never lose.

489
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,279
What are you trying to say, Anna?

490
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,960
I mean, the reason why Sven lost is because

491
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,680
he needed to protect you.

492
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:16,239
If he fought without the need to protect you,
he'd never lose.

493
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,600
So

494
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,800
the reason Sven lost

495
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,000
was because of me, wasn't it?

496
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,520
Anna,

497
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,720
you can't say that.

498
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,640
No,

499
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
everything Anna said is correct.

500
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,479
I'll take my leave.

501
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,600
Anna,

502
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,800
you're too harsh.

503
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:00,079
It's the truth that he needed to accept.

504
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,880
Beam.

505
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,239
Everyone was trying their best for you.

506
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,319
Don't pull them down.

507
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,119
If something happened to Sven,

508
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,119
what would you do?

509
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,279
Mr. West asked to meet me at the office.

510
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,640
I'll be leaving now.

511
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:26,000
Sven, I'll go wait at the car.

512
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,520
Is there anything?

513
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,239
It's just

514
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,800
after what happened last night

515
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,399
you should already know

516
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,720
how dangerous our journey is.

517
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,680
And you're implying?

518
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,920
If you die then

519
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,119
you'll never get a chance to tell her.

520
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,239
I'm talking about Rose.

521
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,319
Wait.

522
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,880
How do you know about this?

523
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,439
Well, even though you're Master's bodyguard,

524
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,439
I'd still have to trace your history anyway.

525
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,800
Leave without saying farewell.

526
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,880
How hurtful.

527
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,800
Oh no.

528
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,960
Are the brownies ready?

529
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,880
Here. Here.

530
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,720
Coffee's ready.

531
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,159
Thank you.

532
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,000
Enjoy.

533
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,840
Sven.

534
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,560
What are you doing here?

535
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,720
Where have you been?

536
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,920
I'm sorry.

537
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,720
Sorry?

538
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:19,000
Is that all you can say?

539
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,079
Just sorry?

540
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,680
I've been blaming myself all these years.

541
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,600
What have I done wrong that

542
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,520
made you left me?

543
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,039
It's not your fault, Rose.

544
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:46,920
And had you ever told me anything?

545
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,560
For years, I've been looking for you.

546
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,760
Going to all the places that you might be in.

547
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,479
Asking everyone that you might contact.

548
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,800
I could not find you anywhere.

549
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,680
Do you know how hurtful it was

550
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:23,279
to not know if our love ones

551
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,880
are alive or not?

552
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,880
Rose.

553
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,039
Don't you forget that I'm just a woman

554
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,119
who has a heart.

555
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,479
Can you tell me where have you been these three years?

556
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,319
Or if I've done anything wrong?

557
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,520
The reason why you left me.

558
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:14,319
I really can't say.

559
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,199
I apologize, Rose.

560
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,880
Do you know how much I miss you, Sven?

561
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,640
I've been missing you

562
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:35,239
all these times as well, Rose.

563
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,960
It doesn't matter how long

564
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,039
or how far I've stepped.

565
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,159
I don't understand why it's just you, Sven,

566
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,640
who never leaves my mind.

567
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,800
Rose.

568
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,319
Is there anything?

569
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,039
Just an old friend coming to say hi.

570
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,800
An old friend?

571
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,720
But I'll be back inside soon.

572
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,640
Hi, there.

573
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,960
Rose, take a good care of yourself.

574
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,880
Thank you for everything.

575
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,800
Do you know what I'm capable of?

576
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,840
Why can’t people just mind their own business, nowadays?

577
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,640
We should send a warning letter to Big Head gang

578
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,520
before all the other gangs get crossed in the crossfire.

579
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,800
If that’s what we come up then,

580
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,279
I volunteer to take care of this.

581
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,720
Now is the time for us to help crush Nemesis.

582
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,680
Are you really going to the enemy’s base?

583
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,640
That’s extremely dangerous.

584
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,199
Sounds fun to me.
