1
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,679
What the hell are you saying?

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,599
How can dozens of you

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,480
lose to a single woman?

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,760
So the snake has come out.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,159
Never thought I'd had to fight together
with a member of Mockingbird.

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,480
Alright.

7
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,559
Alright, I know.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,039
Let's go, then.

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,800
Stop complaining. I'm saving your ass.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,440
Saving my ass, how?

11
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,559
Hey!

12
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,800
You killed a lot of my friends, snake.

13
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:37,360
Drop your gun if you still want to live.

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,079
I should know better

15
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,320
that no one in the Mafia society can beat you.

16
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:46,679
Since you know that, then leave.

17
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm giving you a chance to live.

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,239
Anna Kondra, the Venomous Snake of Mafia society.

19
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,960
Drop your weapons,

20
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,199
if you don't want your car to be shot at.

21
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,840
Wait, Anna.

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,719
What's with that expression?

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,440
I can't fight.

24
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,920
Your life ends here,

25
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,039
you fifthy bunny.

26
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,559
A true gentleman would never hurt a lady!

27
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,280
Don't mess with a real killer,

28
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,719
idiotic child.

29
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,800
Your turn now, sexy.

30
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,199
I've been patient for a while.

31
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,119
But the reason why I won't be is
because you called Miss Bunny

32
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,079
a fifthy bunny.

33
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,639
M.

34
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,400
Are you still alive?

35
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,439
Oh.

36
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,319
What is going on now?

37
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:34,800
Never thought this day would come.

38
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
Krit.

39
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,159
You were supposed to be dead.

40
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,319
God sent me back to defeat Nemesis.

41
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,600
That seems impossible. I'm sorry.

42
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,479
The situation right now,

43
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,119
is not like that day.

44
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,680
There's no chance you're winning this.

45
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,800
Really?

46
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,239
Do you forget that

47
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:09,159
we have Anna Kondra?

48
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Correct!

49
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,680
We have Anna Kondra.

50
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,439
You can never defeat us.

51
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:26,359
Your Anna Kondra

52
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,560
won't be here soon.

53
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,920
Looks like the Venomous Snake

54
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,560
was caught in a trap.

55
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,880
Someone like Anna Kondra will never be caught in your trap.

56
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,680
Stupid child.

57
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:44,039
You're insulting me more than you should.

58
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,039
Let's not waste any more time.

59
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,520
Kill them all!

60
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,279
Anna!

61
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,479
Did you spend all the time on your make-ups?
Why are you so late!?

62
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:18,640
Sven, a true gentleman will never say that!

63
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,079
Even if it's true.

64
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,279
Venomous Snake.

65
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,960
You were supposed to be delayed by the Big Head.

66
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,159
If you call that delaying then

67
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,560
you don't deserve to be a Mafia.

68
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,640
Big Heads are so useless.

69
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,800
However,

70
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,279
arriving right now won't change anything.

71
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
You're too late.

72
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,439
Kill them all including Rachen's son!

73
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:10,479
Is P' Anna this strong?

74
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,720
Looks like we're here on time.

75
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,399
Does anyone want to challenge me?

76
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
I wanna go home.

77
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,600
I'll fight for my husbando.

78
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,560
You crazy bitch. Shoot the heads, not the hands.

79
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,359
What a perfect position. This picture will be a blast.

80
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,680
This ain't the time for taking selfies!

81
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,960
Are you alright, bro?

82
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,479
My head.

83
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,399
Noobs.

84
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,319
Come here, I'll take care of you all.

85
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,520
M!

86
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,199
M, help me!

87
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,279
Damn you! I'm busy!

88
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,760
Wait!

89
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,359
Want me to kick his ass?

90
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,479
Hey!

91
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,279
Prime Minister!

92
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,199
The hell are you guys doing?

93
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,920
Kill them!

94
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,600
Hold these.

95
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,600
What are you doing, Anna?

96
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,199
I don't need weapon fighting this guy.

97
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:19,479
Sure.

98
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,920
Come.

99
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,960
Beam.

100
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,399
Beam.

101
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,039
Are you really not going to help me?

102
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,520
Beam!

103
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,600
Beam!

104
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,159
Beam!

105
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,680
Beam!

106
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,319
Help me. I'm dying.

107
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,840
Are you the famous Venomous Snake?

108
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,439
So weak.

109
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,439
Beam!

110
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,239
Beam!

111
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:44,640
Anna!

112
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,000
Beam, I'm hurt.

113
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,680
Shoot.

114
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,560
Beam!

115
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,960
Help me!

116
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,319
Beam!

117
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,119
Shoot!

118
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,119
Pull the trigger!

119
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,319
I can't.

120
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,520
Shoot.

121
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,560
What are you doing, huh!?

122
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,439
Shoot!

123
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,479
Shoot!

124
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,960
Don't you mess with my sister!

125
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,680
I'm so proud of you.

126
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,840
Anna.

127
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,600
Was it all just acting?

128
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,680
Of course, it is.

129
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,560
You think I can't fight this prick?

130
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,399
Anna...

131
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,680
What have I done?

132
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's say... thanks for the help, kiddo.

133
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,199
Give me the guns now.

134
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,600
Who the hell taught you to pass guns like this?

135
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,319
Never remember a thing.

136
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,800
Oh, and your shot is still wrong.

137
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:26,300
You have to be more bitchy and use more of your hip.

138
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,760
Understand?

139
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,479
Train some more when we get home.

140
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,880
Yes!

141
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,960
We won!

142
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,720
Were you really in the fight?

143
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
What are you talking about?

144
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,800
I dodged their attacks and counterattacked them.

145
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,840
They can never beat Sonya

146
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,399
of Mockingbird Family.

147
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,720
Oh...?

148
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,000
Alright!

149
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,800
Gorgeous.

150
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,279
What's up, M?

151
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,560
Thanks for saving me back then.

152
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,520
It's okay. We're friends after all.

153
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,199
I thought you were going to take selfies while I'm dying.

154
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:35,399
But why do you always take pictures?

155
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,880
I lost my mother since I was so young.

156
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,680
I cried and cried.

157
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,680
Realizing that

158
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,520
I never had a picture with her, not even one.

159
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,199
Without pictures, I can never see her face again.

160
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,920
That's why I take as many photos as possible.

161
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,680
So I can recall all the good memories.

162
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,119
Then..

163
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,039
shall we take a picture together?

164
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,159
Sure.

165
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,560
P' Sven. P' Sven.

166
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,079
Are you alright?

167
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,079
I'm just tired.

168
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,399
I was so worried.

169
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,960
If something should happen to you, I...

170
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,119
I'm fine.

171
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,600
What about you, Nut? Are you hurt?

172
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm totally fine, P'.

173
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,399
That's a relief.

174
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,359
You have to get some rest tomorrow.

175
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,800
I'll take Beam to school.

176
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,119
Thank you.

177
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,239
You were worried about me?

178
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,399
Mr. Jay.

179
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,159
I never thought that

180
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:16,399
Big Head would be this useless.

181
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Ha.

182
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:25,439
So you're blaming me when we lost together.

183
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:31,239
Wasn't it you who were scared of the Venomous Snake

184
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,520
and retreat all your troops?

185
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,920
Three royal guards of mine

186
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,760
have their own reason for retreating.

187
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
You can give whatever excuse you want.

188
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,680
But if you didn't go mad

189
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,399
and order a shot through Ron's daughter

190
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,079
then Mockingbird's troops

191
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,800
would still be ours.

192
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,840
Well, we both lost.

193
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,239
Now we should prepare

194
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,760
for the upcoming Mafia War with Nemesis.

195
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,520
Are you sure that you can fight

196
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,600
and survive the Mafia War with Nemesis?

197
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:25,199
That is none of Big Head's concern.

198
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,720
Let us leave, Mr. Jay.

199
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,319
Violet.

200
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm sorry.

201
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,960
We lost today.

202
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,000
Mistress.

203
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,880
I have to apologize.

204
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,880
I never thought your daughter would take action

205
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:58,960
by herself.

206
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,000
It's no surprise she's the daughter of Mistress of Death.

207
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
She smashed Chicolon like hell.

208
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,640
Enough.

209
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,319
I'm glad you guys are fine.

210
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,319
Now, let us leave.

211
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,319
Oh, was it really true

212
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,880
that Anna shot bullets to the sky

213
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,600
and they dropped into villains' heads?

214
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,520
That's true.

215
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,960
Enough already.

216
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,319
I already know that I'm strong.

217
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,880
You must be lying.

218
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:44,039
Well, this is not even today's highlight.

219
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,159
Why's that?

220
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,760
Today's highlight is...

221
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:56,439
one of Big Head killer aimed gun at Anna's car.

222
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,880
Anna Kondra,

223
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,840
The Venomous Snake of Mafia Society.

224
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,239
Drop your weapons,

225
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,239
if you don't want your car to be shot at.

226
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,159
Wait, Anna.

227
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,760
What's with that expression?

228
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,119
I can't fight.

229
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:22,600
After I beat the strongest Mafia,

230
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,880
what will God Hand title me?

231
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,680
Your title is Red Boot at your Head!

232
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,760
You okay?

233
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,239
Tan, get me my boot.

234
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,479
Hot.

235
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,680
Are you really the strongest Mafia?

236
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:50,119
Oh, the smell.

237
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:52,960
Hold it tight!

238
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,760
Red Boot at the Head?

239
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,279
What?

240
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,119
That's a good title.

241
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,640
It's the first thing that came to my mind.

242
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,079
Red Boot at the Head, damn.

243
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,319
The hell are you smiling for?

244
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,680
Nothing.

245
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,159
Just wanted to thank you for saving me today.

246
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:14,920
What?

247
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,000
I couldn't hear you clearly. Can you repeat that?

248
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,920
Just wanted to thanks for saving me

249
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:27,039
both today and four years ago.

250
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,439
Four years ago?

251
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,800
What did I help you with?

252
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,000
Nothing.

253
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,920
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

254
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,680
The smoke are killing me.

255
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
So hard to breathe.

256
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Tan.

257
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:53,399
I'm going too.

258
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,239
What are those two up to?

259
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,119
Hey.

260
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,760
I know what you're thinking.

261
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,159
What do you mean?

262
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,079
It's totally normal to fall in love with
the one who saved your life.

263
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,199
Huh?

264
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,560
You know about four years ago?

265
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,000
- Of course.
- I never said it to anyone.

266
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,720
That day when you failed your mission.

267
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,560
Old man called me and asked me to rescue you.

268
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,079
But from where I was,

269
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,039
I'd never reached you in time.

270
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,039
So the old man called Master for help.

271
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,760
And Master sent someone to rescue me.

272
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,079
Let me go. Please.

273
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,640
I don't want to die.

274
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,439
Look like he's not telling us.

275
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,520
Shall we shoot him?

276
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,359
I think we should start with cutting his finger off.

277
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,079
Good idea.

278
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,560
Cutting one of his finger

279
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,079
might change his mind.

280
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:47,720
Tell them and I'll kill you myself.

281
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,920
Are you harmed?

282
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,560
You are...

283
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,960
The name's Anna.

284
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,039
Master sent me to rescue you.

285
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,640
Thank you.

286
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,439
Wait.

287
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,000
Don't take that out.

288
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,399
I don't want to see a man's tear.

289
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,640
Now, let's go.

290
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,800
Are you not going to confess to her?

291
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,560
What do you want me to say?

292
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:46,399
Your feeling.

293
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,199
I'm scared.

294
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,279
You idiot.

295
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,439
Can you not be an idiot at this moment?

296
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,119
There's no need to be scared telling her your feeling.

297
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,960
What you should be scared of is

298
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,279
seeing her with someone else

299
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,560
without you taking any action.

300
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,399
But Anna is not like us.

301
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:21,399
Yeah.

302
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,680
Anna is not like anybody.

303
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,039
But, hey.

304
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,760
Think about it...

305
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,079
Winning Anna's heart

306
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,039
should feel like owning the whole world.

307
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,720
Me?

308
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,520
Yes, you.

309
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,640
I could never.

310
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,680
I'm having a hard time with you now.

311
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:53,880
Come here.

312
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,319
This time I'm serious.

313
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
Try imagine this.

314
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,760
Don't you want to touch her chests?

315
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,640
Huh?

316
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:21,760
It works.

317
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Thanks, Intenso.

318
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:25,840
I'm always cool.

319
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I can't give up.

320
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,800
That's more like it.

321
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,039
So?

322
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,039
Run.

323
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,520
Go.

324
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,119
Tell her.

325
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,720
Thanks.

326
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,720
Why the hell do we need to fall for the same girl? Damn.

327
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,079
M.

328
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,640
Hey, Fierce.

329
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,920
Can I talk to you for a moment?

330
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,800
Sure.

331
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm not sure....

332
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,039
if you're dating someone right now.

333
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,600
But if you're still free then...

334
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,960
Then..

335
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,279
Would you like to date me?

336
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,159
It's...

337
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,039
You're a very beautiful person.

338
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,760
And you're beyond perfect.

339
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,439
Plus...

340
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,199
My eyes are extremely drawn

341
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
by your chests.

342
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:53,319
But...

343
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,560
I already have someone that I like.

344
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,399
So I cannot

345
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,439
answer your feelings.

346
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,640
Is that it?

347
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:11,319
It's alright. At least I got to tell you how I feel.

348
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,560
I guess that's more than enough.

349
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,880
We'll keep seeing each other.

350
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,520
Okay.

351
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,640
See you around.

352
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,279
Okay.

353
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,560
Bye.

354
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,720
Bye.

355
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,760
Hey, Mina.

356
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,960
Mina.

357
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm sorry about yesterday.

358
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,119
It's already too late.

359
00:32:56,479 --> 00:33:01,079
I kissed you because I wanted to save your life.

360
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,720
You said you wanted to save my life

361
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,079
but do you know

362
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,560
how important first kiss is to me?

363
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,279
And you completely stole it.

364
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,840
I understand but I...

365
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,399
I don't know how everybody else

366
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,159
feel about their first kiss.

367
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,119
But for me,

368
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,920
I've always dreamed that

369
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,640
the first person that I'm going to kiss

370
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,520
must be the person that I will marry

371
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,319
and we'll take care of each other until death.

372
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,920
What now? Didn't you hurt me enough already?

373
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,079
Mina.

374
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,720
Then...

375
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,159
will you be my girlfriend?

376
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,479
What are you saying?

377
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,880
I promise that

378
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,359
I'll be honest with you

379
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,479
and I will study hard

380
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,439
then work hard

381
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,880
and ask you to be my wife.

382
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,279
And we can be together until death tears us apart.

383
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,079
Are you serious?

384
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,760
Of course.

385
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,399
I just denied that volcanic chests

386
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,439
so that I can ask you this.

387
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,359
Don't you know that

388
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,319
I'm a freak and a yaoi-novel-addicted

389
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:00,880
and my chests are

390
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,359
totally opposite of the word volcanic.

391
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
I know.

392
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,960
And I've thought it through.

393
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,000
What about you? Have you thought about it?

394
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,880
Yesterday incident made me realize

395
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:04,239
how awesome it is to be here.

396
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,119
I agree.

397
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,319
I have had enough being a Mafia leader.

398
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:12,680
Are you sure about it?

399
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,880
Yes.

400
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,119
I'm telling Anna tonight that

401
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,720
I don't want to be a Mafia anymore.

402
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,039
What about P' Sven?

403
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,840
It's kind of sad

404
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,319
if Sven and Anna are gone.

405
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,000
But.. what's up with you and Sven?

406
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,760
What do you think?

407
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,640
What!? Is it true, Nut?

408
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
Hey, wait!

409
00:36:56,479 --> 00:37:01,319
Do you know why you're here?

410
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,239
I know.

411
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,239
You can punish me in any way you like.

412
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,239
I've acknowledged all of my mistakes.

413
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:22,640
Sonya.

414
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,039
Do you realize that what you did yesterday

415
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,199
could destroy our Family.

416
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,840
That, I know.

417
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,600
Bunny.

418
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,239
Do you know that

419
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,640
the rule of this Family is to never hurt comrades.

420
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,159
Sonya,

421
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,199
do you know that

422
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,960
you're the only daughter that I have.

423
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,479
Yes.

424
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,640
Since I am both the leader of this Family

425
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,159
and your father,

426
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
it is only necessarry that I punish you

427
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,720
for violating the rule.

428
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:21,039
I accept.

429
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Your punishment is that

430
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,960
you're not allowed to have desserts
after dinner for 1 month.

431
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,119
Didn't you hear me clearly?

432
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,640
Leave already. I have nothing else to say.

433
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:11,239
What kind of person is this Rachen's son?

434
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,119
How can he make Sonya this brave?

435
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,640
Baifern.

436
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:30,119
I...

437
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,479
I want to apologize regarding yesterday.

438
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:37,199
Regarding a young Mafia taking friends for adventuring?

439
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,479
No one is blaming you at all.

440
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,960
But I risked our friends' life.

441
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,399
Do you know what our friends say?

442
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:47,680
What did they say?

443
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,520
It's the most memorable day of their life.

444
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,000
Really?

445
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,920
Yes.

446
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,039
But you know,

447
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,520
when you told me you wanted to stay back there,

448
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,800
I was so worried.

449
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:11,119
Didn't think I would make it.

450
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,439
But when I recalled that

451
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:17,079
somebody told me to come back here safe,

452
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,520
I did my best.

453
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,199
Do you remember when I told you that

454
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,960
you look like a hero?

455
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,560
I do.

456
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,279
I'd never forget.

457
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:31,880
Now you don't look like a hero anymore.

458
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,119
But I think you're a hero.

459
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,760
And...

460
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,800
is this hero worthy of...

461
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,680
Get out of the fricking way!

462
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,520
Shall we go home?

463
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:11,239
That was unexpected.

464
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,920
I'm home.

465
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,920
I have had enough of you, Anna!

466
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:18,880
Sven,

467
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,479
I did it for the greater good.

468
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,760
Greater good was it?

469
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,840
Are you guys fighting again?

470
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,560
Oh, you're here. Great.

471
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,319
Beam, you can be the judge.

472
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,000
Is it wrong that I sent some men to lift Sven's car

473
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,640
and bombed it last night?

474
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,680
Umm.. Isn't that totally wrong?

475
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,319
You know.. lifting other people's car to bomb it?

476
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,800
What?

477
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,720
I did this for you.

478
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,640
You should be grateful.

479
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,319
Alright alright.

480
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,840
Let's do this.

481
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:00,039
Let's train your leadership skill.

482
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,159
If members of the organization got into arguement,

483
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:05,640
how will you solve this problem?

484
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,520
Answer!

485
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,800
So you want me to come up with the solution?

486
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,640
Correct. The leadership skill is

487
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,239
fundamental for your next step.

488
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:17,600
Now answer.

489
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,279
So whatever I come up with, you'll accept it?

490
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:24,119
Right.

491
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,760
Then I will decide that Anna must

492
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,840
buy Sven a new car.

493
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,960
Beam!

494
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,560
You let Beam decided

495
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,800
so you must accept whatever Beam said.

496
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,199
Sure sure.

497
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,119
Since I came up with that,

498
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,640
of course, I shall accept it.

499
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,520
Chill.

500
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,159
Then let me search for a car that suits you.

501
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,640
Should be second hand and

502
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,159
price lower than $500.

503
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:08,600
But the price of the car

504
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,000
must substitute Sven's feeling

505
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,119
because Sven always takes good care of his car.

506
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:17,560
I mean, the car must have some mental value.

507
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,439
Beam.

508
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:20,720
You played me!

509
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,600
Mornin'.

510
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,920
I have nothing to say to you.

511
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,159
You still mad at me about yesterday?

512
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,840
Yes, I am.

513
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:47,319
My salary is extremely high

514
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:50,119
but that doesn't mean I can buy cars for others.

515
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:55,239
Let's start from not bombing other people's cars.

516
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,760
What are you talking about? That doesn't make any sense.

517
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,640
Anna.

518
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,680
I...

519
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,039
I have something to ask.

520
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,800
What?

521
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:16,479
Are you going to be mad

522
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,479
if I won't become the next leader of the gang?

523
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,760
So what you're saying is

524
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,640
you will sacrifice the throne of the most powerful Mafia
gang

525
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,920
in history of our country?

526
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,079
You will sacrifice powers, authorites

527
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,880
and unlimited amount of money, am I right?

528
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,359
I know that Sven and Anna

529
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,720
expected me to become as powerful Mafia as my dad

530
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,000
but..

531
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You don't have to say anymore.

532
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,479
Sven and I understand everything.

533
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:57,279
If you don't want to become one then we won't force you.

534
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:01,800
You're totally okay with this?

535
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,319
Of course, don't see me as a crazy unreasonable bitch.

536
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,560
Here's the thing.

537
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,479
Sven and I never have a problem with you not becoming Mafia.

538
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:21,800
But your college fees, electric fee
all your personal expenses

539
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,600
were all paid by Nemesis.

540
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,319
If you are not becoming our new leader then

541
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:29,159
I don't see the point

542
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,319
in Nemesis paying for these expenses.

543
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:34,640
That's true.

544
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,439
You must surely think of something now.

545
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:44,680
I think I...

546
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,439
Hello, weakasses.

547
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:51,760
Hi, Anna.

548
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:54,680
Greetings, Master-to-be.

549
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,840
Hello, everyone.

550
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,319
Hi, golden retriever, nerd. What are you guys doing here?

551
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,800
I come to see our next Master.

552
00:46:09,479 --> 00:46:12,640
I haven't decided that I'm going to be the next Master.

553
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,359
By the way, that car in front of the house is cool.

554
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,039
Is that the new Master's personal transportation?

555
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,000
Anna...

556
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,399
Don't tell me...

557
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,119
Wow.

558
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,840
Do you like it?

559
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,199
Anna.

560
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,079
Is this for real?

561
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,600
This is..

562
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,079
My dream car!

563
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,079
I've been dreaming about it for a while.

564
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,960
It's from my favorite movie.

565
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,119
Take a look at the wheels!

566
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,119
They're all chrome.

567
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,279
All the options are also chrome.

568
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,399
Anna...

569
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,039
Huh?

570
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,000
What's with Sven and chrome?

571
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,199
I have no clue.

572
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,600
Oh my god! The ceiling as well! Too perfect!

573
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:54,800
It's even off-road and four-wheel drive.

574
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,039
And a V8 engine! So powerful!

575
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:06,439
I've never seen Sven talk this much.

576
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,399
Anna.

577
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,880
I'm also surprised.

578
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,159
Beam. What are you waiting for?

579
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,079
Get your bag or we'll be late.

580
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,159
Sure, give me a moment.

581
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,159
Sven has evolved.

582
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,399
Hi, dad.

583
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,279
Thank you for making me the way I am.

584
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,720
I promise you, that I will be a good Mafia.

585
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:11,359
Love you, dad.

586
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,960
Rachen.

587
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,439
How is it possible that you're still alive?

588
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:32,800
Do you have any last word?

589
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,079
Why did you disappear for so long then?

590
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:43,560
Everything I did

591
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,720
was for my son

592
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:50,159
to become the strongest Mafia.

593
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,119
If what you said is the truth then

594
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:07,880
you cannot pull the trigger.

595
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,239
Bang.

596
00:51:13,479 --> 00:51:15,199
As expected of you.

597
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,920
If I trigger my gun,

598
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,159
Anna will know that I'm alive.

599
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:23,720
And everything I've done so far

600
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,359
will be worthless.

601
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:35,039
Then what's your intention for

602
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,079
being here right now?

603
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:43,960
I come to tell you that no matter what you do,

604
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,600
your gang will meet its end.

605
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,439
Have you forgotten that my gang

606
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:59,279
is equally powerful as yours?

607
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:01,079
How can you be so sure that

608
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,039
you'll win?

609
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:10,319
Beam,

610
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,520
my son.
