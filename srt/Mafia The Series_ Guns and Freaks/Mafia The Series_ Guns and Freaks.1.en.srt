1
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,030
After today,

2
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,110
The Blue Moon Gang will be just a history right, Master?

3
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,110
Right.

4
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,590
Wasted a lot of time finding them

5
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,960
but today Krit will be dead.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,550
Apology for the interruption, Master

7
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,280
but I think Krit had escaped since we arrived.

8
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,880
Where do you get that idea, Anna?

9
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,320
Take a look at the color of Intenso's hair.

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,230
The way it shines.

11
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,670
Krit must have seen it two kilometers before our arrival.

12
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,510
Hey. Hey. Hey.

13
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,760
I believe it's because of your dress.

14
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,590
Hell of a red.

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,840
Krit must have seen it since you left your house.

16
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,960
Hey!

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,710
Can't you two just take it easy?

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,670
We're crushing another gang, not crushing ourselves!

19
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,360
Still don't get used to it, West?

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,630
They are always like this every time
they're in the field together.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,360
But this time you started it, Anna.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
I apologize, Master.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,480
I just couldn't hold it.

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,360
Sven!

25
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,110
Now is the time.

26
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,590
Intenso,

27
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,110
it's your turn.

28
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,110
Been waiting for too long, old man.

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,480
Hey,

30
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,280
chicken girl.

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,150
Watch me.

32
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,880
Tell me where Krit is.

33
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,230
Huh?

34
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,800
Hey.

35
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,150
Hey!

36
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,800
How could he die so fast?

37
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,320
Wow.

38
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,590
Hiding here all along, huh?

39
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,880
We've been trying hard to find you, you know?

40
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,230
Don't get too excited.

41
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,360
Even if Blue Moon loses today,

42
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,110
there are still many gangs that are waiting to crush yours.

43
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,280
Really?

44
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,800
I can't seem to remember anyone has achieved that.

45
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,800
Let's see how long that mouth of yours can talk.

46
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,110
Where are you going?

47
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
Where's your confidence now?

48
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,190
I think you've already known

49
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,590
the ending of people

50
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,510
who broke the contract.

51
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,550
I'll make sure, you die painfully.

52
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,000
Krit.

53
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,280
See you in hell.

54
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,800
Master.

55
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
Old man.

56
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Krit has been taken care of.

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
I heard that

58
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,030
your son has entered second year.

59
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,480
How's he?

60
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,440
He's just like a normal teenager, West.

61
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,510
Don't you think of telling him that

62
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,760
you're the leader of Mafia organization?

63
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,470
Wake up, Beam.

64
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,800
Or you'll be late.

65
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,030
Beam, you're going to be late!

66
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,110
I'm awake, dad.

67
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,190
This is one of the biggest news of the year.

68
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,350
There's a case of massacre
and more than ten people are found dead.

69
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,640
The police assumed that there's a war between Mafia gangs.

70
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Here, Beam.

71
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,070
There's a lot of fluid coming out from this corpse's brain.

72
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,030
Excuse me, can't you see that I'm reporting news.

73
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,000
Can you be quiet?

74
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,430
I'm sorry, Miss Sexy.

75
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,800
When will these people just die, dad?

76
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,760
The time for Monster News has ended,

77
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,520
but do not change the channel

78
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,800
because coming up next is World's SLAP contest.

79
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
I think it's just the way

80
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,470
they take care of their businesses.

81
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,470
This is the reason I wanted to be a superhero

82
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,470
and get rid of all these people!

83
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,840
By the way, how's your work?

84
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,070
I've been doing well.

85
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,000
Tomorrow, I'll be commissioned.

86
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,350
So dinner will be at your favorite restaurant.

87
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Wow, thank you.

88
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,000
Now, hurry. We're getting late.

89
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,720
This is delicious.

90
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,720
Did you cook?

91
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,720
Well, of course.

92
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,920
Of course, you bought it?

93
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,270
Of course, I cooked!

94
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,470
Sit down, captain Thana.

95
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
This officer is Non.

96
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
He's from S.L.A.P. force.

97
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,680
He's going to help us with the recent massacre case.

98
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,270
But sir,

99
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,840
the massacre just happened yesterday.

100
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,720
Why do we have to rush
and contact the private force so early?

101
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,720
This is the will of the higher ups.

102
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,520
Plus, officer Non has some information

103
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,230
regarding this case.

104
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,840
What if I tell you that this case
is involved with high tier Mafia gang?

105
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,680
Will you trust me?

106
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,640
Now.

107
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,720
That's all for today.

108
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,760
And Thana, forward all the files you have collected

109
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,230
to officer Non.

110
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,640
Then you can get back to work.

111
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes sir.

112
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,350
Leave.

113
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,270
I'm going to class now, dad.

114
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,800
Study well, son.

115
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,520
Sure.

116
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Bye, dad.

117
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,720
Always late.

118
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,270
We've been waiting.

119
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,270
Sorry.

120
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
I had breakfast with dad.

121
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,030
He's not late yet, M.

122
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,030
We got like 10 minutes

123
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,960
before the class begins.

124
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,310
So I can't mess with him now, huh?

125
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,880
Why?

126
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,150
Are you his wife now?

127
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,390
Don't come near me!

128
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,960
Come on, don't fight now.

129
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,350
Guys!

130
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,110
What now?

131
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,470
The college's stars.

132
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,190
One day, I'll definitely date one of them.

133
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,470
Beam.

134
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,190
Time to go to class.

135
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,030
You too, M.

136
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,270
Last class, I said that

137
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,920
we're going to group up for the group project.

138
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,680
Which we will do it randomly.

139
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,190
Oh, noooo.

140
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,230
Miss!

141
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,560
But we already have our own group.

142
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,760
You have to learn to separate from your group.

143
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,110
It's going to be fine separating.

144
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,760
Right?

145
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,640
Easy for you to say, you're not as lazy as me.

146
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,640
Nut.

147
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,470
Huh?

148
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't you dare smile.

149
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
What?

150
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,520
Who smiled?

151
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,030
I also wanted to be with my friend,

152
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,720
Beam.

153
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,430
But I'm your friend too.

154
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,390
Right, you're also my friend.

155
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,030
Alright, lads. We are forming groups

156
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,000
according to your student numbers.

157
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,150
324,

158
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,800
388,

159
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,760
366,

160
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,840
Please stay in the same group as Nut.

161
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,150
M.

162
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,800
Brush your teeth before you wanted to be in my group.

163
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,600
Baifern, Baifern, Baifern.

164
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,000
Why don't you just shout?

165
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,270
So...

166
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,600
My group has

167
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,520
Mina,

168
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,110
O,

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,390
and Earthly.

170
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Seriously, you get a professional camera.

171
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,230
It'd be worth it.

172
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,680
Nice to meet you,

173
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,600
Beam and

174
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,190
Nut.

175
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,760
Nice to meet you guys too.

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,390
I'm so glad I get to stay with Nut

177
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,840
and you, Baifern.

178
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,110
You guys were so good with the past presentations.

179
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,800
You're too kind.

180
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,760
What about me, Noon?

181
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,430
Bomb, I can't seem to remember you at all.

182
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,230
Boom.

183
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,230
What the...

184
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,640
Beam.

185
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,880
Thank you.

186
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,470
Here's the thing.

187
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,030
Since we'll be working together

188
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,520
tonight we should go party at Epic pub.

189
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,270
Anyone wants to join?

190
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,310
You know, to get to know each other better.

191
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,150
Well, I

192
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,960
I don't really drink alc---

193
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,230
Let me sit with you, Beam.

194
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,470
Hi.

195
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,960
Sure.

196
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,230
Let's go together. What time do we meet?

197
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,920
Let's say 8 p.m.

198
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,760
Sure.

199
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,960
Are you with O, Mina, and Earthly?

200
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,520
Yes, what's up?

201
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,800
Invite them. Let's go together.

202
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,960
But it's already fun with just us.

203
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,000
It'll be even better with them.

204
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,800
You guys can go ahead, but not me.

205
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,720
Don't!

206
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,390
Why?

207
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,230
Go.

208
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,600
No go.

209
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,520
I don't have money if you don't go.

210
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,070
And?

211
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,800
I have to borrow some from you.

212
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
Borrow me?

213
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,150
Dad.

214
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,680
Can I go to the pub tonight?

215
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,760
You can not.

216
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,840
Here's the thing, dad.

217
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,190
I just entered the group at the college.

218
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,840
And they wanted to go to the pub
to get to know each other better.

219
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,390
I don't want to be left out.

220
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,390
Please let me go.

221
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,000
Didn't you see the news this morning?

222
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,760
It's dangerous out there.

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
And you still want to go?

224
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,070
But I've never asked even once.

225
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,640
This is the first time, dad.

226
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,680
Let me go, please. Please.

227
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,110
I won't repeat my answer, Beam.

228
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,720
No means no.

229
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,430
What?

230
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,270
My "please" always worked.

231
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,960
Beam is making the great escape.

232
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,520
Beam!

233
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,230
Late once again.

234
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,270
All the pretty girls are going home already!

235
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,310
Sorry, guys.

236
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
Don't tell me, you had dinner with dad this time.

237
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,270
Why don't you add reading books with your dad after dinner?

238
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,190
Dad won't let me come out.

239
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,390
I left without him knowing.

240
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,390
Your dad must think that you're still a little kid.

241
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,760
Just ignore it.

242
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,560
Since we're here, let's have some fun.

243
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,840
Let's get inside.

244
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
Hey.

245
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,600
Shit!

246
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,920
How can a human be so perfect?

247
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,680
Coming to the pub and still get A's.

248
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,270
I'm also at the pub.

249
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,000
And I also get A's.

250
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,190
Really?

251
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,030
Yes.

252
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,430
I didn't ask you a single question.

253
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,030
Wait for my turn.

254
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
I think you should pick up the phone.

255
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,390
No need.

256
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,110
I think he must be so worried about you now.

257
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Being worried about Beam is fine.

258
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,000
But Beam is old enough

259
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,840
to live his life now.

260
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,470
Beam.

261
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,560
If you want to stay here then

262
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,840
let's just at least talk to him first.

263
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,800
Alright.

264
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,430
Going back or staying or calling him?

265
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,470
It's all up to you. I'm getting in.

266
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,390
Hurry up.

267
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,920
Bye.

268
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,720
Let's find a quiet spot for you to call him.

269
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,600
Thanks, Nut.

270
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,390
Let's go.

271
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,430
Hey boys!

272
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,560
Your phone looks cool.

273
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,800
His watch too, big bro.

274
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,760
What do you want?

275
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,110
Nothing much.

276
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,150
Your wallets, your phones

277
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,840
and your watch.

278
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,920
Or you'll get hurt.

279
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,560
You can have anything you want

280
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,270
but please don't hurt us.

281
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,640
I like your answer,

282
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,230
I don't want you to get hurt, you know.

283
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,430
Who the hell are you?

284
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,150
You want to get hurt, huh?

285
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,350
Who's he?

286
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,560
We were almost dead.

287
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,800
Thank you.

288
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,720
Who's he?

289
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,760
Are you okay, Beam?

290
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,470
I'm still fine.

291
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,310
We should leave.

292
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,720
They could be back for us.

293
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,960
Now I completely understand why my dad won't allow me here.

294
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,960
It's just too dangerous.

295
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,920
Agreed.

296
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,470
Thanks to the guy who saved us.

297
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,520
But first, you have to call your dad.

298
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,190
He must be so worried now.

299
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,310
You're right.

300
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,030
Dad!

301
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,110
Go home, Beam.

302
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,270
Get in the car now!

303
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,470
Get in the car.

304
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,600
Your dad is angry.

305
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,720
You, take care as well.

306
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,880
See you later.

307
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,150
Hey!

308
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,920
Look at that 15 years old coming to the pub!

309
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,030
That's right!

310
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,030
His dad comes to get him back!

311
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,880
O.

312
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
Don't bully him like that.

313
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,760
Beam!

314
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,520
Beam!

315
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,230
Don't you ever do this again, ever!

316
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm already an adult now, dad.

317
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,680
You're not mature enough.

318
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,350
It's because you keep doing these things to me.

319
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,190
That's why I'll never be mature enough!

320
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,470
Why did you went to the pub last night

321
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,190
eventhough I didn't allow it?

322
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,600
Why does S.L.A.P. interest in working on this case?

323
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,230
Because the higher-ups know that

324
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,030
the polices could not possibly handle this case.

325
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,840
Plus, this is a very sensitive case.

326
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,680
There will definitely be casualties

327
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,920
if the polices work on this case without help.

328
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,190
What you're saying is the people behind this case

329
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,150
is that scary, huh?

330
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,800
Yes.

331
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,190
I told you they are the highest level of Mafia.

332
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,070
Aren't you going to make any excuse on
what happened last night?

333
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,270
I told you not to go out and you still went out.

334
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,960
There's nothing else to say.

335
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,800
I know

336
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,560
you might not always like what I asked.

337
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,470
But always know that

338
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,350
I care for you.

339
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,000
Dad.

340
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,070
Every college student goes out at night.

341
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,560
Why is it only me

342
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,720
that are not allowed to go out?

343
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,640
I don't expect you to understand me now.

344
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,350
Do you know how shameful it was

345
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,000
that you came and picked me up last night?

346
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,640
Isn't this the road in front of our college?

347
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,520
Where?

348
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Hey!

349
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,390
Beam!

350
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,920
This looks like your father's car.

351
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,520
Hey!

352
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,640
Beam!

353
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,070
Wait for me!

354
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,000
My phone!

355
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,030
Returned.

356
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,800
That's awful.

357
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,070
Take pictures of the evidences.

358
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,470
See if there's anything that might lead us to the culprit.

359
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,390
Everyone, please understand that

360
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,430
we need to investigate before
we can provide any detail on the case.

361
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,390
You can take pictures, but do not enter the area.

362
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,310
This area is under investigation.

363
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,070
That answer we cannot provide at this time.

364
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,960
Excuse me but you are not allowed in.

365
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,470
Allow me.

366
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,350
Please come in.

367
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,030
Thank you.

368
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,520
Any idea, Mr. Non?

369
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,880
We're facing an extreme force.

370
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,520
People who can order

371
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,270
this kind of attack must be extremely powerful.

372
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,110
I suggest you to leave everything to me.

373
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,310
I can handle the rest.

374
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,920
Do not insult me like that.

375
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,190
I didn't just write the paperworks

376
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,000
in order to be where I am today.

377
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,720
Sure.

378
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,310
You cannot enter!

379
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,310
Stop!

380
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,270
Please let me in.

381
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,190
Do not enter!

382
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,880
Please, that's my father's car!

383
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,070
Stop!

384
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,310
My father's car!

385
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,840
Wait!

386
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,720
What are you doing!?

387
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,150
The area's off limit!

388
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,390
That is my father's car!

389
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,960
Excuse me.

390
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,390
Please calm down.

391
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,000
Wait.

392
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,030
You said this is your father's car?

393
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,150
Yes.

394
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,000
Let him in. Just him.

395
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,030
The rest, please wait.

396
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,350
All of you back off.

397
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,600
Dad!

398
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,270
Do not worry.

399
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,800
I promise we'll do our best to solve this case.

400
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Beam,

401
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,600
how are you holding up?

402
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,720
It happened so fast.

403
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,960
I'm not ready for any of this to happen.

404
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,350
I get you.

405
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,560
I didn't expect these things,

406
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,310
to happen to your father either.

407
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,520
You need to stay strong.

408
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,520
He'd be very sad if

409
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,190
he sees you like this.

410
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,430
I don't understand.

411
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,560
My dad's just a salesman.

412
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,350
Why did they do this to him?

413
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,520
Everything will be fine.

414
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,030
You'll get pass this.

415
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,470
Understand?

416
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,470
Yes.

417
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,680
Dad,

418
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,470
I got nothing left.

419
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,600
Beam,

420
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,270
do you want us to stay over?

421
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,560
Things might be better.

422
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,030
Master.

423
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,880
I'm sorry.

424
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,230
Tomorrow, I'll be commissioned.

425
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,760
So dinner will be at your favorite restaurant.

426
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,560
Wow, thank you.

427
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,110
This is delicious.

428
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,760
Did you cook?

429
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,800
Well, of course.

430
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,960
Of course, you bought it?

431
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,560
Of course, I cooked!

432
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,190
I thought you said

433
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:14,000
the dinner's at my favorite restaurant.

434
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,230
Anyone here?

435
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,840
I guess no one's here.

436
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,840
I'll just go back then.

437
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,760
So you're here, little baby.

438
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,960
Please don't kill me.

439
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,680
I'll shoot you if you don't turn on the light now.

440
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,070
Then,

441
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,840
I'll go turn on the light now.

442
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,600
Good boy.

443
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,070
Go ahead.

444
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,520
Listen now.

445
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,640
We're in an emergency situation.

446
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,520
Master was killed for unknown reason.

447
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,680
Our organization is now working on

448
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,150
who's behind Master's death.

449
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,800
From now on,

450
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,230
the only person you can trust is me.

451
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,680
Trust no one else.

452
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,640
I...

453
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,150
I don't understand a thing.

454
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,520
Who are you?

455
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,030
My name is Anna.

456
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,880
The most magnificent hitwoman in the world.

457
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,230
Hitwoman?

458
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,470
Damn!

459
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,270
How come Master's son is this idiot!?

460
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,640
Where's the strength of Master?

461
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,070
Master?

462
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:12,150
Do you mean my dad?

463
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,110
Yes.

464
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,640
Your father is called Master.

465
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,720
Anyone else coming?!

466
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,350
The hell am I supposed to know? I'm here with you.

467
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,840
Maybe it's assassins who were sent to kill you.

468
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,520
If you're so curious then, go welcome them.

469
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,520
No!

470
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,960
If they are assassins, why should I welcome them?

471
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,800
I am a lady and you are a man.

472
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,230
Can't you be more of a gentleman?

473
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,190
Scare?

474
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,110
If you're scared then stay behind me.

475
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,960
Sven.

476
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,960
What the hell are you doing here?

477
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,230
What you are saying is

478
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,350
my dad runs a Mafia organization

479
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,800
called Nemesis,

480
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,960
which runs illegal activities.

481
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,880
Anna is the most powerful hitwoman in the organzation.

482
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:41,030
And Sven is my dad's bodyguard.

483
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,310
Did I get it all right?

484
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,920
No!

485
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
When did I tell you that

486
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,030
I'm most powerful in the organization?

487
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,110
I'm the most powerful hitwoman in the world.

488
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,840
Not to mention, the most beautiful.

489
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,270
Sven.

490
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:59,150
Who do you think is behind Master's death?

491
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,760
The night before the incident,

492
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,000
Master drove to pick Beam up at the pub,

493
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,070
which is owned by Big Head.

494
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,640
Reasonable.

495
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,640
But I believe it's someone inside such as

496
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,390
Mr. West.

497
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,390
Wait,

498
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,600
I don't think it's my uncle, West.

499
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,070
He's also working with dad at the truck company.

500
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,190
He couldn't be involved.

501
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,350
Never interrupt me again when I speak!

502
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,070
Understand?

503
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,800
And Mr. West doesn't work in any truck company.

504
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,520
He's the second-in-command of Nemesis.

505
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,390
Which means as soon as Master is dead,

506
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,230
he'll become the head of the organization.

507
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,640
And I don't suspect just

508
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,190
Mr. West and the Big Heads.

509
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,960
Because last month,

510
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,600
Master sent a warning letter to the Mockingbird

511
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,880
regarding their newly manufactured drug.

512
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,070
In which the components of their drugs breached
the rules of God Hand guild.

513
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,030
Wait.

514
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,800
I really can't follow.

515
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,920
What are these Big Hand or God Hand or whatever?

516
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,000
I don't understand a thing.

517
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,230
Alright.

518
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,840
To make things simple.

519
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,840
We have three things to do.

520
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:18,880
First,

521
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,470
I need to find whoever killed Master.

522
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,110
Second,

523
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,600
The position of Master is now available.

524
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,000
I need to train you to become the new Master
as soon as possible

525
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,760
before Mr. West takes over the throne.

526
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,070
And third,

527
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,680
which is the most important.

528
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,190
Listen closely.

529
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,920
You have to make a list of all the spas around here

530
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,230
because I need to attend to my skin.

531
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,390
Oh,

532
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:51,880
Sven and I are going to move in here

533
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,920
from now to take care of your safety.

534
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,350
I'm going to take control of the bedroom on
the second floor.

535
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:01,070
And Sven, you can take the room right there.

536
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,470
Enough for today.

537
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,350
Rest well. Good night, baby.

538
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,880
Almost forgot the gun.

539
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,150
I apologize

540
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,800
that I couldn't protect Master.

541
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,150
It's okay.

542
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,600
It's definitely not your fault.

543
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,560
Five more minutes, dad.

544
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,430
It's me!

545
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,110
Go shower and hurry up downstair.

546
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,520
Lots of things to do today.

547
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,470
It's okay.

548
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,760
Sure.

549
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,680
It should be safe from here on out.

550
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,520
Thank you.

551
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,640
I'll pick you up after school.

552
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,030
Sure.

553
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,560
He is here.

554
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,920
Beam, how are you?

555
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,070
Are you okay?
We were so worried.

556
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,430
I'm not okay.

557
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,190
Haven't gotten used to it.

558
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,390
We're going to stay with you then.

559
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,150
You might get better with us.

560
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,880
No need.

561
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,720
I'm in the middle of processing things.

562
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,310
I want to stay alone.

563
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,270
Then,

564
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:37,150
if there's anything,

565
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,350
feel free to call us two anytime.

566
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,880
(Scream)

567
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,350
What's that sound?

568
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,720
Beam!

569
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,350
Follow him.

570
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,390
Hey wait!

571
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,520
Hey!

572
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:10,110
Since that son of a bitch

573
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,000
is dead,

574
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:13,560
it is now the time for our

575
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,680
Mockingbird Family to spread it's wing.

576
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,430
Are you ready for the field trip?

577
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,470
What is your boss planning?

578
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,640
Tell me or you're dead meat.

579
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,150
Nooooooooooooo!!
