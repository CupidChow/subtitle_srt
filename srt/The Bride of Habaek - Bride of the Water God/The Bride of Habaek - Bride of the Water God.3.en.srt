00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,600
	- Are you okay?|- Yes.

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,240
	- You've been staying here?|- Yes.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
	Why are you alone?

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,080
	Nam Soo Ri? I lost him.

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,600
	- How did you lose him?|- None of your business.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,480
	You can't keep staying here.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,240
	Have you finally decided to|offer your house and yourself?

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,800
	No. It's not that.

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,120
	It's not?

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,360
	Then, what is it?

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,400
	By requesting help from|our country's welfare system??

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,600
	I don't know what that's about.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,040
	If you haven't decided to offer|your house and yourself, then go.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,120
	Did I thank you already?

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
	You did.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,600
	Goodbye then.

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,120
	Okay.

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,280
	It's not like I saved your life|or something, right?

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,160
	What?

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,800
	Go.

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,480
	You don't even know how to be|grateful!

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,960
	You ingrate!

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,600
	How shameless!

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,480
	That's when it started.|Since then, she's been hearing

33
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,400
	weird sounds. It's like something|keeps talking to her.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
	What is?

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,160
	Flowers, water...

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,400
	Or trees, stones, ants,|things like that.

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,520
	Also... An orange.

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,160
	Orange?

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,160
	In the beginning,|she said it was totally trivial.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,480
	Ouch!

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,000
	She didn't think it was|strange, even if she heard wrong.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,920
	I don't usually say such things|but this is just too much.

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,600
	I'm a living thing too! You spiteful|woman who even kills a cactus!

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,800
	When she heard it the second time,|she thought she was tired.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,880
	There's nothing to eat in|this darn house. I'll go next door.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,040
	When she heard it the third time,|she thought she was really tired.

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
	She thought she should|really get some rest.

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,080
	You Koreans, why do you|keep calling me "orange"?

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,520
	Follow me. O-ren-ji.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,400
	When she heard it the fourth time??

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,920
	She thought she couldn't be more|tired .That's what she thought??

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,960
	??Round and round again

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,400
	??Round and round

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,480
	But then,|it's to the point that she can't

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,720
	explain it as just being tired.

56
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,720
	Reality test seems fine and|her ego boundary isn't collapsing.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,280
	If she's bipolar, could be|hallucinations but it's not that.

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,160
	It's not due to organicity. She's|not feigning her sickness either.

59
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
	Yes.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
	Then the answer might be in Miss A's|first auditory hallucination.

61
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,600
	- Being ungrateful and shameless?|- Yes.

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,920
	Could it be because of her guilt?

63
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,240
	- Guilt?|- The guilt from not helping.

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,320
	We don't have anywhere to go.|Please help us.

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,520
	You said Miss A received help from|Mr. B whom she met by chance.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
	What a hopeless woman, seriously.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,480
	No!

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,200
	Still, it doesn't make sense for|it to be because of guilt.

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,840
	It's different for every person.|According to what you said,

70
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,800
	Miss A might actually be|soft-hearted and warm.

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,120
	But living as if she's not.|She's not being true to herself.

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,160
	She doesn't like having too much|sympathy, and acts the opposite.

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,520
	But the gap between|what her heart wants and

74
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,400
	what she actually does is|causing her stress.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,760
	She probably has a reason for|not liking her true nature.

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,120
	Also, did you say that|Mr. B was abandoned by Mr. C?

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,040
	What?

78
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
	So you're saying you saw|Moo Ra in here?

79
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,920
	- That's right.|- You should have told me first.

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,480
	You're hungry and don't know|anything and you went off??

81
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,600
	Will you keep going?

82
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,760
	Moo Ra is not someone who will|easily be locked up in such a place.

83
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,040
	How do we find her?

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,720
	Moo Ra, do you hear me?

85
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,040
	- Are you doing that to be funny?|- Pardon?

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,080
	Among man-made things, this is|most commendable after the car.

87
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120
	First,|I need to find out what it is I saw.

88
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,080
	Please give it to me now.

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
	Should I show you skateboard tricks?

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,400
	No.

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,120
	Seriously.

92
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,040
	Why does an adult not have|a cellphone?

93
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,440
	There many things adults don't|have. Don't worry about such things.

94
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,400
	More than that,|where did you get this from?

95
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,840
	New account or a transfer? If|you choose JT, no enrollment fee.

96
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
	Choose a design.|What price are you thinking of?

97
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,560
	Since the carrier offers rebates,|we will deduct about $320,

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,360
	and for your monthly plan, with|data, call and text, $50 and up?

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,880
	I'll give you 250 minutes of calls,|unlimited texts, 2GB of data,

100
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,960
	you could play games and browse.|How many months do you want?

101
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,680
	For 2 years, there's the $50 plan|plus the cost of the device

102
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,480
	and pay monthly installments|for 24 months.

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,120
	There's a discount for a family|plan. Whose name will it be under?

104
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,040
	Please give me your IDs.|Please fill this out.

105
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
	Here, pens.

106
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,400
	New contract|for cell phone service?

107
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,120
	Like this.

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,480
	I think we will need help from|the descendant.

109
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,520
	Help?

110
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,520
	Did I say help?|I thought I said her rightful task.

111
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,800
	Mr. Nam.

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
	Mr. Nam, there is a customer.

113
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
	I'm going to work. Don't go|anywhere and stay here.

114
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,160
	By the way,|where did you get those clothes?

115
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,720
	From the clothing bin.|Should I pick up some for you?

116
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,280
	I guess you really want to|become a Mandarin fish.

117
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,040
	Again? You just ate a while ago.

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,160
	How can you be hungry more often|than I do?

119
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,120
	This is the most commendable. Once|you eat it, you get really full.

120
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,040
	Hang in there. I'll buy you|fish-shaped buns when I get paid.

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,640
	- What's with your face?|- Because of you??

122
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,800
	Because of me...

123
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,040
	Did something happen?|Did something happen?

124
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,120
	Did something happen? Did something|happen? Did something happen?

125
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
	Excuse me.

126
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
	I thought I was less devoted to|my duty as a doctor.

127
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,080
	And so??

128
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,040
	- Are you okay?|- Yes.

129
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,160
	I only thought of you.

130
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,160
	From when the sun rises|from the east

131
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,040
	until it sets in the west, I only|thought about you. That's it.

132
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,760
	No matter how hard I tried,|couldn't keep thoughts of you away.

133
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,160
	Why would you think about me?

134
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,800
	How could you be so slow and dull|when you're not even a bear?

135
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,480
	I couldn織t understand at all,|so I had to keep thinking about it.

136
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,640
	I hated it but I couldn't|stop thinking about you.

137
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,080
	Today, I see that even|your legs are slow.

138
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
	I'll just get going.

139
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,840
	I will get straight to the point.

140
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,640
	My academic advisor is|a really good person.

141
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,200
	A lot of people managed to find|happiness and peace through him.

142
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,080
	This talk has nothing to do|with me.

143
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,160
	- I can't give you those things.|- I don't need those things.

144
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,000
	I'm going to tell everything to|my professor. He could offer help??

145
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
	There are many things I have|realized since I came here.

146
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,840
	One is: if you tell the truth, you|become someone who is abnormal.

147
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,680
	If you told yourself you're god's|servant, would that be normal?

148
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,120
	No. No. No, that's not it.

149
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
	See.

150
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,040
	I am the only one who|believes you.

151
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,280
	Is it an easy feat to gain|someone's trust?

152
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,680
	What a great thing it is to have|someone who completely trusts you.

153
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,320
	You are such a person.

154

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
	I think she's been|greatly touched by me.

307
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,440
	I am the only one who trusts you.

308
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,120
	Is it an easy feat to gain|someone's trust?

309
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,040
	What a great thing it is to have|someone who completely trusts you.

310
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,960
	You

311
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,920
	are such a being.

312
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,720
	- Open the door.|- Yes.

313
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,160
	They are closed today.

314
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,080
	Nurse Yoo, the doctor isn't coming|back today, is she?

315
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,520
	No, she went to her university|reunion. She'll be late. Why?

316
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,120
	Should I call the nurse? He's|working part time at my store.

317
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,160
	No.

318
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,560
	Visiting school after a long time|can change up your mood.

319
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,000
	What school? It's at Grand Park|hotel. They're rich people.

320
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,080
	Should we come back tomorrow?

321
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,440
	Let's go.

322
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,160
	There are buses too. Why do you|always have to take a taxi?

323
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,160
	We live day to day.|We can't live like this.

324
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,080
	Yoon So-ah.

325
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,920
	- Ji-won.|- Hello!

326
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,000
	This is new.|You never come to reunions.

327
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,560
	Oh,

328
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,120
	I just felt like coming.

329
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,160
	How are you doing? There's talk of|your clinic not doing well.

330
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,840
	Oh.

331
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,600
	What's with the flower?

332
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,440
	Because of the donations for the|new incurable diseases hospital.

333
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,320
	The hospital director sent me|to give thanks to an early donor.

334
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,960
	I see. Who is it that the director|is personally sending flowers?

335
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,000
	He's the highest alumni donor.|And he does this every year.

336
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,680
	He donates a lot of money and|really supports those in need too.

337
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,560
	He also started supporting|young entrepreneurs last year.

338
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,280
	Supporting young entrepreneurs?

339
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,960
	Darn it.

340
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,760
	He's 2 years ahead of us. Business|major. Went to Yale after a year.

341
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,600
	After he came back, he graduated|early after a year and a half.

342
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,440
	It's a bit awkward for him,|since he's not close to anyone.

343
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,400
	I was told he's very secretive.|He's single.

344
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,560
	His face, body, and mind,|the three shine together.

345
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,320
	Don't you think|he's different on the inside?

346
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,480
	No way, not that senior.

347
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,920
	Senior?

348
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,120
	How is it possible to tell someone

349
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,240
	"Don't pester the bank employee.|Work hard, and earn money,"

350
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,720
	Is this something that you could|just say?

351
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,040
	The devil is in the details.

352
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,240
	People like him go after small|money, like for windshield wipers.

353
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,880
	They're insensitive to other's|pain. It could all be a fa癟ade.

354
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,760
	Do you know him personally?

355
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,080
	How would she? I guess your clinic|is really not doing well.

356
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,080
	You've became twisted like|a twisted breadstick.

357
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,640
	- Hey, Moon Hee-young!|- I guess this is called gossiping.

358
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,400
	Miss Yoon So-ah.|Are your feet okay?

359
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,080
	- Do you know each other?|- Yes.

360
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,960
	We know each other enough to|gossip about one another.

361
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,160
	Also enough to discuss interest rates|at the VIP room of a bank.

362
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,400
	VIP?

363
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,920
	She also broke my windshield|wiper. Didn't want compensation.

364
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,560
	She insisted on compensating me.|That's our relationship.

365
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,800
	Oh, that kind of relationship?

366
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,680
	What was that? Playing a knight|saving a damsel in distress?

367
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,120
	I didn't know we were alumni.|If I knew??

368
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,640
	- Then? You'd lend me some money?|- Pardon?

369
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,320
	I must be crazy.

370
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,040
	I'm sorry. I'm drunk. My thoughts|are jumbled and I'm babbling.

371
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,640
	Are you here to borrow money?

372
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,160
	You really are peculiar.

373
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,400
	People normally don't ask|so bluntly like that. It's rude.

374
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,640
	Once I sober up, I'm going to seek|some money. Why'd you follow me?

375
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,240
	I didn't follow you.|I have another appointment.

376
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,920
	Pretty Ja-ya is coming.

377
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,440
	Hello.

378
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,640
	- How have you been?|- You got even prettier.

379
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,040
	I'm going to get going. There is|someone I want to avoid meeting.

380
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,720
	I feel the same way. Then.

381
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,040
	Who is this?

382
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,320
	- Oh, Sin|Who is this?

383
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,720
	Aren't you Sewoon Medical School's|"3-second goddess"?

384
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,760
	I gave her the nickname because|she looks like a goddess at first,

385
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,840
	but after three seconds,|she looks like a beg-gar.

386
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,840
	I gave her the nickname because|she looks like a goddess at first??

387
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,440
	- Oh my, look at her.|- she looks like a beg-gar.

388
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,040
	Are you frowning at my roses now?

389
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,480
	- No.|- Why are you denying it? It's true.

390
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,160
	You must be jealous|knowing a fan gave me these.

391
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,120
	Why are you denying it? It's true.

392
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,080
	Sin Ja,|what do you mean by beg-gar?

393
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,440
	You still talk like a toddler.|Even on TV.

394
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,800
	"Don't dooo that!" Stop parading|your school name around.

395
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,560
	Hey! Yoon So-ah!|Hey! Yoon So-ah!

396
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,360
	Call me by my proper name.

397
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,680
	Yeah, I am saying it right.|Shin Ja-ya!

398
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,400
	- Shin Ja-ya!|- Oh, Shin Ja-ya!

399
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,160
	You shouldn't be like that. I am|leaving. It was nice seeing you.

400
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,720
	Your father. Has he returned yet?

401
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,320
	You know, Haiti or Somalia?

402
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,440
	Your father who went to|volunteer and never returned.

403
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,200
	Guys, do you know what|a wonderful person So-ah's dad is?

404
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,920
	He would bring all kinds o|homeless people and orphans,

405
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,960
	he would feed them, wash them,|dress them and make them study.

406
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,160
	- Like an angel without wings.|- Feed, wash, dress them??

407
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,400
	He was an angel like none other.

408
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,920
	And then junior year, was it?|There was an earthquake somewhere

409
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,040
	- and he left to do relief work.|- And then junior year, was it?

410
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,160
	We went to the same middle|and high school, so I know well.

411
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,080
	He was a wonderful person.

412
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,280
	Wonderful? Ha!

413
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,200
	Sure, he was wonderful.|Someone who was willing to

414
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,400
	trade his family's peace|for the love of humanity.

415
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,560
	Someone who was willing to|trade his family's peace??

416
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,520
	What are you doing?

417
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,880
	What are you doing?

418
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,600
	You! Stay quiet!

419
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,280
	Hey! Give me back my things. My...

420
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,800
	It's torn.

421
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,160
	Are you finished? I will talk now.

422
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,120
	Tell everyone I left. Also, I get|it that good deeds are mocked.

423
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,040
	With your pretty lips,|you don't have to drive it home.

424
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,240
	They say, if you are|not virtuous, at least pretend.

425
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,240
	You, enough with the social media.|Seeking attention is a sickness.

426
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,040
	In the social media that you love,|how do they call it?

427
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,080
	Oh yeah, attention whore.

428
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,160
	Well, that doesn't sound too nice.

429
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,120
	I am really leaving.

430
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,920
	What? Attention whore?

431
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,800
	That girl! Stop right there!

432
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,520
	- Enough is enough.|- Get lost.

433
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,080
	Hey! Yoon So-ah! Stop right there!

434
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,360
	Let's go.

435
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,760
	Guys, do you know what|a wonderful person So-ah's dad is?

436
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,480
	He would bring all kinds o|homeless people and orphans,

437
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,320
	he would feed them, wash them,|dress them and make them study.

438
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,960
	Hey! Who are you calling|an attention whore? Stop there!

439
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,720
	What is this?

440
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,040
	What are you doing?

441
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,080
	Who are you?

442
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,480
	What's your last name?|Is it possibly Shim?

443
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,160
	Don't you know me? It's me.

444
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,320
	You are quite similar to someone|I know with the last name Shim.

445
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,200
	Someone who's very rude, annoying,|and her last name is Shim.

446
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,960
	By chance,

447
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,760
	This person, really!

448
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,640
	I mean.

449
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,560
	That's that. Why are you|following my woman around?

450
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
	What? "My woman"?

451
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,040
	Yes, she belongs to me.

452
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,320
	If you want to bother her,|get my permission first.

453
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,200
	- It's Ja-ya.|- What's with that face?

454
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,040
	Her last name is Ja.|Thankfully she wasn't a Shim.

455
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,840
	How did you get here?

456
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,000
	I took a cab.

457
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,920
	It keeps on chattering,

458
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
	it's driving me crazy.

459
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,040
	I've warned you.

460
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,640
	Cab.

461
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,440
	Get in.

462
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,680
	The reason I ran recklessly|that night,

463
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,600
	wasn't to hold back my father|who had left us.

464
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,480
	It was so I could gather|the pain and turn it into strength.

465
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,720
	My father was going to|continue living his own life

466
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,440
	like he always had,

467
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,600
	and from then on|I had to support myself.

468
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
	That was the vague premonition|I had that night.

469
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,480
	That night, the pain I felt|all over was etched into me.

470
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,880
	Then I blamed it all on my father|and decided

471
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,760
	to live on with the power of|that hatred and loathing.

472
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,440
	I ran to let my father go.

473
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,880
	That was my last resort.

474
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,080
	Why did you bring me here?

475
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,040
	You didn't tell me where your|home is, so I brought you to mine.

476
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,040
	You could tell me where|you live now.

477
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
	Thank you.

478
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,080
	Where are you going? You just|take off after each time I help.

479
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,520
	- How do you call that here?|- Dine and dash.

480
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,560
	Right, dine and dash! You!|Are you dining and dashing?

481
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,680
	I will take care of the monthly fee|from my part time job.

482
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,440
	Moo Ra will pay you back|for everything.

483
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,160
	- Next.|- I have to go to work.

484
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,280
	It's something called|an electronic display.

485
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,680
	It's highly probable you saw her|on the news.

486
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,520
	She was probably accidentally|caught on camera or...

487
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,440
	You could recognize her for sure?

488
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,480
	I could recognize her even|with my eyes closed. My Moo Ra.

489
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,560
	- She's a woman?|- She's a goddess.

490
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,880
	So what's in|the natural man's world?

491
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,240
	Water, wind, trees, sky,|mountains,

492
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,000
	fish, air, birds.

493
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,560
	That's it?

494
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,800
	You said it's the gods' realm.|Those things are here too.

495
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,600
	The things here are rubbish.

496
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,120
	It's a smart move that the the two|realms weren't made together.

497
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,680
	Thank goodness that gods' realm|didn't turn out this way.

498
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,040
	Sure, sure.

499
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,760
	You can hold it.

500
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,040
	What?

501
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,200
	It's alright.

502
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,880
	It's the generosity|and duty of a god.

503
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,160
	She is still not appearing?

504
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,160
	It's distracting.

505
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,480
	The more distracting it is,|the better it sells.

506
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,160
	I wish you, "natural man,"|were really a god.

507
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,480
	A god can do anything, right?

508
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
	Can you get me that?

509
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,200
	If you carry out|your duties well as a servant,

510
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,600
	I could make as many of|those things as you'd like.

511
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,680
	Make it?

512
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,480
	Then that too?

513
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,840
	Yes. I just need to|snap my finger once.

514
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:14,040
	Oh. Then, that too?

515
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,840
	Yes.

516
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,080
	Then, how about that bridge?

517
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,320
	Of course, I can.

518
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,920
	How about this river?

519
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,080
	It's a piece of cake.

520
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,200
	How about the tree over there?

521
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,800
	I could even make you gold.

522
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,600
	Gold?

523
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,040
	My heart is pounding.

524
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,960
	I want to be richer than Mansur.|Make me some.

525
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,160
	I can't do it right away.|I told you I have my reasons.

526
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,000
	Yes, of course.

527
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,400
	There.

528
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,040
	She's there.

529
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,440
	She's there?

530
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,200
	It's her?

531
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,360
	I said she's a goddess.

532
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,880
	She is a goddess.

533
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,160
	Korea's most famous goddess.|Everyone's goddess, Hye Ra.

534
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,120
	Hye Ra?

535
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,320
	I guess she uses that name here.

536
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,600
	Everyone calls her a goddess.|It's not just you.

537
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,080
	You're right. She's radiant.

538
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,080
	She has a presence that|can't be hidden.

539
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,400
	Right.|But give it serious thought.

540
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,000
	Such a great goddess like her,|would she meet you?

541
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,080
	Don't worry about that.

542
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,920
	I am her master and her king.

543
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,960
	Excuse me.

544
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,080
	Your task is finished once|you take me to Moo Ra's castle.

545
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,440
	That means you|no longer have to be a servant.

546
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
	You still don't want to do it?

547
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,720
	I am here.

548
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,880
	I actually came.

549
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,080
	What do I do?

550
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,080
	It would have been nice if|Nam Soo Ri were here.

551
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,880
	What is this part-time work?

552
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,120
	Is it okay for me to do this?|Is it okay for me to do this?

553
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,760
	You've worked hard.

554
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,320
	You've been lacking, but you'll be|rewarded for your deed today.

555
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,640
	Once my situation is solved,|I'll give you everything you want.

556
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,600
	You may leave.

557
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,160
	Wait.

558
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,560
	Do you have to go?

559
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,520
	You still don't believe me.

560
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,520
	I want to show you, but Moo Ra|hates human women as much as me.

561
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,040
	It's for your sake. Get going.

562
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,040
	Wait, that's not what I mean.

563
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,080
	This isn't Hye Ra's home.

564
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,160
	That's not it.

565
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,080
	Fine,|please face the reality head on.

566
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,400
	He said I could leave.|I've done enough.

567
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,920
	Conscience? My conscience is|perfectly fine. And weird voices...

568
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:17,120
	Now that I think about it,|I'm not hearing things anymore.

569
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,520
	My conscience has recovered.|Let's hurry and go.

570
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,560
	What do I do?

571
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,680
	I guess that car broke down.

572
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,000
	Isn't that the lady doctor?

573
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,160
	Let's go.|Why are you unable to leave?

574
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,040
	She lives in a decent house.|First, I must take a warm bath.

575
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,400
	I am hungry too.|That's not possible.

576
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,000
	Her servants are|very well trained.

577
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,240
	Sir, can I assist you in|finding something?

578
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,760
	I could look for it on my own.|I want to surprise her.

579
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,920
	Then, have a nice time. Weird. Why|does he speak informally to me?

580
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,280
	She's nearby. I can feel it.

581
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,120
	You're not sick.|You're not here to find me.

582
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,680
	Why would I come here to find you?

583
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,360
	Right. Sorry, I went overboard|for a moment.

584
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,120
	Then, why are you spewing out|exhaust in front of my hotel?

585
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,680
	How is this your hotel?|Oh, I guess it is.

586
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,000
	Then...

587
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:32,920
	By chance, actress Hye Ra?帆she doesn't come here, right?

588
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,320
	Hye Ra... Are you talking about|my resort's spokesmodel?

589
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,840
	Look, Director. Don't you know|my goddess' style?

590
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,760
	Moo Ra.

591
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,120
	It's been a while, Moo Ra.

592
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,720
	Miss Hye Ra is in|the middle of a photo shoot.

593
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,160
	What did you say?

594
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,360
	What's the matter?

595
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,080
	No way!

596
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,160
	Won't you let go off me? Moo Ra.

597
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,640
	It's me, Ha Baek. Moo Ra.

598
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,160
	Am I messy beyond recognition?|It's because something came up.

599
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,480
	Things went wrong on|my way here.

600
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,080
	I've lost the coordinates.

601
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,520
	They are so many crazy people.

602
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,440
	Isn't he the guy who asked her to|sign an autograph on his back?

603
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,960
	How dare you touch me?!

604
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,840
	It doesn't look like it.|Oh, but that man is so handsome.

605
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,840
	Oh, what a waste.

606
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,960
	I'm sorry.

607
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,560
	Those shoes aren't the right ones.|Quickly please.

608
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,400
	You can't come.

609
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,720
	I think you need to leave.

610
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,960
	- Do it properly.|- Okay.

611
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,200
	How is that happening? How?

612
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,360
	Wait. Wait for a second.|He's my patient.

613
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,600
	I will talk. Please release him|and we could talk.

614
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,360
	Let go.

615
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,400
	I'm sorry.

616
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,960
	Get away from my servant.

617
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,160
	- Are you okay?|- Don't move.

618
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,480
	We will try to take care of this.

619
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,360
	Manager.

620
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,280
	- Call the agency.|- Yes.

621
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,360
	Look here. What are you doing?

622
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,160
	Talk it out, why did you slap him?|Why would you slap a person!

623
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,440
	Who are you?

624
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,240
	- I am his guardian.|- Guardian?

625
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,320
	I hit him for a reason and|he got hit because he deserved it.

626
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,080
	Who deserves to hit or get hit|in this world?

627
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,640
	He also pushed our bodyguards.

628
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,000
	Excuse me. You must think you're|a real goddess or something.

629
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,800
	A full moon wanes, a flower wilts.|You think it'll last forever?

630
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,240
	You won't. Don't be shocked after|you become all wrinkly.

631
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,000
	Prepare yourself mentally|before that happens.

632
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,280
	Please visit once.|I will give you a celeb discount.

633
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,080
	Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

634
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,120
	(Blessed Mental Health Clinic|Doctor Yoon So-ah)

635
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,080
	Get in.

636
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,280
	Why did you butt in?|It would have been over.

637
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,640
	- You really...|- You misspoke.

638
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,160
	Moo Ra is a real goddess.|She will last forever.

639
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,920
	Of course,|she will never grow old.

640
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:36,480
	For the first time, I wanted to|help you get out from your world.

641
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,520
	But I guess you don't have|any intention or will to get out.

642
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,560
	Either way|we live in different worlds.

643
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,600
	Fine.|Do you really want to meet a god?

644
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,800
	- I have to meet one.|- Okay.

645
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,520
	Hello, Yeom-mi.

646
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,920
	The patient that doctor brought|must be a zealous fan of Hye Ra.

647
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,520
	There was a brief chaos,|but ended without any accidents.

648
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,120
	The patient Yoon So-ah brought?

649
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:15,720
	Yes. He's the man we saw|in front of the hotel last night.

650
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,040
	Is that so?

651
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,040
	I guess Miss Yoon must use|a very unique treatment method.

652
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,000
	She seems like she's quite|dedicated to her patients.

653
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,400
	This is not the first time.|Don't pay him any attention.

654
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,520
	He assaulted our employee, too.|If he takes an issue with it,

655
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,520
	we have many things to say|in our defense.

656
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,600
	Manager Kim.

657
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,560
	- Yes.|- Shut up.

658
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,160
	Get some rest.|I'll come back when we're ready.

659
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,160
	Break for 10 minutes.|Take a break.

660
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,920
	- Where are you?|- Shanghai.

661
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,840
	- What are you doing there?|- I am trying to fly.

662
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,920
	It's not time for you to|leisurely fly like that.

663
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,680
	Hearing you speak,|I think it's time for me to fly.

664
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,680
	- He has come.|- Who?

665
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,640
	- Ha Baek came.|- What?

666
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,920
	I'm at a loss. He showed up|looking like a homeless person.

667
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,000
	I guess the red water|finally flowed.

668
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,440
	What should I do?

669
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,720
	Please calm down, young miss.|He will soon come looking for me.

670
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,120
	- He can't. Lost his coordinates.|- What?

671
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:45,200
	He said he lost other things, too.|I kicked him out for now.

672
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,160
	Setting other things aside,|regarding the divine stones,

673
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:54,200
	you and I are accomplices.|Don't forget that.

674
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,400
	How dare he come with a girl?

675
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,080
	The first thing you do in|the human world is seduce a girl?

676
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,800
	Ha Baek has come...

677
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,800
	I was about to get bored,|but it will be interesting

678
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:17,040
	Mystery, thriller, should we|make a jump to suspense?

679
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,120
	Okay.

680
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,440
	Is there really a woman|who knows a god here?

681
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,960
	That's right.

682
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,160
	I think she meets|with the god often.

683
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,640
	That's impossible.

684
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,120
	If it's Bi Ryeom, it's possible.|He's always led a wild life.

685
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,520
	Also, she says it's a woman.|Bi Ryeom loves women the most.

686
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,560
	- You wait here.|- Okay. Come back safely.

687
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,360
	I will try to figure out why|Moo Ra completely ignored you.

688
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,480
	- Completely what?|- Let's go.

689
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,440
	Why is it so empty?

690
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,160
	Because it hasn't been sold yet.

691
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,280
	It's been two years already|but it's still like this.

692
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,640
	She can predict others' futures well|but not her own future.

693
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,160
	What's not being sold?

694
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,120
	All that.

695
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,320
	Over here.

696
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,600
	Her name is Jo Yeom-mi.|She's a friend.

697
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,000
	That guy is Mr. B and Miss A with|the conscience problem is you?

698
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,160
	The one who's hearing this is you.|And Mr. B is saying he's a god.

699
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,280
	Listen to how he talks.

700
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:36,200
	He keeps saying he needs to meet|a god. You're the closest I know.

701
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,480
	I know, but he's rejecting|actual medical help.

702
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,400
	So for now, just try to figure out|what kind of world he lives in.

703
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,000
	I think that person is real.

704
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,080
	He's really someone|who can be possessed by gods.

705
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,600
	What?

706
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,680
	You look like Jude Law.|I heard from So-ah.

707
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,600
	Where is Bi Ryeom?|Bring him here right now.

708
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,080
	- I don't know such a person.|- You don't?

709
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,720
	Then have you met Joo Dong?

710
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,080
	Who is that?

711
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,040
	You say you're a person who has|met a god, that's why I came here.

712
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,080
	True, but the god I know is|neither this Bi Ryeom or Joo Dong.

713
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,560
	It's not? Then who is it?

714
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,080
	Did you meet one of the|garbage evil spirits who fell here?

715
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,200
	It's not an evil spirit.

716
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,440
	There is someone.

717
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,040
	Sigmund Freud.

718
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,120
	Okay. Let's hear what|you have to say first.

719
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,000
	You said you heard everything.

720
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,520
	This dim-witted servant is|lacking in everything she does.

721
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,960
	Listen well, insignificant human.

722
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,200
	I am the next Emperor of|the Realm of the gods,

723
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,560
	the next king of the Kingdom of|Water, the god of Water, Ha Baek.

724
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,440
	Park Sang-cheol called saying|it's the last time. He's desparate.

725
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,160
	Seriously, what's his deal?

726
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:42,520
	Call him and schedule|a time for tomorrow.

727
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,320
	He's really someone|who can be possessed by gods.

728
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,200
	Either way,|we live in different worlds.

729
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,360
	Whether it's here or there,

730
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,800
	At the end,|he's from a different world.

731
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,040
	It's only up till here.

732
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,800
	Don't care about it anymore.

733
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,040
	You have Vanuatu.

734
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,440
	What?!

735
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,000
	(Quack)

736
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,080
	How did it go?

737
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,120
	You don't know Dr. Hwang's number,|right? I'll send it to you.

738
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,800
	The Professor went to Kangwon|Psychiatric Hospital as a Director.

739
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,280
	Looking at this guy, he's totally|Professor Hwang's specialty.

740
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,920
	The Professor is the only one|who understands me.

741
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,120
	I know why you were having|a hard time. Send him there.

742
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,200
	- Yeom-mi, Yeom-mi.|- I'm late to my cooking

743
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,880
	- lessons so I'll be going first.|- Hey.

744
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,920
	This...

745
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,920
	Excuse me.

746
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,120
	You played me.

747
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,840
	- No, no it's not that.|- You foolish person.

748
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,760
	You can't really believe in me?

749
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,160
	No it's not that.

750
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,200
	Leave because this time I'll really|let you go.

751
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,480
	I just couldn't believe in those|things. This was best for you.

752
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,720
	How do you differentiate truth|from non-truth?

753
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,720
	Believing in what you want to|believe is the truth for you.

754
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,680
	Because it's easier|and less difficult for you.

755
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,000
	Some truths cover the eyes|that way.

756
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,160
	Your father abandoned us.|Just think it's like that.

757
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,200
	What do you think you know?

758
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:21,520
	Your trust is only what you|want to believe. It's easier.

759
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:27,080
	Some truths blind you like that.

760
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,480
	Your father abandoned us.|Just think it's like that.

761
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,800
	What's so important about|the truth?

762

	That guy, seriously!

772
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,040
	Let go!
