What?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,900
I told you I am a god.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,534
Lord Ha Baek. Your divine powers,
your divine powers...

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,400
They have finally returned!

11
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,300
Hooray!

12
00:00:54,133 --> 00:01:00,866
(The Bride of Habaek
Episode 4)

13
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,967
No, how, the divine powers?

14
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,866
The divine powers.

15
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,967
-Try again.
- Geez.

16
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,733
Try.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,400
How can the divine powers
go away again?

18
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,733
It's because of you.

19
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,967
It's because of you.
It's because of you!

20
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:54,367
Because of a thing like you,
do you know how I've been living?

21
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,600
Do you?

22
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:00,500
It's so unfair.

23
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,200
Don't!

24
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:05,300
Die.

25
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,700
Die. Die!

26
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:10,533
Die!

27
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,466
Save me!

28
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:46,500
I told you I am a god.

29
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,133
I must still be dreaming.

30
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,766
I am still dreaming.

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,033
It's a long dream.

32
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,700
I saw that humans do this to
check if it's a dream or not.

33
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:35,134
This must be part of a dream too.

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,134
It's not.

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
- It's a dream.
- I said it's not.

36
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,200
How can the divine powers...

37
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:44,133
How can the divine powers...

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,134
How can the divine powers...

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,967
How can the divine powers?

40
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,967
No way.

41
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,866
No way.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,300
No way.

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,667
How?

44
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,634
No way.

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,133
It has to be a dream.

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,734
No, it's impossible.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,200
This is from a guilty conscience.

48
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:24,667
I think your disorder is
more severe than I thought.

49
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,167
After the auditory hallucinations,
you're having visual ones too.

50
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,934
It's alright.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,034
Take some medicine. This is just
because of a guilty conscience.

52
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,700
It's because of you.
It's because of you!

53
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:40,966
Because of a thing like you,

54
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,767
Oh my, let me go.

55
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,366
- Let me go.
- Get a grip, woman.

56
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,766
You're always so fast at running.

57
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,366
Thank you.

58
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,300
Who was that man?

59
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,234
I don't know.

60
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,467
Think about it. Why would
someone hold a grudge against you?

61
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,534
This is bad. You can't
even report it to the police.

62
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,734
Report... I have to report it.

63
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,034
How can you tell them
someone tried to kill you,

64
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,300
but a good looking water dragon,
a god, showed up and saved you.

65
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,867
But how can he throw down
a person from there?

66
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,433
He's very wicked.

67
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,900
You were boasting about
a house like this?

68
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:30,400
When did I boast?

69
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,433
Go in.

70
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,833
Thank you.

71
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,667
Are you really a god?

72
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:52,834
Not a monster or a ghost.
Are you really a god?

73
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,800
Oh geez.

74
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,900
You are so different from
the god that I know.

75
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,866
Let's go.

76
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,533
What are you doing?

77
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,534
Lord Ha Baek's divine step has
crossed your house's threshold.

78
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,066
You must receive him, as you
have let the god into your house.

79
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,867
Oh!

80
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:37,034
Oh, look here.

81
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,933
No.

82
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,667
Do you believe that
Lord Ha Baek is the God of Water?

83
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,700
Answer! Do you believe it?

84
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:47,934
Do you believe it?

85
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,834
Yes, I believe.

86
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,300
You let a god into your house.
Are you going to ask him to leave?

87
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,734
I don't want to enter either.

88
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,500
What if the god, angered by this
blasphemy abandons this house?

89
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,300
I have abandoned it
a long time ago.

90
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:02,367
Then, this household will
attract all the misfortunes,

91
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:06,634
all the fortunes will bounce off.
None of your descendants will

92
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,467
live past the age of 20.
In other words, you'll live in hell.

93
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,367
What?

94
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:15,566
If you didn't feel confident,
you shouldn't have

95
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,167
let the god enter
your gate in the first place.

96
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:24,600
When did I…
when did I let him enter?

97
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,933
S-so that is.

98
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,334
Here it is.

99
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,500
This really makes no sense at all.

100
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,634
Really, this ungrateful
dine and dash woman.

101
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,866
How can you dare offer such
a place to me?

102
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,966
Where did she go?

103
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:22,434
We barely made it in.

104
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,600
I wouldn't have entered if
I knew it was like this.

105
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,600
You don't know what you're
talking about.

106
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,534
In this world, there's
a vast difference between having

107
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,900
a roof over your head
and not having one.

108
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,834
Don't worry. My boss at the duck
boat business thinks highly of me.

109
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,566
I'll do what I can so that
you can stay in comfort.

110
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,934
The human world is more interesting
than you might think

111
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,234
You should enjoy it
while you're there.

112
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,867
Damned old man.

113
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:20,100
I was jinxed by his words.

114
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,134
No way, no way.

115
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,733
No way.

116
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,400
(Song Il-gook)

117
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,567
(Hae Mo Soo, Lady Yoo Hwa,
Jeon Gwang-ryeol, Joo Mong)

118
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,766
(Water god)

119
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:03,333
No way.

120
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,133
No way!

121
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:18,566
Entered Mt. Gaeryong. Meditation
Period. Do not contact me

122
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,966
Oh yeah!

123
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,734
A god can do anything, right?

124
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,634
Can you make me that?

125
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,834
If you carry out
your duties well as a servant,

126
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,734
I could make as many of
those things as you'd like.

127
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,134
Then that, too?

128
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,900
Yes, I just need to snap
my finger once.

129
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:44,300
But why does he keep
hanging on to me then?

130
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:50,633
Hey.

131
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:54,334
I want to be richer than Mansur.
Make me one.

132
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,666
I can't do it right away.
I told you I have my reasons.

133
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,167
Reasons? What reasons?

134
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,867
There's a reason.

135
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:07,367
- It's strange, right?
-Yes.

136
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,167
There is a reason. It is...

137
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,134
No, leave it. What I hate most is
minding other people's business.

138
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,366
Oh, okay.

139
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,167
If you have any leftover rice...

140
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:26,200
You came here to find
the divine stones?

141
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:31,334
We're just supposed to
collect them. Nothing complicated.

142
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,633
But I don't know why it
turned out this way.

143
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:50,434
He's never gone through
anything like this in 2,800 years.

144
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,100
He hasn't even been able to take
baths which he loves so much.

145
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:58,000
He's 2,800 years old?

146
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:00,200
You're really not curious about
our situation?

147
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:04,866
Yes. What I hate most is minding
someone else's business.

148
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,800
- But then how do you do your job?
- Huh?

149
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:13,433
Isn't it your job to listen to
people's problems?

150
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:22,133
He lost his divine powers?

151
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,900
Ah then, he's not all that.

152
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,533
What is this?

153
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,467
What are you doing right now?

154
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,767
You can't do this here.
Get out, right now.

155
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:50,333
- It's noisy.
- Get out, right now.

156
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:57,267
No, no. Don't come out.
Don't. Stay there.

157
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,534
What are you doing?

158
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,766
Stay there.

159
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,067
Take this.

160
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,667
I just wanted to take a bath.

161
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,167
Baths...

162
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:13,233
- He can't even take baths...
- I don't need it.

163
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:19,467
You do need it. People are
looking. You'll be reported.

164
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:23,100
A police officer will come here.
Do you know what that is?

165
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:30,234
Reporting a person for enjoying
a bath really shows human nature.

166
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
That's not why they would
report you.

167
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,600
It isn't? Then why?

168
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,900
The crime of indecent exposure.
According to public morals…

169
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:43,166
Pull the towel up a bit more.

170
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:48,167
- Pull it up I said.
- You keep bossing me around.

171
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,800
Did you forget I am your owner,
a god?

172
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:54,400
I'm not sure about owner,
but I heard you lost your powers.

173
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:58,666
Is a god that lost his powers
still a god?

174
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,700
I have an eerie feeling.

175
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:28,400
I admit my powers are off
right now, but they'll be back.

176
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:34,900
Does a god stop being a god
because he lost his powers?

177
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:39,500
If you lose your humanity,
are you no longer a human?

178
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:44,800
Do you still not realize why that
flower keeps driving you crazy?

179
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,033
I'll help you remember.

180
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,733
Don't you dare test me.

181
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:08,600
I stopped those sounds. If I
forsake you, you'll suffer again.

182
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,534
- Are you threatening me?
- Threat?

183
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,767
Save the resentment for your
ancestor that made such a promise.

184
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:20,834
I don't intend to stay long. And I
doubt you'll be able to help.

185
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,766
Just do your part assisting me
so I can be comfortable.

186
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,934
You can't do even that?
Repay my kindness towards you.

187
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,566
After all, I did help you
and save your life.

188
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,467
Fine. I prefer repaying
the kindness than being a servant.

189
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:52,233
But this is the human world.
It is 2017 in Seoul, South Korea.

190
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,367
If you want to live well,
don't go around bathing naked.

191
00:19:56,433 --> 00:20:01,700
Also, humans aren't objects.
They can't be possessions.

192
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,567
What? Servant? Owner?
None of that either!

193
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:10,367
Also! If you kiss me again at
your own will...

194
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:13,966
- That's my right.
- I'll report you.

195

(Blessed Mental Health Clinic
Doctor Yoon So-ah)

196
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:18,434
- Are you okay?
- Who are you?

197
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,234
This person's guardian.

198
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,934
What are you, seriously...

199
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Miss Hye Ra!

200
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:31,600
- Long time no see CEO Sin.
- Sorry about yesterday.

201
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,600
There's no need for you
to apologize for my unruly fans.

202
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:40,400
I guess that doctor went overboard
trying to treat her patient.

203
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,667
- Do you know that woman?
- She is a good doctor.

204
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:47,734
Not sure if she is a good doctor,
but she sure seems rude.

205
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,267
Have you ever acted with
someone who is always sorry?

206
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,833
- Is there an actor like that?
- Ji Seong Ryeong.

207
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,466
Then, I'll be leaving now.

208
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,966
Was it awkward?

209
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,500
This is the list of landowners
for Block World.

210
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:19,800
It seems Chairman Sin won't
cooperate until his malls go in.

211
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,134
Don't worry about that
and focus on the other landowners.

212
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,800
Yes sir.
I'll be contacting them all today.

213
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,200
Should I set up a meeting with
Chairman Sin?

214
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,166
Yes.

215
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:39,000
- What kind of guy is good looking?
- Huh?

216
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,367
- A handsome guy.
- Sir?

217
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:48,067
The comedy show I like got
a new segment. It's very funny.

218
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,767
Why do you only watch
comedy shows?

219
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:56,300
Should I tell you a secret?
I actually don't find them funny.

220
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,766
The human ability I envy most
is humor. I just don't get it.

(Block World list of landowners,

We keep getting
strangely intertwined...

223
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,900
Yoon So-ah.

224
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:17,400
It's because of you.
Do you know how I've been living?

225
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,967
It's so unfair.

226
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:24,234
Think about it. Why would
someone hold a grudge against you?

227
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,833
I should report it.

228
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,134
How can you tell them
someone tried to kill you,

229
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,433
but a good looking water dragon,
a god, showed up and saved you.

230
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:47,133
I'm going to go crazy.
What should I do?!

231
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:56,334
Your hours are so inconsistent.
You lost a potential patient.

232
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,500
Delusion and OCD. Could have
been a long-term patient.

233
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:02,900
- Hey. I almost died yesterday.
- What?!

234
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:07,700
I went to Yeom-mi's store and
someone took me to the roof top

235
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:10,434
and pushed me. As I was falling
I thought I was going to die.

236
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,567
Suddenly the king of the Water
Kingdom showed up and saved me!

237
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,366
He wasn't handsome though.

238
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,067
What's up with you lately? Trying
to change your personality?

239
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:28,400
By chance, there isn't someone who
really hates our clinic, right?

240
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:32,300
Of course there is! Mr. Ma.
Should I read what he posted?

241
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,733
Hey!

242
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:42,234
There isn't possibly someone
who has a grudge against me...

243
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,500
You know, someone that
hates me enough to kill me?

244
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:49,100
There are a lot people like that.
Don't you know?

245
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,400

Wow, ten fingers is not enough.

248
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,134
- Who are those people?
- Don't you know?

249

They're my friends.

250
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:08,500
How would I know your friends?
Also why would they hate me?

251
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:09,667
Don't you remember?

252

Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday!

253
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:35,933
This beggar's cake doesn't even
taste good.

254
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,733
Take it off! They're my clothes.

255
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,133
Take it off!

256
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,200
Thanks for the meal.

257
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,100
Hey, Yoo Sang-yoo! Get out!

258
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,300
Get out, I said.

259
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:31,700
You were so tiny yet so mean
at the same time.

260
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:36,933
We used to say we were going to
teach you a lesson one day.

261
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:42,834
We were immature. But we still
talk about it when we meet up.

262
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,233
Why did I bring that up?
I am nostalgic now.

263
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:54,900
I ate my birthday cake that
I wasn't able to eat yesterday.

264
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:59,233
Dad said the cherry and chocolate
were mine and gave it to me.

265
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,266
(My birthday)

266
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:07,900
Dad, you're so mean! How can
you give it and take it back?

267
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,200
It's not too small on me.
Not too small!

268
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:13,633
Even if it's too small and
there are holes, it's all mine!

269
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,300
I told him multiple times
that I wanted to eat sausage…

270
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,666
You always give me kimchi...

271
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:41,900
I haven't done anything wrong.

272
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:45,233
I am the victim.

273
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,133
She gave us a key! We can
eat everything in the fridge.

274
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:03,700
This is a refrigerator. But I feel
sorry for the descendant.

275
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,966
- You call this clothes?
- That was all I could get.

276
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:17,967
I can't go like this.

277
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,134
Then let's go tomorrow. I need to
go to part-time job today

278
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,933
Call a taxi.

279
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,567
You go eat first. I'm fine.

280
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:42,900
You're a doctor. It's important to
eat three meals a day.

281
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:44,700
I don't want to go outside today,
okay?

282
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,467
Why?
Did you take up a private loan?

283
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:50,434
Are there debt-collectors outside?
I thought you were acting strange.

284
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,567
It's not that.

285
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:55,334
You can't do that, no matter how
tough it is! How much is it for?

286
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,067
Okay fine! I'm coming to eat,
I'm coming!

287
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:03,167
You can't take out private loans.

288
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:06,200
- I'll lock up!
- Okay.

289
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:13,166
I'd be happy if he just
got out of my life.

290
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:34,633
What's wrong?

291
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,334
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

292
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,834
I was going to ask for directions
and you treat me like a criminal.

293
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,033
Damn!

294
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:56,300
At this rate, I won't be able to
live out my lifespan.

295
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,866
What the heck?

296
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,500
What the heck!

297
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:17,033
Woman! Hey servant!

298
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:29,300
Hello.

299
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:32,500
What is this?
How did you get here?

300
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,134
- You must have taken a cab.
- You need to get me some clothes.

301
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,734
If I go like this to Moo Ra,
she's going to be insulted.

302
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,434
Why are you telling me that?

303
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,433
Who is it?

304
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:46,633
Who? I've seen you before.

305
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,200
- Hurry.
- Oh,

306
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,067
- Excuse me!
- Oh?

307
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,700
Won't you let go of him?

308
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:55,767
Let go. Are you not going to?
How dare you?

309
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,600
Let go of her hand first!

310
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:01,667
- Seriously, this guy!
- Let go of this. Let go.

311
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:03,466
Stop!

312
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,867
You have good taste.

313
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:48,867
Even though it's hanging here
like that, this is from Italy.

314
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:50,600
What do you think? It's nice.

315
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:51,767
How much is it?

316
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:55,500
$150. If it was at the department
store, it'll cost $1,000.

317
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:58,434
It's too bad it's not
a designer brand.

318
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,600
- Can't you lower the price?
- I'll give you $5 discount.

319
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,433
That's the perk of shopping at
an open market.

320
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,500
What's wrong with him?
Does he not need to try it on?

321
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:09,900
He's upset
that it doesn't have a brand name.

322
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:14,000
Brand name? It's the physique
that completes fashion.

323
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:18,800
His physique is good. Whatever he
wears becomes a luxury brand.

324
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:23,433
What does he lack that
he wants to cover up with cash?

325
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:29,400
Will he wear this and take
a picture if I take out $10 more?

326
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:31,366
So I can hang it up in the store.

327
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,934
- Deal.
- Deal!

328
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,034
If it was going to be this way,
why take me to a department store?

329
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,534
It's passive aggressive revenge.
It's a hard transition, right?

330
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,467
- What?
- Are you not hungry?

331
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:46,034
We've got some
time before Nam Soo Ri gets here.

332
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,300
I am a god. I do not feel hunger.

333
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:53,200
I heard you got kissed by
the voracious god.

334
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:09,867
Eat. There's no remedy for a god
who fainted from hunger.

335
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,566
I'm fine.

336
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,700
Geez...

337
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:28,766
Here, here. Here.

338
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,667
Ah, seriously!

339
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:37,067
I wouldn't do this unless
Mr. Nam Soo Ri begged me to.

340
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:42,333
Try to consider a subordinate's
feelings in this heat.

341
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,700
- I don't understand, but still.
- You sure do talk a lot.

342
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:50,900
Will... Moo Ra, or Hye Ra,
or goddess really fix it for you?

343
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:52,467
Yup.

344
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,667
I guess you have infinite trust
in that goddess.

345
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,300
Yeah. Moo Ra is like that.

346
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,234
Such things are possible.

347
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,800
It's possible to trust infinitely
someone else like that.

348
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:05,066
Isn't it kind of idiotic?

349
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:09,000
- You don't have a person like that?
- Like what?

350
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,634
A person you believe
in unconditionally.

351
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,400
Always on your side.

352
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:14,100
Shouldn't you have at least
one such person?

353
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:17,000
You learn after being totally
betrayed by someone you trusted,

354
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:19,633
how futile those things are.

355
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,534
Ma'am,
please give me some hot water.

356
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,366
Yes.

357
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:29,000
Why are you asking for hot water
in this heat?

358
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,000
Do you have stomach problems?

359
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,334
- Do you not like cold water?
- Yes.

360
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,866
- Why?
- Because it's cold.

361
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:48,567
Was it mid-winter when
you jumped in the water?

362
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,800
Why did you try to kill yourself?

363
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:56,100
What do you mean?

364
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:59,866
Who are you saying tried to
kill themselves?

365
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,100
Is it because of the person
who betrayed you?

366
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,866
- How silly.
- Look here...

367
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,200
Descendant, I am here.
Where should I go to?

368
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:17,866
We'll meet you there. Okay.

369
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,700
If you're not going to eat,
let's go.

370
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,933
Yes, where are you right now?

371
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,134
It's problematic if the water
god's servant is scared of water.

372
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,333
It doesn't make any sense.

373
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:54,100
What doesn't make sense is your…

374
00:35:57,566 --> 00:36:01,334
Should we make a deal?
One for me, one for you.

375
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,034
There's nothing to request of you,
as you know.

376
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,967
Please do not call me
your servant.

377
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:08,367
Now, what is your request?
Except for the department clothes.

378
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,100
I'll count to 5, if you can't
say it, it's over. 5 4 3 2 1.

379
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:14,900
I don't have a request,
but I do have a warning.

380
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:16,634
- Let's do that.
- A warning?

381
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,133
That's right.

382
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:27,100
Do not fall for me. If you
fall for me, there is no cure.

383
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:30,834
There really is no cure for you.

384
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,000
- I've warned you.
- Fine.

385
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,633
Fine.

386
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,866
There is no cure once
I fall for him?

387
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:52,067
Is that a joke?
Is that a parody or a satire?

388
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:56,000
He can't be serious. Goodness.

389
00:36:56,066 --> 00:37:01,066
If I open a clinic in god's realm,
I can become filthy rich.

390
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:06,466
- Oh, why are you calling?
- Where are you?

391
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,500
I am in front of the clinic.

392
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:13,167
Don't worry about them.
They are my neighbors.

393
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,667
If you continue to nag,
seriously...

394
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,200
The wasteland is about to be sold!

395
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,700
What?

396
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:21,834
- Very One resort?
- Yes, the company with wiper.

397
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,834
They are
building some type of resort.

398
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,900
The amazing thing is, the plan to
make roads on your land.

399
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:31,000
In other words, they need
your land to build the resort.

400
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:34,200
Then,
should I ask for a higher price?

401
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:38,366
Or rather, should I will ask for…
about 5 times the price?

402
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,334
- Hello?
- Who is it? Who is it?

403
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,734
Yes, she's back.

404
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,433
It's the resort.

405
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,367
Yes, hello?
Yes, I am the owner of the land.

406
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,667
Yes, yes.
I'm interested in selling.

407
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:58,267
- Are you available to meet today?
- Yes, of course...

408
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,866
Hello?

409
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:12,400
It is true that I am available to
meet today,

410
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:14,667
Yes, can we see you at your clinic?

411
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:18,334
No, please ask your CEO

412
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,300
to personally give me a call.

413
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:26,134
I have about 5 minutes left until
my next appointment.

414
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Then, I will be waiting.

415
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,366
What are you doing now?

416
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:44,100
Let me be the boss for a change.
He pissed me off so much.

417
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:48,066
- Try hard and earn money.
- Please pay me back then

418
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:53,034
Excuse me.

419
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,600
Your old personality hasn't died.

420
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,900
What if you play hard to get
and then he loses interest?

421
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:00,666
Wait and see.

422
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:28,100
Yes, Blessed Mental Health Clinic,
Director Yoon So-ah speaking.

423
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,166
This is Sin Hoo-ye.

424
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,834
Moo Ra is really amazing.

425
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,466
She found a way to live
as a goddess in the human world.

426
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:41,866
Only if her personality was
a bit more goddess-like.

427
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:46,400
Thank goodness she can't use her
divine powers to harass humans.

428
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:48,300
This is driving me nuts.

429
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:51,567
She doesn't just get angry
for no reason.

430
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:55,467
It's because you spoil her,
you received such a humiliation.

431
00:39:55,533 --> 00:40:00,033
If she finds out you lost your
powers, she'll look down on you.

432
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,267
That's why you need to
keep it a secret.

433
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,600
As you are careful.

434
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:07,733
What is this about?

435
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,633
M-Moo Ra.

436
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:23,966
You lost them?
You lost your divine powers?

437
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,367
Can you recognize me now?
Exactly what made you upset?

438
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,200
What do you mean you
lost your divine powers?

439
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:41,533
Don't worry, it's just temporary.
They will return soon.

440
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,067
We have suffered a lot.

441
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:51,200
There was no way to
find you. We had nowhere to go.

442
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:53,900
He got attacked by the
voracious god and became hungry.

443
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,100
You were attacked by
the voracious god?

444
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:58,400
You know Joo Geol Rin,
who challenged Lord to a duel.

445
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:00,534
I heard he fled from our world,
and he was here.

446
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,700
We finally found the descendent of
the god's servant, but…

447
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:07,067
The descendant of
the god's servant?

448
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,967
Then, that woman is...

449
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,634
She's slow beyond words.
We need to move to your place.

450
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,200
Where is Bi Ryeom and Joo Dong?
I will collect your stone first.

451
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,500
How have you been? Miss Yoon So-ah.

452
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:26,300
Isn't this place too casual
for business?

453
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:30,034
For some reason, I thought this
meeting wasn't business-related.

454
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,800
If not business-related,
why would I ask to meet you?

455
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:38,467
Would I ask to meet you regarding
the windshield wiper or the loan?

456
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,966
Please take a seat.

457
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,233
The land you are
interested in purchasing...

458
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:49,700
About that, there's a dedicated
team at my company. So, why…

459
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:54,200
Yes,
I insist on haggling with you.

460
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:55,834
Haggle?

461
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,367
- I was told you need my land badly.
- You're right.

462
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,700
I won't sell the land unless you
pay me 5 times the market price.

463
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,267
- No, I can't.
- What?

464
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,000
I can't give you the stone. I don't
know about Bi Ryeom or Joo Dong.

465
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,900
- And you can't stay at my place.
- What?

466
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:15,834
Did you forget? It's up to
the governing gods to decide.

467
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,534
Moo Ra, please collect yourself.
That's against the customs.

468
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,800
Until now the guardian gods of
the stones always protected them

469
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,734
and gave them to the king to-be.

470
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,966
How dare you
do that in front of me?

471
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:35,534
How can I accept a king who's
lost his powers? Look at you now.

472
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,900
If you were qualified, Bi Ryeom
and Joo Dong would be here.

473
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:44,200
Instead,
you have no idea where they are.

474
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:49,733
No. Then I won't sell it either.

475
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,900
Your land is important to us,
therefore, unlike other land,

476
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:56,300
we were going to offer
7 times as much as its value,

477
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,800
but
if it seems meddlesome,

478
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,534
I will price it
at 5 times as much as its value.

479
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,266
As you won't sell unless it's five
times the value, I have no choice.

480
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,466
I'll ask them to bring
the contract. Please review it.

481
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:12,366
No, I won't sell the land.

482
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,666
Oh, my.
I was really joking this time.

483
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:28,966
So, you…
are not qualified to be the king.

484
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,200
I am not qualified.

485
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:32,833
That's right.

486
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:38,866
Let's go.

487
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,467
- What can I do?
- What?

488
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,600
What do I need to do for you to
acknowledge that I am qualified?

489
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,734
- For me?
- That's right!

490
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,200
- Don't come near me.
- Tell me!

491
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:06,100
Report all the malicious comments
about me on the internet.

492
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:14,966
Gosh, seven times...

493
00:44:16,466 --> 00:44:18,500
It was seven times
as much as the price.

494
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:23,200
Isn't she the woman that we know?

495
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:25,533
Oh! Descendant.

496
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,400
Oh, right.
He said he will come here.

497
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,300
What are you doing here?

498
00:44:37,366 --> 00:44:39,134
Just meeting a friend.

499
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,667
A friend?
That weird lady from last time?

500
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:44,267
Did everything work out? So you
will be moving to Hye Ra's home?

501
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,667
What is a malicious comment?

502
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,133
What?

503
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:51,700
In such a situation, you asked him
to report malicious comments.

504
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:54,900
It was because I was flustered.
I didn't expect him to go that far.

505
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:57,567
You lost your ability to reason
when he asked what he could do.

506
00:44:57,633 --> 00:45:00,200
- That's not it, the divine stone...
- What else did you ask?

507
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:02,734
She asked you to be her bodyguard
for fan signings?

508
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,634
Yes, what's a bodyguard?

509
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,634
Is she really a goddess?
She's acting like a angsty teen.

510
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,466
Miss Yoon So-ah.

511
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,666
You had company.

512
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:29,766
Please give me a chance to resolve
our earlier misunderstanding.

513
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,334
If not, should I set up
a meeting for tomorrow?

514
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
No, no.

515
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:46,033
You can leave first. Let's go.

516
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,566
Her friend looks like someone
with a lot of gold.

517
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,033
A joke?

518
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:08,767
I don't think we're close enough
to tell jokes and laugh about it.

519
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:12,300
I want to get along with everyone
no matter what the relationship is.

520
00:46:12,366 --> 00:46:15,000
- Why?
- Why not?

521
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:18,200
- It's not possible.
- Why isn't it possible?

522
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:22,467
If you want everyone to like you,
you have to restrain your feelings.

523
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:27,234
Then you'll need a scapegoat to
relieve your pent-up stress.

524
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,033
In extreme cases, among murderers…

525
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,734
I went too far.

526
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,933
It's okay. It's your job.

527
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,367
I want to be a good person.

528
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:43,600
I want to help people in need,
and give back to society.

529
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,934
I want to be a person
who is useful in this world.

530
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,167
We have another person
going through puberty here.

531
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:53,667
- Can't I?
- It's not like you can't, but,

532
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:57,467
I knew someone who was
like that...

533
00:46:57,533 --> 00:47:00,066
He didn't meet a good end.

534
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:04,900
Yes?

535
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:07,767
I think you can go to see
Chairman Sin now.

536
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,166
Okay.

537
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:17,033
Here's the contract. 7 times is
still valid. Review it.

538
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:22,567
Grandfather!

539
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,634
A management agency.

540
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,934
Shut up!

541
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,634
I'm planning a shopping mall at
Block World. Take care of that.

542
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,200
You'll make 100 times more money
than smiling in front of a camera.

543
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:40,534
Goodness. I had to sell 2 of
my buildings to make you a doctor.

544
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,866
What has gotten into you
after graduating from med school?

545
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:48,300
Look at how you're dressed.

546
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,934
For a TV show, I had to eat black
bean noodles on a roller coaster.

547
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
My management agency didn't tell me
in advance.

548
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:58,167
But I still smiled on TV.
Why? Because I am a professional.

549
00:47:58,233 --> 00:48:03,834
Set up a management agency for me
so I don't have to struggle.

550
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,433
Look, look, look.

551
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:16,467
Go clean this and bring it back.
Make it like a wet wipe!

552
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,800
I won't!

553
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:21,267
That girl!

554
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,400
Come here!

555
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:25,900
Out of my way!

556
00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:35,600
Fine.
I know it's good to be a doctor.

557
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,634
But I can't be one.
I am not good enough.

558
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,700
I know a no-name celebrity
makes little money.

559
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:48,666
But I still like this.

560
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,366
I lost my appetite.

561
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:15,567
What?

562
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,434
Wipe yourself before you get off.
You're a star.

563
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,200
Why do you care?

564
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:35,566
Hey! Hey!
I don't need this, take it!

565
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,333
What's with him?

566
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,600
(Real Estate Letter of
Intent and Contract)

567
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,933
Seven times,
seven times the value!

568
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,466
Ouch!

569
00:49:56,466 --> 00:49:59,000
Should I pinch it even harder?

570
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:00,933
I will be quite busy from now.

571
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:02,600
Finally...

572
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,966
(Vanuatu)

573
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:12,534
International driver's license,
medical exam results in English,

574
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,000
background check, registration.
Deposit's been taken care of.

575
00:50:15,066 --> 00:50:17,300
Moving will cost thousands of
dollars. By the way,

576
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:21,000
I will refer you to
a good hospital, so don't worry.

577
00:50:21,066 --> 00:50:24,167
I have many offers already.

578
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,434
Let's go for a celebratory drink.

579
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,700
- I have to go to my part-time job.
- Hey! Ditch it.

580
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,434
The things you do with a lukewarm
non-alcoholic barley drink.

581
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,767
Misfortune follows a lucky event.

582
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,434
You saw what happened with
the diamond ring last time.

583
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,234
Then you shouldn't have come
to a bar.

584
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,467
Why do you hate Korea so much?

585
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:56,600
You're the weird one. Don't yo
know the term "Hell Joseon"?

586
00:50:56,666 --> 00:51:00,534
People like you in their 20s coined
that term. People want to leave!

587
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,234
But still, I like my country.

588
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,800
What if you like it?
Korea doesn't like you.

589
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:06,900
What?

590
00:51:06,966 --> 00:51:09,800
- Korea likes other types of people.
- What kind of people?

591
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,167
Today, I met two people
who don't know the world.

592
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:16,834
Well, one is not human. Do you
know what they have in common?

593
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:22,234
Both were born with a silver
spoon. For them, life is a hobby.

594
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,467
So, they say ridiculous things
like "my side," "giving back."

595
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:28,567
Doctor.

596
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:33,034
But actually, Korea secretly likes
people like that.

597
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,067
And you're the opposite of them.

598
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:39,800
Korea outwardly applauds you
but secretly they don't like you.

599
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,500
There was a reason we don't have
many patients at our clinic.

600
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:47,434
When the senior doctor returns,
I will get a serious scolding.

601
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,367
I was supposed to care for you.
But look at your mental state.

602
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:52,966
Gosh, don't ruin my mood.

603
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:57,100
Hey, let's go to karaoke.

604
00:51:57,166 --> 00:52:02,034
I heard that Hye Ra dates 6 guys,
for each day of the week.

605
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,967
Queen of silicone.
She thinks she's a goddess.

606
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:08,967
Things like these are called
malicious comments.

607
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:12,234
Moo Ra must have
gone through a lot here.

608
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,000
If I click here, the malicious
comment will get reported.

609
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,000
But you don't know how to
read Korean.

610
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:21,367
This will teach you to read.

611
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:25,033
Gi-yeok, nee-eun…

612
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,600
By the way, why is this woman
not coming home?

613
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,467
She will come.

614
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:40,966
An old fox... report this.

615
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:47,700
- What did you say?
- What are you looking at?

616
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:50,034
What's this sound?

617
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,800
Oh, it's the sound human got
drunk and fighting.

618
00:52:52,866 --> 00:52:57,800
Many weird things happen
at night in the human world.

619
00:52:57,866 --> 00:53:01,000
Hit me! Hit me!

620
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:27,533
"When I am watching her acting,
I want to rip her..."

621
00:53:28,966 --> 00:53:32,634
"I want to rip her face off."

622
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,934
Rip her face off? Report.

623
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,267
"Be careful not to...

624
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:44,367
not to... run into me once."

625
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:48,933
Report. Jeez.

626
00:54:05,466 --> 00:54:08,833
It's really getting on my nerves.

627
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,900
If you continue to do this,
I'll show off my skills a capella.

628
00:54:26,966 --> 00:54:28,800
Hey!

629
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,900
What are you doing here?

630
00:56:27,966 --> 00:56:31,567
I was thinking of how to
get my divine powers back.

631
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:35,566
Why are you thinking about
this here? Let's go.

632
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,933
Think about that at the entrance
of this alleyway next time.

633
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:48,600
What is this smell?

634
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:53,167
I bought some fried chicken
with sauce.

635
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:57,100
Something really
great happened today. My treat.

636
00:56:57,166 --> 00:57:00,133
I won't eat.

637
00:57:01,466 --> 00:57:03,600
Have you eaten?

638
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:07,300
I told you already that
I don't need such things.

639
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:10,166
Rice.

640
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:13,233
Rice.

641
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:18,533
-Ri- i- ice...
- Stop it, stop. Stop!

642
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:25,700
- I found out how it works.
- No.

643
00:57:25,766 --> 00:57:31,000
It's an awakening. Accept that
you're a god that feels hunger.

644
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:34,567
That's a very noble realization.

645
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:37,200
That woman.

646
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:41,800
Rice!

647
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:47,733
Funny.

648
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,834
Why are you in such a good mood?

649
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:56,067
I met a real god today.

650
00:57:56,133 --> 00:58:01,866
- What are you talking about?
- A real god who will rescue me.

651
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:15,867
Who is tricking you this time?
Good looks don't mean he's a god.

652
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:18,867
- What is a god?
- What?

653
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:23,500
He's a superior being who makes
humans' wishes come true.

654
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,000
That's what a real god is.

655
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:32,067
I'm a real god…

656
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:38,166
Sure. Did you report all the…
Oh, you don't know how to read.

657
00:58:38,866 --> 00:58:40,933
Give me that.

658
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:48,767
(Yoo - n...)

659
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,967
(S-o...)

660
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:53,033
(A-h)

661
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,234
Huh, you know?

662
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,034
Feel honored.
It's my first writing.

663
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,100
My name is written like this.

664
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:06,600
(H-a...)

665
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:12,800
(B - a - k.)

666
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,100
(ae)

667
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,633
(Ha Baek
Yoon So-ah)

668
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:01,367
Woah, what is this? Have some.

669
01:00:01,433 --> 01:00:03,733
No need.

670
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:09,634
- I've seen things.
- What have you seen?

671
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,466
Geez.

672
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:14,300
That day, at the Han River,
after I left.

673
01:00:14,366 --> 01:00:16,433
You ate off the ground.

674
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,734
After drawing lines,
look at you now.

675
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,100
You finally understand
how betrayal and hunger feels...

676
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:29,800
I am sure you're a better king
than you were yesterday.

677
01:00:29,866 --> 01:00:34,600
- What are you saying?
- You're getting proper training.

678
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:39,834
So, did you find out
what a bodyguard is?

679
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,034
Yes, to celebrate learning
how to read...

680
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,667
There was a movie, "Bodyguard."
He watched it.

681
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:48,966
It is a nice profession.
It's worth experiencing.

682
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,400
Don't underestimate humans...

683
01:01:02,466 --> 01:01:04,133
She's coming out!

684
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:06,466
She's come.

685
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:12,267
- Lord Ha Baek!
- Let go!

686
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:15,433
Stop!

687
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:36,033
What's the matter with you?

688
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:53,166
To be honest,
you think I am a failure.

689
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:56,467
You just touched your nose.

690
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:59,900
If you lie, your hormones cause
nose congestion.

691
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,534
So, you end up touching your nose
without realizing it.

692
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,000
No, my nose was just itchy
so I scratched it.

693
01:02:06,066 --> 01:02:11,400
You yawned last week for
the same reason. And before that.

694
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:16,567
So-mi, it's been 2 hours already.
You're just nitpicking.

695
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:20,700
- At this rate, how can I...
- Forget it.

696
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:23,533
I am suddenly in a bad mood.

697
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:38,633
Let's be a little more patient.

698
01:02:43,366 --> 01:02:48,367
- Seriously?
- Sorry. I knew it wouldn't work.

699
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:53,300
I can't trust a king-to-be
who lost his divine powers.

700
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:55,366
Moo Ra.

701
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:03,600
Geez, seriously. I am going crazy.

702
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,400
- Hello?
- I can't do this anymore.

703
01:03:08,466 --> 01:03:10,700
Take over!

704
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,500
What? What do you want?

705
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:22,267
Give me your car keys. I need to
go on a drive to relieve "stress."

706
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:25,534
Just go home.

707
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,700
If you won't give me your keys,
I will break into the car.

708
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:33,233
- W-what?
- I will look it up online.

709
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,734
I want to drive.

710
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:47,434
I want to kill him.
Where can I find instructions?

711
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,366
Blasphemy.

712
01:03:55,166 --> 01:04:00,267
Fine. Let's do it. Since I'm very
tired too, let's go for a drive.

713
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:04,166
- I will drive.
- Put on your seat belts.

714
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:17,500
In any case,
I'll charge you for gas.

715
01:04:56,633 --> 01:05:00,700
- My neck gets cut off.
- It's fine as long I'm in it.

716
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,733
Come here.

717
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,567
I guess my car wasn't enough.

718
01:05:26,633 --> 01:05:32,700
Your engine makes a weird sound,
and the exhaust and hood, too.

719
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:37,100
You need to tighten
the bearing preload adjustment.

720
01:05:37,866 --> 01:05:40,567
- When'd you get your car checked?
- I'm speechless.

721
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:46,434
Can you really learn and
do everything by seeing it once?

722
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:51,833
- Even without your powers?
- God is a god for a reason.

723
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:55,967
By the way, Natural Man…
I am curious about something.

724
01:05:56,033 --> 01:06:00,400
Who's the mother of Lady Yoo Hwa?
I can't find information on her.

725
01:06:01,466 --> 01:06:06,900
- Who's Lady Yoo Hwa?
- Your daughter. Ju Mong's mom.

726
01:06:06,966 --> 01:06:11,734
You're King Yu Ri's grandfather.
So who's your wife?

727
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,467
I am not married.

728
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:17,266
What's the point of pretending
to be single?

729
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:37,833
I had a really hard day today.

730
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:47,134
I wish you
still had your divine powers.

731
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:53,200
If you had your powers, could you
make a blue sea with corals?

732
01:06:53,266 --> 01:06:54,967
Of course.

733
01:06:55,033 --> 01:07:01,234
Could you make fine sand
and pretty sunlight too?

734
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,967
I want to go into the sea.

735
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:08,966
I can see the sea.

736
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,133
I want to swim.

737
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:20,300
The water isn't scary at all.
I'm not lonely even if I'm alone.

738
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,900
- What are you doing?
- Not alone. I have to be here.

739
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:35,600
Damn it. I wanted to be alone.

740
01:07:53,366 --> 01:07:56,034
- What is it this time?
- You can't swim.

741
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:01,066
- I'm doing it, right now.
- Is that so? I'll let go.

742
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,734
No, wait.

743
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:11,500
Damn it. I was just doing it. Why
do I suddenly feel like I can't?

744
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:19,333
Leave it to me. At least in
the water, I will keep you safe.

745
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,633
I'm sorry.

746
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,100
What for?

747
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,534
Did you try to kill me on purpose?

748
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,067
If you started it,
you need to see it to the end.

749
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:35,434
What kind of god is so pathetic?

750
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,034
You won't be able to live
as you wish.

751
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,200
- God's servant?
- Why do you need such a thing?

752
01:09:41,266 --> 01:09:42,534
No, no.

753
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,734
I am a bit excited.

754
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,600
I haven't been like this with you
because of Ha Baek in a while.

755
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:49,167
How can you two be
so irresponsible?

756
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:52,233
I am sure he's not doing this
for her.

757
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,600
Thank you for saving my life.

758
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:58,500
I promise I will keep you safe.
