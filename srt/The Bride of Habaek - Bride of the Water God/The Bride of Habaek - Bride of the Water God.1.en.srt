(The Bride of Habaek)

3
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,653
What do you see?

4
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,153
- Is a bird flying around?
- That is so.

5
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:42,586
The bird-animal is flying,
but where is he headed to?

6
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,753
Probably gone to the world beyond.
Can't you see? Look carefully.

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,253
Mm, I do not see it.

8
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,753
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes.

9
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,753
Now, let's take a good look.

10
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:02,320
It's said that the world
we live in is divided in two.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,253
We live on this side and on
the other side, live the Gods.

12
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,000
Gods?

13
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,053
The realm of the gods is divided
into the Water Kingdom,

14
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:18,953
the Kingdom of Heaven
and the Kingdom of the Earth.

15
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:22,053
The God's Realm sends governing gods
over here

16
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:25,800
to take care of nature in
the human realm.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,753
Do they not take care of humans?

18
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,886
The humans probably take care of
themselves.

19
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,986
The Kings of the Water, Heaven,
and Earth kingdoms

20
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:39,400
are Gods destined to become Kings
from the moment they are born.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,086
The God of the Water Kingdom,
the origin of everything,

22
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:47,520
was given absolute power as
the Emperor of the Gods' realm.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,753
The new emperor can only
ascend the throne after

24
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,220
making a seal out of three divine
stones with oracle inscriptions.

25
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,420
The stones are divided among the
governing gods in the human world.

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,920
So if someone wants to become
the Emperor of the gods,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,020
they would have to come here
and get them?

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,486
Probably.

29
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:07,753
What if the governing gods
don't give them to him?

30
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,120
That's something only humans do.

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,420
But something´s weird.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,266
Why are the divine stones
in the human world?

High Priest.

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,053
It's time for the red water
to arrive.

48
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:09,786
For the first time in 3000 years,
there will be a new emperor.

49
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,733
Where is Lord Ha Baek?

50
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,186
You are so gracious, giving this
chance to such a lowly being.

51
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:53,153
Now that I am drawing your
noble portrait,

52
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:56,853
I definitely understand why
the spirit of the universe

53
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,866
chose you as the next emperor.

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,366
Now, if I could see your eyes...

55
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:17,466
It's the finishing stroke.

56
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:26,220
Lord Ha Baek. This is a message
from the High Priest.

57
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,286
Enough. His messages are like
birds carrying food over daily.

58
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:34,833
The Water Kingdom's water has
turned red.

59
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,633
He says you have to be ready.

60
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,786
- Does the King know too?
- He is glad.

61
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,420
He had been waiting for a long
time for the water to turn red.

62
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,186
It's understandable that he grew
tired after such a long reign.

63
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:06,486
This is the location of gods
who have the stones with them.

64
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,100
These coordinates will
guide you accordingly.

65
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,766
Lord Ha Baek.

66
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:26,953
For the Water Kingdom it must be
Moo Ra,

67
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,486
for the Earth Kingdom, Joo Dong,
but who from the Heaven Kingdom?

68
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,100
It is Lord Bi Ryeom.

69
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:33,353
Bi Ryeom?

70
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:37,253
You must have the coronation
when the red water flows 7 times,

71
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,053
so you need to get the divine stones
before the last tide is here.

72
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,486
- I´ll come back right away.
- Why?

73
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:46,653
The human world is more
interesting than you might think.

74
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,753
As there is time before the last
tide, enjoy the human world a bit.

75
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,933
I am not interested.

76
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,800
More than that, why does such
a meaningless custom still remain?

77
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:06,300
Is there any form of existence in
the world that has no meaning?

78
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:13,286
When I become Emperor, I will
eliminate these obsolete customs.

79
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,786
Yes,

80
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,420
Yes. If you become Emperor,
you can do that.

81
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,753
It sounds as if you are questioning
whether I can become Emperor.

82
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:25,753
Not at all. You were destined to
become Emperor since birth.

83
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,620
It means you´ll become Emperor
even if you do nothing.

84
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,586
Unless the person has an abnormal
soul, who will deny such a fact?

85
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,320
What is the connection between
becoming the Emperor and humans,

86
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,486
that the divine stones have to
remain in the human realm?

87
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:43,120
I see.

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,120
Since you asked a question,

89
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,353
you could stay there
and find the answer.

90
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:52,333
It was not a question.

91
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,153
You must have heard of
the god's servant, right?

92
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:01,320
A human, promised to be a servant
from generation to generation.

93
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,953
If difficulty arises, find
the descendant of that family.

94
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:10,353
If you show this to that person
and say a couple of words,

95
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,186
they will automatically awaken
and they will accept you as a god.

96
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:15,700
I don´t need it.
I will not go find him.

97
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,053
It's a woman.

98
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,420
Should I show you her face?
She's not from the Shin family.

99
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,620
It's okay.

100
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,653
Nam Soo Ri will assist you.

101
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:32,720
Even if it's inconvenient, keep
the divine item on your body.

102
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,633
Don't put it in your clothes.

103
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:40,586
The Heaven Kingdom must be doomed
to have sent Bi Ryeom.

104
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,520
Do you think he would do
a proper job?

105
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,020
Why do you hate him so much?
You guys used to be best friends.

106
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,520
He has no class.

107
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,986
And I cannot trust him.

108
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,053
Shouldn´t you study the human
world a little before you go?

109
00:08:55,133 --> 00:09:00,486
This is the reason I am taking you.
I heard you have been there.

110
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:03,186
I know most things.

111
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:07,720
The moment you pass through
the Gate of gods, it will tingle.

112
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,086
Prepare the best clothes
among human clothing.

113
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,133
Also prepare a gift for Moo Ra.

114
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,953
Have you seen the servant's face?
I heard it's a woman. She pretty?

115
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,786
Yes, I see.

116
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:26,186
Alien gods from the Intro-Q 2544
planet gave me a prophecy.

117
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:31,153
The alien god in charge of me is
TF1-003 and it seemed very urgent.

118
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,786
Oh, is that so?

119
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:36,620
There are earthly partners like me
who carry out the prophecy.

120
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,320
It's a point organization
scattered all over the world.

121
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,566
But the strange thing is that...

122
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:48,653
Why did they give this prophecy
to me and not the USA partner?

123
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,053
That´s the thing.

124
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,386
I know, why is that?

125
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:56,953
Moo sosos skaegara obama tatttata.

126
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:01,686
"Tell Obama that world peace
is under threat."

127
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:04,220
That´s what it means.

128
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,400
Doctor, by chance...

129
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:12,333
I don't know the address,
so what should I do?

130
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,566
Do you know that he's out of
the White House?

131
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:23,586
Ko ko nek ko ko ko? Ji ji ba ba

132
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,633
ji ji ba ba ba ba?

133
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,186
You don't believe me either,
Doctor, right?

134
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,720
Ah, no, there's no way.
Please, patient?

135
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,700
PATIENT? PATIENT?!

136
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,820
- Patient?
- WHO'S THE PATIENT? WHO?!

137
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,320
Oh, yes, Mr. Ma Bong-yeol. I will
somehow find Obama's address.

138
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,233
Do not lie to me!
You don't even believe me!

139
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,853
Ah, Doctor, Doctor!

140
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:01,253
Nobody believes my words.
World peace will be...

141
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,853
Please let me go.

142
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:09,086
Client. Client.

143
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:13,433
You are right that
world peace will be in danger.

144
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,053
Y-You... You know how to
speak our language?

145
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:21,400
Of course, nice to see you.

146
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,120
Nice to meet you.

147
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,586
Let's leave. Let's leave.

148
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,286
This way.

149
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:33,666
Let's leave.

150
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,186
- How can you communicate?
- I studied.

151
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,820
There are uniform symbols like
the alphabet.

152
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,820
Bong-yeol has always been smart.

153
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,300
You're better than me.

154
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,386
The guardian wanted to
hospitalize him, right?

155
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,820
I can't do it.
Set up a consultation.

156
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,986
Ah, you can't give up on him
so easily.

157
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,720
Give up easily? Hey, I've seen him
for a year, a year!

158
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,966
Is it easy to accept failure?
Shall I hold on just for my pride?

159
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,866
- I'm getting sick of it, too.
- Okay.

160
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:11,200
Half of them are notices of
late payment.

161
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,686
The bank said the extension isn't
possible, and to come tomorrow.

162
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,220
What?! Why not?

163
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,453
Our revenue isn't great, and you
haven't paid the interest on time.

164
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,720
If they won't extend it, are they
saying we should close down?

165
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
It seems that way.

166
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,500
Go.

167
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:30,353
Give me your gown.

168
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:33,066
- I'll wash it for you.
- Forget it.

169
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,420
Let´s have a drink together.

170
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,300
Why would I drink with you?

171
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,800
I forgot to give you this earlier.
The land in Gangwon Province.

172
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,700
(Bill for property tax)

173
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,886
Have you not sold that land yet?

174
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,853
Who would buy such
a useless wasteland?

175
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,953
Why did my dad leave behind
such land.

176
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:03,920
You're late on rent too. Half the
deposit's been deducted already.

177
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,420
But why are you stuck by my side?
Just leave.

178
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,720
Of course I am here to pay back
the favor. The senior doctor-

179
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,500
Forget it!

180
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,133
I don´t want to hear it.

181
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,986
But is your dream still the same?
Leaving Korea?

182
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:29,820
Yep. If I can settle my debt,
I am going to go off to Vanuatu.

183
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,220
Meet a man that can settle
your debt. And just live here.

184
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,886
I don´t want to. I hate Korea.

185
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:41,586
Isn't it that men hate you?

186
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:46,766
Hey. I even received a diamond ring
from a 2nd generation chaebol!

187
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,966
I found it.

188
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,266
Why wouldn´t he just believe me?
I said I received one.

189
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:08,333
You were meant to be mine all
along, that's why you were here!

190
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:14,220
And his name is An Bin, An Bin!
What a silly name.

191
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,500
Please take care of the various bills
and the interest on the loan.

192
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,466
My beloved Vanuatu.

193
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,700
That´s right. That´s living.

194
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:05,333
This rotten country where you can´t
even see any stars properly...

195
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,700
Money! Please make me rich!

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,133
Hey woman! Woman?

197
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,266
I will graciously honor you by
briefly borrowing this from you.

198
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:39,433
Listen here, Woman, wake up.

199
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,333
You shouldn't be sleeping here.

200
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:49,433
She's a very bothersome person.

201
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:00,966
What?

202
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,500
What happened?

203
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:48,566
Hey, you thief!

204
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,833
A thief? Such a rude woman!

205
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,600
I will punish her next time.

206
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,886
What in the world happened?

207
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:12,886
Nam Soo Ri.
What happened to Nam Soo Ri?

208
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,086
Lord Ha Baek, are you alright?

209
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,386
What happened?

210
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:21,020
I don´t know. I fell on that side.

211
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,186
But... why do you look like this?

212
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:25,820
And why are you wearing
my clothes?

213
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,333
What?

214
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,666
How did that happen?

215
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,733
Switch.

216
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,286
It's strange,

217
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,920
the Gate of gods is different from
when I came 55 years ago.

218
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,553
There's a saying that even mountains
and rivers change in 10 years.

219
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:50,833
No, the land used as the
Gate of gods never changes.

220
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,333
Then there's no doubt something
went wrong on our way here.

221
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,053
Where's the map
with the coordinates?

222
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,900
What? You don't have it?

223
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:15,266
You should use your divine power
to look for it.

224
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,433
Have you found it?

225
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,800
Why?

226
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:37,086
It's strange.
Something from my body...

227
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:41,800
has slowly... left.

228
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,820
How could this happen... How can
your divine power disappear?

229
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,553
Let's return to the Water Kingdom.
Take me to the Gate of gods.

230
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:17,886
Can't. A god can only return after
accomplishing their mission.

231
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,953
I told you to study up...

232
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:24,333
Let's find the descendant of
the god's servant. We need her.

233
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,500
You don't have it?

234
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,700
What do we do now?

235
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,186
I'll first find some clothes
to change into.

236
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:47,053
I'm okay.

237
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,366
I'm not okay.

238
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,720
Just stay right here.

239
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,620
Y-You can't be confident,
or dignified,

240
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,653
or command anyone, okay?

241
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,466
I understand.

242
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,200
Damn it!

243
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:13,633
No, this can't be.

244
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,400
It's only a temporary symptom.

245
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,486
When I first went to
the Heaven kingdom,

246
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:25,300
things didn't go my way either.

247
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,900
Ah, so where are you saying
you are again?

248
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,900
How many times do I have to tell
you that someone stole my ring?

249
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,020
I´m not drunk.

250
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,053
I'm Ha Baek

251
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:05,466
Why did I come to the park?

252
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:11,186
I told you.
I came to find the diamond ring.

253
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:14,000
What? Delusion? Hey.

254
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:20,253
- Where are you?
- I'm Ha Baek.

255
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,620
Just respond to
the questions that I ask, okay?

256
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,753
I'm Ha Baek.

257
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,620
Ah, where are you, you fart?

258
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,953
I'm Ha Baek!
- Where?

259
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,033
I'M HA BAEK!

260
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,200
That scared me.

261
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,800
Because I'm Ha Baek.

262
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:10,853
Yeah, yeah, it's working well.
Nothing wrong with the mechanism.

263
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:15,033
Turn it off for now. Let's turn it
on and off a couple of times.

264
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,666
That woman.

265
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,366
Who is he? Is he coming to me?
Is he someone I know?

266
00:23:57,966 --> 00:24:00,700
I don't know who he is...

267
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:06,266
Woman!

268
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,120
You thought wrong. I was only
borrowing it for a moment.

269
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,633
Yes?

270
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,153
M-Me?

271
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:18,466
Tell me your name and residence,
Nam Soo Ri will compensate you.

272
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:22,333
What do you need?

273
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,820
Mental disease really does not
discriminate based on looks.

274
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,120
Excuse me, your family must be
very worried, so please head home.

275
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,186
- Don't refuse and tell me.
- It's alright.

276
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:37,420
Such arrogance!
I told you to speak, not to leave!

277
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,233
Ah, seriously.

278
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,633
Mu mu sa shi (gibberish)

279
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,253
Is it a delusion?

280
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,700
I said, what do you need?

281
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,633
Money?

282
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,400
Money?

283
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,333
Money?

284
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,066
What is that?

285
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:17,666
Never mind...
please return home quickly. Then.

286
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:23,686
- Will you not let go of me?
- Your name and where you live.

287
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,353
If you don't let go,

288
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,053
- I'll report you.
- Doctor!

289
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,520
What are you doing? Let go.

290
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,920
Oh, let's release her.
Please do not do this!

291
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,686
So rude! How dare you!

292
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:39,286
What's wrong with your forehead?
Did you hit her?!

293
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:41,153
No, let's go.

294
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,486
I am the god of Water, the next
King of the Water Kingdom,

295
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,700
the next emperor of
the Gods' Realm,

296
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:48,766
I am Ha Baek.

297
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:58,333
Of course you are. It's
the beginning stages of delusion.

298
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,733
Here.

299
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:14,520
It's not far, so stop by. Our
doctor is very effective.

300
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,566
Make sure to come!

301
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,886
You know being a psychiatrist is
your calling, right?

302
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:32,520
People who need you, are able to
find you day and night.

303
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,253
Be quiet.

304
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:39,453
Even if you go to Vanuatu,
only those people will find you.

305
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,053
Isn't it better to not go?
Isn't our country better...

306
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,620
Where's the nearest
police station?

307
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,720
Police station?

308
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,320
- Are you going to report it?
- Yeah.

309
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,053
Please hold it in.
You can't do that.

310
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,653
I'm going to report
the theft of my diamond ring.

311
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,720
Are you still drunk?

312
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,600
They said they would investigate
and get in touch with you.

313
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:57,086
Are you mad?

314
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,733
It seems like
they don't believe me.

315
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:04,153
Okay, let's say the story about
burying the diamond ring is true.

316
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:07,853
But you also said meteors were
acting weird. Going back and forth.

317
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:12,820
A thief dropped from the sky and
left the wallet untouched.

318
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,853
I'm being serious!

319
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,320
Do you want some cold water?
Oh, she doesn't like cold water.

320
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,633
Then some hot water!

321
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:26,053
Where were you all this time?

322
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:30,420
I was collecting some information,
and looking into a place to stay.

323
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,520
Let's go. I've found a place.
And it's close to the waterfront.

324
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,720
There's no need.
My divine power came back.

325
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,420
Really?

326
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,320
This water behind me,
followed my command,

327
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,353
and leaped high.

328
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:45,733
As expected.
Then please make some gold.

329
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:09,986
It's the closest place to water,
so you'll be comfortable. Here.

330
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:13,233
I was a bit late since I had to
blow it up.

331
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:19,553
Earlier a human man told me to
look for it and gave it to me.

332
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:22,220
You spoke with a human?

333
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,733
You shouldn't have said anything.

334
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:30,886
"Blessed Mental Health Clinic
Nurse Sang-yoo"?

335
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:32,386
What?

336
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:36,900
Ah, I was reading the text.
You don't know human text, do you?

337
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,666
Please sleep comfortably.
I will be on watch all night.

338
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:51,200
I will look for the coordinates
tomorrow when the day breaks.

339
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,020
In the human world, if you have
money, most things will be solved.

340
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,920
I asked you what you needed.

341
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,820
Mo-ney?

342
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,053
It's not money,

343
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:12,466
but mo-ney.

344
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:39,420
Happy Bank called.
Did you get a loan from them too?

345
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,400
I didn't do it.

346
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,766
That's right.

347
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,533
It's not something that would be
solved by selling a diamond ring.

348
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,733
Mo-ney?

349
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,800
What's that?

350
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,833
Right, his mind must be at ease.

351
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,400
That's all you need in life.

352
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:40,453
Let's talk while walking around.
F&B team, please begin.

353
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:43,153
There's a party with 200 guests
for a Chinese harbor construction.

354
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:46,886
Chinese tycoon Li Wei Lung will be
in attendance. You should attend.

355
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:50,486
He's not a guest of the state, no
need. And the business proposal?

356
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:54,686
It's an updated proposal for
Block World from the UK company.

357
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:58,053
The site is the same as you have
reviewed in the previous proposal.

358
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:01,353
It's not bad. As long as
we could obtain this land.

359
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,820
Let's look into it. Finance team,
is it regarding a bank?

360
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,120
Yes, there's a bank proposing to
lower interest for several loans.

361
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,600
He wants to have a meal with you,
Chairman.

362
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,253
Do I have to go?

363
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,786
It may be better if you
meet him once.

364
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:20,986
Scientists have detected
a 2nd wave of gravitational forces

365
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:26,753
There may be a 3rd or 4th wave of
forces coming at us as we speak

366
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:30,986
The time-space continuum in Seoul
may have shifted without us knowing

367
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:35,686
Today in "Fascinating Science"
we discussed gravitational forces

368
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:36,786
You're here.

369
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:39,786
- Any news from the police station?
- No.

370
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:43,520
They say the time-space continuum
may have shifted last night.

371
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Could the diamond ring have
disappeared then?

372
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,153
I bought that at Dongdaemun Market
at dawn. Wear that for now.

373
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,653
You should have just slept.

374
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:16,286
A gown is the most important thing
to a doctor. No stomachache?

375
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:17,420
I'm not drunk.

376
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,753
- What about breakfast?
- Ah, your nagging again.

377
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,586
There's nothing to eat at home,
right?

378
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,353
- I should make some side dishes.
- Do you want to die?

379
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:28,820
Remember the guy who ran into your
car last month? He called again.

380
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,553
It was all taken care of by
the insurance company.

381
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:35,620
I dunno. Says he's coming to see
you and then saying he's not.

382
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,586
When are you going to the bank?

383
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,420
It won't get solved by
delaying it ?

384
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Ah, I know.

385
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,853
Do we have any consultations
in the morning?

386
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:49,466
Of course not. And none in
the afternoon, so leave whenever.

387
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:59,886
You're always late in
paying interest on your loan,

388
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:02,886
and you don't really
take care of your credit either.

389
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:07,333
You scored too low on
last year's income evaluation.

390
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,153
Please review it again.

391
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:15,020
I pay my taxes and I'm having
a hard time temporarily.

392
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,886
Lately there are
so many psychiatric patients!

393
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:24,320
Pay back part of the loan and
shift interest to 7% for the rest.

394
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,020
But, I don't know if the screening
team will accept this, ma'am.

395
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,153
7 percent?

396
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:33,433
Wait, how can it go from 4% to 7%?

397
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:39,400
Then, please let me know.

398
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,866
Ah, where did he go again?

399
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,466
Why isn't he coming?

400
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,620
Excuse me. Excuse me!

401
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,100
Please wait a moment.

402
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:30,453
Is it not out yet? I have some
consultations at the hospital.

403
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:33,333
Ah, please wait a moment.

404
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,500
Oh no! What am I going to do?

405
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,320
Chairman, did you enjoy your meal?

406
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,420
Would you like an organic
Ethiopian hand drip coffee?

407
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,953
If you use our loan, we'll offer
you an initial 1% interest rate.

408
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:56,866
What? 1 percent?!

409
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,233
Pardon me.

410
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:03,320
I-I told you to wait!

411
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,886
Why do you keep
telling me to wait?

412
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:07,953
The only thing that I've been
doing since this morning is wait.

413
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,853
I'm not even asking for another
loan, but requesting an extension.

414
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:13,520
Is it so hard to confirm that?

415
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,533
Why are you walking around with
someone's personal information?

416
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,286
E-Excuse me, for now,
please wait outside.

417
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:24,953
I told you I'm not waiting.

418
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:28,286
And, why am I 7 percent and
this person 1 percent?

419
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:30,053
Why are you discriminating
between people?

420
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:32,420
- A-Ah, that is...
- I know, I know.

421
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,853
However, you shouldn't
discriminate so much!

422
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:37,820
7 percent and 1 percent is
too much!

423
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,300
Please help her first. We can
continue through the finance team.

424
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,953
A-Ah, chairman.
If you leave like this?

425
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:50,486
A-Apologize to the chairman,
customer!

426
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:51,253
What did you say?

427
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:56,166
You rudely cut in front of him and
you've upset him!

428
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:59,420
That's not true.

429
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,386
The bank's at fault for revealing
another customer's interest rate.

430
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:05,186
I think you should be
the one to apologize.

431
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,020
Excuse me?

432
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,986
I will try to ask the bank so
your loan will be approved.

433
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:11,066
Why is it any of your concern?

434
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,720
It seems you won't accept
kindness as kindness.

435
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,820
Then, don't pester the bank's
employees with the interest rate,

436
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,933
work hard, and earn money.

437
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,453
Blessed Mental Health Clinic.

438
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:35,733
Blessed Mental Health... Here,
it's Blessed Mental Health Clinic.

439
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:41,500
O-Oh! STOP!

440
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:45,153
Why would you clean bird poop with
our business card?!

441
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:49,886
But, why?!

442
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,186
What is the problem?

443
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:53,253
Ah, it's nothing.

444
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,120
What's the problem?

445
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,286
Why are you cleaning bird poop
with our business card? WHY?!

446
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:59,433
Please do not do this,

447
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:04,286
if you contact me separately
I will take care of this.

448
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:08,320
A business card is our face. You
just cleaned poop with our face!

449
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,353
Stop it. Let's go.

450
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:12,386
No, otherwise why would
you need wipers?

451
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:14,820
It's there so that you can
clean it with this, no?!

452
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,766
Is it just great to have a big car,
huh?

453
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,566
What do I do?

454
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,853
A psychiatry clinic?

455
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:31,233
I will call you with an estimate.

456
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,233
Lord Ha Baek!

457
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:55,753
Did you find the coordinates?

458
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,586
They weren't there. I think that
we may have lost them on the way.

459
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:01,200
On the way?

460
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,953
Then there's no way to find them,
right?

461
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:08,600
Yes. It's dangerous. Why are you
out? You should've stayed home.

462
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:11,933
Home.

463
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:19,886
You slept well. You said you
would be on watch all night.

464
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:23,286
I was tired, and hungry…
so I couldn't help myself.

465
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,253
Hungry?

466
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:28,486
Yes. A rookie like me can become
hungry like a human at mealtime.

467
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,753
A god like you wouldn't know
what it means to be hungry.

468
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:34,220
Do I have to keep listening to
those kinds of stories?

469
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,133
Ah, no.

470
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:40,700
Are you really hungry?

471
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,900
Yes, that is so.

472
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,253
I'm sorry.

473
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,720
This is all because I lost
my divine power,

474
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,186
As a master, if I am unable to
take care of a servant like you,

475
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,686
I don't know how I will be
a good king...

476
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:59,820
What? A-Ah, no Lord Ha Baek!

477
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,966
This is not what you were
expecting to hear from me, right?

478
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:04,486
Right.

479
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:07,466
But what is that thing used for?

480
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,233
That is…
not something you eat, but...

481
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,720
Let's go to that place.

482
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,253
What? Where?

483
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,886
The land where
the Gate of gods is located.

484
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:26,853
The land the descendant of
the gods' servant guards.

485
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:29,386
If we go there,
we can find out how to meet her.

486
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:31,820
What?
Will you meet the descendant?

487
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,053
Of course giving a servant the
opportunity to die for a mission

488
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:40,320
is a god's generosity and
it's not a game I'm playing.

489
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,053
What will we do?

490
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:45,553
Isn't that one wiper going to
cost thousands of dollars?

491
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:48,120
Maybe I need to take the security
deposit out from my apartment.

492
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,086
So why did you get that angry,
when it's not even your style?

493
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:54,453
Because he was cleaning bird poop
with our precious business card.

494
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:57,400
You're just bursting with
strong devotion, aren't you?

495
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:03,200
But why did it have to be that
person's car out of all people?

496
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:09,853
Are you calling Assistant Min?
Ask him to cut the cost a bit!

497
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:12,500
Assistant Min my butt!

498
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:23,366
Ah, this real estate guy is
not picking up his phone again!

499
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,353
I'm going to head over to
Gangwon Province.

500
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:31,286
Right now?

501
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:33,720
You need to change your tires to
drive on the freeway.

502
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,600
The brake oil, your navigation
system, and the emission oil too?

503
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,866
The wiper!

504
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:52,053
Ah,
why are you malfunctioning again?

505
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:54,933
Don't make it so obvious that
you're a used car.

506
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:59,166
Ah, it's all right now.

507
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,153
Did you say you live in
Jeongbok village?

508
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,020
If you go that way,

509
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,253
go that way

510
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,453
and turn left where it seems right

511
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:36,853
then go straight again and when
it feels right again, turn right.

512
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:40,733
If you turn like that, you'll come
across it. Do you understand?

513
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:53,486
What has that human said so far?

514
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:55,453
Ah, it means that it's close.

515
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:59,466
Ah, you don't have to worry!
I've been here more than once.

516
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:07,486
I didn't get any call for
the last 5 years.

517
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:10,120
So, I asked you for
a favor last time.

518
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,086
To put up a "for sale" sign and
make an effort in selling it.

519
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:17,020
Alright, I got it, I got it.

520
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,886
I am here today to
lower the price a little.

521
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:25,286
No matter how much you lower
the price, who would buy such land?

522
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:30,633
You're right, but you shouldn't
say that in front of the landowner!

523
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:34,086
So how much? Do you want to
lower the price by half?

524
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,500
H-Half?

525
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,753
Should've come through the main
gate. It's not visible to humans.

526
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,720
The land is quite shabby to
house the Gate of gods.

527
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,586
But the descendant of that servant
will be clueless. What do we do?

528
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:56,186
We need to give her the
lost royal crest for her to know.

529
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,853
Do not worry. There is a way.

530
00:43:58,933 --> 00:44:00,986
What way?

531
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:05,900
She'll fall for my charms. There's
no way that she won't comply.

532
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,386
If it doesn't work because she's
dumb, I'll use the last resort.

533
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:13,866
What last resort?

534
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:17,853
What? Ah, you cannot do that,
Lord Ha Baek!

535
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:18,786
Why not?

536
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:23,153
That has to remain sealed. We can
retrieve the crest when we return.

537
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:27,553
Then, she'll forget everything, but
with the last resort, she can't.

538
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:31,586
That's something very hard for
a human.

539
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,186
From yesterday to
this very moment,

540
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:36,620
you keep doing idiotic things.

541
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,886
And what nonsense are you
spouting idiotically now?

542
00:44:40,966 --> 00:44:44,820
And, most of all, you've lost
your divine power right now.

543
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,820
Will that work?

544
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,133
What does that have to do with my
power? Am I not a God without it?

545
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:53,686
Then you could be my master then.

546
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:57,553
Oh, how could you say something
like that? No it's not that.

547
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:59,500
Excuse me!

548
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,966
Excuse me, what is the problem?

549
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:09,233
Ah, this is my land.

550
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,233
It was you.

551
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:32,386
Ah, let's release her!
Please do not do this!

552
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:33,720
I am the God of Water,

553
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,253
the next king of the Water Kingdom,
next emperor of the gods' realm.

554
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,286
I am Ha Baek.

555
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,120
Why is that man here?

556
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,420
Are you this land's owner?

557
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,133
Yes, I am the land's owner.

558
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:48,586
Are you going to buy the land?

559
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:50,253
Why would I buy my own land?

560
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,766
Excuse me?

561
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,886
I have searched for you for a while,
my servant.

562
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:15,053
To see you like this,
it is nice to see you.

563
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,700
Be touched that

564
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:21,533
I am glad to see you.

565
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:31,320
What are you doing?

566
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,586
How dare you...

567
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,986
You know that being a psychiatrist
suits you perfectly, right?

568
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:38,586
People who need you come to you
night and day.

569
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:42,566
I have to go see Yeom-mi.
I think it's time I see her.

570
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,366
Lord Ha Baek, if you could give
me a sign before you do... Oh!

571
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,853
Yeah, Yeom-mi.
Are you free tonight?

572
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:59,253
Ah, no, no. You have to be free.
Yeah, let's meet.

573
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:02,133
Yeah, I'm in Gangwon Province now?
Oh my gosh!

574
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,953
What? What happened?

575
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:09,166
Hey... I'll call you again later.

576
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,520
Are you okay?

577
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,553
- Let me see.
- I'm okay.

578
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:17,653
He is not okay.

579
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:21,933
I don't think I'm okay.
I-I'm not okay.

580
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:37,466
The entrance will soon be
on your right.

581
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,453
I'll take you to the nearest
hospital. Contact insurance there.

582
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:45,020
No.
We will go where you are going.

583
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,220
Look here.

584
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,220
How are we going to go to Seoul
at this rate when he is injured?

585
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,720
Also, why do you keep
speaking informally to me?

586
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,553
I do not know what you mean,
but you'll understand soon.

587
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:58,833
If you understand, then
everything will become easier.

588
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,966
What is he even saying?

589
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,986
Excuse me, do you have
a doctor that you usually go to?

590
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:08,500
If you don't, then my clinic...
Ah, no.

591
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:14,086
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.
Your friend here…

592
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,720
He's not my friend.
He's a servant.

593
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,600
The servant…

594
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,220
I mean... In my opinion, there's
nothing wrong with him.

595
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,086
I am going with you so it won't
turn into a case of hit and run.

596
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,933
I do not understand
what you are saying.

597
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:36,866
I feel like this road is a bit
different from the one before.

598
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:45,533
It will be on the right side soon.

599
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:50,500
Where is the road
on the right side?

600
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,820
Please go straight until
the next sign.

601
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,466
I feel like this is going nowhere.

602
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,900
In a moment,
head toward your right.

603
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:10,453
In a moment, left turn.

604
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:13,753
It's straight ahead to
your next prompt.

605
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,600
In a moment, it is a U-turn.

606
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,520
It's on your left and
at 11 o'clock direction.

607
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,286
(No Road Ahead)
This is driving me crazy.

608
00:49:33,366 --> 00:49:35,933
Please watch out for sharp turns.

609
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,153
It's straight at
the 12 o'clock direction.

610
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:42,420
It's blocked!

611
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,720
Where are you telling me to go,
you idiot?

612
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,500
Proceed straight ahead.
Please drive safely.

613
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:54,886
Are you tired?

614
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:56,933
Yes.

615
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,966
What should I do?

616
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:03,586
Nothing.

617
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,686
Will it be resolved if I do that
so-called 'driving'?

618
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:07,886
Do you have a license?

619
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,800
What is that?

620
00:50:15,633 --> 00:50:21,466
Never mind. A doctor does
not let her patient drive.

621
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,700
It's to your right in a moment.

622
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:02,953
Network can not be located

623
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:05,500
Ah, no!

624
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:08,953
What is the problem?

625
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:10,986
Ah, there is no fuel,
so the car stopped.

626
00:51:11,066 --> 00:51:13,153
Then give it the fuel.

627
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,933
H-How?

628
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,700
Let me use your cellphone.

629
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:28,466
Your cellphone.
Do you not have one?

630
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:39,086
Fine then. Let's walk. We'll at
least be able to meet someone.

631
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:42,986
We can then either borrow a phone
and call insurance or buy fuel.

632
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:47,253
I do not understand
what you are saying, but you rest.

633
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:47,886
What?

634
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:52,500
You said you were tired.
Rest. Nam Soo Ri will go.

635
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:55,553
But he is injured.

636
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:57,786
- Ah, yes. I'm injured.
- He is not.

637
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:00,920
I do not think I am injured.
I am not injured.

638
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,420
Go safely.

639
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,020
Ah, no it's okay.
I will be back soon.

640
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,266
Goodness! Excuse me!

641
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:15,266
I do not even know where
anything is...

642
00:52:18,933 --> 00:52:20,853
Excuse me!

643
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,420
Yes?

644
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,420
Here is the vehicle ID number
and the number of the insurance.

645
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,966
And this is money for fuel…
Oh, please wait a moment.

646
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,753
Here.

647
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,933
I almost forgot.

648
00:53:28,866 --> 00:53:33,900
What is with my luck today?

649
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:43,200
Excuse me.

650
00:54:47,233 --> 00:54:49,500
Please wait inside.

651
00:54:57,733 --> 00:55:00,420
I'm alright,
so rest comfortably inside.

652
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,653
My name is not 'excuse me',
but Ha Baek.

653
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:07,620
God of Water, the next emperor of
the gods' realm.

654
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,153
And, your master.

655
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:14,933
Ha. Baek.

656
00:55:17,966 --> 00:55:21,466
Ah, I keep forgetting that
he's a mental patient.

657
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:25,886
Excuse me, patient...
Oh, Mr. Ha Baek.

658
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:29,353
Why do you think of yourself as
the God of Water?

659
00:55:29,433 --> 00:55:32,020
What kind of question is that?
Then what about you?

660
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,000
Why do you think you are a human?

661
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,420
Alright then.

662
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,353
Then, what is the God of Water?

663
00:55:46,433 --> 00:55:49,066
What are you starting to do
with me now?

664
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,220
As a human,
do you want to receive a lesson?

665
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,233
It seems you want to talk about
the ultimate essence of the world.

666
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,686
Listen carefully.

667
00:56:01,766 --> 00:56:05,653
God of Water, God of Heaven,
God of Earth.

668
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:12,800
We are nature. So, I am nature.

669
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:16,086
So you are a natural person?

670
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,686
I am nature.

671
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:19,286
So you are a natural person?

672
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:25,500
I am nature and on top of that
the most natural of them all.

673
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,466
Based on his appearance,
he really seems normal.

674
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:51,200
Stop peeking at me. Even if
my eyes are closed, I still know.

675
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:54,253
I am used to those looks,
you know.

676
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:58,566
Yes, you probably would be.

677
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:04,020
You have family, right?

678
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,153
You can say I do,
or you can say I don't.

679
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:10,486
A god doesn't have such relations
as humans would think.

680
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:13,986
-Then, that person from earlier-
- I told you he is a servant.

681
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:16,720
Like you, Nam Soo Ri is a servant,
but in the realm of gods.

682
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,933
You are a servant in
the human realm.

683
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:24,333
- Look here, servant.
-Yes?

684
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:28,666
- Ah, excuse me!
- "Lord Ha Baek"!

685
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:36,653
Is what you really need?
'Mooo-ney'?

686
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:41,700
- Why are you asking?
- Why does a human need it so much?

687
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:48,186
Because if you have 'mooo-ney',
then you will be happy.

688
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:52,653
- You too?
- That is so. Why do you ask?

689
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:57,166
I think I will be able to do that
for you.

690
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,866
Not at the moment,
because I have some circumstances.

691
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:08,233
Strangely,
I keep falling for his tricks.

692
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:15,033
Look here, servant. So the thing
you need most is 'mooo-ney',

693
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:21,800
because it will make you happy.
So what you need is happiness.

694
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,753
What do you know about me that
you would say such a thing?

695
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:32,966
I have no interest in your
happiness, so I'll compensate you.

696
00:58:38,566 --> 00:58:42,033
I think it would be better to
look together after all.

697
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:51,433
- Is this the right road?
- No. It seems like we're lost.

698
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:55,253
You are calmer than expected.

699
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:59,786
Isn't that a given? For now, I am
'natural man's' guardian anyway.

700
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:02,700
- Guardian?
-Yes.

701
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:07,533
It might not look like it,
but I am a doctor after all.

702
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:13,500
I should have taken a good look at
your subordinate or companion.

703
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,086
This won´t do.
I think it´s better to go back.

704
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:25,353
- That's what I wanted to say before.
- Excuse me, I'll lead the way.

705
00:59:25,433 --> 00:59:28,266
Look here, servant!

706
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,886
This is the last time.
Listen carefully.

707
00:59:35,966 --> 00:59:41,520
My name is not "excuse me" but
"Lord Hae Baek", god of Water,

708
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,600
next king of the Water Kingdom,
next emperor of the gods' realm.

709
00:59:55,633 --> 01:00:00,420
Then you listen carefully too. I'm
not "servant", but Yoon So-ah.

710
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:05,153
As I'm your guardian, it'd be
better to call me Dr. Yoon So-ah,

711
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:10,320
but if you don't want to, then
call me "Miss Yoon So-ah". Got it?

712
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,300
Such rudeness.

713
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,400
- What?
- Quick, run!

714
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:23,800
Let's go inside the car! Omo!

715
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,800
The trunk!

716
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:10,100
- Why do we have to be quiet?
- Shh!

717
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,300
I think it left.

718
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,420
- How are you?
- I'm extremely uncomfortable.

719
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,566
What?

720
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,066
Don't move.
I'm even more uncomfortable.

721
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,266
I think it left,
so I'll open the trunk.

722
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,633
What... is that?

723
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,900
It's a wild boar -- oh my gosh…
it's a crazy wild boar!

724
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:43,400
Lord Ha Baek!

725
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,800
- Do you think you can move?
- Let's go after I sit for a while.

726
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,620
What happened?

727
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,320
I was lost in the woods when
I met a hunter.

728
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,820
It was a relief that
I came with him.

729
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,520
- What happened to the hunter?
- He followed the wild boar.

730
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,566
Are you hurt anywhere?

731
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,320
Excuse me,
but I thought you couldn't drive.

732
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,820
I couldn't.

733
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,653
Then,
what are you doing right now?

734
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:50,520
I'm okay now. I'm doing this for
the first time, but it seems fun.

735
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,600
What?

736
01:04:55,133 --> 01:04:57,586
Then, y-your license?

737
01:04:57,666 --> 01:04:59,720
I keep asking you what
that license is.

738
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,186
Look here! Pull over immediately.
Change seats.

739
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:08,053
Rest. I am bestowing unimaginable
grace on you, so don't refuse.

740
01:05:08,133 --> 01:05:12,186
Doing this is rightful generosity
and duty of the god.

741
01:05:12,266 --> 01:05:13,666
PULL OVER!

742
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:21,653
Excuse me, don't worry.
My Lord has an unimaginable skill.

743
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:25,700
Regardless of his skill
or whatever, pull over!

744
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,966
PULL OVER!

745
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:55,866
Is this the place where you live?

746
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,900
- Did you fool me?
- Who is fooling whom?

747
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:14,653
Anyway, thank you for
multiple things today.

748
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:17,766
It was a long time ago.

749
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:23,220
Your ancestor, whose name
I don't know, made a promise.

750
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,886
To have your family live as
god's servant for generations.

751
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:29,253
It doesn't matter that you're not
the one who made the promise.

752
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:35,320
If the god wishes, you, the
descendant must serve as promised.

753
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,820
Lead me to your home.

754
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,986
No, you will be led to the hospital.

755
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:47,120
- Refuse and only you'll struggle.
- Doesn't matter.

756
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:54,120
You're right. Maybe what I need
most is happiness.

757
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:01,900
So, please just leave now.
I beg you.

758
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:09,020
I gave her such instruction,
but she still doesn't realize.

759
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,553
She's too dumb,
then I don't have a choice.

760
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:21,186
I tried to not to use the last
resort, but in this case, I must.

761
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:23,653
Lord Ha Baek!
But your divine power...!

762
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:25,800
Look here, servant!

763
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,366
I am giving you god's grace,
so wake up.

764
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:12,720
♬ What's this feeling now?
What's this shaking now? ♬

765
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:18,886
♬ Everytime I meet you I feel it ♬

766
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:24,333
♬ What's this feeling right now?
The reason for it is so nice.  ♬

767
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,133
(The Bride of Habaek)

768
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:28,820
Something quietly creeps into
your heart

769
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,186
Ah, why did you close
your eyes then, why?

770
01:08:31,266 --> 01:08:33,153
and hit you in the head,
that's how it feels, right?

771
01:08:33,233 --> 01:08:34,486
No.

772
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:36,786
That dim-witted woman, it's here!

773
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:38,986
- You crazy?
- It is destiny.

774
01:08:39,066 --> 01:08:40,886
- You are now a person of god.
- No I'm not.

775
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:42,720
God, god, god.

776
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,086
If you refuse to accept it,
you will experience great hardship.

777
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,153
Is what I'm experiencing...

778
01:08:47,233 --> 01:08:49,253
No!

779
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,286
She's falling!

780
01:08:50,366 --> 01:08:52,020
SERVANT!

781
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,600
Please, please save me!

782
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,420
- Are you leaving right away?
- Yes, my portrait was interrupted.

783
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,333
I know. He just needs to draw your
eyes, why are you punishing him?

784
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,200
What punishment?

785
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,086
When is
Lord Ha Baek going to come?

786
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:17,233
I said just draw the eyes.
