1
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:07,667
(The Bride of Habaek)

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,600
(Shin Sae Kyeong
Nam Joo Hyuk)

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,366
(Lim Ju Hwan)

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,100
(Jung Soo Jung)

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,266
(Gong Myoung)

6
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,233
(The Bride of Habaek)

7
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,666
You want to know
how gods are created?

8
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:23,200
If you look here, lovemaking
between humans is detailed.

9
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:27,034
Look here. They do this and that.
They do all kinds of things.

10
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,800
Then.

11
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:33,534
A new human is made in the woman's
belly and later comes out.

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,234
That is called giving birth
to a baby.

13
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,367
How are our gods created?

14
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,900
We don't give birth to babies.

15
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,500
Even if a god and goddess do all
kinds of things like these humans,

16
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:45,800
Lord Ha Baek.

17
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:51,634
Lord Ha Baek. Gods are
just created. They are not born.

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,767
- Just?
- Yes, they exist on their own.

19
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,900
If you want to nitpick, they could
be human's wishes confirmed,

20
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:02,334
was created by the universe,
or they're the fruits of nature.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,933
It sounds so vague.

22
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,266
That's the difference between
a god and a human.

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,766
Gods are vague by nature.

24
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,633
It's up to the humans to
interpret them.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,934
Humans are beings who question why
and continue to

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,067
seek a logical reason, and
come to accept the circumstances.

27
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:25,600
However, gods are just gods.

28
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:30,200
Gods are beings that
surpass everything.

29
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,400
They are created by themselves?

30
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,900
The Great Priest asked us here to
listen to an interesting story.

31
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:46,767
- What?
- Thus, we cannot be parents or children.

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,234
What is he talking about?

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,100
By the way,

34
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,367
there is a story about a god

35
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,900
who was born into
the borrowed body of a human.

36
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:59,733
He is a being who has both human
and godly nature.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,667
He goes through a life cycle like
his mother and lives eternally

38
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:10,100
like his father, a god. He
experiences life many times over.

39
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:13,133
Wow. He really is unlucky and low.

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,800
How can he be a god?

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,533
If it exists, it's a disgrace to
the gods' realm. Does he exist?

42
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,333
They say he does.
Even though I've never seen him.

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,066
Someone like that is a god?

44
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,034
Since gods live an eternal life
in the form we were created with,

45
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,600
it's a bit ambiguous to
call him a god.

46
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:42,666
But he possesses divine powers,
so can't really call him human.

47
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,266
He is a being who's welcomed by
neither gods nor humans.

48
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:53,366
Besides, unlike ours, his divine
power is not a positive power.

49
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,266
It's not a positive power?

50
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,034
Our divine powers

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,734
give life to and looks after
all creation in heaven and earth.

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,333
However,
he has the power to annihilate.

53
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,534
His divine element is fire.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,300
Fire?

55
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:13,400
Thus, it's uncomfortable for him
to mingle with us.

56
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,700
He wouldn't really like us either.

57
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:18,067
Then is he stronger than Ha Baek?

58
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,434
What? That doesn't make any sense.

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,600
High Priest. That means he's
stronger than Ha Baek. Right?

60
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,366
He's not, right?

61
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,367
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

62
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,066
Of course Ha Baek is stronger.

63
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,500
I will really freeze your tongue
and smash it.

64
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,167
How can that be?

65
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:47,566
You are born to be a king.

66
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,200
Half-human half-god? It's not
an interesting story in the least.

67
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,700
In the human world, there are
many interesting stories.

68
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:01,034
Like bears turning into humans.

69
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,667
Wow. To be stronger than Ha Baek.

70
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,267
When did the High Priest say
he's stronger?

71
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,267
Not knowing means he is stronger.

72
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,400
You really are the disgrace to
the gods' realm.

73
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,234
Fire is his element. It'd be
perfect to capture him and

74
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,167
- make him a blacksmith.
- Capture?

75
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,900
If you happen to run into him,
flee right away.

76
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,267
Without a doubt,
he will be stronger than you.

77
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,767
And you, Ha Baek, if you run into
him, pretend you don't know him.

78
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,166
Power of annihilation.
How can he be a god?

79
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,267
Is he a bad guy?

80
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,767
If he uses his power for good,
he's a good guy. If he uses it for

81
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,833
evil, he is bad. If he uses it
strangely, he is a strange guy.

82
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,266
He might
just be a different guy too.

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Why? Are you scared?

84
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,967
Why would I be scared of such
a guy? We are immortal anyway.

85
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,634
- Immortality isn't indestructible.
- Indestructible?

86
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,300
The moment a god is forgotten
by humans,

87
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,700
he is no longer a god.

88
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:04,233
To put it differently even if he's
alive, he's not really living.

89
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:09,100
There are countless gods
who couldn't be destroyed.

90
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:13,900
Because he's forgotten by mere
humans, a god is no longer a god?

91
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,234
- That bastard has such powers?
- Don't worry about it.

92
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,167
That doesn't mean he's a monster
that has the power of hundreds.

93
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:28,300
As his existence isn't welcomed,
he will be living in hiding.

94
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:31,534
But, you will be able to
recognize him right away.

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,666
Since you are someone who will
become king.

96
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,933
You've been figured out by me.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm saying I've figured you out.

98
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,800
You.

99
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:04,334
(The Bride of Habaek)

100
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,200
(Episode 8)

101
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:13,633
I don't know
what you're talking about.

102
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,867
I heard you go through a life
cycle like your human mother

103
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,000
and live eternally like
your father, a god.

104
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:30,100
This... it's your blood, isn't it?

105
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,134
Hold on a moment.

106
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,834
I will explain everything.
Let's leave first.

107
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
You will explain? Does that mean
you knew about it too?

108
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,400
- About what?
- This person's true identity!

109
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,266
What?

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,300
His true identity is that
he's the CEO of this place…

111
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,000
Ha Baek!

112
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,067
I am sorry, CEO Sin.

113
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:06,800
He's not only difficult
but he can also be random.

114
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:09,767
It's alright.

115
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,233
Then.

116
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,733
Let's go.

117
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,033
Stay with
Bi Ryeom for the time being.

118
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,134
Pardon?

119
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,166
Do that.
I have to confirm some things.

120
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,966
(Chairman of the Board:
Sin Hoo-ye)

121
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,266
You've been figured out by me.

122
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,300
I'm saying that
I've figured you out. You.

123
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,334
I heard you go through a life
cycle like your human mother

124
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,300
and live eternally like
your father, a god.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,034
There's someone who moves as fast
as the wind, like teleporting,

126
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,900
someone who can make
diamond rings endlessly,

127
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:39,066
and someone who becomes an expert
if he just reads about it once.

128
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,933
This person can even transform
his body like Jeon Woo-chi.

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,034
He's a friend.

130
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,733
Dare I say, a cut metal and
cut neck friend.

131
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,866
I will apologize. For being rude.

132
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,366
Yoon So-ah.

133
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,600
From the looks of it, it seems
Ha Baek has caught on.

134
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:25,834
I'm saying I've figured you out.

135
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,200
Ha Baek said he's figured
CEO Sin out.

136
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:30,134
But why did the conversation
flow like that?

137
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,834
Does that mean you also knew
about it?

138
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,200
This person's true identity!

139
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,700
True identity?

140
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,333
What true identity?

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,366
Goodness.
How can such things happen?

142
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,667
The old high priest was right.

143
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,100
I was able to recognize him
at once.

144
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,567
No way.

145
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:55,534
No way. And CEO Sin was that
half-human half-god?

146
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,966
He's stronger than Lord Ha Baek?

147
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:04,067
But you said he lives in the gods'
realm. How come he's here?

148
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,067
Why did you acknowledge him?
I told you to pretend not to know!

149
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,700
You don't even have your powers.
If he's half-human half-god,

150
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,300
what if he really has
ill intentions?

151
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:17,234
After you lost your powers,
did you lose your judgment too?

152
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,266
I have to acknowledge him,
for him to show his true identity.

153
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:22,733
That guy

154
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,966
must be related to
Joo Dong disappearing. Definitely.

155
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,700
You don't even have proof.
Those are all assumptions.

156
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,800
Proof? After spending a long time
here, you almost became a human.

157
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,800
No where near your skill level.
You guys always leave me out.

158
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:47,567
I need to at least think like
a human to barely keep up.

159
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:50,866
We should check to see whether
he's really half-human half-god.

160
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,566
Lord Ha Baek, you shouldn't
get involved anymore.

161
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,633
Out of all people,
that guy is close to So-ah.

162
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,100
It's too amazing to call it
a coincidence.

163
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:06,834
I'll try to find out what kind of
relationship they have.

164
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Just let it be.
Don't drag her into our affairs.

165
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,100
Why? You never know.

166
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:17,667
A god's servant is ours. I cannot
allow him to have what's ours.

167
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:22,500
I cannot allow her to even
wash a pair of socks for him.

168
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,033
She has very high self-esteem.
She wouldn't wash his socks.

169
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,100
You still have a lot to learn.

170
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:35,800
Don't forget that this descendant
is just a foolish human being.

171
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:39,033
I'm not sure if you have the right
to say such things.

172
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,500
As it was your kingdom that
enlightened Nak Bin about human

173
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:47,934
foolishness, do you think you
earned a right to be concerned?

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The Water Kingdom and
the gods' realm forgave your king,

175
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,366
they didn't
forgive your king's actions.

176
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,866
It was you who dragged
the human into it again.

177
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,800
Like you said, let's assume
So-ah is gods' loyal servant,

178
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,967
and wouldn't be fooled by him.
But what about him?

179
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,834
Just as we are suspicious of
So-ah being with him,

180
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,200
he must also be curious her
being with you.

181
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:38,300
No, he might actually think he
also has the right to a servant.

182
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,866
My intuition still hasn't come.

183
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,167
I must have lost my intuition
after living here for so long.

184
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,900
You who still have intuition,
do as you deem fit.

185
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:03,400
He really is a god of strife.

186
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,834
He's leaving us with worries
without even trying hard.

187
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,167
I'm concerned that half-human
half-god might have ill intentions

188
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:12,333
and will harass the descendant.
I am more worried about that.

189
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,700
(Real Estate Sales Contract)

190
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:22,966
So what if he knows?
I just sold my own land.

191
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:30,933
They will say I am a king
who couldn't even keep that.

192
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,633
So what?

193
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:38,100
I don't have a speck of shame
towards heaven.

194
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,934
Hey! Stop it, it's so noisy!

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,866
Why? This is a warning I'm giving
to the half-human half-god.

196
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:01,667
The Water Kingdom and
the gods' realm forgave your king,

197
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,133
they didn't
forgive your king's actions.

198
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,233
This rascal. He rubs it in when
I am about to forget about it.

199
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,233
They say he's a half-human
half-god. The fun is over now.

200
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,500
A bolt out of the blue.

201
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:48,167
It's not that I am looking down on
the neighborhood resident,

202
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,900
despite all that, you're
a mere neighborhood resident,

203
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:54,300
I don't think you should visit her
whenever you feel like it.

204
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,934
If you have something to say,
do that in the neighborhood.

205
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,367
No, even in the neighborhood,
you can't meet her at any time.

206
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:03,500
Happy Psychiatry Clinic.

207
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,200
Nurse Yoo Sang-yoo.

208
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,933
Yes?

209
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,833
You really talk a lot.

210
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:16,967
You're long-winded because
I look like I don't have any gold.

211
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,266
You're making a huge mistake.

212
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:24,033
Excuse me,
have we met before by chance?

213
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,300
Anyway.

214
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:31,100
you can't be so casual
with the Doctor.

215
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,234
The doctor has a boyfriend.

216
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,234
She has a soft heart,
that's why she accepted you.

217
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,367
It would be great if you'd act
with some sense.

218
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:43,534
The doctor's boyfriend is
a really amazing person.

219
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,166
He's the only one who'll stop her
from going to the banana boat.

220
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,200
Gosh!

221
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,300
What is it?

222
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:03,333
(Very One Resort)

223
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,833
Please enjoy.

224
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:34,466
Wait a moment.

225
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,966
It's missing a tooth.

226
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,200
My teeth fell out?

227
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,333
No.

228
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,833
This here.

229
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,600
There's a saying that dishware
with a missing tooth is unlucky.

230
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,066
Well, I cannot be any unluckier.

231
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,234
Why did you come?

232
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,400
To get off work together.

233
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,366
Getting off work together means
going on a wild drive in my car.

234
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,967
Today, my Nurse Yoo will
take it out for a wild drive

235
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:14,934
with a friend named Hyung-sik
to show off.

236
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,800
He said it's his wish.
You can't even grant it as a god?

237
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,400
It's not like you need divine
powers to make that happen.

238
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,833
Do you have something like
a boyfriend?

239
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:26,900
What?

240
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,200
Nurse Yoo Sang-yoo said so.

241
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,334
I searched the Internet.

242
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,134
A boyfriend refers to a man you're
in a dating relationship with.

243
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,900
Dating means that two people are
deeply in love with each other,

244
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,567
so they're going out with each other.

245
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:44,500
Are you by chance in a deep
relationship with that hotel CEO?

246
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,933
What are you saying?

247
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:52,500
No. How could that be?

248
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,767
Look, the last time when
I fell asleep for a while,

249
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,500
out of the blue,
you said you were sorry.

250
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,134
- I'm also sorry, for now.
- For what?

251
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,634
Today, I'll show you great places,
feed you good food,

252
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,900
and buy you good clothes.

253
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:14,966
I'm thinking of having a farewell party
in advance.

254
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:19,267
What are you doing?

255
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,766
I want to feel more at ease.

256
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,233
That was so much fun.

257
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's leave, go.

258
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:08,133
Why do you want to keep riding
if you can't even get used to it?

259
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
I can do it. This time, I'll win.

260
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,167
You won. You won.
The natural man has won already.

261
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,766
Hurry, I feel ashamed.

262
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:22,234
Blocking the master's path is not
proper behavior for god's servant.

263
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,800
It's not proper for a king to risk
his life for something trivial.

264
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,600
You're cute.

265
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,100
-What are you saying?
- You're cute. Really.

266
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,533
How old am I,
saying that I'm cute is a little...

267
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:43,100
I'm 2800 years old.

268
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,433
2000...

269
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:49,034
Let's go. I don't like it here.

270
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,300
It makes me feel defeated for
some reason.

271
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,034
Why do you want to go to
this place called Banana Boat?

272
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,366
What?

273
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,800
That's because my body and mind
might be at ease if I go there.

274
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:09,700
Humans, if there's no solution
no matter how hard they try,

275
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:11,700
they just want to
leave everything behind.

276
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,733
Because of 'mo-ney'?
Because they don't have enough?

277
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,633
That, too.

278
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,266
And because of my dad as well.

279
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,634
Grant me one wish.

280
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,134
Let me meet my dad.

281
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,300
I want to ask him why he passed
this burden to me and just left.

282
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:34,134
If he's doing just fine. For him

283
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,800
to take everything away now.

284
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:37,734
He can't save his own daughter

285
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,700
so how can he save the world?
If I could ask that one question,

286
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,966
I wouldn't have any other wish.

287
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:51,433
I want to reset my life.
I don't like Korea either.

288
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,967
To me it seems a little better
than when I first came here.

289
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,667
Especially cars and cellphones.

290
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,700
So what if you do?
You will leave anyway.

291
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:06,967
What did you talk about with
CEO Sin before?

292
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,767
Why did I bring that up?

293
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,834
Why? Are you curious?

294
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,467
I was wondering what you were
talking about when you said...

295
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,100
I told him not to hit on my woman.

296
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,734
- What did you say?
- I told him you belong to me.

297
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,400
He's been found out trying to hit
on you. If he wants to hit on you,

298
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:27,400
I told him to ask for
my permission.

299
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:33,900
What is he talking about?

300
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,700
What is he saying?

301
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:43,633
It's just

302
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,166
I made a common mistake that
many people make.

303
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,700
Relying on someone without
intending to.

304
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:58,400
Having expectations.

305
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:02,267
More importantly,
telling him how I feel.

306
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,666
That was the worst.

307
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,967
I am sure you did it because it's
alright to do it to that person.

308
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:08,800
No,

309
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,933
It was to someone I shouldn't do
that to.

310
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:17,500
Since he's someone who will
leave anyway.

311
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,500
He's not a person.

312
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,500
Was it something like that?

313
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:02,800
That's what I'm saying.
You're from a bigger world.

314
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,933
You're someone who has to
do bigger things.

315
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:12,500
Even if small nameless things leave
like sounds from afar,

316
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,266
it won't matter to you.

317
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,534
- Hello?
- Let's leave work together.

318
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
- What?
- Leave work together with me.

319
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,600
(Water Ghost)

320
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,866
I haven't even gotten to work yet.
Why's he talking about leaving?

321
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,667
Who is this?

322
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:52,500
You saw her on TV the other day
and said she was pretty.

323
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,967
She was a no-name too.

324
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,467
After she shot this
one mobile photoshoot

325
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,500
she became
a Hallyu star overnight.

326
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,700
I can become famous

327
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:05,367
and you can go on
a free vacation abroad!

328
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:08,934
- It would be great!
- Goodness!

329
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,900
Why?

330
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,367
Just try pulling something
like that.

331
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:14,367
I won't leave a single penny to
you. Erase it from your head now.

332
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:19,700
Start a business in CEO Sin's
Block World Shopping Mall.

333
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:23,300
CEO Sin?
Is he the one buying your land?

334
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:26,300
That guy who has no one on heaven
and earth to lean on

335
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:30,067
is really excellent at paving his
own way.

336
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:32,600
Who have I been trusting…

337
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,134
my head hurts.

338
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,967
I'll try it. I'm also good at
those kinds of things.

339
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:41,334
Really? Then are you going to
do the shopping mall like I said?

340
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,734
Yeah after I think it over.

341
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,667
In any case, I'm going to be
inheriting your business later,

342
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:49,067
so I might as well
start practicing now.

343
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:53,666
I'll move that work forward.
Leave it to me.

344
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:05,333
CEO.

345
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:08,833
CEO?

346
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,834
Yes?

347
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,467
As you asked me to, I've cancelled
all your afternoon appointments,

348
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,267
however, I think we'll have to
proceed with the Songdo site visit

349
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,634
because of the guests from Laos.

350
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,634
Ah.

351
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,166
I see.

352
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,433
Is there something the matter?

353
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:28,100
No, I'll see you at the site
at the agreed meeting time.

354
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,167
Hey! This person...

355
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,700
Hey, do you not hear me speaking?
I have something to talk about.

356
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,366
The land for the Block World.

357
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,333
This person.

358
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:50,266
I'm a little busy right now.
Talk it over with Assistant Min.

359
00:26:57,066 --> 00:27:00,666
Hey! Hey!

360
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,867
- Assistant...
- Ok fine, Assistant Min.

361
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,134
- Why is CEO Sin like that?
- What are you talking about?

362
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,334
Why is he so cold…
I mean why is he that busy?

363
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,633
He's always busy.

364
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,100
But no matter how busy he's been,
he's never been like that before.

365
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,734
He must have times when
he's like this or that.

366
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,734
No, he's never been like that.

367
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
- Like what?
- I mean like, like...

368
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:28,300
- Cold?
- Right, he's never been cold.

369
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:30,366
You always complained that
he was rude before.

370
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,666
What's the reason for your visit
today? I'm also quite busy.

371
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,467
Oh, you know the land for
Block World.

372
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,734
I've taken that over,
so discuss it with me from now on.

373
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,900
I don't think there will be anything
to discuss.

374
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,734
All you need to do is
sign the contract.

375
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,567
I think we were able to resolve
a difficult land sale case,

376
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,100
so you should be
getting a contract soon.

377
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,366
Oh, okay.

378
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm going to talk with CEO Sin
directly instead of with you.

379
00:27:57,566 --> 00:28:00,600
Morning shoots start tomorrow, so
I'll stay here for several days,

380
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:05,934
so give me a room. But, why do you
think CEO Sin is being that way?

381
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm asking you
why he's being that way? Hey!

382
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,734
Do you think I'm being this way
because I like him?

383
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,934
I'm just feeling offended.
That's why I'm being this way.

384
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,367
You're being like this because
you like him, isn't that so?

385
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,500
I've known about it all along.

386
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:24,867
- I've seen people like you at church.
- How ridiculous.

387
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:29,434
After Sunday service is over,
people come ask for advice.

388
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,067
Mostly high schoolers. Conveying
feelings by bothering people

389
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:37,000
is a tactic that
elementary students often use.

390
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,000
(Real Estate Sales Proposal
and Contract)

391
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:05,500
Will this correspondence know that
the clinic will close down soon?

392
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:11,667
You know how Ma Bong-yeol's father
is a manager of a bank branch?

393
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,734
When we were dealing with the
security deposit, I asked him about

394
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,300
getting a loan, and he said to
come see him.

395
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:17,666
We don't need to do that anymore.

396
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:20,833
Did you go to an amusement park?

397
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:23,166
Who did you go with?

398
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,933
- Who did you go with?
- Won't you leave?

399
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,100
Why are you
looking at someone else's wallet?

400
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,466
It can't be
the neighborhood resident.

401
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,133
Who is he to tell me who
I can or can't see?

402
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,433
(Yeonju E-land Fast Pass)

403
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,100
I told him not to hit on my woman.
I told him you belong to me.

404
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,367
He's been found out trying to
hit on you.

405
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:54,333
If he wants to hit on you, I told
him to ask for my permission.

406
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,000
That neighborhood resident is...

407
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:01,367
Why is your face like that?
Do you have a fever?

408
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,200
No, no. Wait a second,
I'm going to get some air.

409
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,067
Are you sure you're not ill?

410
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,000
Why are you following me?

411
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,166
Oh my.

412
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:13,066
I came to get some treatment.

413
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:24,567
There are several causes
for sleep disorders.

414
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:27,200
If you have developed
physical pain or discomfort...

415
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:28,766
It's because I keep remembering
things that happened in the past.

416
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,566
You remember what I told you
about myself before.

417
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:39,500
Recently, some things reminded me
about my forgotten past.

418
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,334
I've never told these things
to anyone before

419
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,833
so I'm feeling a little awkward.

420
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:55,400
I'm a doctor so you can tell me
anything you want.

421
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:03,833
I don't know who my mother is

422
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,233
and my father...

423
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:17,633
my father treated me
like a monster.

424
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:23,666
I was a life that shouldn't have
been born. Disgrace...

425
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,700
was my name.

426
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,400
My father was afraid of me being
revealed, so he locked me away.

427
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:43,300
Then one cold winter evening,
in the end,

428
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,866
he kicked me out and abandoned me.

429
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,333
It was a night when the clouds
covered the moon and the stars.

430
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,066
I was not afraid of the darkness.
I was actually used to it.

431
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,833
What I feared more than
darkness was the unfamiliar air.

432
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:21,367
The air that this world that
I was seeing for the first time

433
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:25,100
had a completely different smell
and texture.

434
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,100
That place…

435
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:37,666
Up to now I still don't understand
and I don't want to understand.

436
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,266
I was so scared that all I wanted
to do was leave that place.

437
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,666
At that time,
I saw a far away light pass by.

438
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:53,633
And then another light passed by.

439
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,633
I just ran towards those lights.

440
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:15,967
That's sympathy. It's not
contempt, aggression, or fear.

441
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,634
This woman is definitely not
one of them.

442
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,366
If she knew, she wouldn't have
that kind of feeling.

443
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:27,700
She's not them. Then who is she?

444
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,833
Who is she that she knows
their true identities?

445
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:35,000
Umm... CEO Sin?

446
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,833
Oh, the conclusion is
a happy ending.

447
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:45,400
That night I could have
become an animal or a human

448
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:48,533
But, just at that time, the person
who saved me was there as well.

449
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:53,100
Thanks to that person, I was able
to become a human being.

450
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,466
Luckily, I'm living well now
behaving as a person should.

451
00:33:58,133 --> 00:34:01,634
- A person who saved you?
- Yes, he raised me as his son.

452
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,433
That's how I got the last name,
Sin.

453
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,500
Oh, that's what happened.

454
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,634
If at all possible, it's best to
sleep without taking medication.

455
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,700
Try to stop your thoughts with
other methods

456
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:22,300
and if you still cannot sleep
then let's have another meeting.

457
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:27,800
Thank you.

458
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,900
CEO Sin.

459
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,833
Last time you said you
wanted to become a good person.

460
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:44,434
That you wanted to become a useful
person in this world by helping

461
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,866
people contributing to society.

462
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:56,666
I now understand.

463
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,233
Back then...

464
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:06,166
I'm sorry for laughing at
your sincerity.

465
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:17,233
I think you've lived that way and
you'll continue living that way.

466
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:24,300
Your trees will form
a large forest.

467
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,000
Goodbye.

468
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,800
Just at that time, the person who
saved me was there as well.

469
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:55,233
Thanks to that person, I was able
to become a human being.

470
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,633
A person who saved you?

471
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,133
Ah, what am I thinking about?

472
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,033
Alright, Jin Geon.

473
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,600
Jin Geon knows how to talk?

474
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:23,133
I understand.
Keep looking into it.

475
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:29,333
You froze his tongue and smashed
it into pieces. How can he talk?

476
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:33,600
You hang out with minor gods.
This is why Ha Baek hates you!

477
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,066
There are a million reasons why
Ha Baek doesn't like me.

478
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,333
- Where are we going.
- To show my loyalty.

479
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,834
I'm sorry for laughing at
your sincerity.

480
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,033
Your trees will form
a large forest.

481
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:25,500
Yes?

482
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:29,500
CEO? The guests from Laos
will be there in 20 minutes.

483
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,633
Yes, I'm almost there.
I'll be there soon.

484
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,734
What are you planning to do now?

485
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,167
We should check out whether
what Ha Baek says is true.

486
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,333
It's also what's best for Ha Baek.

487
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:54,800
- I don't think this is right.
- Why?

488
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:58,267
What if CEO Sin is not half-person
half-human? What if he's human?

489
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,867
Then it's his destiny.

490
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:01,300
What?

491
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:04,333
- You don't believe Ha Baek?
- That's not it.

492
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:11,033
Stop it, Bi Ryeom.

493
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:22,166
- This isn't right.
- You said you believe everything.

494
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,833
Stop it, Bi Ryeom!

495
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:41,734
- I'm telling you to stop!
- Do it, half-human half-god.

496
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
Show us your true identity.

497
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,166
Bi Ryeom!

498
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,366
Moo Ra.

499
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:04,933
You really are incorrigible!

500
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:21,134
You were saying he's
a decent human and so forth,

501
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,333
did you develop some kind of
affection? This isn't like you.

502
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:32,667
Or, more than affection, have
you developed feelings for him?

503
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:34,266
It's because of you, you jerk!

504
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:39,700
What if Ha Baek was mistaken?
What if he's just a human?

505
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,900
A governing god cannot harm
a human in the human realm.

506
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,733
If you disobey that, you won't be
able to return to our realm.

507
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:51,833
Why are you always doing things
on your own way and acting rashly?

508
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,200
Ha Baek.

509
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,466
So be careful. He's probably been
further provoked.

510
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:10,067
Why the heck do the two of you
act without a plan?

511
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:11,266
I understand.

512
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,333
Bi Ryeom, try to make
an appointment with him.

513
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:30,700
Get off work together? Get off
work together... get off…

514
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:34,433
Does that…
mean he's going to pick me up?

515
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:38,966
That can't be it.

516
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:43,633
Yesterday he meant to go
for a drive.

517
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,500
Since we couldn't yesterday, does
he want to go for a drive today?

518
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:52,866
Really. What am I thinking?

519
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:58,333
What is it? How long do I have to
wait? I'm dying of curiosity!

520
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:01,200
Yeom-mi, that…

521
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:04,566
Who are they? Jude Law and his
friend? Why can't I see anything?

522
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:13,534
Don't look at me like this. I was
even worse. Just close your shop.

523
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,900
The real gods are in front of you
and you can't recognize them.

524
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:18,367
Are you not feeling well?

525
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:22,167
We have been repeating this for
an hour already. Just accept it.

526
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:26,900
If you don't believe me, who will?
And if not, then nothing I can do.

527
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:29,100
Then let me meet him
one more time?

528
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:32,066
- Ha Baek?
- No. That man.

529
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:54,000
You're sturdy. Let's try our best
in the future. Take care of me.

530
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:55,900
Oh?

531
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:02,100
I thought you'd act first after
what happened.

532
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:05,634
I didn't hear from you.
I saw it correctly, didn't I?

533
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,800
As you recognize dme, you must be
the ruler or future ruler.

534
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:11,767
If you know that,
show me your respect.

535
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:15,666
I am not a person from that place,
do I really need to?

536
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:18,000
A person?

537
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,967
No matter how you feel about me in
your world, I don't want to fight.

538
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:27,333
With you guys,

539
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:31,334
I have no relationship.

540
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,733
We don't want to be related
to you either.

541
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:37,767
But I need to confirm something.

542
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:44,300
If I'm right, you're proving
you're the rumored monster.

543
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:45,333
What are you saying?

544
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,666
This is Joo Dong's symbol.
Why is this engraved in your body?

545
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,967
- Let go.
- Where is Joo Dong?

546
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:03,267
- I don't know who he is!
- Then you should explain this.

547
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:06,034
Is there a reason why I have to
explain about my body to you?

548
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:11,167
No reason? It's Joo Dong's symbol
and emblem of the Earth Kingdom.

549
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,300
The insane one who disrupted
the order of the gods' realm and

550
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:15,866
gave you immortality was
the god of the Earth Kingdom?

551
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:21,067
Even so, you cannot possess
this symbol.

552
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:23,467
It seems like you haven't heard

553
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:27,167
- about the powers I possess.
- Those powers!

554
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:30,333
It seems you haven't checked to
see whether they will affect me.

555
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,200
Ha Baek!

556
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:44,700
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet.

557
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:48,334
- Leave.
- What are you doing now?

558
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,000
Do you want to be even more
humiliated?

559
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,000
Ahjussi!

560
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,166
Did someone come?

561
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,500
No.

562
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:35,000
- He has Joo Dong's symbol.
- We'll get by on our own.

563
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,866
- He...
- Ha Baek, please!

564
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:42,067
You don't need to prove yourself.
You're our king.

565
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:44,233
It has been like this for
2800 years.

566
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,433
I'm sorry for losing the stones.
I'll fix everything. Just wait.

567
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:13,834
But why isn't he contacting me?
He was early yesterday.

568
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,366
Is he going to
come right on time today?

569
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,933
Why am I being like this
because of him?

570
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,267
You'll leave now, right?

571
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:30,434
What? I'm the one who'll close up.
And it's not even that late!

572
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,034
What?

573
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,967
Are you doing whatever you want
because we sold the land?

574
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:36,667
Until I leave we have
normal hours. Got it?

575
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:39,600
But today's the anniversary of
your mother's death.

576
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:43,300
Did you perhaps forget? Did you
not order ceremonial food?

577
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,766
I've gone crazy, I've gone crazy.

578
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,700
What am I doing lately?

579
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:51,600
Mom, mom.

580
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:01,934
You didn't eat anything

581
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,966
and only drank alcohol every day.
What is this?

582
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:10,666
They won't sell you alcohol there.

583
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,833
What will you subsist on now?

584
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:20,300
You should have at least eaten
a lot of food before you went.

585
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:04,400
What's going on?

586
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:13,033
Nothing is working out…
because of the gods.

587
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:21,766
No.

588
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,900
It's all my fault.

589
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:48,166
Be alert. My mom tries to
come out sometimes.

590
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:08,533
(Haesari)

591
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Mom. I've been bewitched by
a water ghost, so I couldn't prepare

592
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:35,666
your food. I came to tell you
not to make a trip for nothing.

593
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:42,033
I hope you'll be full just from
seeing her daughter's face.

594
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:10,333
Dad abandoned Mom and me and left.

595
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,833
Mom couldn't defeat her
anger and just drank every day.

596
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,233
She passed away from
acute liver cancer.

597
00:51:24,466 --> 00:51:29,366
Although I really hate my father,
I hate my mother just as much.

598
00:51:30,366 --> 00:51:35,100
They are selfish people who
think only they are important.

599
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:44,167
For 2,800 years,

600
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:47,700
did you have a moment you
regretted or felt ashamed about?

601
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:48,566
I don't.

602
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:53,933
I regretted a lot.

603
00:51:54,633 --> 00:52:00,867
And I felt ashamed just once.
It was so strong that

604
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:03,833
when I get embarrassed now,
I'm not even ashamed.

605
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,200
Mom just left like this.

606
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:12,634
I had all the resentment against
my father.

607
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,333
My life was a total sob story.

608
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,166
I thought that I should take
revenge on my dad some day.

609
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:27,266
In the dead of winter,
I jumped right into the river.

610
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:36,100
It's funny. It was so cold that

611
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,166
I couldn't just wait until I died
in there.

612
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:45,200
I was freezing to death, so
I only thought about getting out.

613
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:50,500
The swimming skills I learned
as a child multiplied by 100.

614
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:54,433
That's how I lived.

615
00:52:56,166 --> 00:53:01,433
However, after that I was never
able to do anything like swimming.

616
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:06,166
Ah, I feel ashamed.

617
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,100
I really feel ashamed.

618
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,666
I'm glad that it's dark.

619
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,333
You're lucky that
I lost my divine powers.

620
00:53:25,933 --> 00:53:28,066
Then you wouldn't even dream of it
being this dark.

621
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,500
Would you put street lamps here
and there?

622
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:37,433
Not something so crude.

623
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,933
Like this.

624
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,467
- Like this?

625
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:53,500
Yes. If I go like this the world's
brightest water fireflies appear.

626
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:55,966
Water firefly?

627
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:01,500
Can you see them?

628
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:07,333
I don't see anything.

629
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:12,233
Look closely. With your heart.

630
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:29,666
Oh, right.

631
00:55:30,266 --> 00:55:33,100
What did you mean by
"let's get off work together"?

632
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,600
If you say that to someone who's
leaving for work, that means…

633
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,000
That means I will come
pick you up.

634
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:42,500
Pardon?

635
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:45,666
Why... all of a sudden?

636
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:49,900
I have my reasons. I went to the
clinic but you had left already.

637
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,266
Go inside.

638
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:56,100
Excuse me.

639
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:01,266
We couldn't get off work together
today, how about tomorrow?

640
00:57:02,066 --> 00:57:06,034
What we couldn't do together
yesterday, should I do it for you?

641
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,267
What we couldn't do?

642
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,867
Yes, I mean

643
00:57:09,933 --> 00:57:13,666
like feeding you good food
and showing you great places.

644
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,266
Why not?

645
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:28,033
Yes. Then see you tomorrow.

646
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,666
(Very One Resort)

647
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,367
You're leaving early today.

648
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:08,667
Yes. We have a group reservation
of kindergarteners.

649
00:58:08,733 --> 00:58:12,333
By the way,
Mr. Nam Soo Ri, about the land.

650
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,834
Even if I sell that land,

651
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,966
it won't be create any problem for
the natural man becoming a king.

652
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,500
I guess so.

653
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,033
Then well.

654
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:25,666
But... However,

655
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:32,134
even in our world, there is
always someone waiting.

656
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,333
What does that mean?

657
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,234
Lord Ha Baek said that?

658
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:36,900
Yes.

659
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,800
About that,

660
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:42,167
too be honest, a long time ago,

661
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:45,234
there were several attempts
to take Ha Baek's position.

662
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:49,067
But you said those things don't
take place in the gods' realm.

663
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:51,800
That's true. But the king of
the Heaven Kingdom was being

664
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:58,234
unreasonably greedy. He committed
evil deeds against Lord Ha Baek.

665
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,867
Evil deeds?

666
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:01,400
No, it's nothing.

667
00:59:09,366 --> 00:59:10,566
(Real Estate Sales Proposal
and Contract)

668
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,666
Are you going somewhere?

669
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:43,333
We don't have
any scheduled patients, right?

670
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:46,600
Maybe the rumor of
our impending closure spread.

671
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,834
I didn't receive a single call
all day.

672
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,767
Work hard.

673
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:53,200
Work hard distributing your
card and work on your blog.

674
00:59:53,266 --> 00:59:56,467
You said there are publicity
places. Look into that.

675
00:59:56,533 --> 00:59:58,000
And be friendly to the patients.

676
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,566
We can't do anything about it.

677
01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:03,333
Let's work day and night.

678
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:08,366
We'll have to ask Ma Bong-yeol's
father for help again.

679
01:00:10,066 --> 01:00:12,767
Have you heard anything from
the Korean leopard people?

680
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:13,800
No.

681
01:00:15,266 --> 01:00:17,200
Even leopard poops are nowhere
in sight when you need them.

682
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,233
(Very One Resort)

683
01:00:39,066 --> 01:00:41,267
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

684
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,166
Miss Yoon.

685
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,533
I know well that this doesn't
make much sense, but

686
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:52,366
I'll pay you the fee for breach of
contract no matter what.

687
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,833
What is the reason?

688
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,233
What is your reason for going
that far? You needed the money.

689
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,666
Well…

690
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,967
because of the leopard poop.

691
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:14,666
What?

692
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:21,166
You see, Korean leopard poop was
discovered on my land.

693
01:01:22,066 --> 01:01:26,600
The Korea Wildcat Preservation
Society joined forces with Russia

694
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:29,667
in trying to
restore Korean leopards.

695
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:34,600
But out of all places,
Korean leopards pooped on my land.

696
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:35,833
Almost 100 years ago.

697
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:40,134
So, as Korean citizens,

698
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,800
we need to urgently restore
the Korean leopard and...

699
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:43,600
Miss Yoon.

700
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:51,000
I'll discuss it in a meeting.

701
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:00,000
What did I do, really?

702
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,067
It's not like I've been
bewitched by a ghost.

703
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:08,000
No, I have been bewitched
by a ghost. A water ghost.

(Water Ghost)

705
01:02:13,633 --> 01:02:14,667
Hello?

706
01:02:14,733 --> 01:02:15,533
I'm leaving now.

707
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,367
We'll see each other there.

708
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,967
Can you really find it?

709
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:20,033
I can.

710
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,700
Water ghost.

711
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:45,666
Oh.

712
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:48,733
I will carry this for you.

713
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,500
Thank you.

714
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:05,367
How can I cross over to
the other side?

715
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:07,067
- Go this way and and go up.
- Okay.

716
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:07,966
Thank you.

717
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:13,633
Did I arrive too early?

718
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,800
You'll have to wait
a little bit longer.

719
01:03:25,866 --> 01:03:28,966
It seems I still have some things
left to do here.

720
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:53,733
Oh?

721
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:07,800
Why is he like this?

722
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,133
(The Bride of Habaek)

723
01:04:49,133 --> 01:04:50,734
I guess you live pretending to be
quite a decent human being.

724
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,767
What is it that you want?

725
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:54,334
I don't know why you're hesitating

726
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,834
I won't just sit and watch
this time.

727
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,100
Then, are you going back?

728
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,134
I must go.

729
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,934
What can you do with me? Are you
going to kill me or something?

730
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,300
You're a really bad god.

731
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,400
That…
Can you do it as well as me?

732
01:05:06,466 --> 01:05:08,367
- Did you kill him too?
- What I have decided now.

733
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:10,734
Go and see what your woman is
doing now.

734
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,734
- It's Yoon So-ah.
- What do you mean?

735
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,200
CEO Sin.
