(The Bride of Habaek)

7
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:26,167
The person who saved you is going
to be the one to bring you death.

8
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,467
You're going to die!

9
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,033
What?

10
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,434
Oh. Hello.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,566
What's going on?

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,334
Nothing.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not done yet.

14
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,734
- I just told you there's a twist.
- Yeom-mi.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,833
It's not your boyfriend.

16
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,300
At first, I thought it was
him too. But then,

17
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:07,100
I saw the face of that person with
the wet sneakers.

18
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,200
It was some middle-aged guy.

19
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:13,267
- Middle-aged guy?
- Yes.

20
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:17,033
Although it's a relief that
it's not your boyfriend…

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,100
This person.

22
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,466
It's this person.

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,333
What?

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,667
This person, who is he?

25
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:39,100
Why is he in this photo?

26
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,400
(The Bride of Habaek)

27
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:57,966
(Final Episode)

28
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,166
You...

29
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,934
Have you been well?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,034
Where have you been?

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,200
I thought
I would finish work earlier, but…

32
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,033
What work?

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,100
Hello.

34
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,434
Let's skip the greetings. Hey you,

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
Jo Yeom-mi, friend of Yoon So-ah.

36
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:30,300
How about you leave now? This
woman and I don't have much time.

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,134
Who is he?

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,734
Leave. It's better if
you don't know too much.

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,434
So what do we do about my dream?
The one who brings you death

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,900
- is your dad…
- Stop talking nonsense.

41
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,667
That dream doesn't mean anything.

42
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,500
I'm telling you it's your dad.
It's the man in the picture!

43
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,067
- I'm sure of it...
- There's a critical error with

44
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:52,767
- what you're saying.
- What?

45
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,734
You said the one to save me will
be the one to lead me to death.

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
But my father has never saved me,
not even once.

47
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,833
Leave.
And forget about that silly dream.

48
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:11,900
Go.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,966
Why is this?

50
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,166
Why are you doing such
a useless thing?

51
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,034
You were looking for the crest?

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,600
There's no need to find it,
but it was bothering me.

53
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,967
It took longer than I expected.

54
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,100
- Did you find it?
- No, not quite.

55
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,434
Just some traces. I have to
match up the pieces together now.

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,867
Whatever it is, do it at Moo Ra's.
I'm busy, so don't bother me.

57
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,234
The messenger must have come.

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
How much time do you have left?

59
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,200
6 days.

60
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,966
I heard that you came back
after you left.

61
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,634
You're not planning on
not returning, right?

62
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,034
You know that's the worst move
you could make, right?

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,967
I know that much too.

64
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:23,500
It's not that I get to stay here
if I don't return.

65
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:26,867
Right. I should at least goodbye
to the landlady before I leave.

66
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,566
Hey.

67
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,666
This way.

68
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,467
He says he's leaving.

69
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,534
Goodbye.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,766
You are not holding me back,
just like someone.

71
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,166
Is that your father?

72
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,100
Yes.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,967
Did he hand over
his burdens onto his daughter?

74
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,100
- Still no news of him?
- Pardon me?

75
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,433
Do you even want to find him?

76
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,600
Go, and stop speaking nonsense.

77
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,900
Ahem, have a great time?

78
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,667
Okay, I get it. I get it.

79
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:51,266
Close the gate behind you.

80
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,400
Like this.

81
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,133
You won't know how to do it
after I leave.

82
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:28,034
Saying you've forgotten
means you haven't forgotten.

83
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,500
And saying you hate him
means you don't.

84
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,066
The heart doesn't shatter
even if you feel it does.

85
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:39,533
Your lies show through.

86
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:43,500
That's you.

87
00:06:58,533 --> 00:06:59,500
Your wish...

88
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,800
was to meet your father and say
everything you want to say to him.

89
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,300
I'm sorry I have to leave
before fulfilling this wish.

90
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,466
Despite saying I'm a god..

91
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm sorry I'm a powerless god
who can't even do that for you.

92
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,566
So,

93
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,766
find him,
even if it's after I leave.

94
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:28,666
Look for him as much as you can.

95
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,000
Even if you happen to find
the worst father in the world,

96
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:35,933
look for him.

97
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:42,534
As you said, you're mature enough
to endure it, so find him.

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,500
Find him, and

99
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:48,866
verify what you want to,
lessen the burden of your heart,

100
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,566
and come out of the darkness.

101
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,934
When I think of you,

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,233
still in that darkness
after I leave,

103
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,100
I get mad.

104
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:35,500
Why don't you go and check? See if
it seems like he'll leave or not.

105
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm sure he'll leave.

106
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,400
It's because
I don't feel good about this.

107
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:41,700
He's going, you'll see. He knows
what will happen if he doesn't,

108
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,333
so why would he do such
an idiotic thing?

109
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,600
Joo Dong is here.

110
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,434
Where have you been,
without any notice?

111
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,900
If you keep blocking your signals
like that, I'll cut ties with you.

112
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,500
I've been chased away by Ha Baek.

113
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,833
You met Ha Baek?

114
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,934
I heard that the messenger came.

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,567
He doesn't seem like
he'll do anything stupid, right?

116
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:23,967
Yep, not really.

117
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,100
So you went around
looking for the crest?

118
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,467
I thought it'd be stuck around
where I collapsed, but it wasn't.

119
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,167
So I thought
maybe I hadn't lost it there.

120
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:37,234
I searched every single place
I had been to. I've been around

121
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,767
the entire country.
That's why I'm a little late.

122
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,867
Didn't you say
you weren't able to find it?

123
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:44,034
Yes, but I think
I might know who took it.

124
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,267
Who?

125
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,000
It must not be visible to humans.

126
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,766
There are some humans who may be
able to see it.

127
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:57,100
Could I stay the night? I need to
go to a bunch of places tomorrow.

128
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,300
- No!
- No!

129
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:13,000
Love is the problem, love.

130
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,200
Nam Soo Ri.

131
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,167
Oh, Lord Joo Dong, where are you?

132
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,434
On the street.

133
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,234
Why, did you meet Lord Ha Baek?

134
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,134
I got kicked out. Where are you?
Could you let me in your house?

135
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,734
I'm working, though. I don't think
I'll be able to go home tonight.

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,867
Why is someone who's about
to leave working so hard?

137
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,900
Lord Ha Baek told me to
make a lot of money.

138
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,667
I understand, I'm hanging up.

139
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,700
Money is the problem, money.

140
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Why are you here?

141
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,434
I'm a little desperate.

142
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,734
A grim reaper?

143
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Our descendant will die?

144
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,834
That's what I'm telling you!

145
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,267
By chance, did you hate
the descendant so much that

146
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,800
you wanted to kill her? You said
dreams are subconscious desires.

147
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:03,967
I thought it was a premonition.

148
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:08,434
But my predictive abilities are
weak, so to make up for it,

149
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,834
I needed a bit of your help,

150
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,366
and I heard that
you're leaving soon.

151
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,500
What?

152
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,100
Hello? 50 chickens? Okay, yes!

153
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,400
Why is he sleeping in,
it's not like him.

154
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,734
I've been waiting for you to
come and wake me up.

155
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Why?

156
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,533
Just because.

157
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:20,133
I have a present for you.

158
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,834
I wanted
to buy you the best present ever

159
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,567
but I thought there wouldn't be
anything better than the ones from

160
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:37,333
a goddess. Instead, I've picked
out the one that suits you best.

161
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:44,334
I always told you that I would
buy you clothes, but I never did.

162
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,434
Let's go on a date,
with you wearing this.

163
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,100
- Go on a date?
- Yes.

164
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,967
What we were going to do
last time.

165
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:54,500
Let's eat something good,
do something fun, shop a bit.

166
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,234
Let's do that today, tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

167
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,100
Let's leave the car here and let's
walk, or take the bus or subway.

168
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,900
- Just because.
- Just because.

169
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:25,833
Here.

170
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,266
Rock, paper, scissors! Yay!

171
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,333
Rock paper, scissors!

172
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:45,366
How come you don't ever win,
not even once?

173
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,400
- Let's do one more round.
- Oh, our bus is here.

174
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,133
Never mind.

175
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,400
Isn't it good to be out? Isn't it
even better to be out with me?

176
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,500
The cold bean noodles are
really good in this place.

177
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,667
You can't eat cold things, though.

178
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,034
I'm going to try. Wouldn't you
feel more at ease once I've solved

179
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,633
at least one of my problems?
I need to show you I'm trying too.

180
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,500
Then, let's try it!

181
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:59,167
It's not a big deal.
I've been scared this whole time

182
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,700
for nothing. It's annoying.

183
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:02,433
Why are you laughing?

184
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:39,366
Ha Baek.

185
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,933
Why are you surprised?
Because I called you by your name?

186
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:50,434
I didn't feel so for others, but
with you, calling you by name felt

187
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,800
like a love confession. That's why
I never did it until now.

188
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,133
Because I felt like I was
giving away my feelings.

189
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:08,467
Ha Baek. Today, we had noodles.
Do you know how to play

190
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:12,100
rock paper scissors? If we win,
they'll draw a picture of us.

191
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,633
I will only draw you if you win.
Lose and you get nothing.

192
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,334
Now then. Rock, paper, scissors!

193
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,867
Once again. Rock, paper, scissors!

194
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:30,100
Right, Rock, paper, scissors! Ah!

195
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:35,034
Yay, we won! You did well.

196
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,400
Wait a moment, please.

197
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,100
Take a seat. They'll be back soon.

198
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,767
You're very good at rock paper
scissors. What's your trick?

199
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,167
I can't explain something as low
as a trick.

200
00:16:55,233 --> 00:17:01,533
I never lose,
so you must be really great.

201
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,667
The bride must've made a request
about something to my wife.

202
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,666
Bride?

203
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,033
Oh, right, here she comes.

204
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:25,466
Am I pretty? Ha Baek?

205
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,566
Am I pretty?

206
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:31,833
Yes.

207
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:47,834
Photographs fade
after some time, so...

208
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,200
I heard that coal doesn't fade,
even after a very long time.

209
00:18:54,833 --> 00:19:01,300
Your face will be preserved
more clearly than in a photograph.

210
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:05,033
I thought it'd be better to have
a portrait that won't fade.

211
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,166
You must look this way for me
to be able to draw you.

212
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:20,633
Mr. Groom?

213
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,033
Wait a moment!

214
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,233
You forgot this.

215
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,300
You're as beautiful as a painting,
you two.

216
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,366
Here.

217
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,833
It's great, here.

218
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:26,700
Don't get so hung up on it. Though
I did suffer a bit because of you.

219
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:30,067
- I am sorry
- It's like that for everyone.

220
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:34,734
- Don't worry. I have a question.
- About?

221
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,400
I am looking for someone. But
I think he's someone in your life.

222
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,267
Who are you looking for?

223
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,734
Probably the person who saved you?

224
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,433
The person who saved me?

225
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:52,100
I lost my crest on that day.
So I traced back my steps from

226
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:57,667
that place and ended up
tracing back your steps as well.

227
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,167
I found out you were wandering
around the Divine Gate that day

228
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:04,567
your stepmother Sin Mi-jung found
you and took you in. Also, there

229
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:08,167
- was one more person.
- Yes, you're right.

230
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:14,034
That night, long after you left,
a man found me.

231
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,967
He left after taking me to
the hospital. From his traces,

232
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:23,200
I found out his identity.
He was the same person you've met.

233
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:26,467
But why are you looking for
this person?

234
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:29,500
I think he probably picked up
my crest.

235
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:32,034
Did he mention anything about
where he was headed to that night?

236
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,267
He did say he's on his way to
meet someone.

237
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,100
I was in a bad state,
so he sent me and my mother first.

238
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,834
Afterwards, I heard that he was
on his way to his wife's grave.

239
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,967
He had come back after being abroad
for a year, but he didn't know

240
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:52,067
that his wife had died. After that
day we couldn't get a hold of him.

241
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,100
Mother tried her best to look for
him, but we weren't able to.

242
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,400
- Wife's grave.
-However, from what I heard

243
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:03,734
that night, he said there is
someone else he had to meet.

244
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,634
Who?

245
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,767
- His daughter.
- Daughter? Was his name Yoon?

246
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,666
Yes, Mother said his name was
Yoon Seong-joon.

247
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:19,634
The night of December 20, 2004?

248
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,333
Yes, on that date, that night, do
you remember where you were?

249
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,934
The human brain doesn't remember
what happened yesterday.

250
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,167
How would she remember
what happened so long ago? Leave.

251
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:38,534
Where were you?
You don't keep a diary?

252
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,766
Can you try to look for it?

253
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,934
What are you plotting? I told you
not to come. Why did you ask that?

254
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,600
That's the day I went missing.

255
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,300
What does that have to do with
Yoon So-ah?

256
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:59,500
Her father, Yoon Seong-joon
probably took my crest.

257
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:00,000
What?

258
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:04,434
I went everywhere I had been. Then
something popped in my head.

259
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,100
The man who took me to
the hospital. The number he left.

260
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,800
I traced that phone number. It was
under the name Yoon Seong-joon.

261
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:15,166
Our servant's father. In other
words, he was our servant.

262
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,000
What was that?

263
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,433
Why is he curious about
what I did that day?

264
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:42,333
I figured it out. The servant's
crest probably caught his eye.

265
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
Divine things are not visible to
the human eye, but the servant's

266
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:47,367
crest is visible to the servants.
He probably picked it up thinking

267
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:52,400
that it was mine. He probably
planned on returning it to me.

268
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:56,200
Since I hadn't handed it to him,
he wouldn't have been awakened.

269
00:23:56,266 --> 00:24:00,834
However, why are you asking about
So-ah's whereabouts on that night?

270
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,234
He wasn't awakened, but the crest
probably recognized the servant.

271
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,634
Do you understand what I'm saying?

272
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,567
On that night, before he found me,
Yoon Seong-joon met that

273
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:15,234
half-god half-human.
And he saved him first.

274
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,766
He said that Yoon was
on his way to meet his daughter.

275
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,000
The crest of servant has the power

276
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,834
to grant the servant's
earnest wish.

277
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,034
Yes! That night, his earnestness
must have reached the crest.

278
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,700
The crest must have taken
Yoon Seong-joon to his daughter…

279
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:43,033
So, where was that girl
on that night?

280
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,466
Just come once. Dad.

281
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,533
Then I will forgive everything.

282
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,400
Welcome, ahjussi.

283
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:15,400
It seems like your mind is at ease
now. So what did you call me for?

284
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:18,634
What is this crest thing
that the gods carry?

285
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:26,300
That's the servant's crest. It's
a symbol to awaken the servant's

286
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:30,167
family. As it's a divine item, it
won't be visible to other humans.

287
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:34,400
Only those in the family of
the god's servant can see it. Why?

288
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:39,434
- Daughter.
- Was his name Yoon?

289
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,033
Yes, Mother said his name was
Yoon Seong-joon.

290
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,500
Yoon. I knew I was right.

291
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,266
(The parent-child relationship)

292
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,933
He's over there.

293
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,933
Ha Baek.

294
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,033
I've found him.

295
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:38,534
Oh? Amusement park. Went already.

296
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,666
Claw machine. No, no. Yong Yong
might get jealous. Alright now?

297
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:49,200
Then, eat street food.

298
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:58,767
I better write going to the
arcade. Oh! I need to ask him to

299
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,833
buy me a single flower. If I ask,
he will give me one, right?

300
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:08,000
Share shaved ice . Take a nap at
the Han River. Remember to

301
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:11,833
pack a mat. Share earbuds to
listen to music together.

302
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,300
There are so many things to do.

303
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,533
I should have done these earlier.

304
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,067
Yoon So-ah.

305
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,467
Oh. Let's get going.

306
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,500
We have so many things to do.

307
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,934
Also, you were right.

308
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,067
I will look for my dad before
he comes back.

309
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:35,166
It's not like
I am a teenager being immature.

310
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,867
I will surely find him and
make him beg for forgiveness.

311
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:41,600
I am going to live with courage.

312
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:42,766
Yoon So-ah.

313
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,334
I have to go out for a while.

314
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,767
What? To where?

315
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,267
We don't have much time.

316
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,434
I will be back as soon as I can.

317
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,633
Fine. I will get ready then.

318
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:13,600
I should dress up everyday.
It's a must.

319
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,566
Underline it.

320
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:26,234
However, from what I heard that
night he said there's someone else

321
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,634
he had to meet. His daughter.

322
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,200
I can't ask my father's opinion
due to some circumstances.

323
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,766
As for my mother… she passed away
so I can't ask her opinion either.

324
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,200
I am just asking you to be on
the safe side.

325
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:59,800
Even if you find out who Yoon
Seong-joon is, don't do anything.

326
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:03,100
There is someone else who has to
untangle this fate.

327
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:08,133
There is nothing prepared for you
in this lifetime.

328
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:15,900
Miss Yoon So-ah.

329
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:17,300
Yes, CEO Sin.

330
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:19,234
I would like to see you
briefly now.

331
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,967
Pardon?

332
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,633
It won't take long.

333
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,434
Oh...

334
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,200
Over there. He's in there.
Yoon Seong-joon.

335
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:35,700
And also my crest. She jumped into
the river and survived?

336
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,834
It was probably due to
er father's powers.

337
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Have you ever tried to
look for him?

338
00:29:40,966 --> 00:29:42,567
No, I didn't.

339
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:45,833
What if I found him
but he was in Korea?

340
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,033
Suppose he was in Korea all along
but he didn't come back to us.

341
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,266
What should I do then?

342
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:55,833
How about now?

343
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,867
Is that your real wish?

344
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,900
To meet your dad and say
whatever is on your mind?

345
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:11,900
I think so.

346
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:23,933
I will bring him out.

347
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,566
Why did you ask to see me?

348
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:08,767
About our counselling... I think
today will be my last session.

349
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:09,567
Pardon?

350
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:14,066
After I tell you the rest of
the story about my past.

351
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:21,666
That night,
I ran towards the light.

352
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,233
Are you alright?

353
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:48,566
It's alright. It's alright.

354
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,834
Stay still. Don't be nervous.

355
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,834
It was the very first time that

356
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,567
I felt the warmth of a human body.

357
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,500
Someone telling you,
"it's alright"

358
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,833
has such a power.

359
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:08,100
I found that out for the first time
that night as well.

360
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,000
I told you I was lucky.

361
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:18,434
If the first human I met that day
wasn't him,

362
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,067
if I met a human
who wasn't able to embrace me

363
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:26,000
and say "it's alright"
to a kid like me,

364
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,666
how would I have turned out?

365
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,700
I met three gods so far.

366
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:42,000
Him, my stepmother, and

367
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:46,000
Miss Yoon So-ah.

368
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,133
Can I formally ask you for
a handshake as a way to thank you?

369
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,800
You're back?

370
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,333
I hung it.

371
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:38,533
Is it raining outside?

372
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,266
What's wrong?
You look like you're about to cry.

373
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:54,766
Huh?

374
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:58,500
What's wrong?

375
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:01,900
Why?

376
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:04,966
Your friends said they won't
give you money again?

377
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,200
There is no need.

378
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,666
Your father... I found him.

379
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:35,466
Your father...

380
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:39,733
I found him.

381
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:45,633
Where? Where is he now?

382
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,100
Hm?

383
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:52,200
Where?

384
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:59,900
Under the river

385
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:02,466
where you threw yourself that day.

386
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,700
What did you say?

387
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,900
What are you talking about?

388
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:15,033
What do you mean?

389
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:23,200
Your father came back to Korea
on that day.

390
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:27,234
After hearing about your mother's
news, he was heading to her grave.

391
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,867
On his way there,
he picked up Joo Dong's crest.

392
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:38,800
The crest of the servant has the
power to grant the servant's wish.

393
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:44,766
Your father's wish on that day
must have been to meet you.

394
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:04,533
On that day, right before you
threw yourself into the river,

395
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:13,033
your father went there led by
the power of the crest.

396
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:16,766
No.

397
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:24,533
He probably saw you jumping into
the water.

398
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,666
No. No.

399
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,066
(The parent-child relationship)

400
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:57,066
So-ah…

401
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:06,000
So-ah... No... So-ah!

402
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
(The parent-child relationship)

403
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,666
My dad...

404
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,700
couldn't swim.

405
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,233
He couldn't.

406
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:18,867
Why? Why?

407
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:22,834
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

408
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,767
Dad.

409
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:29,566
Dad. Dad.

410
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:34,034
Dad. Please come out, please.

411
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,534
Dad.

412
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,300
Dad.

413
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:48,834
Please save my dad.

414
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,234
This doesn't make any sense.
My dad.

415
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,233
My dad shouldn't leave like this.

416
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:06,934
Ha Baek, save him.

417
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,033
You're a god.

418
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,300
Please save my dad. Please.

419
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:18,700
I can't

420
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:20,500
revive the dead.

421
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:24,566
I didn't know and

422
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:28,733
I thought I survived by myself.

423
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:33,300
My dad is so pitiful.

424
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:39,500
Because of me.

425
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:42,633
- No it's not.
- Because of me.

426
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:46,033
Because of me. Me.

427
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:49,067
I killed my dad. I did.

428
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,534
No.

429
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,034
I killed him.

430
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,200
And then

431
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,734
for such a long time

432
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,434
I blamed and resented him.

433
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,233
I killed my dad. I did.

434
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:09,066
No.

435
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:14,033
That's why he's not coming out.

436
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,867
Because he doesn't want to see me.

437
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:19,266
No. That's not true, Yoon So-ah.

438
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:23,300
That's not true.

439
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:29,900
I have to go.
My dad is waiting for me.

440
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:32,467
- I am going to go and bring him.
- No.

441
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:35,567
Let me go. I can't do it.

442
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,900
I used to be good at swimming too.

443
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:41,867
He knows that. That's why
he's waiting for me. Please.

444
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:44,766
- Please.
- No.

445
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,466
- Let me go.
- No, no you can't.

446
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,534
He won't move?

447
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,900
No matter how hard Ha Baek tries
to move him, he won't budge.

448
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:18,967
He has a divine item on his body,
so thankfully his body is intact.

449
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:20,234
Ha Baek was afraid that if he
removes the crest, his body might

450
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,033
fall apart,
so he just left the crest there.

451
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:24,967
Then what will happen to
the descendant?

452
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:26,234
Why won't he move?

453
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,833
That... No one knows.

454
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,367
What is god?

455
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:25,333
A superior being who makes the
human's earnest wish come true.

456
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:31,000
That is a real god.

457
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,934
Your wish was to meet your dad to
tell him everything you want to.

458
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,633
I am sorry for leaving before
fulfilling that wish.

459
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,666
I say that I am a god. I am sorry
for being a powerless god

460
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:52,433
who can't even make that one wish
come true.

461
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,300
Lord Ha Baek.

462
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,534
- Is Yoon So-ah alright?
- She's not doing well.

463
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,833
Moo Ra and I went back in. We
can't do it with our powers either.

464
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,167
What do we do then?

465
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:04,500
Descendant didn't say it, but
she was waiting for her father.

466
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:09,166
She says she herself will go in.

467
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,600
It's too deep for So-ah
to go in there. She can't.

468
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,200
However, we can't just let her be.

469
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,100
Why not?

470
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,867
Don't do anything. Nothing.

471
00:47:24,933 --> 00:47:26,967
- Like you didn't in the past.
- Moo Ra.

472
00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:31,800
Don't you think I know what crazy
thing you're planning to do?

473
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:36,300
I am Moo Ra. For 2800 years,
I could always read your thoughts.

474
00:47:36,366 --> 00:47:40,700
Even your sighs,
I know what they mean.

475
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:42,567
- Moo Ra
- What are you talking about?

476
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,067
The divine power you need to
use on your return,

477
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:47,600
that,

478
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:52,633
you will use it on her.
That's what you've decided.

479
00:47:54,533 --> 00:48:00,000
- Really?
- Lord Ha Baek, you can't. Then...

480
00:48:00,066 --> 00:48:04,967
If he can't return, he can't have
the coronation ceremony.

481
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:09,234
If you can't become a king,
if you can't, then...

482
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,500
He will stop existing.

483
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:15,266
You know that very well too.

484
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,900
I'm not going to forgive you for
even thinking that. You can't!

485
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,934
- Absolutely not.
- Don't, Lord Ha Baek.

486
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,966
No, Ha Baek.

487
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:37,567
I made a promise.

488
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:41,500
Stop saying nonsense. Is it more
important than your death?

489
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:45,000
I told her that it's
the god's duty to protect.

490
00:48:49,566 --> 00:48:51,700
If I can't save even her,

491
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,034
how can I be called a king?

492
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,667
Stop saying ridiculous things. Do
you think she really wants that?

493
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:05,367
If you stop existing, you'll
vanish from people's memories.

494
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:07,800
She won't even be able to
remember you.

495
00:49:07,866 --> 00:49:11,633
She won't even know a god like you
ever existed.

496
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,100
What are you talking about?

497
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:52,267
- Please listen to my words.
- No.

498
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,733
I can't hear a thing.

499
00:49:55,466 --> 00:49:58,233
Don't say anything.

500
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,633
How?

501
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,167
How can you think such a thing?
How?

502
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,933
How can you have such
a cruel thought?

503
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,600
You are going to die?

504
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:15,333
You will vanish from my memories?

505
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:19,300
I won't ever know you?

506
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,700
How?

507
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:27,200
Listen to what I say.

508
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,600
It's because
I didn't do anything for you.

509
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:43,367
I am your god. You said god is a
being who makes a human's earnest

510
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,233
wish come true.
So give me a chance.

511
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:48,166
I've never said such a thing.

512
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,400
I don't have a wish.

513
00:50:58,366 --> 00:50:59,366
Also,

514
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,333
I told you that
I will protect you.

515
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:09,000
I've never asked you to protect me
with your life.

516
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:14,000
Why are you so selfish? Why?

517
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,100
What to do?

518
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,367
What to do?
Hurry and send him away.

519
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,133
Isn't there
a way to force his return?

520
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,566
Then what should we do?

521
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,533
He might really do it.

522
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:39,200
Let's confine him.
Let's have him confined.

523
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,700
We can't. You can't do
anything by force to a king.

524
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:45,567
Then use your powers to protect
her. You said she's your friend.

525
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:47,667
Why do you ask when you know
already? Even with my, your or

526
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,700
Joo Dong's divine powers,
it's beyond our abilities.

527
00:51:50,766 --> 00:51:54,300
Then what should we do?

528
00:51:54,366 --> 00:51:57,834
It's because of you. Why did you
go dig up such things?

529
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,300
If Ha Baek dies,
you will die too by my hands.

530
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:19,666
Last time, Moo Ra said Ha Baek is
nothing if he's not a king.

531
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:26,234
Ha Baek was born a king because
that's his role. If he isn't king,

532
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,734
there is no reason for him
to exist. Therefore, he will

533
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,134
stop existing.
That's the law of nature.

534
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,767
You human people can't remember
all the past gods.

535
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:41,134
It is for this reason.

536
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,900
So, please do this for Ha Baek.

537
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:48,534
Just leave

538
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,333
your father there.

539
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,933
Don't try to retrieve him.

540
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:59,700
You have to do that in order for
Ha Baek and you to live.

541
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:15,700
According to Lord Bi Ryeom, the
descendant has decided to give up.

542
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,066
Yoon So-ah.

543
00:54:02,266 --> 00:54:04,100
You were right.

544
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:08,567
I was afraid to lose you so
I only thought of myself.

545
00:54:08,633 --> 00:54:12,533
I told you that I would let you
live with my memory

546
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,700
but I forgot about that.

547
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,033
So,

548
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,933
you must also
promise me one thing.

549
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,000
That you will

550
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,500
treasure your life.

551
00:54:35,566 --> 00:54:37,133
That even after I leave,

552
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,366
you will do that.

553
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:48,900
You father will be at peace even
in that place.

554
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:54,166
I will look over him every day.

555
00:54:55,866 --> 00:55:04,500
Did you forget that I'm a Water God
and king of the Water Kingdom?

556
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,100
Let's go see your father.

557
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,700
I'm sorry, Dad.

558
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:47,966
I'm sorry.

559
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,833
I'm sorry, Dad.

560
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,866
What did you just say?

561
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,300
Where did they go?

562
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,300
Why is it so quiet?

563
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:29,866
Don't worry about anything.

564
00:56:35,366 --> 00:56:38,033
You yourself should not worry
bout a thing and get going.

565
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,300
That was our original plan anyway.
We should try to do

566
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:46,533
what we were planning to do.
Where should we go first?

567
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:04,766
I love you.

568
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,767
What is this...

569
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,300
Since I've given you
a divine blessing,

570
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:58,067
You can't.

571
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:00,666
you will definitely live.

572
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:06,100
You will not be touched by
any unhappiness

573
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:09,400
and you will live out
your natural lifespan.

574
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:11,600
No!

575
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,666
So,

576
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:23,900
meet someone you love

577
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:27,667
and live out
the rest of your life happily.

578
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:33,733
Happiness, that's the thing
you wanted the most, isn't it?

579
00:58:35,266 --> 00:58:37,400
You can't, you can't.

580
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,333
Were you going to do this from
the beginning?

581
00:58:43,366 --> 00:58:46,766
Were you going to deceive me?
Is that why you brought me here?

582
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,333
I can't just leave you.

583
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,200
If I leave, you will without
a doubt go to meet your father.

584
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,500
How can I just leave knowing that?

585
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,100
I can do it.
I said that I can do it.

586
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:09,067
What? How could you do this?
How could you do such a foolish...

587
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,234
How could you do this?

588
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,600
What am I going to do now?

589
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,634
I'll tell you what to do,
so listen carefully.

590
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,967
Pull yourself together.

591
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:22,000
Go meet your father right now.

592
00:59:22,066 --> 00:59:24,667
I don't want to. I don't want to.

593
00:59:24,733 --> 00:59:28,200
Go quickly.
Your father is waiting.

594
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,100
Quickly.

595
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:37,866
Yoon So-ah, go.

596
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:41,166
While I'm here,

597
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,233
let me do what I can for you.

598
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:02,900
This doesn't make sense.
This doesn't make any sense.

599
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,034
Ha Baek,
how can you do this to us?

600
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,033
Ha Baek.

601
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,667
Go. Your father is waiting.

602
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:18,034
Ha Baek!

603
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,733
Leave him alone. Let him do
what he needs to do for now.

604
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,300
How...

605
01:00:31,466 --> 01:00:32,700
Go.

606
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,100
Your father is waiting.

607
01:01:52,766 --> 01:01:54,500
Dad.

608
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:11,000
Dad.

609
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,800
Dad,

610
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,866
why are you here by yourself?

611
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,000
How scared you must have been.

612
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,700
How lonely and cold.

613
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,766
You should have called me sooner.

614
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:51,200
Let's go home now, Dad.

615
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:55,466
Let's go home.

616
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,500
(Yoon Seong-joon
9/12/1957 - 12/20/2004)

617
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:16,567
Wait just a little, Dad.

618
01:04:16,633 --> 01:04:20,166
I'll bring Mom over here soon.

619
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:07,234
I'm not going to forgive you.

620
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah.

621
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,133
I'm going to hate you and
resent you.

622
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:17,300
Yeah.

623
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,233
I will regret

624
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,866
meeting you.

625
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,566
Ok.

626
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,600
Before I become like that,

627
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:42,100
I'm going to set things straight.

628
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:59,800
I'm going to
return you to your rightful place.

629
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:02,366
What are you saying?

630
01:06:05,366 --> 01:06:07,934
I thought you were slow-witted
but you must

631
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,666
have enough brains to
think this far.

632
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:17,300
Don't think I'll forgive you for
using your brain this much.

633
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:18,767
What's going on?

634
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,000
The descendant found a way.

635
01:06:21,066 --> 01:06:23,900
My crest that was in
Yoon Seong-joon's pocket.

636
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:31,900
You said that a servant's crest
could grant one earnest wish.

637
01:06:31,966 --> 01:06:36,000
I'm going to make it so that
you can return.

638
01:06:36,066 --> 01:06:36,567
Yoon So-ah.

639
01:06:36,633 --> 01:06:41,500
Quickly. I want to drown you both
but I'm holding myself back.

640
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:44,666
Do it quickly. Moo Ra is going to
start a flood soon.

641
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,600
Your hand.

642
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:18,100
Now everything will go back to
its rightful place.

643
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,366
- The divine blessing...
- You're all here.

644
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,033
What is it?

645
01:07:34,033 --> 01:07:35,000
Is it the High Priest?

646
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:42,734
- What are you doing here?
- I come to the human realm often.

647
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,300
Did Joo Dong not tell you?

648
01:07:45,366 --> 01:07:46,966
Oh... I forgot...

649
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,567
I came to catch my maid
who ran away without any words

650
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:58,900
after causing trouble.
I also had someone I had to meet.

651
01:08:01,233 --> 01:08:06,234
You met a taxi driver
with divine powers

652
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,034
and are
the person whose life changed.

653
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,600
What?

654
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:12,967
By any chance...

655
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:15,434
I heard that Lord Ha Baek
did some part-time work.

656
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:20,467
You don't have any parents
to buy red underwear for,

657
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:24,600
so what did you buy with your
first paycheck... Your Highness?

658
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,634
High Priest, did you perhaps…

659
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,734
Why are you appearing suddenly
and getting in the way? Quickly.

660
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,600
- Oh, oh... the divine blessing...
- What are you doing?

661
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:35,700
Ah really.

662
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:38,900
Listen carefully. I'm only going
to say this once. This idiot used

663
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:42,467
This idiot, used is only divine powers
on this woman

664
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:43,500
and now he can't go back.

665
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,534
Wait just a minute.

666
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,767
So you're going to use
the precious power of the crest

667
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:54,100
for Lord Ha Baek? Why would you
do something so useless?

668
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:58,000
What are you saying? If Ha Baek
doesn't go back, he's dead.

669
01:08:58,066 --> 01:08:59,767
Why can't he go back?
Ha Baek completed his mission.

670
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:05,467
If he completed his mission,
then he can go back.

671
01:09:05,533 --> 01:09:11,400
Exactly. Why'd he have to come
back and create this situation?

672
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:13,900
Wait a minute.

673
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,566
My new mission was
to find the reason

674
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,666
why the divine stones were
placed in the human realm.

675
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:32,100
That's right!
You already found out the reason.

676
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,100
If a god

677
01:09:46,966 --> 01:09:49,133
can't save one person,

678
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,933
how can he save a whole world?

679
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,200
What is this?

680
01:09:57,266 --> 01:10:03,000
I knew it! The Lord Energy of
the Universe favors Ha Baek.

681
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:10,566
Miss Yoon So-ah, use the crest
to make a more precious wish.

682
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,634
My guest has arrived
so I need to go.

683
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:19,666
Lord Ha Baek, no matter what, you
must return to the Water Kingdom.

684
01:10:23,366 --> 01:10:27,100
That's right. The High Priest's
words are correct.

685
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,633
Shall we finish what we started?

686
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:35,466
Wish for the very best thing
so that I don't have to worry.

687
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:40,166
You can just ask to
become richer than Mansour.

688
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:47,533
I give my divine blessing,
so awaken.

689
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,466
Last descendant of the gods'
servants, state your wish.

690
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:07,033
Don't hesitate, ask for the thing
that will make you happiest.

691
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:15,666
My wish...

692
01:11:17,533 --> 01:11:21,733
My... wish...

693
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,000
I...

694
01:11:32,233 --> 01:11:34,466
My wish...

695
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,700
is that you

696
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:45,533
can leave a little later.

697
01:11:50,033 --> 01:11:52,800
Just until I die

698
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:57,066
you will stay with me.

699
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:04,633
Live with me until then.

700
01:12:06,233 --> 01:12:11,500
After I die,
go back and become a great king.

701
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,533
Let's live together.

702
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,833
I'm leaving. I think I'm gonna
lose it. I need rest.

703
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,433
You rejected Mansour.

704
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,966
It's because you're young.

705
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:09,266
- I love you.
- I love you.

706
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:22,367
You've done a good deed and won't
have problems in your next life.

707
01:13:22,433 --> 01:13:27,100
What did I do? So-ah came
and asked me about the power of

708
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:28,967
the crest and I told her
what I knew.

709
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:33,134
You took a risk and
revealed the secrets of nature.

710
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,067
That's the strongest divine power.

711
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:40,367
Ah, on our first meeting...

712
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:44,700
I'm pleased to meet you.
I'm the High Priest.

713
01:13:44,766 --> 01:13:47,500
I'm Sin Hoo-ye,
formerly the God of Fire.

714
01:13:47,566 --> 01:13:52,767
Lord Hoo-ye,
please teach me a fire trick.

715
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:56,200
If I learn that, then I'll be
able to control water, fire, air,

716
01:13:56,266 --> 01:14:01,000
earth, and humans
all five of them.

717
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,000
Come visit me soon.

718
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:21,034
Lord Ha Baek, let's go now.

719
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:25,933
That sneaky old man,
he knew it all along.

720
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,633
I still have to go back to
the Water Kingdom anyway.

721
01:14:32,866 --> 01:14:34,900
I'll go to take care of
your wish and return.

722
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,134
You're going to return, right?

723
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,300
I will definitely return.

724
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,534
You're going to come quickly, right?

725
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:52,200
Yes.

726
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:53,300
I'll be back.

727
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:33,400
I organized everything
by category.

728
01:15:33,466 --> 01:15:36,967
I don't need it. I figured it out.

729
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,566
How to become a human being.

730
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:47,700
As you know,
I used to be a really good student.

731
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:50,800
I finally figured out
what you were saying.

732
01:15:52,933 --> 01:15:56,766
What is your method of becoming
a human being?

733
01:15:58,066 --> 01:16:02,567
Look it over. They're foundations
I nagged my grandfather

734
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:06,367
into setting up. This one is for
single mothers, this one is for

735
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:09,900
senior citizens, and this one is
for orphan children.

736
01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:11,533
Noblesse oblige. That's the way
to become a human being.

737
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,434
This is not a bad idea
but first this.

738
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,234
Write down the name of relevant
parties and get their signatures.

739
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,667
- Starting with "I'm sorry."
- What is it?

740
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:33,734
Think of the people you need to
apologize to and then apologize to

741
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,967
them and get their signature.
Start with your grandfather. Then

742
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:37,800
- I'll be your church oppa again.
- What?

743
01:16:37,866 --> 01:16:41,400
Become more human,
and I can become just your oppa.

744
01:16:41,466 --> 01:16:42,866
What?

745
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,800
Don't even dream of it.

746
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:35,867
Even if you jump in, Ha Baek can't
return immediately to save you.

747
01:17:35,933 --> 01:17:37,533
Who was thinking that?

748
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:47,000
Your dad's in the forest, why are
you acting pitifully here? Don't

749
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:48,866
throw stuff. It pollutes the
water. Also, I'll share some news.

750
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,000
Ha Baek won't be able to
come back.

751
01:17:53,066 --> 01:17:57,266
What are you saying?
Did he send a message?

752
01:17:57,566 --> 01:18:03,434
What do I need a message for?
I'm a goddess. I just feel it.

753
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:09,167
Let's go.

754
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:11,767
If there's no news, doesn't that
mean he's not coming?

755
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:16,566
Start worrying about us. There
really isn't a ring you like?

756
01:18:17,933 --> 01:18:20,266
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

757
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:32,333
- Do you have something to say?
- I was going to tell you but I

758
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,767
- think I have to marry Hyung-sik.
- What?

759
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:38,400
I think it's better if we just get
married. Is love so complicated?

760
01:18:38,466 --> 01:18:43,666
Worrying about someone and caring
for them, that's enough for me.

761
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,134
Think about it rationally.
Friends can't marry each other.

762
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:54,100
We know each other inside and out.
Do you hate Hyung-sik?

763
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:56,000
- It's not like that...
- Hyung-sik is here.

764
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:58,000
- What?
- To get your permission.

765
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,367
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

766
01:19:00,433 --> 01:19:01,700
Hyung-sik.

767
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,934
So-ah, long time no see.

768
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,100
Ah yes, it's been a long time. Why
haven't you ever visited before?

769
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:20,766
I was afraid of you.

770
01:19:22,733 --> 01:19:24,266
What did I do?

771
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,567
Yoo Sang-yoo is getting married?

772
01:19:27,633 --> 01:19:31,234
Yeah. He has nothing to his name,
what kind of marriage...

773
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,334
I was going to at least prepare
a security deposit for him.

774
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:40,467
This is so sudden. I tried to stop
him but he won't listen to me.

775
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:45,034
He said back in the day, people
started with a pot and two spoons.

776
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,900
Is that something that
he should be saying?

777
01:19:52,633 --> 01:19:56,900
Hello? Did she
hang up again? That girl...

778
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,367
I've returned.

779
01:20:36,433 --> 01:20:38,434
I told you to come home early but
you really don't listen to me.

780
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,867
Why are you so late?

781
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:43,534
It's difficult and complicated
to delay the coronation.

782
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
They really have no flexibility.

783
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:09,766
Let's go eat.

784
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,900
- Does your body still feel hunger?
- Yup.

785
01:21:28,966 --> 01:21:30,200
What about the goblin's club?

786
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,134
They said I couldn't.

787
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,633
Then you only have
a driver's license again?

788
01:21:35,866 --> 01:21:39,000
- They told me to get that here.
- There's so much to do.

789
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:40,567
What about Nam Soo Ri?

790
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:43,966
He said part-time work is hard
and he's scared of your friend.

792
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,500
What should we eat?

793
01:22:11,433 --> 01:22:18,066

794
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:27,534
People live with any strength
they possess, if it is love.

795
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,566
If it is love, it's better.
