(The Bride of Habaek)

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,766
This kid is destined to have a
short life. She's destined to die

8
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,733
before Lord Ha Baek returns to
sit on the throne.

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,233
I will grace you with
a god's blessing, so wake up.

10
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:44,100
You are…
you're now the god´s person.

11
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,867
If you don't accept it, you'll end
up facing countless difficulties.

12
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,700
How is it? Something quietly
creeps into your heart

13
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:53,100
and hits you on the head.
That's how it feels, isn't it?

14
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,900
You have received the kiss of
a god.

15
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,966
Be honored.

16
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:14,167
What are you doing?!

17
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:17,067
You crazy jerk!

18
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:19,967
As expected, it didn't work.

19
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:23,500
Look at that. She is mad.

20
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,666
Go and fix it.

21
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,700
Are you scared?

22
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:33,834
Okay. I will do it this one time.

23
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,934
Don't.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,633
You've been telling me that
a lot since we came here.

25
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,134
Who do you think you are
telling that to?

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,800
You can´t kiss human girls
just like that.

27
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:49,300
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:53,266
She has not woken up yet.
If you go now you'll get slapped.

29
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:01,267
(The Bride of Habaek)

30
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,100
(Episode 2)

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,666
Crazy jerk. Crazy jerk.
He´s a crazy jerk.

32
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:20,167
And why would you close your eyes?

33
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,700
I need to find a legitimate reason
for why I closed my eyes.

34
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:27,000
Right. If I don't want this to
become a trauma,

35
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,800
if I don't want this to
become a trauma...

36
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,934
Find the cause.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,034
Face it, then overcome it.

38
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,166
Hey, servant.

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,867
No, no. Don´t! No!

40
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:59,034
Something quietly creeps into
your heart

41
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,667
and hits you on the head.
That's how it feels, isn't it?

42
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,866
- No.
- I´m sure it´s true.

43
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,633
No, it´s not.

44
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,166
Won´t you get off?

45
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,867
You can´t kiss human girls
just like that.

46
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,833
If you go now, you´ll get slapped.

47
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,833
Even if I bestow grace, she
doesn't know it. She's slow.

48
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,766
I'm hungry.

49
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:29,100
I'm hungr…

50
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,733
Though I have enough
slow servants with this rascal.

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,367
No. You are wrong.

52
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:47,733
She will awaken and come to find
me with her own two feet anyway.

53
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,800
It´s not a big deal.

54
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,800
It's because
the world has changed.

55
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,733
Damn! Sang-yoo didn't even call!

56
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:45,967
It's Sunday you know, Sunday.
You're cursing me out, right?

57
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:51,300
It's Sunday, you know, Sunday.
It's Sunday. Sunday! Sunday!

58
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,966
That´s right. It´s Sunday.

59
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:58,700
You went back to bed, didn't you?
Get up.

60
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:01,133
Okay.

61
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,833
Exercise. Do some exercise.

62
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,833
Get some sunlight, vitamin D is
important these days.

63
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,434
You need to have strong calves to
prevent diabetes later on.

64
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,800
You need to have strong calves.

65
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:30,633
Dear god. I'll kill Sang-yoo
and just go to hell.

66
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,266
Why are there
so many humans today?

67
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,433
Why are you blocking the way?

68
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,667
It's called a car. A transportation
device for humans.

69
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:49,100
A car? You said it's a car, but
why are there only two wheels?

70
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,100
How can they go without falling
with just two wheels?

71
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,533
Well, that...

72
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,800
There are other types of wheels,
would you like to see them?

73
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:25,400
It's cool, right?

74
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:29,933
It's whatever. Just having four
wheels doesn't make it the same.

75
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,733
Since when has he been
an expert about wheels?

76
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,734
So what?
What are you telling me to do?

77
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,500
Wow. Here he goes. Very good.

78
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:46,433
Wow.

79
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,767
That´s good.

80
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,967
Yes,
including the final trick, ollie...

81
00:10:57,033 --> 00:11:00,834
Yes, there are many varieties of
skateboard tricks!

82
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Now, as for the person that
does any four of these tricks,

83
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:08,700
we will not ask or hesitate
to give them first place!

84
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,666
- Wow!
- Yeah!

85
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,867
I shouldn´t have come out.

86
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,000
Why are there so many humans?

87
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,700
Fighting! Fighting, fighting!

88
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,300
- Wow, that's so cool!
- Wow!

89
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,966
What´s going on?

90
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,267
What's happening?

91
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,334
Here comes the first contestant.

92
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, this blonde female contestant,
it's great.

93
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:35,167
Oh, that´s a shame!
She´s disqualified.

94
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:39,167
Here comes the second contestant.
Oh, that´s good!

95
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, no!

96
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:45,767
Third contestant, please come out.
I get the feeling he'll be good.

97
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,667
Oh, you're doing good!

98
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:51,267
- Just once. Please? Just once.
- Now, the fourth contestant!

99
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,667
I guess you want to go back to
being a Mandarin fish?

100
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,700
Oh, I think he will be good.

101
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:58,900
We don´t know how long
we'll have to endure this here.

102
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,834
We need money to live here.

103
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,467
Unfortunately,

104
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:07,067
- Lord Ha Baek.
- you're disqualified!

105
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,334
Now the 5th contestant,
please come forward.

106
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,167
Lord Ha Baek!

107
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,767
Do you forfeit?

108
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,933
Ah, to actually do it,
it's a bit scary, right?

109
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:29,834
You said if I do all four,
it is first place?

110
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,933
Go gently. Nicely.

111
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:33,300
(1st: $100 2nd: $50,
3rd: Voucher for KoKo Chicken)

112
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,400
- What do I have do to win it all?
- Excuse me?

113
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,733
You will have to give it all
to me.

114
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,200
You should all know that
this is an honor for you.

115
00:12:53,433 --> 00:13:00,200
Hey! You must be really nervous.
You´re going the wrong way.

116
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:25,200
Lord Ha Baek. Don`t overdo it.

117
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,000
Who is that guy?
Professionals are not allowed!

118
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:42,866
Well.. he's someone who's
never seen a skateboard before.

119
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,566
Something

120
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,033
slowly crept into your heart

121
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,533
and hit you on the head.

122
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,700
That's how it feels, isn't it?

123
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,533
You've come.

124
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,566
It´s really him. It´s him.

125
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:06,300
This is crazy.
Why would I see that person there?

126
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,600
Hey, the servant walking there!
I am here!

127
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:14,167
What the hell? What is this?
Is he following me?

128
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:15,666
Why?

129
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,867
Is she really the descendant?

130
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:21,567
She is. What did I say?
I said that she would be awakened.

131
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:25,367
- Wait. Why am I running away?
- Look here, servant!

132
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:29,767
Ah right! He was a 'natural man'!

133
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,200
Why is she running away then?

134
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,567
She´s not running away.
She is looking for me.

135
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,633
She is running away.

136
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:41,167
Look here, servant! You
dim-witted woman, I'm right here!

137
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,300
This is crazy.

138
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,567
This guy is blocking
the way again.

139
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,533
Move!

140
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,967
That rude.

141
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,733
- Crazy. Why did I even...
- SERVANT!

142
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,633
What did I do wrong that
I have to run away?

143
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:12,767
That damned Yoo Sang-yoo.
Why did he tell me to exercise?

144
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,733
I'm a doctor,
how would I get diabetes?

145
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:31,666
Hey, it fell in!
Find something to collect it with!

146
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,766
Please. Please save me.

147
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,633
Dad. Dad!

148
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,900
I told you humans are
not to be trusted.

149
00:18:55,966 --> 00:19:00,500
Prize? If you're trying to scam
someone, make it believable!

150
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:03,467
Which company is he under?

151
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,667
Why did you do that?

152
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:09,367
I told you go easy.
Like it's your first time.

153
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:13,800
You're really too much.
If I had skills like Lord Ha Baek,

154
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,734
I would have only used them for
Lord Ha Baek.

155
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
It´s the same for me.

156
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:24,934
I wanted to win all three prizes
to make you happy.

157
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,733
Lord Ha Baek.

158
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,134
Lord Ha Baek.

159
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,834
That's not what you were expecting
to hear from me, right?

160
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,600
Right.

161
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:55,700
She's not awakened, right?
I told you to give up.

162
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:58,866
It will be better to appeal to
her sympathy.

163
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:09,267
Total land is 16.3 acres.
The initial survey found 5 owners.

164
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,367
The process of purchasing
12 acres is going smoothly.

165
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:14,634
- Phone numbers of the owners?
- I was able to procure them all.

166
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,600
But...

167
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,134
Please speak.

168
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't think it'll be easy to
purchase the remaining 4 acres.

169
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:32,434
That…
that land belongs to Chairman Sin.

170
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,900
It's impossible to get through
to him.

171
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:37,067
I´ll resolve it.

172
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,166
Yes, I understand.

173
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,134
Of all people,
the land belongs to Chairman Sin.

174
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,700
I am sure the asking price will
jump quite a bit.

175
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,600
Yes Driver Choi. Please speak.

176
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:02,700
Please handle it like that.
No, please prepare a second car.

177
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,000
It'll take some time to purchase
parts for the windshield wiper.

178
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,566
Fine.

179
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:15,134
You're still telling me to wait?
I've been waiting since morning.

180
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm not asking for a new loan, just
an extension. Is it that so hard?

181
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:22,300
Is it just great to
have a big car, huh?

182
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,500
What do I do...

183
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:29,134
The repair cost will be
quite high for them.

184
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,733
Excuse me, but how is it
so expensive for one wiper?

185
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,766
What? R-rain sensor?
I understand.

186
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,800
Hello.

187
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,633
Did you get back safely from
Gangwon Province?

188
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:12,534
About the windshield wiper…
With original parts and labor…

189
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,000
I have a friend who's a mechanic,
if we don't use original parts...

190
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,700
Do you think those people
would agree to that?

191
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,733
I guess I have to move out of
my apartment.

192
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
When they call, say that our
insurance will take care of it.

193
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,566
What?

194
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:34,167
Confidently, and don't cower.
Clearly and simply.

195
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,267
How will you do it?

196
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:40,033
"Ah, yes. Talk to our insurance".

197
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,633
Okay.

198
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:49,067
Ma Bong-yeol is admitting himself.
They need your diagnosis.

199
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:53,733
And Park Sang-cheol called again.
He said he would do it again.

200
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:20,567
How could you sleep for so long?

201
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:25,700
Because I was tired. A god
like you may not feel anything,

202
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:30,100
but a lowly being like me is
no different from a tired human.

203
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,067
I am very hungry, as well.

204
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,034
This is not something I have to
continue to hear, is it?

205
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,666
No.

206
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,967
Let´s go.

207
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,134
Excuse me? Where to?

208
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,500
Our house.

209
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,233
Our house?

210
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:53,233
Where...?

211
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,700
What a coincidence. Not realizing
we had his card all along.

212
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:03,900
We went to the boonies
to go through all that suffering.

213
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:08,234
But I'm a bit smart and remembered
the gas money she gave me.

214
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,667
If not, I would have starved
and walked all day again.

215
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,800
But I wonder if the descendant
will sympathize with us.

216
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,667
- That thing...
- Yes?

217
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:23,000
That thing called driving.
I want to do it.

218
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:25,467
I will do it. Driving.

219
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,167
What is he saying?

220
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,666
Get out! Now!

221
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,733
I'm sorry!

222
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,467
Who came by?

223
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,467
The agent of the person
above landlord.

224
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:43,667
Department Head Bang? Rent is
getting deducted from the deposit.

225
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,600
He gave us kind of an ultimatum.
To increase the deposit $50,000.

226
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,533
What?

227
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,300
Is that him? Yes, it is!

228
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:05,067
Yes. We´re almost there.

229
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,733
All right sir.

230
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,767
He wants to meet you in an hour.

231
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:15,834
Chairman Sin, as expected, doesn't
wish to review the business plan.

232
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,333
Of course he wouldn't.

233
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:36,934
Let me escort you.

234
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,934
No, it´s okay.
I can walk alone. You can go.

235
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,867
Okay.

236
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,100
Is it here?

237
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,734
They said that it was
on the other side, so...

238
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh. We have to cross the road too!

239
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:51,334
There she comes.

240
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,334
What did I say?
I said that she's awakened.

241
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,867
Elder. You can hold onto me.

242
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:59,666
No, it´s fine. You can go.

243
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,533
Oh, isn't that the wiper-doctor?
Her clinic must be around here.

244
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,100
Thank you.

245
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:12,600
She's a psychiatric doctor, so she
must have seen what we couldn't.

246
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,233
- It might be.
- She fits the doctor's gown well.

247
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,600
It seems that way.

248
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:31,933
You startled me!

249
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,900
How did you come here?

250
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:40,000
We came here in something called
a taxi. Bigger than your car.

251
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:44,334
Thanks to you, the 'mooo-ney'
you gave us has decreased by half.

252
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,167
N-nice to see you again.

253
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,467
Why did you just go yesterday
after coming?

254
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,466
- What?
- You should've said goodbye first.

255
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,500
First, teach her about the rites.

256
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,900
Nothing too complicated. We need
a place to stay while we're here.

257
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:03,967
I do not eat, but we need food
to satisfy Nam Soo Ri,

258
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,134
and clothes to change into
every day.

259
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,367
Try to give me a lot of
what you call 'mooo-ney.'

260
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,534
You told me the more you have,
the easier it is to live here.

261
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,833
The other things that I need,
we will slowly figure out.

262
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,800
Also,
there are gods I have to find.

263
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:24,566
I need to have the coronation
ceremony soon, so hurry.

264
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,666
Do you have any questions?

265
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,666
See me for a minute.

266
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:39,667
You can't keep getting dragged
around like this all the time.

267
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,534
He is getting treatment
at some hospital, right?

268
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,467
Sorry?

269
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,433
He isn´t?

270
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,634
Look here. Being mentally ill is
the same as being physically ill.

271
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,334
Don't you go to the hospital
when your body is sick?

272
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,367
If you endure a fever, bleeding,
or a broken bone, does it go away?

273
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:59,467
Nam Soo Ri is very hungry.
And I need water.

274
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,900
Then quickly go home
and resolve it.

275
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:06,067
- Where is the house?
- No, not to my place, but to yours.

276
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:09,967
Excuse me. It´s just that we have
nowhere to go right now.

277
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:10,900
Can´t you help us a bit?

278
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:16,467
Then, you could seek help
at your local district center.

279
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:20,466
I don't know how good our
country's community shelters are,

280
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:25,967
but I think the government needs
to take care of people like you.

281
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,200
Not an individual.

282
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:44,067
That is why we are paying taxes.

283
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't have the leisure
to help other people's situations.

284
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:51,333
So why did you walk with
an old human just now?

285
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,267
When did I?

286
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,867
I saw it all.

287
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,767
I saw everything.

288
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,967
- I was just walking.
- You walked with him.

289
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,766
I was only just walking.

290
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,667
Can you not be honest?

291
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:11,100
This and that are
different problems. I can't…

292
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,967
I do not know what you are saying.

293
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,866
I know.

294
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:22,533
From here on out, if you ever show
up again, I will call the police.

295
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,567
If you go like this,
I will let go of you.

296
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:27,800
That means I will abandon you.

297
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:32,133
That´s something
I'm happy to hear.

298
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:39,500
I told you. She is not awakened.

299
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:47,467
- What?
- Have you met with Mr. Bang yet?

300
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:50,434
No, where's the landlord's office?
I should go and meet him.

301
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,734
It's not far, but you should
come back to the hospital first.

302
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,600
Patient Ma Bong-yeol's guardian
is here.

303
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,900
Since he will admitted, you need
to sign off on his diagnosis.

304
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:58,900
Really? Okay, I´ll be right there.

305
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:01,167
You're in deep trouble now, do
you even know who that person is?

306
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:03,100
- What?
- What?

307
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,067
- What did you just say?
- I didn´t say anything.

308
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,800
It will be so painful,
you'll want to die.

309
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:12,533
Hey, who do you think
you're threatening?

310
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:34,267
It won't be easy to appeal to
her compassion from now on.

311
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,666
Please give me a hint
before you do something.

312
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,767
We have to take care of
urgent matters first.

313
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,800
Even though it's not to my liking.

314
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:45,667
I guess we have to go to
that place in the end.

315
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:46,767
Where?

316
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,933
Where I buried the gold.

317
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,034
Gold?

318
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,367
I buried gold
somewhere 55 years ago.

319
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:57,767
I wasn't preparing for a day like
this, but I guess it's useful now!

320
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,100
If we just find that gold,

321
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,767
I can then take you
to a better place.

322
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:05,234
So you´re saying... this solution
was available the whole time,

323
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,734
and yet I suffered like this
until now?

324
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,834
To be honest, that land is filthy
and I wanted to avoid it.

325
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,334
It's where random gods who ran
away from the other realm gather.

326
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,234
Where is it?

327
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,833
- It's the pear orchard.
- Pear orchard?

328
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:23,466
Pear orchard.

329
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,533
This used to be a pear orchard.

330
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,867
This isn´t it.

331
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:40,166
This was never it, was it?

332
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,134
- Oh my.
- I'm sorry.

333
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
Hold it.

334
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,633
Here. Is this what you wanted?

335
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:56,133
You are a strange man.
You're going to eat all of this?

336
00:32:57,466 --> 00:33:00,734
Wait, wait. You must finish
what you started before you eat.

337
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,933
What? Oh.

338
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:11,167
The blocked road will be cleared
for the length of the road

339
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:14,100
and auspicious energy will
come in from both directions.

340
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:19,767
Like a tiger rules all animals,
you'll be triumphant.

341
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:24,067
On the 11th month of the
lunar calendar, you'll celebrate.

342
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,066
Eat.

343
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,100
How is it to be hungry?

344
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,834
I don´t know how to express it.

345
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
Putting everything else aside,
you could stoop really low.

346
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:38,167
- How pathetic. So meaningless.
- You're right.

347
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:40,434
But I think Lord Ha Baek's words
are right.

348
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,200
You're still a god, even without
your divine powers.

349
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:46,634
Seeing that you're still
not hungry after all this time…

350
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,066
You just realized that now?

351
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,834
Let´s go.

352
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,466
What? I´m still eating...

353
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:58,300
What do we do now?

354
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:02,900
It'd be nice, but we can't find
the governing gods right away.

355
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:06,767
Even if we wait until your power
returns, we can't live like this.

356
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:11,300
I'll continue to be hungry, so we
have to find a way to survive.

357
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:15,467
You're still a god without your
powers, but it is inconvenient.

358
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,467
Why would you lose
your divine power?

359
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,500
We must go back to the descendant
and entrust ourselves to her.

360
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:25,000
It's so annoying that
I can't stand it anymore.

361
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,767
Excuse me?

362
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,900
What did I...?

363
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:31,500
Stop following me and come out.

364
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,667
Who are you and why are you
following us?

365
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:43,067
Aren´t you Lord Ha Baek?

366
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,500
Who are you?

367
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:46,400
It´s me.

368
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:51,167
Ah, he's familiar!

369
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,600
It's me, Joo Geol Ri.

370
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,634
Don´t you recognize me?

371
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,167
I don´t know you.

372
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:59,500
You cannot not know me.

373
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:00,300
Oh!

374
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,934
You cannot not know!

375
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,666
You´re...!

376
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:18,567
What are you doing?!

377
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:21,534
Haha! Y-you have really

378
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,067
lost your divine power!

379
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,567
How could you can't recognize me?

380
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:28,534
Who are you?

381
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I…
I have waited for a day like this.

382
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:36,566
You´re in big trouble now!

383
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,133
What kind of person...

384
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,500
Lord Ha Baek.

385
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:48,733
Are you alright?

386
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,200
What kind of guy is that?

387
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:55,900
He's the god Joo Geol Rin, who ran
away because of you and Moo Ra.

388
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:57,234
Who?

389
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,933
It's the kiss of
a voracious god...

390
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:03,500
You´ll be alright, won´t you?

391
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Yes, Department Head Bang.
I am the tenant of Daebak Building.

392
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,367
Blessed Mental Health Clinic.

393
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,400
Yes, yes. Where are you right now?

394
00:37:17,466 --> 00:37:19,600
I wish to meet you.

395
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,234
Who is this?

396
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,766
It's a stupid rock that rolled in
from somewhere.

397
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,534
Why did you come here?

398
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,700
What did you come to collect
this time?

399
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,000
That stupid rock is treating me
like I am not here.

400
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,734
Did you arrive, Chairman?

401
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,000
I see my nephew is here.

402
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:47,900
Nephew? Who´s your nephew?

403
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:51,234
So if you put anyone in your
family registry, you're related?

404
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,234
What kind of way is that
to speak to a relative?

405
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,400
What relative? That´s crap.

406
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:00,567
Be quiet! Just give me the keys.

407
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,367
Grandpa, Grandpa...

408
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:07,100
You get treated as the Chairman
since you own buildings.

409
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:10,700
Give me
a entertainment building too!

410
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:14,267
I brought your car over there,
so you could ride it!

411
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,634
Towing cost, storage fee,
and fine.

412
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,867
Are you a money-eating hippo,
or what?

413
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,800
That´s why, Grandpa.

414
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:26,467
Why should a celebrity like me
have my car towed?

415
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,834
Just make me a company!

416
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,400
Let´s go up.

417
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:32,200
Come home early.

418
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:37,366
Grandpa, Grandpa. Don´t go.

419
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,033
Representative Cha!

420
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:54,966
Why would you give my road manager
to an unknown musical actor?

421
00:38:56,633 --> 00:39:00,200
Chairman. You're here.

422
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,167
The 5th floor tenant is leaving,
right?

423
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:02,667
Yes.

424
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:05,334
Check everything thoroughly
before you let them leave.

425
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,867
Make sure they don't leave
a single piece of trash!

426
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,266
Don´t worry, Chairman.

427
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:19,666
That rude jerk…
he didn't even say bye.

428
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:27,600
It cost me so much money
to send her to medical school.

429
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,166
If I had another grandchild,
I would've disowned her long ago.

430
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:47,067
I had to pay so much in taxes
this month alone.

431
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,400
They are like a bunch of thugs.

432
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:53,033
What have they done for me
to demand taxes?

433
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:58,900
So, you're building a new resort?

434
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:03,033
It seems you will have to help.

435
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:08,600
How could this old man be of
any help?

436
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:12,000
I heard about it a bit
from Secretary Min.

437
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,834
But it´s complicated
so I don´t really know.

438
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,400
Just tell me this.
How much money can I make?

439
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:22,866
I am planning to purchase it at
5 times the market value.

440
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:31,100
The people living in the there
will come across some money.

441
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:35,700
So, how much will you pay me?

442
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,734
That's against business ethics.

443
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,634
Business ethics, you say?

444
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,034
Coming from someone
who's unable to pay rent...

445
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,334
Doesn't that go against
business ethics even more?

446
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,434
I´m sorry and thankful about that.

447
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,967
So, please put in a good word
about raising the security deposit.

448
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,234
Once we settle down...

449
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,534
So, don't do that.

450
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,900
Why are you trying to settle down
in my building?

451
00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:07,900
This is what
our Chairman will say, I think.

452
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,467
So, you should get
established elsewhere,

453
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:15,767
why are you trying to settle down
in my building?

454
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:20,333
Saying this,
he will scold me greatly.

455
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:24,934
Okay. Then I will ask him myself.

456
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,833
No, that won´t do!

457
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,200
He is not here right now.

458
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,867
I will price your land at 6 times
the market value.

459
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:43,667
You give 5 times the market value
to total strangers,

460
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:47,800
aren't being a bit too stingy
to family? I won't be too greedy.

461
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:50,667
Just give me double
what you're giving them.

462
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:52,633
Let's settle at 7 times.

463
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,900
Since there is your position
to consider, your uncle must help.

464
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:08,300
So, Block World…
Is it like an amusement park?

465
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:11,234
I heard restaurants are
very profitable there.

466
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,100
It'll be a public bidding. If
you're interested, submit a bid.

467
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,500
Why are you making it
so complicated?

468
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:20,900
You just need to add a line
when we sign the contract.

469
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:25,500
I am giving up my precious land,
just write that down please.

470
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,133
That's going to be difficult,
Chairman.

471
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,500
Who is it?

472
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,200
What is it?

473
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,800
I am the 3rd floor...

474
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:44,734
What?

475
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,200
I am the 3rd floor tenant
at Daebak Building.

476
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,034
Oh, oh right. The insane asylum.

477
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,900
No, it's not an insane asylum.

478
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:55,334
You've suddenly doubled
the security deposit, so I'm here..

479
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,900
Right. I meant to go see you.
It's good that you're here.

480
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:01,600
Why aren't you paying the rent?

481
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,567
You have no common sense.

482
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:08,367
You're educated and should know
better than to cause such a loss.

483
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:13,167
I am old man who barely makes
a living from the rent.

484
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:15,700
Are you trying to starve me
to death?

485
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:18,700
Since you have a guest today,
I will come see you next time.

486
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:22,534
No need for next time. Stay if
you can pay, leave if you can't.

487
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,433
Since I haven´t studied anything,
I hate complicated things.

488
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:39,566
Young ones these days only know
how to blame others.

489
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,466
Why did that person have to be
there again?

490
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:51,934
You are now one of
the god´s people.

491
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,234
If you do not accept this,
you will endure many difficulties.

492
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,700
Don´t tell me...

493
00:43:56,766 --> 00:44:01,466
this is the sort of things
I´ll have to endure?

494
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:07,767
What a ridiculous thought.

495
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:11,433
Please give me some water,
I am so thirsty.

496
00:44:16,466 --> 00:44:17,767
Can´t you hear me?

497
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:21,633
Please give me water,
I'm so dehydrated!

498
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,600
Oh my.

499
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:33,567
Why is she blocking my way?
So stupid.

500
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,333
Sorry.

501
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:55,034
It would be easier to make
your case at the bank again.

502
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,767
Why are you getting involved
everytime? You´re quite nosy.

503
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,867
You're quite nosy too.

504
00:45:00,933 --> 00:45:03,167
- What?
- At the crosswalk earlier,

505
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:07,466
some woman put on a very lame act.

506
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,800
- I was just walking.
You were walking together.

507
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:16,367
- I was just walking.
- I see you cannot be honest.

508
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:18,900
These people are really...

509
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,866
- I am not criticizing you.
- I didn't say you were.

510
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:27,866
- About the windshield wiper...
- I'll have insurance handle it.

511
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:33,466
I wanted to tell you it was okay
if you didn´t repay it.

512
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:36,300
Am I being nosy again?

513
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:42,433
Y-yes. You are being nosy.

514
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,066
I see.

515
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,533
Then please repay me.

516
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:05,334
Hello,
guardian of patient Ma Bong-yeol.

517
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600
What? He ran away?

518
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:11,067
- I see you cannot be honest.
- I see you cannot be honest.

519
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:13,866
What does it have to do with
you guys?

520
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:21,100
What is it? What?!

521
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:24,966
He suddenly changed his mind
about being admitted and ran away.

522
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,534
Why did they let him get away?

523
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,066
What? Why should I look for him?

524
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:38,534
I´m not feeling so good.
I keep hearing things.

525
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
I need to get some rest.

526
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,934
It doesn´t have anything
to do with our clinic anymore.

527
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,167
The people there will
take care of it.

528
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:48,134
Just try to contact the police.

529
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,100
Ask them how the investigation
about my stolen ring is going.

530
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,834
Are you staring at what
that kid is eating?

531
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,000
No.

532
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:12,467
Then what are you looking at?

533
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:14,167
I'm not looking at anything.

534
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:15,700
Do you want some?

535
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,500
Get it out of my sight.

536
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:22,534
Tell me if you are dizzy, start
stooping, and have no energy.

537
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,334
That is the feeling of hunger.

538
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,900
If you at least eat this,
it will get better.

539
00:47:28,966 --> 00:47:31,600
I guess that lower god's power
worked on you.

540
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:35,067
Why aren´t we taking a taxi?

541
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:38,866
We have to save money.
Now we have two mouths to feed.

542
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:45,600
I never expected Joo Geol Rin
to be here. So when was it?

543
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:49,300
- He asked you to duel and hurt you.
- He didn't cause the wound.

544
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,300
His knife fell from trembling.
The knife hit a twig and the twig…

545
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:56,400
Anyway.
So Moo Ra threatened to kill him

546
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:59,700
and he ran away. I knew that much.
He was hiding here.

547
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:03,700
I never knew the human world is
a garbage dumping site.

548
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,934
Why did Joo Geol Rin ask for
an impossible duel?

549
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,800
His soul must have been in
an abnormal state.

550
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:15,866
We're in trouble. You even gained
hunger in this state.

551
00:48:16,566 --> 00:48:18,800
Why is nothing working out?

552
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:33,033
Yes, I´m almost there.
I'm getting off now.

553
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:35,866
Moo Ra?

554
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:00,000
Lord Ha Baek.

555
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:03,866
Lord Ha Baek!

556
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,400
- Lord Ha Baek!
- Nam Soo Ri.

557
00:49:08,633 --> 00:49:10,166
Lord Ha Baek!

558
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,466
Oh no! Oh no!

559
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,400
He found an entryway to contact
aliens and uploaded a selfie.

560
00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:53,467
It's against code of ethics to dig
into the patient's personal life.

561
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:57,834
I had to follow him because
he threatened to switch clinics.

562
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,734
I think he's on a subway platform.

563
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,900
It's around Gangseo, judging from
the background of this picture.

564
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:07,267
It's a station ending with "naru".
Says it's towards Seonyudo Park.

565
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,567
Then, is it the Han River?

566
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:10,334
Are you Sherlock Holmes now?

567
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,134
But what it this?
He wrote he finally met a god.

568
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,066
God, god, god everywhere.

569
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,533
I want to meet a god, seriously.

570
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:28,800
Although my mother said
a person lives by the soul of rice,

571
00:50:28,866 --> 00:50:32,800
I have lived on the strength of
chicken and pizza.

572
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:37,033
However, I am saying this after
my mother passed away.

573
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:47,000
Please have some.

574
00:50:47,066 --> 00:50:51,600
Don't hold back. The drumstick
usually goes to the eldest.

575
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:53,934
- Here.
- What are you doing?

576
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,366
I´m s-sorry.

577
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,766
Now they will believe me. Now that
I have a picture to prove it.

578
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:21,400
Ah.

579
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:24,734
Is TF1004 doing well?

580
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,167
I couldn't meet Obama yet.

581
00:51:27,233 --> 00:51:31,467
I've tried my best but
I'm deeply ashamed of myself.

582
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:36,200
Not like I have to save the world.
Just have to get to Obama.

583
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:40,800
But I haven't been able to
do that. When Obama finds out...

584
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:42,967
Who the heck is Obama?

585
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,166
What?

586
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,634
He's not here.

587
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,600
I went to the Station Office,
and no incidents.

588
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:53,034
Satisfied?

589
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,100
Hey, close up early today.
I really need to go home to rest.

590
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:59,634
Oh? Something new came up
on Instagram. Hey!

591
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,567
It looks like Hangang Park.
I'll send you the picture.

592
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:05,200
Hey, don´t send it to me.

593
00:52:06,266 --> 00:52:08,067
That guy really...

594
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,567
Nurse Yoo

595
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:12,767
I told him not to send it!

596
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,800
Hey, Nurse Yoo.
Doctor, do you know that?

597
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:17,900
When Mr. Ma was admitted before,
he tried to kill himself.

598
00:52:17,966 --> 00:52:18,834
What?

599
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,100
Because of that, his family was
hesitant about admitting him.

600
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,900
Why...

601
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:26,134
Why are they telling us that now?

602
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,167
It must have been hard for
the family. What do we do?

603
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:31,167
Call the police and ask them
to find him.

604
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:35,434
He hates the police and firemen.
So, Doctor,

605
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,166
- Nurse Yoo, Nurse Yoo!
- Yes?

606
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:44,833
Contact the police.
We're done! Understand?

607
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:10,466
Why is everybody like this to me?

608
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:14,966
I won´t live like this.

609
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:30,000
(Nurse Yoo)

610
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,366
Patient... where are you?

611
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:46,834
I contacted Park Management to
find out. It's not far from you.

612
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,534
Isn't this guy doing this for fun?

613
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,634
O-Obama?

614
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,200
Yes. Who is "Obama, Obama"
that you say over and over?

615
00:53:57,266 --> 00:54:01,800
Ah... that... Obama is
the 44th President of the USA and

616
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:04,900
he was the Democratic candidate
in the 2008 election.

617
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:07,834
- I do not know what you are saying.
- Huh?

618
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:13,067
Not sure what you're saying,
but Obama cannot save the world.

619
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:14,400
What?

620
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:18,100
Why, of all places, did it have to
be at the Han River again?

621
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:22,066
Why am I...? Seriously.

622
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,300
Why can't he save it?

623
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:32,667
- It really is him.
- Isn´t it obvious?

624
00:54:32,733 --> 00:54:36,734
It´s really that person.
Why is he sitting there?

625
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,400
Then who can save it?

626
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:42,300
How would I know that?

627
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:44,834
Even if I did, I wouldn´t tell you.

628
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,333
Because I have no interest
in humans.

629
00:54:54,566 --> 00:54:56,500
I´m going crazy.

630
00:54:56,566 --> 00:54:58,567
Then, why did TF1004 tell me...

631
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:00,800
That guy is fake.

632
00:55:01,933 --> 00:55:04,334
- Fake?
- The guy who goes by that name...

633
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,067
Doesn't exist in this realm
or the other realm. Nowhere.

634
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:12,800
Pho... ny.

635
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:15,000
You´re lying!

636
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:16,667
He shouldn't agitate him.

637
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:20,700
Why are you lying to me,
you con artist?!

638
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,367
Listen carefully, puny human.

639
00:55:29,433 --> 00:55:34,300
I'm the next emperor of
the Gods' Realm and

640
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:36,567
next king of the Water Kingdom.
The Water God, Ha Baek.

641
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:41,134
If you´re really a god, you'd
know who could save the world.

642
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,600
If it´s not Obama, then who is it?

643
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:47,100
Listen up, you worthless human.

644
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:53,633
Even if one person can destroy
the world, one person can't save it.

645
00:55:54,866 --> 00:55:57,200
That´s why...

646
00:55:57,266 --> 00:56:00,434
this isn´t something that
Obama can do.

647
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,267
- But...
- So...

648
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:07,767
Work hard.
Don´t just go around like this.

649
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,934
That person is really...

650
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,834
How can I work harder?

651
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,300
How am I supposed to do
an even better job?

652
00:56:17,366 --> 00:56:22,434
No matter how good I am,
I can't reach my father. How?

653
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,567
I...

654
00:56:24,633 --> 00:56:28,066
I can't reach him.

655
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:34,266
Mr. Ma Bong-yeol.

656
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,267
Why are you here?

657
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,900
Mr. Ma, talk to me.

658
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:43,500
What do you mean talk? You don't
listen so why should we talk?

659
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:47,667
Let´s talk about that. About what
you really wanted to say.

660
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:52,567
You wanted to show your father
that you could reach him.

661
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:56,234
And that´s why you wanted to
meet Obama. Let´s talk about that.

662
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,200
I already did. I did.

663
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:01,900
And you ignored me.

664
00:57:01,966 --> 00:57:05,200
This is her specialty.

665
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:06,867
Mr. Ma, I...

666
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:09,267
Don´t come close.
I don´t want to talk to you.

667
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:12,000
Mr. Ma...

668
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:15,300
These noisy humans...

669
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:22,000
I have to throw this away. I must.

670
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:25,566
I don't need anything.
I'm really going to meet TF1004.

671
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:31,233
Yes. He's the only one
who understands me.

672
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:37,433
Bong-yeol, stop right there!

673
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:45,333
Dad.

674
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:49,400
Should I hold on to this
and give it to Nam Soo Ri?

675
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,567
Please grab this person, quickly.

676
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:57,300
How dare a servant tell me to
do this or do that. Do it yourself.

677
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:03,067
Bong-yeol, please come here.
I was wrong.

678
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:07,767
You've always treated me this way.
"Yes." "Is that so?" "I see".

679
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:11,267
I understand what you're
thinking, patient. I understand.

680
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,367
What the hell do you understand?

681
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:18,300
Even now, you respond with words
but don't intend to save me.

682
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:20,800
Sitting at that desk of yours!

683
00:58:20,866 --> 00:58:23,567
You did not want to help me
from the very beginning!

684
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,267
That´s not true.

685
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,666
I...

686
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:53,266
I...

687
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:12,033
14 years ago

688
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:19,066
Dad.

689
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:24,133
Please

690
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:32,966
The person you have phoned...

691
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:54,433
I will make you regret it
all your life.

692
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:08,933
(The parent-child relationship)

693
01:00:41,066 --> 01:00:44,366
Please save me.

694
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,800
Please save me.

695
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,934
Please. Please save me.

696
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,266
Dad. Dad!

697
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,534
I regretted it.

698
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:16,266
It was cold, dark, lonely,
and scary. There was no one.

699
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,934
What are you doing?
I'm telling you I´m going to die!

700
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,867
Do I look like I´m lying?

701
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:57,400
Are you mocking me?

702
01:01:57,466 --> 01:02:00,266
You think I can´t do it?

703
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:07,433
Okay. Live and eat well,
this dirty world!

704
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:13,766
No! No! Bong Yeol!

705
01:02:14,566 --> 01:02:16,734
Save me.

706
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,366
Please save me.

707
01:02:20,233 --> 01:02:22,066
No.

708
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:26,433
Please save me.

709
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,134
Bong Yeol...

710
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,434
Doctor! Please save me!

711
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:38,400
Please.
Please, please save me. Dad.

712
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:41,300
No, please!

713
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:47,434
No. No!

714
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,066
Save me!

715
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:55,333
No!

716
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:25,366
This woman doesn't think before
she acts.

717
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:30,400
Hold onto this. You´re so noisy.

718
01:03:30,466 --> 01:03:33,766
I want both of you to
get out of my house quickly.

719
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:37,766
I didn´t want to go in
because it´s dirty.

720
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,400
No!

721
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:46,334
No!

722
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,466
You must come out.

723
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:56,300
Come out, please come out!

724
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,634
I am sorry, I am sorry.

725
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,066
I am sorry about everything.

726
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:15,100
I told you you were too noisy

727
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:33,600
Bong-yeol.

728
01:04:44,633 --> 01:04:48,766
Ma Bong-yeol. Please.

729
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:57,600
Don't do that.

730
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:02,766
My lips are for TF1004.

731
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,366
I'm sorry.

732
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:13,066
Thank you.

733
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:18,934
It´s fine as long as you know.

734
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,700
Take this idiot and go.

735
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,667
Hey!

736
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:49,334
I told you to hold onto it well!

737
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,600
I... I wasn´t going to eat it.

738
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:56,766
My Nam Soo Ri is hungry.

739
01:06:21,033 --> 01:06:23,266
Thank you.

740
01:06:41,366 --> 01:06:45,266
Fate, it's fate.

741
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,567
Are you really a god?

742
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:19,900
I told you Ha Baek came!

743
01:07:19,966 --> 01:07:22,467
- I always thought about you
- Shut up.

744
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:25,000
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

745
01:07:25,066 --> 01:07:26,034
This is crazy.

746
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,200
Who is this? Homeless!

747
01:07:28,266 --> 01:07:31,034
Why are you following my woman
around and bothering her?

748
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,600
Are you pretending to be a prince?

749
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:33,834
We keep running into each other.

750
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,934
Mystery, thriller, should we
make the jump to suspense?

751
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,400
You and I are accomplices
when it comes to divine stones.

752
01:07:40,466 --> 01:07:43,000
Did you toy with me? Stupid human.

753
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:46,900
Don't dare to test me.

754
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,033
- High Priest
- Oh, this punk.

755
01:07:55,566 --> 01:07:56,600
High Priest.

756
01:07:56,666 --> 01:08:00,434
High Priest. What is fate?

757
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,467
-I am not going to tell you.
- High Priest.

758
01:08:03,533 --> 01:08:07,666
High Priest. What is fate?

759
01:08:08,733 --> 01:08:11,300
It's revealing
the secrets of nature.
