00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,666
(2 hours earlier)

8
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,534
Get me one too.

9
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,433
What is he saying?

10
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,400
Come. Come.

11
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,000
Why is he asking me?

12
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:38,166
Why is he taking out his stress
on the wrong person?

13
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:43,734
Goddess this, goddess that.
He should ask her, not me.

14
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,333
I guess servants are easy targets.
That's why they are servants.

15
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,367
Hurry and lead the way.

16
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:09,200
Yes. Yes. I am leading the way.

17
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,467
I knew he'd do that.

18
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,400
He's trying to
make the brakes malfunction.

19
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:54,134
He added water to the brake fluids
so it lowers the tire pressure.

20
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,434
The loosened valve will become
looser, causing brake malfunction.

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,034
Because of the loose lining of
the rear tires, the car will go

22
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,367
sideways and as a consequence,
the car will start speeding up.

23
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:11,366
Hey, woman.
This is the time to make a report.

24
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:43,066
(The Bride of Habaek
Episode 5)

25
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,733
What's wrong?

26
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,500
What? What are you sorry about?

27
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,034
Are you dreaming?

28
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,433
I am thirsty. Give me some water.

29
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,000
So, you're hungry, and thirsty.

30
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:07,766
What else?

31
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:13,034
Are you out of breath from running
and your back and legs hurt?

32
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,467
How did you know?

33
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:18,000
It all started after
I became hungry.

34
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,500
Keep this to yourself.

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
It's not like I could tell this
to anyone.

36
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,834
So refreshing.

37
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,267
It's the taste of
the Water Kingdom.

38
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,700
It's from a tree fruit.

39
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:38,533
I'll tell Moo Ra and
Bi Ryeom to care for these trees.

40
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:45,533
Nam Soo Ri, Nam Soo Ri, let's go!

41
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,166
I heard it clearly.

42
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,200
Am I mistaken? I think I heard it.

43
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,766
Give me your keys.

44
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,200
Why?

45
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,300
What are you doing?
You can't drive.

46
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:14,333
That's the law for humans.
I am a god. Get in.

47
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:18,467
- No...
- Just get in, please.

48
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,500
Gosh.

49
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,534
Reduce your speed.

50
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,767
You don't have a license, but at
least follow the speed limit. 70!

51
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,866
I don't know what you're saying.

52
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:24,300
Oh my! Oh!

53
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,734
If you want to die, just do it
by yourself.

54
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,067
Right. You're a god.

55
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,200
Since gods don't die,
you could live however you'd like.

56
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,167
- I'm glad you can live forever.
- So noisy.

57
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:55,267
Must be nice to do as you wish.
It must be nicer to be a king.

58
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,267
However, I'm human so I can die.

59
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,767
Even if I don't, this is too fast.

60
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,300
I got it. So please be quiet.

61
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,500
I'll be nice and reduce the speed.

62
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,767
Why aren't you slowing down?
Should I go on?

63
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,034
Wait.

64
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,267
- As expected.
- Seriously!

65
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,400
You wouldn't know but accidents
cause trauma for humans.

66
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:22,366
- It doesn't work.
- If so, reduce the speed.

67
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,833
- The brake is not working.
- Pardon?

68
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,566
W-what are you talking about?

69
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,366
Don't joke with me.
This is not funny at all.

70
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:38,533
What's going on?

71
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,366
You weren't joking?

72
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,500
Construction in the tunnel.

73
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,766
Roads are blocked. No road ahead!

74
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:20,167
- Lord Ha Baek.
- I don't want to die like this.

75
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,533
Wait, woman. Do you think
I'd let my servant die so easily?

76
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,300
Stop.

77
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,833
- Lord Ha Baek.
- Stop.

78
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,566
Please save me.
Please do something.

79
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,800
- Stop!
- Please.

80
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:44,833
Stop!

81
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,300
Lord Ha Baek!

82
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,433
Lord Ha Baek!

83
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,100
W-why?

84
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:18,600
Hold the steering wheel tightly.

85
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,800
I will climb up first, follow me.

86
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,900
What are you trying to do?

87
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,200
Lord Ha Baek.

88
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:33,366
Come out, hurry!

89
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:38,333
I can't, I can't, I can't.

90
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,200
Trust me.

91
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,866
What are you planning to do?

92
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,300
We are going to jump off.

93
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:20,266
Nam Soo Ri, you come out too.

94
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,866
No, no!

95
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,700
Don't be scared.
You're a god's person.

96
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,833
Are you okay?

97
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,033
What's going on?

98
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,700
It's okay. It's okay.

99
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,400
Lord Ha Baek. Lord Ha Baek.

100
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,467
Your divine powers...
Your divine powers have returned.

101
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:27,600
Finally,
your divine powers have returned.

102
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
Don't tell me your divine powers
will disappear again.

103
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:42,800
Hurry and give it a try.

104
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,133
No need.
They have disappeared again.

105
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,300
Now I know even without trying.

106
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,166
Really?

107
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,766
What is the reason?

108
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,566
Why?

109
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,234
My divine powers will definitely
return. I have a feeling.

110
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,800
You don't have to worry about it.
Now, let's go report the incident.

111
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:16,600
R-report? What do you mean?

112
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,200
Someone intentionally manipulated
your brakes, like in the movies.

113
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:28,134
- Look here.
- You said there are CCTVs all over.

114
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,100
You said they can see better
than a god's eyes.

115
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,300
How did this person...

116
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:41,134
I was going to ask for directions
and you treat me like a criminal.

117
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,967
He confessed to
manipulating your brakes.

118
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:49,134
Thankfully, the CCTV had a clear
view of the car and caught it.

119
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,534
Do you know him?

120
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,266
Yes.

121
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,667
No. A few days ago, for a moment...

122
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,066
You were involved in a rear-end
collision three months ago, right?

123
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,534
That's him, right?
Park Sang-cheol.

124
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,433
What?

125
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,600
Gosh!

126
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,833
This guy, really...

127
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,833
Excuse me.

128
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,600
This man, really...

129
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,200
Excuse me.

130
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:43,367
He is the man from the accident?

131
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:48,100
Yes. Was there any trouble in
handling the accident?

132
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,367
No. It was handled by the
insurance company with no issues.

133
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,334
I haven't see him since
the day of the accident.

134
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,800
The person from the accident,
Park Sang-cheol. He called again.

135
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:02,267
Park Sang-cheol called again.
Said he'll call back.

136
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,200
Park Sang-cheol called and hung up
saying it's really the last time.

137
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,366
(Nurse Yoo)

138
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:06,400
He sounded desperate.

139
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,866
He's a really crazy guy.

140
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,134
He said the accident is a blemish
in his life he can't get rid of.

141
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,767
What?

142
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,334
Until now, he prided himself
in having lived the perfect life.

143
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,300
Because of the accident,
he had to pay a fine, got points

144
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,400
on his driving record,
and his efforts became futile.

145
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:40,367
He said it's so unfair. He blames
Miss Yoon for everything.

146
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:44,300
What? It's not a criminal record.
Just points on his driving record.

147
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,800
He's going to hold a grudge
like that? Does that make sense?

148
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,767
- He caused the accident.
- He's a crazy punk.

149
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,300
He said a few days ago, he pushed
Miss Yoon from a tall building

150
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:55,766
but she's still alive. So he's
insisting that she's not human.

151
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,767
Since she's not human, he can't be
held for attempted murder.

152
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,900
He says he was doing an exorcism.
It's not only that.

153
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,566
He also said he's also not human.

154
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,166
You are a human, right?

155
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,633
The culprit's been caught and we
found the reason. It's over now.

156
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,966
You can just focus on
serving me from now.

157
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,600
I saved your life twice but
you haven't done much to repay me.

158
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,366
What?

159
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,134
It'll be fine if I make
a partition.

160
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,500
Master Ha Baek really likes to
take baths.

161
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,500
He used to stay in the water for
a whole day and do nothing else.

162
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,333
He used to have
a priviledged life.

163
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:06,233
A man cannot lower his standards
like that!

164
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,134
To celebrate learning the human
alphabet, I looked up some things.

165
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,733
There is this thing called
a foam bath.

166
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,234
What?

167
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,633
Rose scent please.
I want a new cell phone too.

168
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:20,767
I smashed mine saving your life.
I want some new clothes too.

169
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:25,666
Bring out some food worth eating.
I think 12 side dishes will do.

170
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,100
I can't even afford to eat meat.

171
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:46,666
Still, he saved my life.

172
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,133
This.

173
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,600
(Expiring soon. Price Reduced.)

174
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,433
I was really scared that
we would be caught.

175
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:09,533
When Lord Ha Baek mentioned it,
I couldn't believe it.

176
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,800
Someone manipulated the brakes?
Why?

177
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:15,700
He must be the person
who wanted to kill her before.

178
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,467
Then we must do something.
Descendant!

179
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:25,100
You can't. I think my divine
return when she begs to be saved.

180
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,200
This is a really good opportunity.

181
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,566
So what if they return?
They will go away again.

182
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,200
What would you have done if
your powers hadn't returned?

183
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:38,166
If something went wrong, she would
have turned into a vengeful ghost.

184
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:44,034
- I saved her.
- Still. How could you do that?

185
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,333
The result is what's important.

186
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,766
I said sorry and apologized
beforehand too.

187
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:49,866
Apologized?

188
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:56,533
Mix soaked potato noodles with
the vegetables.

189
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,366
I better fry it once
it cools down a bit.

190
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,666
Pancakes.

191
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,333
I think it's turning out okay.

192
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,766
It looks tasty and crispy.

193
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,900
The smell of freshly cooked rice.
It looks good.

194
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,733
I think I can cook quite well.
Wonderful.

195
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,600
Oh, squid!

196
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,566
There are things people can
and can't do.

197
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,600
A meal with 12 side dishes is
something humans can't do.

198
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,333
- It's fine for me.
- Not for me.

199
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:12,600
Excuse me. Natural man. I will
show you what real male gods make.

200
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:17,766
These days, in the human world,
men who can cook are appreciated.

201
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,600
This man is the most popular.

202
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,200
He can capture women's hearts with
the way he sprinkles salt.

203
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,433
Look at his forearms!

204
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:33,034
How long are you going to act
this stupid? It doesn't suit you.

205
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,933
What?

206
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,366
Chef Chan Ho said earlier
that this is beautiful

207
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,033
It's no use.

208
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,566
It doesn't have to be perfect.

209
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,233
Should I have had him watch
a different show instead?

210
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:07,300
I should have showed him
a nature show instead.

211
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:08,933
Thank you for the food.

212
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:11,900
Oh. You're quite skilled.

213
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:16,034
Don't define my superiority with
such a lowly term as "skill."

214
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,167
I was a science major so I lack in
literary expressions.

215
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,967
When I used to eat boogers,
I used to write many poems.

216
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,966
Why do you think I became
a doctor?

217
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:41,333
What are you doing?

218
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,600
You don't have to go this far.

219
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:57,900
Take it as my apology.

220
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:06,966
Have you done anything wrong
towards me?

221
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,600
Why did you eat your boogers?

222
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:36,167
Why is that so funny? I'm laughing
for the first time in forever.

223
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,466
It's that you probably wanted to
laugh but someone slapped you.

224
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:54,333
But this meat, it expires today.

225
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, it's alright. I've even eaten
meat 10 days past expiration.

226
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
Did the boogers taste good?

227
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,434
- I don't know.
- This meat is good quality.

228
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,333
At times like this, I don't want
to return to the gods' realm.

(Ha Baek
Yoon So-ah)

230
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,133
He probably has severe OCD.
A compulsion for utter perfection.

231
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:32,833
Delusional.

232
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Park Sang-cheol kept
wanting to meet me.

233
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:44,766
That was his last cry for help.

234
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,300
Mr. Ma Bong-yeol and this.

235
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:56,534
Could it be that these things
happened because as a doctor,

236
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,934
I missed the things I should have
seen and listened to?

237
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,133
How should I know that?

238
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,700
I don't want to think like that.

239
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:18,600
I don't want to feel responsible
or sorry for things like that.

240
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,200
I don't want to live like that.

241
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
I just want to live thinking
about myself.

242
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,466
- I...
- I don't know what you're saying.

243
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,033
- That's a relief.
- But I know one thing for sure.

244
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
You won't be able to live the way
you want.

245
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:52,233
- Why?
- That's not how it's meant to be.

246
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,266
I was interested in wheels,
so I looked into them.

247
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,700
Bicycles are like that.

248
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,533
You have to steer in the direction
you're leaning to not fall.

249
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,133
The direction your heart is
leaning towards,

250
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,333
maybe you're the only one
who doesn't know about it?

251
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,933
If you force it the opposite
way, you'll fall and get hurt.

252
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,366
Thank you.

253
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,400
What for?

254
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,500
For saving my life again.

255
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
And again for...

256
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:10,833
For keeping me

257
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,500
busy the whole day.

If only I master the world of
comedy, it would be perfect.

263
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't think we're close enough
to tell jokes and laugh about it.

264
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,866
I thought humor would get through
to her.

265
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,034
- Yes.
- Are you still there studying comedy?

266
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,267
I think I have to give up
on comedy.

CEO Jo asked to push lunch back

- Just do that.
- Also, the handkerchief issue.

I will contact miss Shin Ja-ya
tomorrow and handle it.

When will you return
the handkerchief?

288
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,500
What handkerchief?

289
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,766
Wipe it and get off. You're a star.

Wow, so stingy.

buy one. Why is he whining?

the handkerchief that time.

Ask Sin Hoo-ye why he gave me
someone else's handkerchief. Why!

Oh, he doesn't want my tears on
his own handkerchief?

298
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:58,767
I'm tired of wasting emotions too.
Tell him to buzz off!

Tell him I hope Very One
goes under!

What is this?

301

Why is there no response?
Don't tell me he left the chat?

What's with the crappy manners?

303

Ja-ya isn't like that. Why can't
you say that it's not true?

308

Ja-ya tried to make a move on

ask your fans to console you?

The Director is asking you to
come to the office right away!

314
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,167
- You take care of it!
- What are you talking about?

315
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,467
Say it was a PR move through
a press release,

316
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:10,066
or hold a press conference,
just hurry and take care of it!

317
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,900
What's going on?

318
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,833
It's probably because
she's embarrassed.

319
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,200
What's Ja-ya's relationship to CEO
Sin? "Tired of wasting emotions"

320
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:33,667
Assistant Min: Online chatter
dies down quickly.

321
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:34,800
Don't worry.

322
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,434
What is he saying?

323
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,166
Assistant Min: ...says the CEO.

324
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,166
This guy!

325
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,200
(Jang Manager)

326
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,633
- What?
- Are you related to that CEO?

327
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,434
Why didn't you say so?
Don't fight with your relative.

328
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Who are you calling my relative?

329
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:21,900
That girl!

330
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:24,600
I asked you not to come.
You really don't listen.

331
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,634
I haven't seen you for many years.
You're acting so friendly.

332
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,967
Hey! Don't get undressed.

333
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,466
Please respect my eyes,
to celebrate our little reunion.

334
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,933
Our goddess hasn't changed at all.

335
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:42,534
Guess you have to meet that punk
in the gods' realm to be obedient.

336
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,967
That punk?
Who are you talking about?

337
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:48,900
You know him. That punk your
high priest told us about before.

338
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,600
That punk who will kill everyone.

339
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:54,934
It's that again? That's why you're
more immature than Ha Baek.

340
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,366
Aren't you too old to believe stuff
like that?

341
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,166
You still believe a bear turned
into a woman after eating garlic?

342
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,933
Isn't the story of a man
coming out of an egg more fun?

343
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,466
What will you do now?
Are you here with a solution?

344
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,334
If he asks, say you'll give it to
him if he gets it from me first.

345
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,767
- I'll tell him the opposite.
- Is that your strategy?

346
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,000
To stall for time.

347
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:30,367
So where's the self-proclaimed
best god of the Water Kingdom?

348
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:35,466
The moron is using the god's
servant lifeline for the first time.

349
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:37,733
God's servant?

350
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,866
Blessed Mental Health.
What is this?

351
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,400
Yoon So-ah?

352
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:48,300
- A girl?
- Yes, I don't like how she looks.

353
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:52,600
I think she doesn't even know that
Ha Baek is a Water God.

354
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,766
Why?

355
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,566
I'm not going to tell you.

356
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,633
Where is this?

357
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,734
Where did you bring me?
What are you plotting?

358
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,234
You don't remember?

359
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:38,966
Remember what?

360
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,066
Last night, you were in a good mood
and finished my dessert

361
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:48,766
and insisted that you sleep in
Nam Soo Ri's bed,

362
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:52,266
I did?

363
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,034
If you sleep on a cold place,
your mouth will turn.

364
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,133
Saying incomprehensible things
about mouths turning and

365
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:07,833
you limply crawled into my room.

366
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,234
I made a small mistake.

367
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,033
I looked it up online.

368
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,000
Your symptoms were called
"Crappy Drunken Behavior".

369
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,733
It isn't.

370
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,700
Ah yes, Nam Soo Ri, Nam Soo Ri?

371
00:37:56,766 --> 00:38:01,834
Nam Soo Ri, Nam Soo Ri,
Nam Soo Ri.

372
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,300
Why are you coming out from there?

373
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:15,800
- You two?
- It's not what you think. It's not.

374
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,000
Hello?

375
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,234
I hear Ha Baek doesn't
have a cell phone.

376
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,833
Who are you?

377
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,300
Lord Bi Ryeom?

378
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,266
I'm crazy, crazy, crazy.

379
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:39,800
Ouch, aches everywhere.

380
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:49,367
What an unmerciful god.
Not even a blanket. Or a pillow.

381
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:51,300
There's no way for
something like that to exist.

382
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:53,000
Bi Ryeom,
Nam Soo Ri gives his greetings.

383
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:53,566
Where is Ha Baek?

384
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:59,100
He's here.
I'll switch him over. Okay?

385
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:01,633
Yes.

386
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:06,100
- What?
- He said to come. He said he'll

387
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,866
- text the address.
- Moo Ra must have found him.

388
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:11,467
How about going after gaining
your divine powers back somehow?

389
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:14,400
That doesn't mean you could put
the descendant in danger again.

390
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:17,133
I still feel guilty about
deceiving her like that.

391
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:18,733
What are you talking about?

392
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,434
Did you try to kill me on purpose?

393
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,300
No.

394
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,600
Is that why you said
you are sorry?

395
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:39,966
You were apologizing in advance
before killing me.

396
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:42,234
No, it's not.

397
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,133
That's why you cut the meat
for me, gave me an apple,

398
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,400
Then would you try to kill me
again? Is it like the Last Supper?

399
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:55,434
No.

400
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,834
No? You saw everything and
still made me get in that car.

401
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,800
Just to regain your
insignificant divine powers?

402
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
- Insignificant?
- Yes, insignificant.

403
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:07,400
I don't know how amazing those
powers are, but do gods sacrifice

404
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:11,600
others' lives for their own gain?
What kind of a god is that lame?

405
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:23,000
He thought his powers would return
and he could save you like before.

406
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,034
Does that make sense? What if
his powers didn't come back?

407
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,467
No matter what he did,
he would have saved you.

408
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:35,634
Even so, it doesn't change
the fact that he used me.

409
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,834
It also doesn't change the fact
that he saved your life twice.

410
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,800
Nam Soo Ri.

411
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:46,900
Why are you so long-winded?

412
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Let's go.

413
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,233
It's better for you if
we return to the gods' realm soon.

414
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:21,367
Let's go together,
I have something to receive too.

415
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,533
- What are you going to receive?
- The money that you spent.

416
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,834
I have all the receipts, so I need
compensation. They can decide if

417
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,034
they'll return the stones
or take you. Let's have a look.

418
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,567
Should I take off?

419
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:35,300
Yes.

420
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:46,067
So like him. Even in heaven,
he only went to high places.

421
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:53,166
Those who should serve the poor.
One's a star. One in a penthouse.

422
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:59,167
Is it that the world is this way
because of the gods,

423
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:02,833
or the gods gave up
because the world is this way?

424
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,534
You're becoming more arrogant
day by day.

425
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,334
Reminds me of the guy who followed
me around asking me to marry him.

426
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,266
He gave me a big diamond ring and
proposed to me. But I dumped him.

427
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,100
Yeom-mi!

428
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:23,667
Yoon So! I thought you said you
had 3 part-time jobs during break.

429
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:25,467
Why don't I see Ahn Bin
these days?

430
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:29,000
Ahn Bin? Didn't you know
he dropped out to study in Rome?

431
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:33,034
Funny guy. Always at the top of
the class, but he said med school

432
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,000
isn't for him and quit. I guess
he really came to school for fun.

433
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,600
What about him?

434
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,566
I want to return this to him.

435
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:46,833
I should have just married him.
He was a 2nd generation chaebol.

436
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,500
He always boasted about
living here.

437
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:59,100
It has been a while, Bi Ryeom.

438
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,966
It has been a while, Yoon So-ah.

439
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:17,000
Is fainting her hobby?
She faints so easily.

440
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:30,266
Nam Soo Ri, it's been a while.

441
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,833
Lord Bi Ryeom. Have you been well?

442
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,100
My friend Yoon So-ah was
a god's servant...

443
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,600
No wonder I was attracted to her.

444
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,934
Losing your divine powers
doesn't mean the stones disappear.

445
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,066
I've never lost my divine powers
before, so I'm curious.

446
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:15,600
It's been a while, Yoon So-ah.

447
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:27,900
If my divinity is safe,
just give the divine stone to me.

448
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,034
As you expected, you can't take it
from me. You should know why.

449
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,733
But, if you get it from
Moo Ra first, I'll think about it.

450
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,833
Lord Bi Ryeom.

451
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,400
It's been a while, Yoon So-ah.

452
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,667
It's true isn't it, considering
your relationship to Moo Ra.

453
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:06,166
But if she doesn't give you
the stone, isn't there a problem?

454
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,633
That's the reason
we protect the stones.

455
00:45:10,366 --> 00:45:11,467
Lord Bi Ryeom.

456
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:12,500
Ah, right.

457
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:18,333
And you, you get hungry too?

458
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:25,167
Yes, I got to experience
the pain of betrayal and hunger.

459
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:29,800
With each passing day, I feel like
I'm becoming a better king.

460
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:35,966
- Pardon?
- I'm receiving proper training.

461
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:41,666
Let's go, Nam Soo Ri.

462
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:49,900
Leave her here. It's been a while.
We have a lot to catch up on.

463
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:06,366
Moo Ra won't give it to us,
so there's no reason for him to.

464
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,633
This may be a hobby for you, but
it's punishment for the employees.

465
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:31,000
Tell them if it bothers them,
they will be fired.

466
00:46:31,966 --> 00:46:35,200
The new business planning team
asked about Yoon So-ah's contract.

467
00:46:35,266 --> 00:46:39,567
It somehow turned out that you're
personally handling this matter.

468
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,334
She must still be
reviewing the contract.

469
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,934
I thought she would
sign the contract immediately.

470
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,033
She must be hesitant, since it
was passed down for generations.

471
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,134
She puts up a strong front,
but she's actually very careful.

472
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,233
Pardon?

473
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,067
She's a good person
at the core. She doesn't want to

474
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:02,000
get caught or acknowledge it,
so she's acting the opposite way.

475
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:05,633
That's why her plans often
go awry.

476
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:09,267
That's not my question.

477
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:12,333
Isn't it fun to see how bad
she is at pretending to be evil?

478
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:14,867
Have I answered your question?

479
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:15,800
Ah, yes.

480
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,300
Miss Yoon So-ah is the psychiatrist.

481
00:47:19,366 --> 00:47:23,766
Shall I tell you a secret?
I see people's emotions.

482
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,333
That's the secret to
my business success.

483
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,867
I will call Yoon So-ah.

484
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,233
Yes, sir.

485
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,700
Let's go together.

486
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,633
It's been a while, Yoon So-ah.

487
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:23,934
Gosh. What a ridiculous dream.

488
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,534
How can a dream have introduction,
development,

489
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,266
turn and conclusion.And even a twist.

490
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,433
This is ridiculous.

491
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,966
These people, seriously.

492
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:56,300
Where do you think
you're crawling into?

493
00:48:57,433 --> 00:49:01,600
I heard that diamond ring wasn't
given to you as a proposal.

494
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,500
It was a friendship ring.

495
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:09,267
Friendship ring!

496
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:13,867
Did An Bin give it to you?
I thought he gave you a love ring.

497
00:49:13,933 --> 00:49:16,066
At least 20 people got this ring.

498
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,633
Apparently, he gave those out to
more than 20 people.

499
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:22,466
He never chased after you, either.

500
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:27,066
Do you have megalomania?

501
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,966
What? You were going to decide?

502
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,600
You couldn't even say a thing.

503
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,366
Don't faint!

504
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:43,033
You always faint when you're at
a disadvantage.

505
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:50,333
No way, no way. No way!

506
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:55,866
Anyway, be careful of Bi Ryeom.
Not all gods are the same.

507
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:03,900
He came from the back of
the goddess of love. The back!

508
00:50:06,433 --> 00:50:07,800
Back!

509
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:10,934
Not just any back. From
the back of the goddess of love.

510
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,167
He's a guy that enjoys
betrayal and infidelity.

511
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:15,700
So, don't even talk to him.

512
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:18,200
Ahn Bin is a god...

513
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,834
Ahn Bin...

514
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,500
Ahn Bin is a god...

515
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,266
She's totally out of it.

516
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:32,833
What do you think about
going to Moo Ra again?

517
00:50:34,066 --> 00:50:36,133
Where is Joo Dong exactly?

518
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:44,833
Ahn Bin... Ahn Bin... Ahn Bin...

519
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:18,366
What? Why did you ask to meet?

520
00:51:21,866 --> 00:51:24,000
You didn't need to tell Bi Ryeom
about my divine powers.

521
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:25,934
That was because I didn't have
a choice.

522
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,800
He said if Moo Ra gives the divine
stone, he'd think about it too.

523
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:31,833
Give it to me. You trust me.

524
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,667
My divine powers will return
when I go back to the gods' realm.

525
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:38,734
I can't. I said I can't.

526
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,600
Moo Ra.

527
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:42,167
Get it from Bi Ryeom,
then I'll give it to you.

528
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,600
- Moo Ra.
- I can't decide on my own.

529
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:47,133
Moo Ra!

530
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,900
I'm sorry, Ha Baek.
There's nothing else I can do.

531
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:02,033
I'm quite excited.

532
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,634
It's been a while since we planned
something against Ha Baek.

533
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,467
What are you talking about?
What'd I do with you in the past?

534
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:12,000
I proposed to you.
Of course, it's still in effect.

535
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:14,434
Though it didn't provoke Ha Baek's
jealousy like you planned.

536
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,100
You!

537
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:19,866
Let's go. I'm busy. Gotta meet
an old friend and do some work.

538
00:52:26,766 --> 00:52:29,900
It's been a while, Yoon So-ah.
It's been a while, Yoon So-ah.

539
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,000
No way, no way. No way!

540
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,366
The phone has been turned off. You
will be transferred to voicemail.

541
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,366
Yeom-mi.

542
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:56,566
Ahn Bin... Ahn Bin...

543
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,200
When did you come?

544
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,766
Doctor!

545
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,866
CEO Sin called a bunch of times,
saying he couldn't contact you.

546
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:15,500
No time to go over the contract.

547
00:53:16,066 --> 00:53:18,334
What's more important than
selling the land?

548
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,633
That's what I'm saying.

549
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,467
- Hello?
- Hi it's Yoon So-ah.

550
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:33,067
Finally I can reach you.

551
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:34,200
Sorry.

552
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:37,034
I'm calling you because you didn't
contact me about the contract.

553
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,867
Sorry, I haven't looked at
the contract yet.

554
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:42,400
I have a meeting over there
so I'm on my way out.

555
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:46,834
I have some time. If you're ready,
I can meet with you first.

556
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,067
Then, let's meet at a cafe near
my clinic later.

557
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:51,600
Let's review it right away
and proceed.

558
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,834
What exactly are you going to
ask the descendant?

559
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,800
Some things about Moo Ra and
Bi Ryeom I have an inkling about.

560
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:04,800
What? What would the descendant
know about that?

561
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:08,800
After learning the alphabet,
I looked into her profession.

562
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:13,400
I want to confirm some things
about Moo Ra and Bi Ryeom.

563
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:24,800
My goodness, what!

564
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:27,567
Why are you here?

565
00:54:27,633 --> 00:54:30,034
I was sad to see you leave
like that.

566
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,467
I wanted to catch up.

567
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:34,166
You're a god's servant.
I wanted to talk about that too.

568
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:38,234
It'd be nice to talk here,
but I have to work too.

569
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,533
So I'm going to kill two birds
with one stone.

570
00:54:40,766 --> 00:54:42,900
Hey, let go! Hey.

571
00:54:42,966 --> 00:54:45,733
Ah! Hey!

572
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:03,700
Isn't that Lord Bi Ryeom?

573
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,366
Hey, stop it. Stop.

574
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,333
Hey!

575
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:20,500
Bi Ryeom!

576
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:25,534
You know the saying "run like
the wind"?

577
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,300
I'll show it to you.

578
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,700
What?

579
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,766
You!

580
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:13,833
You... I'll seriously report you.

581
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:19,267
Hey!

582
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,400
Don't worry. I will buy you
the newest cell phone.

583
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,933
The phone has been turned off. You
will be transferred to voicemail.

584
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:44,566
(Doctor Yoon So-ah)

585
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:08,566
Wait for a bit.

586
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,300
It's a mutation. It's not time for
the cumulonimbus yet.

587
00:57:23,366 --> 00:57:26,966
A cumulus is just right for now.
This is just a temporary solution.

588
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,834
You... Seriously, you...

589
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,333
Should I tell you a secret?

590
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:37,067
We are not omnipotent.

591
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:39,966
For example, not being able to
save what's dead.

592
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,633
If humans continue to ignore
nature's warning, they'll all die.

593
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,234
But it's strange.

594
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,566
All the people
I gave a ring to lived well.

595
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,400
What's wrong with you?
Did you throw away the ring?

596
00:57:57,466 --> 00:57:58,933
What are you doing?

597
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:03,466
From what I remember, you were
just a poor working student.

598
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:07,700
Because of you, I quit school.
So you can receive a scholarship.

599
00:58:07,766 --> 00:58:08,800
What a load of crap.

600
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,600
Why did you go into Psychiatry?
There are more lucrative options.

601
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:18,000
You opened a business in a hurry
and you have huge debts as always.

602
00:58:18,066 --> 00:58:20,866
I heard you can't even afford to
pay rent these days.

603
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:34,000
It's even bigger than last time,
right?

604
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,834
There's a task for you as a servant.

605
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,467
Feed this to
Ha Baek and the ring's yours.

606
00:58:59,533 --> 00:58:59,867
What?

607
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:02,000
He'll forget that he's looking for
the divine stones for a while.

608
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:04,600
I have to take care of
some things in the meantime.

609
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,934
Of course, you'll be compensated.
The ring is just a bonus.

610
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,200
I can grant you a wish.
Like making you richer than Mansour.

611
00:59:15,266 --> 00:59:17,533
Richer than Mansour?

612
00:59:35,466 --> 00:59:38,233
Handle it with caution.
It's one of a kind.

613
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:52,100
Settle your business among
yourselves.

614
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:55,733
Also, my wish is not to be
richer than Mansour.

615
00:59:56,966 --> 01:00:00,234
First, you're not Ha Baek's
servant but a servant to all gods.

616
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,966
Second, Ha Baek who lost his
powers can do nothing for you.

617
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,533
To put it simply, you should
do well in choosing sides.

618
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:13,634
I'm sorry,
but he has divine powers.

619
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:18,667
It's not stable, but a god
without powers is still a god.

620
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:19,500
What?

621
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:25,466
He'll come if you let him be.
Why do we have to chase him?

622
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:28,267
I can't trust Bi Ryeom in
whatever he does.

623
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,366
You never cared about
what Bi Ryeom does.

624
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:37,166
Could it be that you're doing this
because of that girl?

625
01:00:45,766 --> 01:00:48,634
Are you done? I have an evening
appointment with a patient.

626
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,900
Now I want to ask Ha Baek if
what you're saying is true.

627
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,134
How is that you make trouble
everywhere you go?

628
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,000
We meet again.

629
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,933
Come here.

630
01:01:16,766 --> 01:01:17,566
Hey.

631
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,000
Hey! Hey!

632
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,466
Hey.

633
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:41,367
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

634
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:43,300
I heard that Ha Baek didn't
completely lose his divine powers.

635
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,600
- What?
- If I can confirm that your powers

636
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:50,534
came back, even a little, I'll
think about giving you the stone.

637
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,266
What is he saying right now?

638
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:56,900
Hey! Hey!

639
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:19,066
Hey!

640
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:24,300
Hey, don't you dare, jerk!

641
01:02:24,466 --> 01:02:28,133
Not yet. If you take one step,
I will sink her right away.

642
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:34,333
Hey, what are you doing?!

643
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:42,167
Lord Bi Ryeom!
You can't harm a human.

644
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:46,834
A god's servant's an exception.
Grace, punishment, honor, pain.

645
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,133
- It's up to the god.
- How can that be?

646
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,800
Hey! I also don't like her.
Still, this isn't right.

647
01:02:52,866 --> 01:02:57,133
His powers come back when
she's in danger. Aren't you curious?

648
01:02:58,133 --> 01:02:59,633
Why?

649
01:03:00,466 --> 01:03:01,633
Are you ready?

650
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:03,966
I'll get started then.

651
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,033
What do I do?

652
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:28,000
Bi Ryeom. Please stop. What will
you do if his powers don't return?

653
01:03:28,066 --> 01:03:30,766
Then, this must just be
the end of her fate.

654
01:03:33,366 --> 01:03:37,233
Okay, Ha Baek.
It's really your turn now.

655
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:45,966
Hey!

656
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,133
You guys lost the divine stones,
didn't you?

657
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,633
Hey!

658
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,166
The divine stones...
Why did you lose them?

659
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:38,700
(The Bride of Habaek)

660
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,500
It's like I've been watching
a rom-com all day.

661
01:04:41,566 --> 01:04:45,467
What grave sin did I commit that
you play with my life and fate?

662
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:47,800
Fighting, breaking up,
even the ending was perfect.

663
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:49,900
I don't like you wavering
because of a human girl again.

664
01:04:49,966 --> 01:04:52,434
- If you keep doing this, I ought to...
- He's a bad person then.

665
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,067
He's someone who will be
leaving anyway.

666
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:55,300
He's going to leave but he made
your heart waver.

667
01:04:55,366 --> 01:04:57,600
- Did anything happen?
- I'm paying for dreaming too big.

668
01:04:57,666 --> 01:05:04,867
I don't like you remembering that
agony and despair from before!

669
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,566
Yoon So-ah!
