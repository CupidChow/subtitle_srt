(The Bride of Habaek)

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,000
I heard that if stories fade away
by sunlight, they become history

8
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:41,167
if they are lit by moonlight,
they become legends

9
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:44,000
our story will become a legend.

10
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:51,334
(The Bride of Habaek)

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,766
(Episode 15)

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,634
You know, this is supposed to be
really romantic.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,866
But why do I keep thinking
about that?

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,100
What is?

15
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,300
The clam noodle soup
I told you about earlier.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,466
I keep on remembering that
there were 12 clams in that soup.

17
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:26,100
Even at the noodle restaurant,
my mom and dad kept on fighting.

18
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:30,434
I was counting the clams in the
noodle soup because I was nervous.

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,367
There were 12 of them.
There were many.

20
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,634
Dad, there are 12 clams.

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,934
I need to say this.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,100
But my mom kept on getting mad
at my dad.

23
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:44,700
My mom would ask,
"what's so important?"

24
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,934
My dad wouldn't say a word
and just sat there.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,233
That made mom even angrier so
she would say all kinds of things.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,334
I was counting the clams
over and over again.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,666
No matter how many times
I've counted, there were 12 clams.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What exactly was so important

29
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,233
for my dad?

30
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,734
You said you're a god

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,333
Grant me one wish.

32
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,533
Let me meet my dad.

33
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,733
I want to ask him, why
he left all these burdens to me.

34
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,967
If he's doing just fine.

35
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,000
To ask if he is able to eat.

36
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,600
For him to
take everything away now.

37
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:37,400
He can't save his own daughter
so how can he save the world?

38
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:40,034
If I could ask that one question,
I wouldn't have any other wish.

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,734
You never tried to look for him?

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,333
I didn't.

41
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:47,066
What if I found him but
he was in Korea?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,100
Suppose he was in Korea all along
but he didn't come back to us.

43
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,000
What should I do then?

44
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,266
How about now?

45
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:01,600
Is that your real wish?

46
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,633
To meet your dad and say
whatever is on your mind?

47
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,700
I think so.

48
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:58,666
What is it?

49
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,200
Nothing.

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,000
It's nice. This.

51
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,434
What is?

52
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,334
Do you know why people
get married?

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,133
Because they don't want to part
after spending the day together.

54
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:22,800
However, since we live together,
that we don't have to do that.

55
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,666
It's nice. Living together.

56
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,167
Is there marriage in
the gods' realm too?

57
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,800
You could say there is and
there isn't.

58
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,733
What do you mean?

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,367
You can get married, but it's not
binding or exclusive.

60
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,534
What?

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,034
Then, you could cheat anytime
you want?

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,900
It's very freewheeling.

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,167
That's why
Lady Yoo Hwa's mom is uncertain.

64
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,533
So who exactly is
this Lady Yoo Hwa?

65
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,633
Your daughter.

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
Joo Mong's mom, King Yoo Ri's
maternal grandmother.

67
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,867
As you are King Yoo Ri's maternal
grandfather, she's your wife.

68
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,134
I told you I am single.

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,633
It's pointless pretending to
be single.

70
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,166
It seems like you're sulking.

71
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,400
What?

72
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:24,466
Give me a glass of water please.

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,467
Seriously, why would law
and institutions exist?

74
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,066
Legal authority and binding force,
those are all sources of power.

75
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:38,767
What? Freewheeling? It's not as
if this was the animal kingdom.

76
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,000
Is it because they are
natural men and women?

77
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:42,866
Oh?

78
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:02,700
By chance, is polygamy allowed
in the gods' realm?

79
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,200
How did you know?

80
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,967
There are goddesses who have
many husbands.

81
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,567
Really?

82
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:09,967
Of course. They don't age or die.
How could they devote

83
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:14,666
themselves to one man or one woman
for such a long time?

84
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,434
Why?

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,067
Then you,

86
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,400
how many times were you married?

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,167
I told you
I have never been married.

88
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,600
Then, who is Lady Yoo Hwa?

89
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,067
Woman, get your act together.

90
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,233
Please give me
another glass of water.

91
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:42,933
One more.

92
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:39,800
Look here,

93
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
what are you plotting?

94
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,667
Can't you tell? I am trying to
stay here longer.

95
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,500
What?

96
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:55,000
If you stay, if you don't leave,
what are you planning to do?

97
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:59,267
Nam Soo Ri isn't coming home
tonight because of work.

98
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,500
Coincidentally.

99
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,567
S-so?

100
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,666
So...

101
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,633
you and I...

102
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,900
let's watch TV.

103
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,267
TV?

104
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,166
Sit down.

105
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,466
- Yoon So-ah.
- Yes?

106
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,100
Seriously.

107
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,567
What did you see to act like this?

108
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,800
Something called a diary?

109
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,100
What did you say?

110
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,134
I don't offer my lap for anyone
to lie on.

111
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,700
Why did you read my diary?

112
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:09,467
Did you't write it so I could
read it? 20 years ago at that.

113
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,500
What?

114
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:13,534
Like you said, I found a poem you
wrote when you were just a child.

115
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,967
Title, "Dad's Lap."

116
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:21,600
Dad's lap is mine. Sang-yoo,
get out. Sang-yoo, I curse you."

117
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,466
Do you call that a poem?

118
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,700
You said you were pretty good at
writing poems when you were a kid.

119
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,934
There is a rerun for
"Male Gods' Dinner".

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,266
Oh, you're being too obvious.

121
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,767
If I had such a great talent
like yours,

122
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:49,066
I will be in charge of cooking
until I had to leave.

123
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:00,234
When are you leaving?

124
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,200
The messenger will come.

125
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:05,066
It could be tomorrow for
all we know.

126
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:14,166
I guess we are on a day-to-day
basis. Like a terminal patient.

127
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,666
When I was an intern,

128
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:23,934
whenever I had to meet terminal
patients or their family members,

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,533
I would feel guilty for
some reason.

130
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:31,400
How would I be able to understand
how they really feel?

131
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,700
I would comfort them with
this and that, as I'd been taught,

132
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:41,500
but to be honest, I couldn't even
begin to fathom how they felt.

133
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,667
Crying with them would have been
more valuable than all those words

134
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,900
that would often fall unaccounted.

135
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,833
But I think
I still learned something.

136
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,866
How they prepared to say
their farewell,

137
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,933
the things left behind after
the farewell.

138
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:07,167
For the families left behind or
for me now,

139
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,833
people find a reason to live on
without withering away.

140
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,033
The wandering mind will

141
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,833
find a place to stay.

142
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,400
Can I ask you a question?

143
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,066
How about you?

144
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:41,534
How will you live?

145
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,233
I will only live for 40 to 50 more
years, but there's no end for you.

146
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:57,133
Is it alright for me to
desire you?

147
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,800
As long as it's possible,
for a long long time,

148
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,433
to live without forgetting me.

149
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:24,666
What are you doing?

150
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,100
You're awake? I was up early
and I had nothing to do.

151
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,033
So I watched a rerun of
"Male Gods' Dinner."

152
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:35,400
So?

153
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,233
So?

154
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,300
Wait.

155
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,100
Are you making breakfast for me?
So you're the kind of guy who

156
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,734
makes breakfast, the kind of guy
that I've only heard about.

157
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,500
It's because I am hungry.

158
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,467
Really?

159
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,366
Then, I will go back to sleep.

160
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,066
I usually skip breakfast.

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,200
Sit right there.

162
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:07,566
If I have breakfast,
I don't feel good.

163
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,733
Just sit.

164
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll brush my teeth, wash my face,
and sit down with reverence.

165
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,833
He's cute but I can't tell him.
I think he'll get really angry.

166
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,733
Should I give it a try? What if
I change into a water lily?

167
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,566
This is quite a feast
for breakfast.

168
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,433
Who will eat it all?

169
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:12,034
Do you know how much food waste
pollutes the environment?

170
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,966
If it's to your liking,
just say you like it. Simple.

171
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:19,066
Sit.

172
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,200
Let's eat.

173
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:33,400
I said eat.

174
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,000
This is how it feels

175
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,366
to have a meal prepared for you.

176
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,900
Eat.

177
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,233
Let's eat.

178
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,333
I locked the door, but there was
no potted plant for the keys.

179
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,100
He came here to give me the keys.
Since there was no potted plant.

180
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:30,100
It didn't seem like you'd be going
to the clinic for a while.

181
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,834
Should I send it by messenger,
mail it, or call you over?

182
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,867
Who are you calling over?

183
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:39,167
That's right.
That's why I came myself.

184
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,634
Then at least have a cup of tea...

185
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,934
Who drinks tea first thing
in the morning?

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,934
There's no law saying I can't have
tea first thing in the morning.

187
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,300
In my home, there is such a thing.

188
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,367
You can't drink tea in the morning
in my home.

189
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,534
In my house we have breakfast.

190
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,467
If you haven't eaten,
eat before you go.

191
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,800
CEO Sin is a really busy person so...

192
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:06,734
If it's okay,
I'll have a little bit.

193
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,834
Wow,
So-ah has great cooking skills.

194
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,167
I did it.
This woman didn't lift a finger.

195
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,334
I did it all.

196
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,434
Ah, is that so?

197
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,267
You must not know but this woman
has the worst cooking skills.

198
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,534
She also falls asleep wherever.
Passes out the moment she lies down.

199
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,000
So, I always carry her in my arms

200
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:38,134
and lay her in her bed. I do that.
It's really bothersome.

201
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Is that the only thing?
She doesn't know how to turn on

202
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:43,567
her porch light so
I always turn it on for her.

203
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:48,567
She doesn't clean very often
so I do that for her.

204
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:51,367
I bathe every morning and
strangely she's very embarrassed

205
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:57,934
at the sight of
an undressed male god's body.

206
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,666
Hey.

207
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,600
Am I wrong? You said that
no matter how many times

208
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,000
you see it, you just can't
get used to it, right?

209
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,600
Hey.

210
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,300
Was I wrong?

211
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:13,266
Ah, did you say that
you never get tired of seeing it?

212
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,433
Let's eat.

213
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,800
Since you live together,
you know a lot about her.

214
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:30,367
Ah right, So-ah.
I'm your clinic's new landlord.

215
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:34,100
Oh! Really?

216
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,400
Seriously?

217
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:39,967
Is that why you reduced
my rent and security deposit?

218
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,133
I told you, didn't I?

219
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:47,600
That I'd just buy your building.
That I have lots of money.

220
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,934
Landlord.

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,467
Thank you so much.
I really owe you so much.

222
00:18:54,533 --> 00:19:00,967
No, I did that for all the tenants
in my building.

223
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:05,500
They had been suffering lately
because of Chairman Sin's greed.

224
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:07,400
Thank you so much.

225
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:08,934
I really feel secure now.

226
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
It's nothing.

227
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:15,300
I should become a good landlord.

228
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:17,134
CEO Sin will definitely be
a good landlord...

229
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,433
I am a king!

230
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,533
I'm saying that I'm a king.

231
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,334
The traces of the passage of time
in this house look really nice.

232
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,233
I was born in this house, although
half is now owned by the banks.

233
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,534
It's okay, it's okay,

234
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,366
stay still.

235
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,000
So-ah.
Have we really never met before?

236
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:06,300
No, we haven't,
at least as far as I remember.

237
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,200
Then why do I keep...

238
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:11,100
What nonsense are you spouting?

239
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,034
Why don't you sit?

240
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,666
Drinking tea after a meal is a law
in my house.

241
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,566
Bring us some tea please.

242
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,200
What's with this "head of
the household" nonsense?

243
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,667
That looks so foreign.

244
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:49,166
A god who is the king of the Water
Kingdom and a half-god half-human.

245
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Why did he change his clothes?

246
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,366
Give it to me in my cup.

247
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,134
I have my own personal cup. It's
called Yong Yong. It's an artistic

248
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,067
piece that depicts a relationship
between owner and servant.

249
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:21,534
I bought it for this woman after
I did that "part-time job" thing.

250
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,266
Give it to me in my cup.

251
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:27,633
Why don't you just drink it
in this cup for today?

252
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,033
If you wish, I'll do as you say.

253
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,766
I'm going to go do the dishes.

254
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,266
You look good together.

255
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,567
If you know that,
then why did you come? Keys?

256
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:50,100
Did you think I'd blink an eye
at your childish provocation?

257
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:54,367
Even if I'm no match, I can find
some loop-holes if I keep poking.

258
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:58,000
I already told you that the thing
that I'm best at is waiting.

259
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:03,067
During your life, you'll realize
how seriously futile waiting is.

260
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:06,633
And you'll feel like
this life is a failure.

261
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm envious of your confidence.

262
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,466
I'm a king.

263
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,767
So-ah said not to feel intimidated
by things like birth origin.

264
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:23,067
- She was just saying it.
- Anyhow, time is on my side. And

265
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:27,434
- it seems money is on my side too.
- I am a king.

266
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,600
I own a building.

267
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:33,367
Wanna see if money or being
a king is more powerful here?

268
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:33,933
What?

269
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,133
- So-ah.
- Yes?

270
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:45,066
You forgot you're working on the
farm the day after tomorrow, huh?

271
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,866
I'm sorry.

272
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:54,100
This is tricky. A contract is a
contract, regardless of closeness.

273
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry. You're going in
the afternoon, right? Then I'll…

274
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:01,166
Where are you going?

275
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:05,033
I don't know what you want her to
do but whatever it is, it's a no.

276
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:10,934
She incurred some debt when
she cancelled the land contract.

277
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,100
She needs to earn money and
pay it back to end this contract.

278
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:19,400
I'll see you then.

279
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,766
It's because you didn't let me
sell that land.

280
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:42,634
Give me some money. My servant
owes the halfling money for not

281
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,500
selling the land. Because we're
the reason she has that debt...

282
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,033
What a joke.

283
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,167
You look like you've just
gotten a call from Ha Baek.

284
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,634
CEO Sin is a pretty good player.
He listens very well to his coach.

285
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,634
That's a name I still don't
want to hear. Try not to say it.

286
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,066
No. I'm going to keep saying it
until you get tired of it.

287
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,333
What are play-acting now?

288
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:16,134
I hear women want to be served
breakfast by the man they love.

289
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,634
- Only foolish human women.
- Be a human woman just for a bit.

290
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,367
Don't I need a man that I love
to do that?

291
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:27,233
How many steps do I have left?
50? 100?

292
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Will I be able to even reach you?

293
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:35,300
- Get out. I need to shower.
- Alright.

294
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,000
She's the most difficult woman
in the world.

295
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,366
I know that, I do.

296
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:00,066
What's up?

297
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,366
I can't today,
my schedule is filled to the brim.

298
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll contact you.

299
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:18,733
When I go back, I'll turn one into
a mackerel and the one a sparrow.

300
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,734
Yes, Lord Ha Baek.

301
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,334
Are you earning lots of money?

302
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,967
What? Yes. A lot of customers are
waiting. Lord Joo Dong called me.

303
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,634
What? Where is he?
Why isn't he coming?

304
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,534
He said he's coming soon and not
to go anywhere and wait for him.

305
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,000
But why did he call you
and not me?

306
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:55,567
Moo Ra told him not to call you
because you keep asking for money.

307
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:56,433
How impertinent.

308
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:11,133
That person is apparently
the person who saved me.

309
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:15,466
That person. But...

310
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:21,133
What? What else are you saying?

311
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,934
What is it? It's good up to the
part about the person saving her

312
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,333
but, "but," but... That's the part
that makes me uncomfortable.

313
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:49,567
I'm a bit late. The next shift at
the convenience store was late.

314
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,334
- Nam Soo Ri.
- Yes?

315
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,934
It's always the same dream
but I can't just ignore it.

316
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,400
I can't hear
the most important part.

317
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,433
Is there no fix for this?

318
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:13,766
Theres... there's nothing.

319
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,000
Why?

320
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:29,634
- What is it?
- Is anything going on with you?

321
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,634
What? It sounds like there
should be something going on.

322
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,034
Your dating life has gone badly
and now you're all twisted up.

323
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,034
There's nothing wrong with
my dating life.

324
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,167
Then your dating DNA is off. Does
it make sense to love to break up?

325
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:49,300
I've heard of breaking up because
you're in love, but not this.

326
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:53,266
You left out 'well', to break up well.

327
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,900
I'm hanging up now.

328
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,733
Is the boyfriend that saved you
doing well?

329
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:08,400
Is someone having a
ridiculous relationship like that?

330
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,667
You are trying really hard even
though you know you can't do it.

331
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:35,800
I heard there's a thing called
interest if you borrow money.

332
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
When I go back to the Water
Kingdom, I'll give you a lot.

333
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,934
Why would I need money in
the gods' realm?

334
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm not saying interest will be in
money. Tell me what you need.

335
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:50,200
Would you give me your kingship?

336
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,100
Of course something like that
can't happen.

337
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:59,600
No matter how cold I am to you,
I don't want to see that.

338
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:04,334
- I want to see you for long.
- Can you really not do it?

339
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,167
I could give you money or
a diamond ring, but Moo Ra doesn't

340
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:14,267
want me to. I'm the kind of man
who listens to his woman.

341
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:19,567
I saw this online. They call that
kind of thing "being whipped."

342
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,800
I like "being whipped."

343
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,866
- I'm leaving.
- Wait.

344
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,533
- I have business with you too.
- What?

345
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:39,333
What is it?

346
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:46,400
What kind of woman is Moo Ra?

347
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:50,100
Did you meet with Ha Baek?
Did you attack his weakest link?

348
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,434
It's not like that.

349
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,267
Good. Show him how superior you
are and how lacking he is here.

350
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,200
- Do you mean it?
- Even if he goes, I can't just

351
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:06,600
let him go. I'm going to
have him shrivel up first.

352
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,800
No, actually, I'm going to burn
him to a crisp and then send him.

353
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,666
You gods really don't have
any middle ground.

354
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,900
Moo Ra is the most loyal among us.
You know this too.

355
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,300
But if she turns her back on you,
she's ruthless.

356
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,600
Are you acting like this knowing
that about her?

357
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:30,867
I'm an exception of course.
Moo Ra and I are beyond that.

358
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:35,734
I made a mistake asking you. You
don't know her very well either.

359
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,666
You don't know
Moo Ra's true heart, right?

360
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm really no match for you.

361
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:49,600
You don't know anything but
you know everything.

362
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,967
That's the difference between
you and me.

363
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:58,234
Yes. What you say is correct.
I can't grasp it.

364
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,934
I can't get a feel for how far
I need to go.

365
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,433
If you pay me a consultation fee,
I'll give you advice.

366
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,900
So merciless. Are they really
going to be this way?

367
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:24,000
- Where are you going?
- Oh?

368
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:26,167
I'm going to work to pay back
the cancellation fee.

369
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:27,833
I told you not to go.

370
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:34,966
I'm sorry. He said that
he would follow me here.

371
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,467
He's a great worker. I don't know
much about the gods' realm but

372
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:49,666
the Ha Baek I've heard about would
never do something like that.

373
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,734
There's a reason that
Hye Ra is unhappy with him.

374
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,234
He said he'll take care of
the cancellation fee that way.

375
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,100
I told him I get paid a daily wage
but I can't get through to him.

376
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,100
Is it that he doesn't understand
the concept of a daily wage?

377
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:08,400
If he didn't, I could just
explain, but it turns out he does.

378
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:12,267
He read about "emperor's labor."

379
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:17,167
Even a human CEO makes $500,000,
so my labor would be priceless.

380
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:23,734
However I'll give him the honor of
putting a price on my labor. Go.

381
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,166
So, what is the price he set for
the labor of a king?

382
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,866
- $50 million.
- Oh, $50 million?

383
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:38,666
He said after you deduct the fee,
he'll accept the rest in cash.

384
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,266
$50 million?

385
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,233
You've realized the power of money
though your plan was a bit off.

386
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,200
Do you think if So-ah had money,
there would be no chance for me?

387
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:03,967
Regardless of money, you won't
have a place in her heart.

388
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:06,400
You really don't know her.

389
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,166
Is that so?

390
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:13,133
Then I will tell you one thing
that you are not aware of.

391
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,067
- There's nothing I'm not aware of.
- There is.

392
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,566
Something you will never know
as a god.

393
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,133
Something I am able to know
because I am a human.

394
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:24,433
What?

395
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:27,466
Human beings...

396
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,933
they are lonely from the moment
they are born.

397
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,733
Jin Geon, what is it?

398
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,700
- Someone came looking for you.
- Who?

399
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:01,267
- He left something for you.
- What?

400
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,300
Please give me your hand.

401
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,033
Good, well done.

402
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,300
This won't be planted there.
It was brought there by mistake.

403
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,367
I will hold this.

404
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:11,133
It's okay.

405
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,800
Go.

406
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,800
No, he's not a kid.

407
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,500
If the gods heard that, they'd be
flabbergasted. A kid?

408
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:27,467
I am really curious,

409
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,333
is he someone that great?

410
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,766
I don't know too well.

411
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:37,767
My whole world consisted of the
cave. However, the stories about

412
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:41,900
the gods' realm that Joo Geol Rin
told me, half were about Ha Baek.

413
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:46,400
Inside the cave, Ha Baek seemed
like the god of gods.

414
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:48,300
The god of gods?

415
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:51,500
Not all gods have
equal divine powers.

416
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,866
What's possible for some isn't
possible for others.

417
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,467
However, Ha Baek is a being
in which all powers are present.

418
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,066
Since he was born a king.

419
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:05,833
However, even for Ha Baek,
there are two things he can't do.

420
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,567
He can't revive what's dead.

421
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:13,600
And he doesn't have
the power I have.

422
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,234
Still, Ha Baek is not
intimidated by me in the least.

423
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,900
To be honest, I liked that.

424
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,100
But... are you okay?

425
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:33,466
He might have to leave tomorrow.

426
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,300
He might be gone when you
wake up in the morning.

427
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:43,400
Still, he came back

428
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:46,266
so that I will be able to live on.

429
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:02,066
Are you finished?

430
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,266
Yes.

431
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,233
$50 million, that's cheap for my labor.

432
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:09,800
Give it to me.

433
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:13,667
What are you doing?
It doesn't suit you.

434
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:14,500
Why not?

435
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:21,100
You still don't get it.
How attractive I can be.

436
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:22,033
Should I show you?

437
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:24,466
Don't.

438
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:26,734
Don't do such things.

439
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,134
Before your heart bursts from
pounding so hard, hold on tight.

440
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,300
I said don't.

441
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,566
Seriously.

442
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:51,566
I said don't.

443
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:56,200
How is it? Does your heart pound?

444
00:37:56,266 --> 00:38:00,300
According to the internet,
human females call this sexy.

445
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,700
Please bend down.

446
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,234
What is it all of a sudden?

447
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,200
Your heart is okay?

448
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:22,966
My heart is perfectly fine and
I now have goosebumps.

449
00:38:24,866 --> 00:38:26,466
Come this way. Take a seat.

450
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:41,000
Why do you try to stand out
like this? This isn't like you.

451
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:45,600
Isn't it similar to how you peeked
at me in front of the house?

452
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:46,366
What?

453
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:51,467
You said that you have to live for
40 to 50 more years.

454
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:57,200
Things being like that,

455
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:59,266
you need to have more memories of
me to last you till then.

456
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,966
You're so good at saying
such things in an indifferent way.

457
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,700
I am not saying this because
I am an indifferent person.

458
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:32,733
You know that I am selfish.

459
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:37,800
I am saying this because
I am selfish.

460
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,266
As much as possible,

461
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,166
for a long long time,

462
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,000
don't be lonely.

463
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:01,833
I will

464
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,333
remember you for a long long time.

465
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,066
Are you angry because your
daily wage wasn't $50 million?

466
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:44,467
He said since you're a king, he'll
give you $5,000. So go every day.

467
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:48,234
If you work for 10 days, it'll be
more than enough to pay the debt.

468
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,133
If we both earn money...

469
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:54,166
That's a funny thing to say.
If we both earn money.

470
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:04,867
We will go tomorrow and
the day after...

471
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:06,633
Let's go there together every day.

472
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:11,500
Let's work together.

473
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,966
Let's stay together.

474
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,533
Okay.

475
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,066
Where have you been?

476
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:03,134
Look at you.

477
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,266
What brings you here?

478
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:06,133
Good news.

479
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,666
Congratulations.

480
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:19,467
I had this remade
according to the customs here.

481
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:21,700
Formality is important.
I even dressed accordingly.

482
00:42:21,766 --> 00:42:25,700
To give this kind of news I should
at least put in this much effort.

483
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:31,433
I guess the messenger's busy.
Left without meeting with me.

484
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:43,534
The sixth red water has come.

485
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,133
So please prepare for the return,
Lord Ha Baek.

486
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,467
The time limit is marked inside.

487
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:55,866
I wrote it plain and big, so you
can tell at first glance.

488
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,566
I am leaving.

489
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:10,733
I am saying this just to be
on the safe side,

490
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:19,066
you know what will happen
if you don't return, dont you?

491
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,833
Let's go in.

492
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,733
Let's go. Let's eat. I am hungry.

493
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:45,666
Eat.

494
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:52,166
Standing there like that, you look
good even from the back.

495
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,400
Hurry and come.

496
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:29,200
It's not like you didn't know,
why do you look so crestfallen?

497
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,733
It's not like they are asking you
to return right away tomorrow.

498
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,800
Even if it's just empty words,

499
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:47,400
why aren't you asking me to stay?

500
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,733
Why?

501
00:45:53,866 --> 00:45:55,700
If I ask you to stay,
will you not go?

502
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,300
No, that's not possible.

503
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:07,400
Exactly. Why are you testing me?

504
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:10,233
I'm not the type of woman who gets
in the way of her man's future.

505
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:28,800
I will tell you why
I am clinging on to you.

506
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:30,934
Think about it.

507
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,534
You're great because you're
the king of the gods' realm.

508
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,000
If you're not king and don't have
powers, what will you do here?

509
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:39,034
You are an unemployed person
who just takes baths every day.

510
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,900
You don't like to work. You just
want to drive every day.

511
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,466
I have to feed you.

512
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:53,134
I'll give it all up. I just need
you. Don't watch those movies.

513
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,666
If you come like that,
the girl will give up on you.

514
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:18,833
He's so soft-hearted.
How will he be a king?

515
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,366
Lord Ha Baek.

516
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:23,600
- I am back.
- Why are you here now?

517
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,500
Since I have an ID, there are
so many places I can work.

518
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:31,267
A 24-hour BBQ place asked for me.
And the duck boat place during…

519
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,367
- Wrap it up.
- Pardon?

520
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:34,667
The messenger came.

521
00:49:34,733 --> 00:49:37,400
I see.
So we really are going back now.

522
00:49:37,466 --> 00:49:40,734
So wrap it up in advance
so it's not like last time.

523
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,300
Yes.

524
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,400
Are you that happy?

525
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:18,100
You should've seen his face too.
Looked like the sky fell on him.

526
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:21,400
Our goddess is really unhappy
with Ha Baek.

527
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:27,600
I was tempted to not tell him
so he wouldn't be able to return.

528
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:31,467
That's a bit harsh to say
just because you're angry.

529
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:36,967
If Ha Baek can't become king he'll
die. Will you be okay with that?

530
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:42,466
He knows this so it's not like
he's contemplating his return.

531
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,800
So please give him a break.

532
00:50:45,866 --> 00:50:48,166
So annoying.

533
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,466
Do you like me or Ha Baek more?

534
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:56,733
Huh? Who do you like better?

535
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,600
You, you.

536
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:03,766
What?

537
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,267
You? You like me more,
not Ha Baek?

538
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,266
Yeah you.

539
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:16,266
What are you doing?

540
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,400
Oh, this?

541
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,234
Your fans sent it to you.

542
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,834
I heard you got angry
your fans sent you gifts.

543
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,633
I heard your fans won't send you
gifts because they're scared.

544
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:39,234
But Mr. Kim's having a difficult
time because gifts keep coming.

545
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,666
So I asked for them because I like
anything that has your face on it.

546
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:01,234
Oh and that box of gifts that
you had in your room...

547
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:06,167
Oh yeah that. I ate the cookies
that were in there.

548
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:09,000
Good.

549
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:12,200
But why are you holding onto that?

550
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:13,600
What?

551
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:19,733
I told Manager Kim to throw it
away and he put it here again.

552
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:22,834
Would Manager Kim know anything?

553
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,434
You're a real goddess; why would
you need the love of humans?

554
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,267
This mere sock is ridiculous
to you.

555
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:33,234
You even turn up your nose
at my diamonds, right?

556
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,800
Yeah.

557
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,200
Only lowly human beings cling onto
these things, I'll take care of them.

558
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:46,633
I like them because they have
your face on.

559
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,433
What are you doing?

560
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,666
Where are you going?

561
00:53:35,366 --> 00:53:37,400
Would you like to come with me?

562
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:48,166
It's here.

563
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:52,266
This is the place where I made
that foolish decision.

564
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:57,434
December 21, 2004, at 11:35 pm.

565
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,533
I even remember
the time accurately.

566
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:09,400
After my dad left, I tried to
become happy by studying hard.

567
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:16,734
Like you said, I believed
the truth I wanted to believe.

568
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,067
As you said, it's because
that was a much easier path.

569
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:21,767
You father abandoned us.
Just think of it that way.

570
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:24,567
If I hadn't, I would 've had to
spend my youth

571
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:30,334
trying to
understand my father.

572
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:37,366
But, my mother who did that was
also crumbling behind my back.

573
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:41,200
I really hated my mother.

574
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,067
After my mother died,
I was really holding on well.

575
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:48,200
On that day too,

576
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:55,467
I was fine at school,
but all of a sudden I was hit

577
00:54:55,533 --> 00:55:02,034
by a certain feeling. It suddenly
took hold of me and grew

578
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:09,800
enormously out of my control
and pushed me to this place.

579
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Why did God,

580
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:23,300
among all the many people
in the world, neglect my life?

581
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:28,334
Why was only I left out?

582
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:35,366
Why did he only hate me?

583
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,400
If my father answered my call,
it meant that God loved me.

584
00:55:46,466 --> 00:55:52,134
If he didn't answer,
it meant that God really hated me.

585
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,734
I made my decision that way.

586
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,733
Please.

587
00:56:02,766 --> 00:56:05,600
The customer is not available to
answer the phone at this moment...

588
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:11,633
My dad's phone, which was turned
off, wasn't turned on to the end.

589
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,533
I decided to take the most
terrible revenge in the world.

590
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,500
I'm going to make him regret it
his whole life.

591
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:35,733
It now remains in my memory as
my most embarrassing moment.

592
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:48,433
I am once again standing
in front of a huge goodbye.

593
00:56:50,466 --> 00:56:53,600
How my heart really is...

594
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:01,166
Is it as still the way it was
when I threw myself in

595
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:07,733
or has it matured?

596
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,400
I was curious about it.

597
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:22,433
Thank you for giving me love.

598
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,533
Let's go home and eat now.

599
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,200
Hey! I've been going over it in my head

600
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:09,234
what the heck are you plotting?

601
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,900
Why are you in that state?

602
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:12,234
I need to become a human?

603
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,367
I'm a complete human being with 22 pairs of autosomes

604
00:58:14,433 --> 00:58:17,967
and 1 pair of sex chromosomes,

605
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:19,367
but because you told me to become a human,

606
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:23,167
I wondered if you meant something else and studied up on it.

607
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,900
I even went so far as getting my DNA sequenced.

608
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:36,100
Steam came out of my head and I took so many headache pills.

609
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,934
I did that!
I had forgotten it all because it's been so long since I graduated!

610
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,800
Why did you have to make me study again?

611
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,667
Ja-ya, why are you being like this?

612
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,734
This guy is looking down on me!

613
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,000
If you are a church oppa be a church oppa.

614
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:54,867
Why are you making me study?

615
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:57,767
My grandfather put you up to it, didn't he?

616
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:58,966
How much did you get?

617
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,500
You did, didn't you? Tell me!

618
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:07,966
How much did you get? Was it a lot?

619
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,066
Let go.

620
00:59:12,266 --> 00:59:12,933
Are you stupid?

621
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,100
What's the relationship between chasing Yoon So-ah
out of her hospital space

622
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,100
and getting a DNA sequencing test?

623
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:19,400
That's what I'm asking you.

624
00:59:19,466 --> 00:59:21,000
Do you really like Yoon So-ah?

625
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,866
Shin Ja-ya, stop doing that job.

626
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:31,233
You might need brain for your job
but don't you need a heart as well?

627
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:33,233
What are you saying?

628
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,233
I have no interest in being
a glamour model.

629
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:43,733
Work on your heart a little bit more,
and become a human.

630
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:50,100
What my chest... become a human?

631
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:53,466
Why is my homework increasing?

632
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:00,866
(Goddess Hye Ra)

633
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,466
Oh.

634
01:00:06,533 --> 01:00:09,300
What is it? Is this the first time
you see me shirtless?

635
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:14,000
By any chance is that towel
something from a fan ?

636
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:18,300
Ah, yeah. I really like it,
because it has your name on it.

637
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:41,266
That guy really.

638
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,966
I only have a couple of those.

639
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:03,833
You know how I feel. Be mine.

640
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:06,334
What are you doing?

641
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,633
This is really hydrating.

642
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,700
You...

643
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,866
What?

644
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:21,533
Why are you like that?

645
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,634
- You and that...
- By any chance

646
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,067
is it because I'm using your fan's presents?

647
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:27,734
No. Would I do that?

648
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,567
Didn't you say you hated them?
These mere presents from humans?

649
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:32,633
I hate them. They're grubby.

650
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,534
Tell your fans that it's alright
to send you presents again.

651
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,934
Why are you acting so proud?
It's not healthy.

652
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
What do you know?

653
01:01:53,266 --> 01:01:56,866
I didn't know before but I know now.

654
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,900
This design is not great.

655
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:16,967
Is it 50 steps or 100 steps?

656
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,066
Or have I already gone
through the door?

657
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,800
Why don't I try standing
face-to-face with your truth.

658
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,366
Get lost.

659
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,667
Okay.

660
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:51,566
Diamond rings are not her style.
I need to get a gold ring.

661
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,300
Gold ring...

662
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,100
Why are you here this late at night?

663
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,266
What are you doing?

664
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,734
I finally solved the last piece
of the puzzle.

665
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,467
What?

666
01:03:14,533 --> 01:03:17,267
You might need brains for your job
but don't you need a heart as well?

667
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,734
You're talking about that, again.

668
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,567
If you're here you might as well eat before you go.

669
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,267
Food is not important right now.

670
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:25,400
No, food is important to me.
I wanted to eat just the two of us

671
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:26,734
but since my only friend
in the world has come,

672
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,500
there's nothing I can do about it.

673
01:03:30,566 --> 01:03:32,500
But you're really an inconvenience.

674
01:03:32,566 --> 01:03:33,867
I told you last time, didn't I?

675
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:36,234
At first I wasn't sure about it
butI saw a faint image of someone coming to me,

676
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:41,400
and trying to say something,
I don't know why but I thought of you.

677
01:03:41,466 --> 01:03:42,967
Then, a few days later, you came
in my dream soaked through with rain

678
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:45,134
you were saying something
but I couldn't hear it.

679
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,733
But then a couple days ago
I could hear what you were saying.

680
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:51,634
That person.

681
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,734
That person? What person?

682
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,933
That person.

683
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:06,033
is the person who saved me, they say, that person.

684
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:08,167
But,

685
01:04:08,233 --> 01:04:11,466
So I thought it was obviously your boyfriend.

686
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:12,434
I was really mad at you
for coming into my dreams

687
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,834
to brag about your boyfriend.
Just ask, Nam Soo Ri.

688
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,200
Friend, can you stop delaying
and get to the point?

689
01:04:18,266 --> 01:04:20,034
I have things to take care of.

690
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,666
I said "but"!

691
01:04:22,966 --> 01:04:23,600
But?

692
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:30,166
Yeah! You said "but".
That means that a twist is coming.

693
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,234
That "but" kept bothering me,

694
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,267
but the words that came after
rustratingly never came.

695
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:58,000
Was it something like "The Usual Suspects?"

696
01:04:58,066 --> 01:04:59,166
It's more than that.
But anyway that's how it was.

697
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,534
It was like that
but I heard it just now.

698
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,900
Ok, congratulations.

699
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,166
What did I tell you?

700
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,800
You said something very big.

701
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,667
You said that's the person
who saved me but...

702
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:18,700
That's the person who saved me,
they say,

703
01:05:18,766 --> 01:05:19,734
but...

704
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,900
but the person wh saved you

705
01:05:21,966 --> 01:05:23,266
the person who saved me,

706
01:05:25,766 --> 01:05:28,000
is going to be the one
who brings me death.

707
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:28,567
What?

708
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:32,134
The person who saved you is going to
be the one who brings you death.

709
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,366
You're going to die!

710
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:36,733
What?

711
01:06:16,533 --> 01:06:18,400
(The Bride of Habaek)

712
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,800
Our descendant is going to die?

713
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:21,434
No.

714
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,734
I think today will be the last time.

715
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,834
Why are you doing this to me?

716
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,034
The divine power you need to use on
your return, you will use it on her.

717
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,067
I told you it's the god's duty to protect.

718
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:31,467
If you can't become a king, then.

719
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:32,967
What will happen if I stop existing?

720
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:34,200
Stop saying ridiculous things.

721
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:37,700
If I can't save even her, how can I be called a king?

722
01:06:37,766 --> 01:06:39,400
Whatever it may be, is it more important that your death?

723
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:40,334
You are going to die?

724
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,800
I told you I will protect you.

725
01:06:41,866 --> 01:06:44,800
You will disappear from my memory?

726
01:06:44,866 --> 01:06:46,300
I love you.
