(Water Ghost)

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,267
Hello?

9
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,767
I'm leaving now.

10
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:28,967
I'll see you there.

11
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:30,467
Can you really find it?

12
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,133
I can.

13
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:41,800
That darned Water Ghost.

14
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,267
You seem to be living pretty
comfortably, half-god half-human.

15
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,700
There are trees and flowers
growing in your secret sanctuary.

16
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,000
Raising earthworms, too.

17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,267
You seem to be quite good at
pretending to be a good human.

18
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,500
What do you want from me?

19
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:10,934
What else? Let's introduce ourselves.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,800
And that thing on your body
that doesn't suit you,

21
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,500
we'll talk about it too.

22
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:17,700
Ahjussi.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,334
Your friends came to visit.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,967
I told them that
you're not coming here today.

25
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,200
Okay, Min.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,133
Can you hand the phone back
to him?

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,300
I just came to have a look
and she was playing by herself.

28
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:37,834
This has nothing to do
with the kid!

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,967
Of course it doesn't.

30
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,733
Come quickly.

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm really not feeling this.

32
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,266
Kiddo,
I think it's time to go home.

33
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,300
(The Bride of Habaek)

34
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:21,066
(Episode 9)

35
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:29,067
I sent the kid home.
Let's introduce ourselves.

36
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:32,934
You've met Ha Baek, who came here
and caused a ruckus yesterday.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,766
I'm Bi Ryeom and this is Moo Ra.

38
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,767
Guess you have a conscience,
not pretending to be a god.

39
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,234
You must not be as rude as
the rumors say you are

40
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,800
seeing how nicely you are treating
this unimportant blind girl.

41
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,867
Or do you have no particular
feelings towards humans?

42
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,834
I also have no feelings towards
you people.

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,900
We have feelings towards you

44
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,966
even though our positions are
a little different.

45
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:05,767
Moo Ra used to get worked up,
saying you're a shame to the gods.

46
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,900
She has now become quite composed.

47
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:11,800
I keep giving you leverage.
I guess I've aged.

48
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:16,200
Ha Baek is just as you've seen
him. Meanwhile, I'm very simple.

49
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:20,800
I hate you. I will also continue
hating you a lot in the future.

50
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:25,166
Because I'm different from
you people?

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,333
Let's say that's half the reason.

52
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,333
Just tell us why that symbol is
on your body.

53
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:39,200
(Driver-owned Taxi)

54
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,767
Did you ever meet the owner of
that symbol?

55
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,867
A long time ago, by coincidence.

56
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,434
When? Where?

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,000
- The day I arrived. At the place.
- The land of the gods.

58
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,133
He appeared out of nowhere and
ran towards me.

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,000
A lightning bolt pierced him in
the back and the symbol appeared.

60
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,000
Did you know he was a god?

61
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,867
Because of the symbol.

62
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,733
Did you kill him as well?

63
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:46,534
I heard you can only kill or
destroy. That you hate the gods.

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,100
I heard that you even killed a
couple of gods in the gods' realm.

65
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,534
I've never done anything
like that.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,234
Even though you're only half,
did you want to prove you were

67
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,933
-  a god that badly?
- Bi Ryeom, stop it.

68
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,333
What?

69
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,200
There's nothing there.

70
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,600
Why are the coordinates here?

71
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,866
- Coordinates?
- Why are they stuck on here?

72
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,066
This guy.

73
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:34,033
What are you saying right now?

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Since he wasn't moving,
I just went on my own way.

75
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:45,534
Went your own way? Joo Dong was
struck instead of you!

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,500
He thought you were a human
and he saved you!

77
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,267
And you just pretended like it had
nothing to do with you and left?

78
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:54,333
Did I throw that lightning bolt?

79
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,000
That night,
I wasn't the me I am now.

80
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,667
I was scared.

81
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:07,600
All I could do was to try my best
to run away. I did my best!

82
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,967
My lightning bolt doesn't
injure gods. Joo Dong is the same.

83
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,000
You did something, didn't you?

84
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,100
Yeah.

85
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,733
What?

86
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,067
Does that make any sense?

87
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,800
You mean your coordinates were
hiding behind my map?

88
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,667
Where are these two at that
they are right next to each other?

89
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,434
But why? Why?

90
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,966
Don't try to understand everything
that happens in the world.

91
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,900
It's just so strange.

92
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,633
Then, are you going back now?

93
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,633
I guess you'll be going back.

94
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,800
That's right.

95
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,734
Congratulations.

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,267
It's the end of your suffering and
the beginning of your happiness.

97
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,600
I guess you can't invite me to
your coronation ceremony.

98
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:28,666
I knew it, I gain nothing from
this kind of relationship.

99
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,400
Then the coordinates are not like
a map where you look at it and go?

100
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:45,200
So when you hold it, it's like
you know where to go?

101
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,800
You've already asked me that
forty-six times.

102
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:51,100
It's because I don't see any place
around where people could be.

103
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,300
It's not a person.

104
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,100
Oh, I see.

105
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:59,334
That hotel CEO,
does he do any strange things?

106
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,234
What things?

107
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,934
Don't get too friendly with him.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,534
Nothing good will come out of
being friendly with him.

109
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,234
Why do you keep saying
the same things over again?

110
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,867
Just looking at him, he looks like
he has more to offer than you.

111
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:11,867
Looking good on the outside doesn't
mean they're a good person.

112
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:15,767
Don't worry. I'm a psychiatrist.

113
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,500
Even if I don't know other things,
I know human nature very well.

114
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,200
From my perspective, CEO Shin is
a nearly perfect human being.

115
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,934
A perfect human being?

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,100
You can only see as much as
you know.

117
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,067
It's not right to make assumptions
without knowing someone very well.

118
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:35,867
Then how about you?
How well do you know him?

119
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,700
What?

120
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,033
You look exactly like someone
who can be easily fooled.

121
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,066
Hey.

122
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,366
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,366
Take my hand.

124
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,800
It's ok. I'll walk on my own.

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,833
I've always walked well on my own
wherever I've been.

126
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,800
What are you doing?

127
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,766
What are you doing in a place
like this?

128
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,333
Who are you...

129
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,800
Who are you?

130
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,966
W-what are you saying?

131
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,600
By chance...

132
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Are you someone who knows me?

133
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,667
Why am I so drawn to earth?

134
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,600
I crave it so much.

135
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,933
I must be a mole.

136
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,600
How can a god have amnesia?

137
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:54,000
Hey punk,
did you convert or something?

138
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,700
He lost his divine power

139
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,133
and he lost his memory.

140
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
What a mess of flaws...

141
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:08,000
So you cut off contact because
you lost your memory?

142
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,100
The divine stone. What did you do
with my divine stone?

143
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:16,133
Merciful Buddha, save us.
Guan Yin...

144
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,300
He's going to sleep for a while.
I got him on the head.

145
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:27,000
It will take some time.

146
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,200
How did his memory...

147
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,666
How did his memory...?

148
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
- Why are you still here?
- Pardon?

149
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:39,200
Send her off. No reason for her to
be involved in the gods' affairs.

150
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,934
- We're leaving together anyw…
- Ah, of course.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,233
You're probably not coming home
tonight. I hope things work out.

152
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,400
Shall I give you a ride?

153
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,167
Oh, Miss Hye Ra, let's just say
this guy has always been this way

154
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,867
but can't you stop speaking
disrespectfully to me? I get your

155
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:05,867
situation but you keep throwing me
into cognitive dissonance.

156
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:10,900
What have you been doing till now
that she's still talking that way?

157
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,934
Listen, unworthy human!

158
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,234
I'm the one and only of
all worlds, the supreme goddess...

159
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,766
Yes, yes.

160
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,766
That's mean...

161
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,500
CEO Sin was right. He stupidly
asked him if he killed Joo Dong.

162
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,867
Why do you keep taking his side?

163
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm not taking his side.
I'm saying to pay him no mind.

164
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,434
What did I tell you?

165
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,034
Bi Ryeom, I told you to run
the other direction and

166
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,667
Ha Baek, I told you to
pretend you don't know him.

167
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,066
Why should I,
since I'm not scared of him?

168
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,867
After living as long as you have,
isn't it time you mature a bit?

169
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,200
It's because I'm more mature that
I'm not running away.

170
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:31,000
I can't live because of
you two immature gods.

171
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:34,800
She's right. We've found Joo Dong
so it's okay. Don't provoke him.

172
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:38,700
Hear that? The more attention you
give, the more you validate him.

173
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:46,666
Once you get the stone, go back.
He's enough for me to handle.

174
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,566
I thought you hated heights.

175
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,400
It's amazing, right?
We only have night and day but

176
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:12,333
here they have night and day
and those kinds of things.

177
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,334
How hard it must be to live as
humans do?

178
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,334
Bi Ryeom must enjoy it.
How about you?

179
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,833
Besides the beautiful clothes, I
hate it. I want to return quickly.

180
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:33,033
Why don't you have a happy face
even though we found Joo Dong?

181
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,333
I am happy.

182
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,000
- The last time...
- I remember.

183
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,633
You said Bi Ryeom was wrong.

184
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,133
I want to go back quickly.

185
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,300
That woman, our servant, is...

186
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:58,967
Before I came here, the high
priest told me I should find out

187
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,734
the reason the divine stone was
kept in the human world.

188
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,334
Now that it's almost time to
leave, I'm becoming curious.

189
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,434
Why are you curious about that?

190
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,600
If you get curious, you lose. You
still don't know the high priest?

191
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,100
He's always ambiguous and makes us
think. Do you know why?

192
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:18,000
He doesn't know either, and that
fact could threaten his position.

193
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,333
Is that how it is?

194
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,133
I'll let you know the answer.

195
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:31,867
The divine stones are here so
you can really learn about humans.

196
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:38,066
The reason humans can't enter our
realm and why that should remain.

197
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:45,800
But you already

198
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:48,434
learned that 1200 years ago,

199
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,033
what kind of things humans are.

200
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:58,133
Humans sacrificed a woman so they
could live. We didn't ask for it.

201
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,900
We saved her out of pity, but she
coveted eternal life of the gods.

202
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:08,200
She paid love back with betrayal
and shook the gods' realm.

203
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:11,866
Humans are cruel, greedy,
and foolish.

204
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,266
Do you need to learn anything more
about them?

205
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,166
Go back.

206
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:25,834
Yoon So-ah is not something
you need to attend to as a king.

207
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,300
Even if she is lucky enough to
become a consideration,

208
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,333
her existence is smaller than
that of a grain of sand.

209
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,400
I don't know
what's making you waver,

210
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,366
but I won't just sit on my hands
this time.

211
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,634
I told you that psychiatry doesn't
suit you when you were an intern.

212
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,067
I said you'd have a hard time
because you're too empathetic.

213
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,200
Since you're strong I said you're
a perfect fit for orthopedics.

214
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,834
The only two people I have
around me are such naggers.

215
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,800
Am I that incompetent?

216
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:09,534
It's bad to be too confident, but
also bad to completely lack it.

217
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,567
Jo Yeom-mi!

218
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:13,934
If it were me, I would just think
people worry because they care.

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,100
Do you think Yoo Sang-yoo would
nag me because of that?

220
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,567
Yoo Sang-yoo worries about you
more than you do.

221
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,067
Where could you find someone
like that these days?

222
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,967
Because your father took him in
and fed him, clothed him,

223
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,800
and sent him to school,
now he's taking care of you.

224
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:28,200
Whenever I look at him, I see
a sliver of hope in this world.

225
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:31,034
Then do you understand why I get
so angry when I see him?

226
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,067
The kids my father raised while
neglecting me and my mother...

227
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,567
The beggar children?

228
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:39,166
Right. And most successful case
out of them was Sang-yoo,

229
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,134
seriously? Whenever I see him, I
start feeling like I'm suffocating

230
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,467
and I see what a loser and fool
my father was many times over.

231
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:54,366
Then, would you really like it if
Sang-yoo left you?

232
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,334
Let's go to karaoke. I don't want
to go home to an empty house.

233
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,200
I want to hurry home.

234
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,200
I need to watch "Temple Cooking
Master Mr. Baek" re-runs.

235
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:19,867
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

236
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,733
Happy birthday dear Eun Bi!
Happy birthday to you!

237
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,067
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday!

238
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,800
- Where did you buy it?
- I asked where you bought it!

239
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,266
Hey, where did you get this?

240
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,800
-What is it Doctor?
-Where are you?

241
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:09,900
I'm at the hospital.

242
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:12,600
Why are you still there? Come out
and go sing at karaoke with me.

243
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:17,066
Karaoke... I'm waiting for
Hyung-sik right now.

244
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:36,900
These people are no help.

245
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,066
Jo Yeom-mi just proudly chews on
her ice.

246
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:10,833
I've always been good at
going around on my own.

247
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,266
(Ha Baek
Yoon So-ah)

248
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,900
(Water Ghost)

249
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,833
- Hello?
- Why are you coming home now?

250
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,733
You said you wouldn't be
coming today.

251
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,834
Did his memory come back?

252
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,734
Not yet.
They said it will take a few days.

253
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,066
Then... Why did you come?

254
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,966
To turn on the lights.

255
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,066
Why are you crying?

256
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm laughing.

257
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,266
I'm sorry.

258
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,600
Good night.

259
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:06,866
How do you do that? They said you
can kill with just a single touch.

260
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:55,900
What's this?

261
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:21,866
What was that? What's with him?
What did he do?

262
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,000
I was mistaken, right?

263
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:35,667
For sure, the flower...

264
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,366
The flower...

265
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,833
What's with you so early
in the morning?

266
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,300
- I... I saw everything about you.
- What?

267
00:25:55,366 --> 00:26:01,300
You did a strange thing to
the flower. I almost fainted.

268
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,900
- What are you talking about?
- Oh sure...

269
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:07,833
You keep bluffing.

270
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:14,766
I thought about it for a long
time. Just what could that be?

271
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,600
I just can't understand it using
common sense or science.

272
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:23,166
I know it's hard to believe, but
I went to med school. A scientist.

273
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:29,666
While doing that,
I finally figured it out.

274
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,967
I didn't think much of you, but

275
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:36,734
you're really a creepy bastard,
aren't you?

276
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,000
- You!
- Shin Ja-ya.

277
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:44,200
You also know how to do magic?
When did you learn that?

278
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,600
You're quite talented.

279
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,866
Although I don't understand why
you have to keep that a secret,

280
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:56,233
I'll acknowledge it.

281
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:03,866
You're a total magic god.

282
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,467
If you can help it, don't perform
those kinds of tricks anymore.

283
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:11,100
Why kill such a pretty flower?

284
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,866
Do things where you put life back
into those withered old things.

285
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:20,566
What?

286
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:27,733
What is it?

287
00:27:56,266 --> 00:28:00,300
I'm sorry. Go.

288
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:04,266
Huh? Okay.

289
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,166
Good job.

290
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,900
Are you sick?

291
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,333
Are you still sleepy?

292
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:53,800
I thought it was weird when she
ran away earlier. Seems she saw

293
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:59,100
something she shouldn't have. I
was nervous. Why did you do that?

294
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:05,300
Fine. Let's what we were talking
about. When did you come here?

295
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:06,667
About 10 years ago.

296
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:08,834
Did you escape from that cave?

297
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,100
I was abandoned by that person.

298
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,966
He asked me to take you away from your mother. And he abandoned you?

299
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:20,000
I didn't know you were here.
You didn't come to the cave for

300
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:26,167
a long time, so I thought
you didn't want to come anymore.

301
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,100
I came here more than
500 years ago.

302
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,000
I ran away after getting caught up
in some business of the Water Gods.

303
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:34,834
I knew right away when Ha Baek
brought the blood-stained stone.

304
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,567
I was worried, but it seems you
established yourself well.

305
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,267
That's because I met good humans.

306
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,634
I see. You had great luck.

307
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,267
And I see you have gained control
over your strength. Back then,

308
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:53,234
I said that thorns must be removed
for the leaves and stem to grow.

309
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,267
I was in agony when I thought of
you for saying such useless words.

310
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:04,333
How could those words bring hope
to you, locked up in a cave?

311
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:10,334
I'll get going. I came to see you
and confirm it.

312
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,933
Now there's no reason for me
to see you again.

313
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,366
I have something I want to know.

314
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,867
Ha Baek is with a human girl.

315
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,833
She's also aware of
their identities.

316
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,833
(National Daily Paper)

317
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,133
Do you want to
eat breakfast together?

318
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,300
Goodness.

319
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,200
- Is this edible?
- Yes.

320
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,767
It doesn't look like something
you've been cooking for two hours.

321
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,333
Have some.

322
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:20,834
- Is it good...
- No.

323
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,034
Jeez.

324
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,900
Can't you just say it is?
Think of the person who cooked.

325
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:29,634
- I only speak the truth.
- Only the truth?

326
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,967
Hold on. I'm a psychiatrist.

327
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:38,467
I studied so hard that
I got a "A++" in psychology.

328
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,600
Lies? What lies?

329
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,266
The reason why the gods punished
our family.

330
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:46,300
In truth,
there's a different reason, right?

331
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,200
You're not saying it because you
don't want to face the truth.

332
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:57,167
So you used that irrelevant
Sim girl as a front to avoid it.

333
00:31:57,233 --> 00:32:00,000
You just want to think that
it didn't happen.

334
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:04,167
I guess my ancestor must have been
a feared being in the gods' realm.

335
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:08,133
How scary! Was she like
Voldemort or something?

336
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:14,734
Is it a trauma?
I do treatment for that.

337
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,234
Should we get off work
together today?

338
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,733
It's Saturday, my day off.

339
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,300
Let's do something else.

340
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:22,900
Something else?

341
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:45,166
Ouch! That was hot!

342
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,366
I'm exhausted.

343
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:53,434
- Million year old dirt gone.
- One million?

344
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,100
We used to clean often before.
We had enough people to.

345
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,634
- I never lifted a finger then.
- Why?

346
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,700
I really hated being in this house
back then.

347
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,133
Lie down and stretch your back.

348
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:07,967
I'm okay.

349
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:11,100
If you stretch it like this,
it's really comfortable. Lie down.

350
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,133
I said I'm okay.

351
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:19,367
- Why?
- I'm a man.

352
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,366
So?

353
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,334
Who told you to lie down here?

354
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,133
You told me to lie down.

355
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,966
Didn't you tell me to lie down?

356
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,666
Remember you told me to lie down.

357
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:55,766
That's not it,
what I mean is that...

358
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,767
Who are you trying to seduce?

359
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:04,233
Who is seducing whom?

360
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:10,133
There's something I realized
after reading the paper every day.

361
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:12,766
They're all wolves.

362
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:17,100
- Who?
- Non-female humans.

363
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,267
It's not right to consider
everyone as covert criminals.

364
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,767
I said a wolf not a criminal.

365
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:29,000
So, don't thoughtlessly say things
like 'come lie down here'

366
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:33,634
or suddenly hugging me from behind
and crying. Don't do such things.

367
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,766
It won't do if you are so lacking.

368
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,700
Why are you suddenly acting like
an older brother?

369
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,733
(Public Bathhouse)

370
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:54,966
How was the water?

371
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,700
It was good.

372
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:59,366
- Isn't the smell great too?
- Not really.

373
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,534
The day has gone by, though
we haven't really done that much.

374
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,300
No. We ate, cleaned,
and even bathed.

375
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,700
What did you do on days
you didn't go to work?

376
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,700
I don't have any memory of
what I did.

377
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,900
Is it because
you didn't do anything?

378
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,166
Oh, could that be it?

379
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,334
Oh! That's not how you ride that.
Hold this.

380
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,567
Hey guys!

381
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:50,200
That's not how you ride that.
It's more fun to ride like this.

382
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:51,333
Look how I'm doing it.
Watch carefully, okay?

383
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,100
Were you surprised?
Don't make a fuss and come here.

384
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,000
What's wrong with her?
She's all grown too!

385
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:10,734
Let's go, let's go home.

386
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,200
It's okay. Stay right there.

387
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,900
I'll get up on my own accord.

388
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:20,100
What the heck?

389
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:24,233
I had no idea she could
utterly humiliate me like that.

390
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:31,300
Oh this jerk. Oh hey!

391
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:33,266
Hey there! Let's go together!

392
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,967
Hey, Water Ghost!

393
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:39,167
I saw her. She's probably
the servant of the gods.

394
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:40,234
Servant of the gods.

395
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,400
A servant of the higher gods.
Though they don't really need one.

396
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,500
How in the world did she become
a servant to the gods?

397
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:51,033
Twelve hundred years ago,
when you...

398
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:57,300
I'm not sure. I heard that her
ancestor committed a huge sin.

399
00:37:57,366 --> 00:38:00,234
An ancestral sin? What does that
have to do with that woman?

400
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,500
Actually, the one who really needs
a servant of the gods is you.

401
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:09,700
Wouldn't such a servant understand
and accept you more easily?

402
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:14,867
Then wouldn't it be less lonely
for you who has no one to lean on?

403
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:18,800
Otherwise, that life cycle of
being born, growing up,

404
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:21,766
and dying in repetition,
how can you deal with it alone?

405
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:34,333
Aren't you being too harsh?

406
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:37,300
How can you just leave me there
and leave?

407
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:38,934
Isn't that what you told me to do?

408
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,333
You had already left before
I even told you to.

409
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,200
It is fine as long as it
turned out that way.

410
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,634
How did you come to
that conclusion? Wrong conclusion.

411
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,833
- Are you really hurt?
- Of course I am.

412
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,333
Let me have a look.

413
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,966
- Hey, wait...
- Hold still.

414
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,767
As I expected, they aren't back.

415
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:23,167
This guy really! Is this a joke?

416
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:26,267
Why is this still here?

417
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,500
Just leave it.

418
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:30,267
Why? When you leave
you won't be living here anymore.

419
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,567
Am I leaving right now?

420
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:33,700
You're going to leave anyway.

421
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:35,900
I told you to leave it!

422
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:38,766
You're not supposed to put off
things that you need to do.

423
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:43,867
Oh, look at this person…
I mean not person... I mean god.

424
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:45,700
Look here!

425
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,933
That's not the only one.

426
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,100
Look, there is a chicken.

427
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:02,100
I don't have the water you like.

428
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,834
Yeah? Then I'll just leave.

429
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,467
Oh look here.
The door is over here.

430
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,033
There's a different door that
you go through.

431
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:13,567
It's connected to my room,
isn't it?

432
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:17,033
Your entrance way is over here.

433
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,933
You're heartless.

434
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,500
Who does he think he's trying to
fool by covering it up?

435
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:33,834
But why are his clothes like that
lately? It's unlike him.

436
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,467
Is it's some kind of
gods' realm fashion?

437
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:40,866
If he goes around like that people
will… Should I buy him clothes?

438
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:44,500
I brought a shaved ice truck.
Go eat some and rest up.

439
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:47,200
Yes. Thank you.

440
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,334
Why did you come here? You should
stay and watch over Joo Dong.

441
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,233
Is Joo Dong important right now?
Our goddess is in the enemy camp.

442
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,367
Don't make a fuss and just go.

443
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:03,167
The more you continue to
protect him

444
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:05,700
the more twisted I get.

445
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:10,766
You're a bit weird. You're being
unnecessarily aggressive.

446
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:21,834
Good bye, my love.

447
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,766
In this life

448
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,366
I'll remember only you,
who was my everything.

449
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,800
If you faint again, I'll kill you.

450
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:42,700
-Yes.
- Quickly

451
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,734
Sir!

452
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,900
- Someone help him!
- Sir!

453
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,900
What's going on?!

454
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,800
Hye Ra...

455
00:41:56,866 --> 00:42:00,034
Tell them to choose: either
fire that person or fire me.

456
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,700
No, I'll just quit. Whatever the
penalty is, just give it to them!

457
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:07,366
H-Hye...

458
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,266
You're not going to do it?

459
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,167
Hye-Hye...

460
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,400
Don't worry about it and
just leave. I'll take care of it.

461
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,700
The thing is...

462
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,833
Thank you so much.

463
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:23,233
What are you going to
take care of?

464
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:33,834
The unconquerable goddess Artemis.
Or the goddess of war, Athena.

465
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,834
Aphrodite is very feminine, but
the other two have a ton of fans.

466
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,367
Athena stands for fear, war, fire.
She leads an attack to victory.

467
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:47,967
Athena is more like you
than Artemis.

468
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:51,233
Do you really want me to
shatter your tongue?

469
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:04,834
Thanks to you,
we've found our friend.

470
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,733
How fortunate.

471
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:11,200
But he really is out of it.

472
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:13,900
What did you do to the kid?

473
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:20,500
We're in the process of
fixing him up.

474
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:23,034
You break things,
while we fix them.

475
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,900
That's the fundamental difference
between you and us.

476
00:43:33,966 --> 00:43:35,600
See you.

477
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:02,700
You're being really strange.
You're acting like it's personal.

478
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,100
Why the heck are you being
like this?

479
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,266
Even Ha Baek isn't doing anything.

480
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:11,734
Ha Baek? He's someone who's
used to not doing anything.

481
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,667
While I am someone who usually
creates a mess.

482
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:17,367
Speaking of which,
why are you being this way?

483
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:20,300
I've always acted like that.
Why are you being so sensitive?

484
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:24,567
It's because it makes you look
pathetic. You said it yourself,

485
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:28,500
is it proper for a goddess to be
so pathetic? I agree with you.

486
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,000
Is it proper for a god to look
so pitiful?

487
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:36,833
That kiss scene...

488
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,666
what do you think about
practicing it?

489
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,166
What?

490
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,333
It's the guy whose tongue
you shattered.

491
00:44:49,733 --> 00:44:53,566
Yeah, Jin Geon?
Stop the car for a second.

492
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:01,766
You head back first.
Take good care of Joo Dong.

493
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,900
Where are you going?

494
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:19,167
We're in the process of fixing him
up. You break things, while we

495
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:22,200
fix them. That's the fundamental
difference between you and us.

496
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,233
Yes?

497
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:32,167
The development team has the final
planning meeting in Jeju today.

498
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:34,300
Yoon So-ah's case must be
handled first.

499
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:35,367
I understand.

500
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,133
Yes.

501
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,166
(Block World Construction Project
Agreement Proposal)

502
00:46:01,566 --> 00:46:03,166
Could it be?

503
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:05,700
Is this for real?

504
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,100
What game are you playing?

505
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,300
You're only a half-being and you
dare to try snatching our land?

506
00:47:37,366 --> 00:47:38,867
You knew it from the start, right?

507
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:40,367
You knew it and that's why you
approached Yoon So-ah.

508
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:41,500
No I did not.

509
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:42,334
Lies.

510
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,500
Lies? I don't do
childish things like that.

511
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,034
I only speak the truth.
Listen carefully.

512
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,700
You asked me what game
I'm playing?

513
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,167
That fundamental difference
between us

514
00:47:58,233 --> 00:48:00,800
is that you save and I break.

515
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:03,500
I might try my hand at that

516
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:05,933
on this very amazing land.

517
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,500
How I will proceed to do that,

518
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:10,900
I'll leave it to
your lofty imaginations.

519
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:20,500
Also,

520
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:28,100
since I'm telling you this, I
might as well say one more thing.

521
00:48:29,466 --> 00:48:33,800
You said your friend was broken?
You were right.

522
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:35,600
I did that to him.

523
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:41,900
However, if I confess

524
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:44,100
what does it change?

525
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:47,166
You self-professed
life-giving gods!

526
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:51,967
What can you do to me?
Are you going to try and kill me?

527
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,866
That...

528
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,066
can you do it as well as I can?

529
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,900
She sold the land to him?

530
00:49:13,966 --> 00:49:16,166
You didn't know at all?

531
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:20,267
Are you selling the land
because of that 'mo-ney' thing?

532
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,834
Since you don't have it?

533
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,800
Yes. I wouldn't sell it
unless it was necessary.

534
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:25,666
Then do as you deem fit.

535
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,400
You said you will become happy
if you had a lot of 'mo-ney'.

536
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,434
- I told her to sell it.
- What?

537
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,800
It doesn't matter to us.

538
00:49:38,866 --> 00:49:41,000
No matter who has the land,
the gods' gate will not disappear.

539
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:42,300
The gate won't disappear?

540
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,467
Can you guarantee that that jerk
won't do anything to that land?

541
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:50,034
He can fill that land with
people all day long.

542
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,767
When there are lights on day and
night and is crowded with humans,

543
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,967
the gods' realm will have to
abandon that gate.

544
00:49:56,033 --> 00:49:59,133
If we stop coming here, the human
world will eventually die.

545
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,833
Even when I heard that
you'd lost your powers,

546
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:09,867
I never thought you were pathetic.

547
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:13,100
I might be more selfish and foolish
than you

548
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:17,900
but I won't forget who I am
because I fell for a human woman.

549
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:19,866
Of course this isn't
the first time for you, is it?

550
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:23,434
Do you know what makes you
so exasperating?

551
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,600
The fact that you play victim
and disengage yourself,

552
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,533
then cause others to
covertly feel guilty.

553
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,634
Just as I feel about you becoming
King without lifting a finger.

554
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,966
This leaves a bad taste
in my mouth.

555
00:50:44,866 --> 00:50:46,633
I understand.

556
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:52,100
Go see what your servant...

557
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:56,866
I mean... what your woman is
doing right now.

558
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,633
Hello.

559
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:16,833
Please sit down.

560
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,000
I feel like I need to know
the real reason to accept it

561
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:31,000
and convince my employees.

562
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,067
The other day, I asked you if
there was someone opposing

563
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:39,600
the sale of the land. By chance,
is it because of that person?

564
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:48,167
That's how it is. However, rather
than it being that person's will,

565
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:50,667
I felt as if I needed to do it for
my own peace of mind.

566
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:55,167
It's just not common to see
a person refuse 100,000 dollars.

567
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:59,767
That a person who has more
should help a person who has less

568
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,333
is what I learned as
the simple logic of this world

569
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,567
from my father.

570
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:11,000
That person who has less,

571
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:15,466
is he that person I saw
the other day at my hotel?

572
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,800
He didn't look like someone
who has less than you.

573
00:52:20,866 --> 00:52:23,334
That a stronger person

574
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,234
should protect a weaker person

575
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,834
is another simple logic of
our world, and

576
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,134
just because you have more doesn't
mean that you are stronger.

577
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,234
So, you're saying that you are
stronger than that person?

578
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,234
The loss that I experience from
giving up the 100,000 dollars

579
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,666
is less than
his loss of that land.

580
00:52:44,466 --> 00:52:46,567
My loss is less than his,
that's what I'm saying.

581
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:48,767
Is it because he is the wind?

582
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,034
What?

583
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,033
But... Didn't you say that wind
had stopped?

584
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,100
I don't think that's relevant to
this discussion.

585
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:06,634
The reason I'm being
interrogated about that...

586
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,566
It's not an interrogation.
It's a verification.

587
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:17,466
In any case, this has nothing
to do with my decision.

588
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,367
I momentarily forgot that you care
too much about other people.

589
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:29,333
I also forgot that that's the
reason I keep wanting to see you.

590
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,267
CEO Sin.

591
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:35,367
Now that I know your reasoning,
I'll try to convince my employees.

592
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:37,900
That a person who has more
should help a person who has less

593
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:41,534
and that a stronger person
should protect a weaker person

594
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,867
is also my way of life.

595
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:46,167
However, I don't agree that
the person you want to protect

596
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:52,000
is weaker than you are.
I'll be in touch.

597
00:54:39,133 --> 00:54:43,800
I can see the feelings of others,
except for you.

598
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:49,834
Even though it doesn't work on
you, I know what you're feeling.

599
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,000
You're probably feeling anger,
contempt, and confusion.

600
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:57,067
Nothing will change from you
taking over the gods' gate.

601
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:03,000
That's not what's important.
I don't care about the gate.

602
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:07,333
What I've made up my mind about
is Yoon So-ah.

603
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,567
Yoon So-ah is the first thing
during my time here

604
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:17,000
that I've most ardently desired.

605
00:55:17,066 --> 00:55:19,067
Of course I'll make sure to
win her over in a proper manner.

606
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:22,567
I will give thanks to you for
helping me realize this.

607
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:26,200
What nonsense are you saying?
She is a servant of the gods.

608
00:55:26,266 --> 00:55:30,333
So what? This is the human realm
and my stomping ground.

609
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:36,334
I heard you're going back.
So-ah called you a passing breeze.

610
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,833
Or rather, what she actually
said was a wind that has stopped.

611
00:55:41,266 --> 00:55:45,767
Your friend seems to fear that
I'm going to harm the gods' realm.

612
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:51,100
Let him know that I have
no interest in you or your realm.

613
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:55,266
So don't you worry and
just return safely to your realm.

614
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:37,233
(My Servant)

615
00:56:45,966 --> 00:56:48,200
(Water Ghost)

616
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,333
What? What took you so long?

617
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,466
- Hello?
- Speak.

618
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,034
What's making you so cold?

619
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,000
- Speak?
- Are you at home?

620
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:05,066
Yes.

621
00:57:07,533 --> 00:57:12,166
What? Why are you lying when
you said you weren't going to?

622
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:14,767
Did you come out to take in
some night air?

623
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,867
Yes. Why?

624
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:21,900
I did something for your sake
just now,

625
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:26,967
I can't tell you the details but
I'm just letting you know.

626
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,967
- Where are you?
- I'm about to go in now.

627
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:32,400
Wait a second. Since you're out,
why don't you get some more air?

628
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:37,167
Or actually, it's dinner time.
Let's eat before we home.

629
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:40,566
Where are you? I'll come to you.

630
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,133
Ok?

631
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,767
I heard you're going back.
So-ah called you a passing breeze.

632
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:24,233
Or rather, what she actually
said was a wind that has stopped.

633
00:58:31,766 --> 00:58:33,500
You're here?

634
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:39,500
Why do you keep putting on
a long face?

635
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,634
I said we should eat dinner.
Why did you want to come here...

636
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:47,100
- Did you sell the land?
- Pardon?

637
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,866
Did you sell it to
that hotel owner?

638
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:54,967
Yes. But…

639
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,467
Right. I told you to do as you
deem fit.

640
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:01,534
However,
if it's that guy, you can't.

641
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,366
Were you mad because of that?

642
00:59:08,866 --> 00:59:12,934
I did sell it to him but I asked
him to rescind the contract.

643
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,600
I felt troubled about it too.

644
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:21,134
I didn't need to, but I felt
sorry and self-conscious.

645
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,834
I don't know why, as it's my land
and you said to do as I deem fit.

646
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,100
And I don't know why I had to
since you're leaving anyway, but I

647
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:34,400
told him to return it. For you.
I don't know why but I did it.

648
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:37,567
Selling it and getting it back
is not what's important.

649
00:59:37,633 --> 00:59:40,066
It's not important?

650
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,966
Over something that's unimportant,

651
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:48,966
what the heck have I been
doing all this time?

652
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,300
What the heck have I been doing?

653
00:59:52,366 --> 00:59:57,600
Why do I need to know what you've
done and will do with that man?

654
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:01,566
What did you say?

655
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,333
Fine.

656
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:10,033
You were right.

657
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,633
I'm going to leave

658
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:16,433
while you're someone who belongs
to this world.

659
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,734
We cannot be
each other's happiness.

660
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,900
Since we have flightless wings,

661
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,100
it's not right to think that
we can fly.

662
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:43,500
Laughing when you're sad
makes you first-rate,

663
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:50,367
bearing it makes you second-rate,

664
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:56,133
and crying makes you third-rate.

665
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,333
I guess I'm third-rate.

666
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,033
Because of you,

667
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,600
I became third-rate.

668
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:23,566
You really are a bad god.

669
01:01:24,366 --> 01:01:30,334
I hammered my heart so much to
toughen it. Even if I couldn't be

670
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,333
be first-rate, I needed to be
second-rate since I'm by myself.

671
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:44,300
In order to prevent the poor and
weak tears from hanging around me.

672
01:01:44,366 --> 01:01:47,400
I had to have firm affirmations
in my heart.

673
01:01:51,566 --> 01:01:57,433
After you appeared,
I thought I had become first-rate,

674
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:02,300
and now I see

675
01:02:03,766 --> 01:02:06,233
that I've become third-rate.

676
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:54,166
I'm going to go.

677
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,500
I must go.

678
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,900
I just said, I'm leaving.

679
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,733
(The Bride of Habaek)

680
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,534
- Joo Dong's back.
- The divine stones?

681
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,500
Now the end is really in sight.

682
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:07,567
Is it because of that girl?

683
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:09,567
I think that girl is in
Ha Baek's heart.

684
01:05:09,633 --> 01:05:11,634
I lost you once,
I won't lose you a second time!

685
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,200
Are you crazy?

686
01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:16,467
Why are you doing this to me?

687
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:18,034
Why are you doing this to me?!

688
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,967
So that no one is hurt

689
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:21,434
We should wrap this up
beautifully.

690
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,834
Whether the feeling you have is
sympathy towards humans or love

691
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,134
If it's at all possible,
I want to live with this woman.

692
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,233
Here, like this.
