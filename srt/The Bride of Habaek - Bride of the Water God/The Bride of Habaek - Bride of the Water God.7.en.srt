Yoon So-ah!

8

Yoon So-ah!

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,800
Yoon So-ah!

10
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,200
Yoon So-ah!

11
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,666
Yoon So-ah!

12
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,800
Lord Ha Baek!

13
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,233
Come to your senses.

14
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,034
What happened?

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,966
Today is my day off.
I was curious about you two.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,366
So I had been following you two
the entire day.

17
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,666
By the way,
why did you guys fight?

18
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,633
Aren't you going to thank me?

19
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,033
Fine, let's call it even with
what happened yesterday.

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,033
No need to be embarrassed.

21
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,700
(The Bride of Habaek)

22
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:07,600
(Episode 7)

23
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:15,666
Oh, what are you so worried about?

24
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,066
It's nothing.

25
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:22,667
Oh my. You look like
you almost died just now.

26
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:27,534
Earlier, I drove someone who
almost died four times in a month.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,334
Four times?

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,434
Yes. As it was that often,

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,634
he said it caused him to give up,

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,500
thinking this must be fate.

31
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:39,934
If it's fate,
he might think like that.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,834
You're mistaken about fate too.

33
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,567
Pardon?

34
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:47,267
In fate,
you can't change your life.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,367
You're born with it.
But luck is a different story.

36
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:54,534
Life varies depending on
the driving ability of the luck.

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,100
When luck and life come together,
fate can change.

38
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,367
Depending on the ability of
the driver,

39
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,567
you could go faster or slower,

40
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,334
go with ease or with difficulty.

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,100
It's even possible that
you won't be able to go at all.

42
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:14,034
Today, you have met
a good driver so you will

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,200
be able to reach your destination
quickly and safely.

44
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:28,967
- Why are you smiling?
- Following you was like

45
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:33,134
watching a rom-com. Even though
it's not my favorite genre.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,500
Rom-com? What is that?

47
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:38,033
Fight, then parting.
Even the conclusion was perfect.

48
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,000
But what did you two fight about?

49
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:03,566
Miss Yoon So-ah.

50
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:11,300
Something came up.

51
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:15,034
It doesn't look pretty, but there
won't be a problem stamping it.

52
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Did something happen?

53
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,534
No.

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,066
Let's hurry and get this stamped.

55
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,633
Hurry.

56
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,000
I guess there is someone
who is against selling this land.

57
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,000
No. No. No.

58
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,234
No, not at all.

59
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,700
Just keep it. I will draft
a new contract and send it to you.

60
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,134
No, let's just do it today...

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,834
We can't do it today.

62
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,400
It needs to be stamped
with the corporate seal.

63
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,200
I was in a hurry,

64
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,400
I didn't think that far.

65
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,400
I am sorry.

66
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,333
Then, goodbye.

67
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,700
Are you joking?

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,366
Pardon?

69
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,500
You're here already, do you think
I will let you just leave?

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,033
Oh!

71
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,200
Are you alright?

72
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,634
Manual labor is best when
you have many things on your mind.

73
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,400
I know.

74
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:32,367
Your first impression was
of someone with is cold-hearted.

75
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,134
I never knew you had
this kind of a hobby.

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,900
That's a stereotype.

77
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,767
Someone who's cold-hearted can
like trees.

78
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,100
Also, I am someone with
enough blood

79
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,800
and more than enough tears.

80
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:46,367
Anyway,
you seem very unapproachable.

81
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,900
How did you become a successful
businessman when you're like that?

82
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:55,067
Once I set my mind to it,
I can see the other's feelings.

83
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,767
I just try not to see them.

84
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,567
You can see them? Do you have
supernatural powers or something?

85
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:01,667
Aren't I something else?

86
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,434
I am sorry to say this,
but not really.

87
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Those kinds of skills are
very common around me.

88
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,034
There's someone who moves as fast
as the wind, like teleporting,

89
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,934
someone who can make
diamond rings endlessly,

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,333
and someone who becomes an expert
if he just reads about it once.

91
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,534
This person can even transform
his body like Jeon Woo-chi.

92
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,000
They are dangerous people.

93
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:23,766
I know.

94
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,300
Oh. Thank you.

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,233
Out of all hobbies, why trees?

96
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,034
Because trees will live longer
than I will.

97
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,767
Trees make a forest but
they don't try to control it.

98
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,400
A lowly grass, bothersome bugs,
or even annoying winds.

99
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,367
They embrace it all.

100
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,167
Trees live together in
harmony with others

101
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:42,000
and prove their being by
giving up themselves when needed.

102
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,366
I was right, wasn't I?

103
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,333
When you're physically tired,
you forget about everything.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,766
What happened?

105
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,233
It's odd.

106
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,267
Why do I want to tell you
everything?

107
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,200
That's because I am a stranger.

108
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,000
A stranger?

109
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,100
If you tell this  to yourself,

110
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,600
it's just like spitting on your own face.

111
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,233
It's odd.

112
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,100
You don't make any sense
yet you do.

113
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:19,100
Just think you're telling anyone.

114
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,633
It's just

115
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,400
I made a common mistake that
many people make.

116
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:38,066
Relying on someone without
intending to. Having expectations.

117
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,300
More importantly,
telling him how I feel.

118
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,833
That was the worst.

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,634
I am sure you did it because it's
alright to do it to that person.

120
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,266
No.

121
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,600
It was to someone I shouldn't do
that to.

122
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,166
Since he's someone who will
leave anyway.

123
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,166
He's not a person.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,933
He's a bad person.

125
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,934
What?

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,333
He's going to leave but he made

127
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,433
your heart waver.

128
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,533
Thank you.

129
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,600
The gate to my farm is
always open.

130
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,233
We always need a helping hand too.

131
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,233
CEO Sin.

132
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,767
I will apologize.

133
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,000
For being rude.

134
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,500
Oh my goodness.

135
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,000
He's going to leave but he made
your heart waver.

136
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:38,666
What are you doing here?

137
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,166
I was trying to come up with
a way to regain my divine powers.

138
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,633
Let's go.

139
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,733
Did you visit the wasteland?

140
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:55,600
No.

141
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,833
Why?

142
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,800
You acted as if you needed
to go there right away.

143
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,100
I don't have a license.

144
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,534
There is Ahn Bin.
Why didn't you ask him?

145
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,100
I told you he's not to be trusted.

146
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,100
Then have we made up now?

147
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,333
Are you still angry?

148
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,966
- When I said I'll protect you...
- It was a lie.

149
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:43,233
What I said earlier,
they were all lies.

150
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:52,400
Everyone's the same.
When they're angry, they ramble.

151
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:58,000
I didn't mean it. So don't worry about it.

152
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,166
There is no truth in rambling.

153
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Don't worry.

154
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,366
I knew it already.

155
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,733
It always shows when you lie.

156
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,334
- Where are you?
- At work.

157
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,633
- Where are you?
- You will die if you come.

158
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:57,700
Only I am having it hard. Only me.
Things seem fine without Joo Dong.

159
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:01,000
And someone goofs off at work and
everything is perfectly fine.

160
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,000
It's not fine.

161
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:04,566
The biggest problem is water.

162
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:16,600
I have resuscitated it but
if it continues to be like this...

163
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,500
One day,
we will have to let it go too.

164
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,100
Since we can't revive the dead.

165
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,100
Guess what I did the whole day.

166
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,667
Do you think I would be
curious about that?

167
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,200
I tailed Ha Baek the whole day.

168
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:31,767
Don't agitate your insecurities
again and just do your work.

169
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,900
I saw Joo Geol Rin.

170
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,000
Coming and going like the wind
is my specialty.

171
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,433
So what happened? Did Ha Baek
find out about everything?

172
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:50,767
Did he find out about everything?
Did Joo Geol Rin fess up?

173
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:55,666
Joo Geol Rin was quite something.
He was good at running away.

174
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,167
Is Joo Geol Rin something
for you to be so nervous about?

175
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:03,466
Hurry and find Joo Dong. I need to
send him away. Can't stand it.

176
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,934
Why are you looking for a house
then? Isn't it to live with him?

177
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,500
Find a nice house. It seems
Ha Baek is in no hurry to return.

178
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:19,266
What? Why?

179
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,934
Let's start with breathing.
Inhale through the nose,

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,366
exhale.

181
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,267
Then, with your right hand
and your left leg,

182
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:38,367
wrap your left hand and feet
and twist.

183
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:44,800
With palms facing each other,
breathe in then breathe out.

184
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, Ja-ya. Ja-ya.
Keep your balance. Balance.

185
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:52,067
Round your back more. More.

186
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,500
Release. That's all for now.

187
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:01,600
It seems they want to shoot
the main segment

188
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,866
of the morning broadcast at our
resort. For 2 hours, from 6 to 8am.

189
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,100
What did
the marketing department say?

190
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:11,067
They say the publicity effect
will be fairly small,

191
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,167
but Miss Shin will be
at the forefront again.

192
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,734
She nagged me all day yesterday
about setting up your interview.

193
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,900
Thank you.

194
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:24,200
I still haven't seen the summer
package proposal. Please check.

195
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,267
Alright.

196
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:29,434
Also, there are performance files
from Culture Space.

197
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,333
- Please send them to my e-mail.
- Yes.

198
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,666
Hey!

199
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,367
- Assistant Min. Where is CEO Sin?
- He has an outside meeting.

200
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,534
He's always busy.

201
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,500
I thought I made myself clear
regarding the interview.

202
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:56,266
I know. So cut and dry.

203
00:17:56,766 --> 00:18:01,333
Never mind.
More importantly, earlier today,

204
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,333
why did CEO Sin smile after
seeing me?

205
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:09,534
- He smiled?
- Yes! He smiled.

206
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,367
A very off-putting smile.
Why did he laugh?

207
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:17,700
I don't know about him but
I would've because it was funny.

208
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:18,466
What?

209
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:25,434
You were twisting your body.
Anyone would have found it funny.

210
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
Hey! Y-you!

211
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,233
It's Assistant Min.

212
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,466
Hey! Hey!

213
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,666
Did I really look funny?
I can't look funny.

214
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,700
Hello?

215
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh. Did I call too early?

216
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,767
No. No.

217
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,433
The documents are ready. Should I
set up a meeting for Monday?

218
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:01,667
Oh. Yes, that sounds good.

219
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:05,434
- No. Let's just meet today.
-
Pardon?

220
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,667
Something might come up again.
I'll bring the corporate seal.

221
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,634
Alright.

222
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,900
Let's meet in the evening.
I have to stop by the farm.

223
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,067
Flower seedlings which were
hard to get arrived at the farm.

224
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,834
Alright.
Then I'll see you in the evening.

225
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,367
What are you so happy about?
Who is it?

226
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,467
What is this?

227
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:26,833
How did you get in?

228
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,100
My keys!

229
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,200
Look at you!

230
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:40,933
- The key was in the door lock.
- Pardon?

231
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:03,434
That's a separate issue from
you, natural man, trespassing.

232
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,100
I came into my own house,
what's the problem?

233
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:10,766
I've told you many times already
and you still don't know it.

234
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,600
The land,
are you trying to sell it

235
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,833
because of the 'mo-ney'?
Since you don't have it?

236
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,700
Yes. I wouldn't sell it
unless it was necessary.

237
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:28,766
Then do as you deem fit.

238
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,267
What?

239
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,233
You said you will become happy
if you had a lot of 'mo-ney'.

240
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:38,166
Do as you deem fit.

241
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:48,100
Who was on the phone? Who was it
for you to smile like that?

242
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,066
You don't need to know.

243
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,634
Why?

244
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
It must have been a man.

245
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:34,333
- What did you say?
- It was a man.

246
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:40,600
You're blushing
and your heart is pounding.

247
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,233
You're breathing hard too.

248
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Your pupils are oscillating too.

249
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,000
It was a man on the phone.
It's same as the movies.

250
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,300
What is he saying?

251
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:12,100
What should we do?

252
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:16,300
What do you mean? If the bus
doesn't come, we will call a cab.

253
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:20,166
No, not about that. About us.

254
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:26,467
Where did you go in the middle of
a movie?

255
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,600
Did you pack everything?

256
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,600
I must have same taste
as Lord Bi Ryeom.

257
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:34,967
I can't watch movies
like rom-coms.

258
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,966
I watched something I can't watch
in real life.

259
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
- Where is my tree fruit water?
- I... Goodness.

260
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,834
What is all this?

261
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,800
She didn't like the way
Lord Ha Baek was dressed.

262
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:52,733
So Moo Ra had those sent over
this morning.

263
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:57,000
When was I on the phone
with a man?

264
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,200
Then were you on the phone
with a woman?

265
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,934
It was with a man

266
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,900
but I wasn't blushing because
I was on the phone with a man.

267
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:08,433
He's just a land...

268
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,800
Forget it. Who cares.

269
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:16,900
Let's just say that's the case.

270
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,967
So does that mean the she was
on the phone with a man or not?

271
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,300
That means she was.

272
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
But is that important?

273
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:39,600
But why did you try to explain
yourself? Why's that important?

274
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:43,966
You almost blurted out that
he's the buyer of the land.

275
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:49,266
You can sell whatever else
you want. But not the god's land.

276
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,466
Then do as you deem fit.

277
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:03,833
But why does he go back and forth?
He's confusing me.

278
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:08,800
You said you will become happy
if you had a lot of 'mo-ney'.

279
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:14,500
Is it because he wishes for my
happiness? No, what do you mean?

280
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,266
He's testing me. Like a coward.

281
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,734
- Hello.
- Who were they?

282
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,634
Doctor. In the wasteland,
feces assumed to be

283
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,433
of the Korean leopard's
have been found.

284
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:36,434
What did they find?

285
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,566
Poop. Korean leopard's poop.

286
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:41,000
So what?

287
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,167
They said it went extinct after
the Japanese invasion and the war.

288
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:50,967
The last leopard stayed in
Changgyeong Palace. Died in 1973.

289
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,666
Since then, the lineage has
been completely cut off.

290
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:56,234
So what?

291
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,700
Korean Wildcat Preservation
Society joined forces with Russia

292
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:01,167
trying to restore Korean wildcats.

293
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,167
What's presumed to be its poop
has been found in your land.

294
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:07,534
Gosh. So what?

295
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,734
They're asking you to delay
the sale for their research.

296
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
They heard all about it
from the Farmcorner Realtors.

297
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:16,500
Are you finished? You may leave.

298
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:19,333
Korean leopards need
to be restored.

299
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:26,533
Sang-yoo. Korean leopards wouldn't
have just pooped only in my land.

300
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,234
You said Ma Bong-yeol will be here
today with his father.

301
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,667
He went on a trip with his father
and cancelled his appointment.

302
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,167
And you don't have any other
patients. You can go and rest.

303
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,600
Anyway, you will close down
the clinic soon.

304
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,000
Are you trying to rebel
or is that a joke?

305
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,566
Bye. My eternal love.

306
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,200
Don't ever come back.

307
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:59,400
Don't ask the forest
for directions.

308
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,866
Don't send tidings by the wind.

309
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:11,833
I will remember only you,
you who were my everything.

310
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:36,566
Breathe.

311
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,134
- Oh my.
- Again?

312
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,700
What's going on?

313
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,667
How many times has it been?

314
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:55,800
He's the king of romance but
he can't even handle a kiss scene

315
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,767
without fainting. it's not like
our Hye Ra eats them alive.

316
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:01,400
Exactly. Even if she has a strong
energy, how strong can it be?

317
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:05,634
Can't they even tell energy
and charisma apart? It's charisma!

318
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,567
Since male actors
keep on fainting...

319
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,467
it's not that our Hye Ra
can't act.

320
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,467
She's an actress who
can't act in a romance genre.

321
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:14,600
She looks stiff.

322
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,267
An actress who's pretty but
has no chemistry with co-stars.

323
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,600
Eats the male actors alive.

324
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,800
Manager Kim.

325
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:28,400
- Yes?
- Are you looking into the house?

326
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,000
Of course. It's a house
our goddess will live in.

327
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:38,167
However, can you explain in
more detail about

328
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:41,966
this penthouse with a view
and an interior to your liking?

329
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,800
Don't you know?

330
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,933
Why don't you know it?

331
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,300
Your lips.

332
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:57,133
Let's change your lip color.
Something more vivid.

333
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:11,800
Go have some steak. I got catering
from a Michelin star restaurant.

334
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:12,966
Hello.

335
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,500
Fine, go and eat.

336
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,533
Thank you.

337
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,600
At this rate, you'll only film
movies where you're an Amazon.

338
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,900
Hye Ra.

339
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,400
You look so pretty.

340
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:43,500
So... Today's shooting has been
wrapped up. He was carried out.

341
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
- Should we have a drink?
- I have a prior engagement.

342
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:56,366
Don't mind him. He has nothing
to do, so he just butts in.

343
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,866
It seems like he's a nice friend.

344
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:05,367
Dare I say, a cut metal and
cut neck friend.

345
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:09,534
A friendship solid and strong
enough to cut through metal.

346
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,967
A friend who will not fear
situations when heads might roll.

347
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:16,666
What must you do to
have such a friendship?

348
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,300
It comes naturally if
you see each other at their worst.

349
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,767
Something came up, so I'm looking
for a place to live.

350
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,034
Oh, I see.

351
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,267
My resort was becoming known as
where the goddess lives.

352
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,334
I am sorry for being so sudden
about it.

353
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,666
My marketing department has
their work cut out for them.

354
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:43,867
I'm surprised to find there's
a human who can talk to you.

355
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,267
I am also surprised to
hear you say you are sorry.

356
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:51,100
He's a decent. Strength with
the strong, gentle with the weak.

357
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:55,666
What's going on? I didn't know
you have such criteria.

358
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,766
What do you know about me?

359
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,900
(Ha Baek)

360
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,166
Oh, Ha Baek.

361
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:12,766
Right.
I will be on my way so get ready.

362
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:14,866
Bi Ryeom?

363
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:20,733
No need to tell him yet. Whatever
he does, he can't be trusted.

364
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,533
I will see you later.

365
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:27,667
Why don't you tell the descendant
about it?

366
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:30,600
It's our work.
I don't want to drag her in.

367
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,700
What's going on? What kind of
secret phone call was it?

368
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,133
Only water gods can
hang out together?

369
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:42,566
I suddenly feel left out.

370
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:44,266
Just leave.

371
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:52,367
If you continue to be like this,
I might just turn evil.

372
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,500
If you want.

373
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,666
Fine.

374
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:15,934
What do I have to do for
that woman to hang out with me?

375
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,033
Oh, should I catch and bring
that punk to her?

376
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,333
I am so hungry.

377
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:44,166
If I can't stay in
the human world, where can I stay?

378
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,366
I am so hungry.

379
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,067
(Humans called gods)

380
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:02,533
(Must Read: Regular morning
meeting will be held)

381
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,700
It's the first time since then.

382
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:21,533
Why are you here? Too much time
has passed to look for traces.

383
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:28,067
That day, Joo Dong asked you to
come saying something was strange?

384
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:28,700
Yeah.

385
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:36,400
No, Joo Dong went that way to
pick up the divine stones.

386
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:06,200
Why?

387
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:13,967
Oh.

388
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,133
What is this?

389
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:20,000
I saw it on the day of my arrival
and I carelessly overlooked it.

390
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,833
But I can't
let go of what Joo Dong said.

391
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,800
What does this look like?

392
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,200
- This...
- It's blood.

393
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,300
But?

394
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:55,267
It seems like human blood,
but that can't be it.

395
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,167
Humans can't leave anything behind
on this land.

396
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:00,966
I know.
This land cleanses everything.

397
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:07,600
If it's not from a human, it must
be from beings of the gods' realm.

398
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:12,633
Traces of gods' realm can be
left behind. But what has blood?

399
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:15,433
Then, just

400
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,933
what is this?

401
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,134
- It's done!
- Is it done?

402
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,166
Stay like this.

403
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,300
Is it done?

404
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,300
It's done.

405
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,133
Finished! Oh, my back.

406
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:56,233
Oh, my back.

407
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Thanks to you,
we finished quickly.

408
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,000
Grandma said, if you're hungry,
you should come eat noodles.

409
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:22,800
So today it is noodles.
But what can I do?

410
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:26,634
I have an important appointment,
so I have to go.

411
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,400
Appointment. Promises must be
kept, so you should leave quickly.

412
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,600
Thank you.

413
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,500
Just a moment.

414
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,200
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

415
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:49,400
There's an insect on my arm.
An insect.

416
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:59,267
What kind of an insect is it?
It has many legs. It stings.

417
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,367
It's fine. Don't cry.

418
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:05,434
Don't cry. It's fine.

419
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,700
It's fine. Don't cry.

420
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,800
Let's go.

421
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:14,400
Yes, Miss Yoon?

422
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:27,067
- Is it related to Joo Dong?
- Since it's strange.

423
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:31,300
The minor gods might know more.
You're not going to tell Bi Ryeom?

424
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:34,600
- Don't say anything yet.
- I also dislike him.

425
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,667
I can't stand the sight of him
if I think about how he hurt you

426
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,233
by making such a thing as
the god's servant.

427
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,666
But this is how he usually is,
so what shall we do?

428
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:50,200
I don't know why he was meddlesome
like that back then either.

429
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:57,166
But you really want to find
Joo Dong quickly, right?

430
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:00,300
What?

431
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:04,500
Bi Ryeom said something strange.
That you don't want go back soon.

432
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:07,400
What are you saying?

433
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,133
What Bi Ryeom said is nonsense,
right?

434
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,200
You would rather be silent
than lie.

435
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:31,866
That's you, Ha Beak.

436
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:34,933
You know, right?

437
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,233
I often lie to you.

438
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,833
But you haven't lied to me
even once.

439
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,966
But Ha Baek, do you know what?

440
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,000
I think it would be better if you
sometimes lied to me.

441
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,400
Because more than anyone,
you know the weight of your words.

442
00:37:54,466 --> 00:37:57,667
Since once you've spoken, you want
to keep your word by all means.

443
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:02,034
So, in case Bi Ryeom is right,
lie to me and tell me it's not.

444
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,634
Moo Ra.

445
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,734
I hate it that you're wavering
because of a human woman again.

446
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,300
Moo Ra.

447
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,167
I don't want you to remember that
pain and despair from the past!

448
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:11,567
Moo Ra, what are you saying?

449
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,633
I'm relieved if my guess is wrong.

450
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,067
With the majesty of the king-to-be
and the authority of the master,

451
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,833
please punish this arrogant
goddess. I will gladly take it.

452
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:37,033
- Please stamp it.
- Yes.

453
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:47,533
You can sell whatever else
you want. But not the gods' land.

454
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,666
What is it? Is something wrong?

455
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,933
No.

456
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:57,400
Then do as you deem fit.

457
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,733
Right.
He said I shall do as I deem fit.

458
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:10,466
It's finally done.

459
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,066
Miss Yoon So-ah, do you know that?

460
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,700
Somehow, I ended up handling
the purchase of your land.

461
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:19,466
The department in charge finds
it odd.

462
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:24,600
- I can explain.
- Some things become more

463
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:29,000
complicated when you explain. And
some things don't need explaining.

464
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,100
Let's eat dinner together
to celebrate signing the contract.

465
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:42,100
You said it was a land passed down
for generations. Aren't you sad?

466
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:46,566
It's a land that did more harm
than good, so I am all right.

467
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,634
But your parents must be
displeased.

468
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,833
I can't ask my father due to some
circumstances. As for my mother...

469
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:03,766
My mother passed away,
so I can't ask her opinion either.

470
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,367
I'm sorry. I naturally...

471
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:10,666
Right. What should be
natural isn't natural.

472
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:15,367
You also naturally look like
you were born with a silver spoon.

473
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:21,766
- You weren't, right?
- Right, I wasn't. I'm an orphan.

474
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,500
I don't know my mother.
My father abandoned me abusing me.

475
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,333
Just let it be.
I'll ask for a new one.

476
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:49,734
Aren't you hungry? Shall we eat?
There are good restaurants nearby.

477
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
- Yes!
- I'm not hungry.

478
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,067
Not hungry!

479
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:04,666
That woman over there,
isn't that the woman we know?

480
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:11,800
Oh, it's Miss Descendant! The man
next to her seems familiar.

481
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,234
- It's indeed CEO Sin.
- What?

482
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,567
The CEO of the resort I model for.
But did they know each other?

483
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:23,367
He's the person we saw that day.
He looks like he has lots of gold.

484
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:27,834
It's him. He is a CEO. He really is
someone who has a lot of gold.

485
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,466
Go.

486
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:45,266
I think I said something
unnecessary. I ruined the mood.

487
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:51,300
- Ah, no no, that's not it. I...
- I know what you're

488
00:41:51,366 --> 00:41:54,800
thinking. You're thinking about me
in your doctor's gown.

489
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:57,267
It's not normal for that guy
to not be bothered by it at all.'

490
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:57,967
No, the thing is…

491
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:02,500
Multiple personalities. Psycho?
Anger-management issues?

492
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:04,400
That's not it,
what are you saying?

493
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,034
Let's go. I will take you home.

494
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,800
I'll take the bus. The breeze
is nice, so I want to walk.

495
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,767
Okay.

496
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,467
It's a great breeze for walking.

497
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:18,666
Thank you for today.

498
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:25,867
But, actually, I'm curious about
something. I've been curious

499
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:30,533
since yesterday, and since
we're talking about the breeze.

500
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,000
The wind that shook your heart,
what was its minimum speed?

501
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:46,200
- Moo Ra.
- Yeah?

502
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:51,333
The question you asked me before,
do you have to hear the answer?

503
00:42:55,266 --> 00:42:57,767
- Bi Ryeom is mistaken.
- Really?

504
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:03,400
It doesn't matter if it's true or
not. My answer is more important.

505
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:04,400
Right.

506
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:11,634
Your answer is what is important.
Isn't it?

507
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,666
What?

508
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:24,666
The wind that shook your heart,
what was its minimum speed?

509
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:29,366
I wanted to know if it is to
such an extent that I can stop it.

510
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,667
I am not sure if it's meaningful
enough to calculate its speed.

511
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:42,767
If I want it to stop,
I'll stop it on my own.

512
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,500
I won't need your help.

513
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,500
Besides, it has already stopped.

514
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:55,066
This is my answer.

515
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,233
Are they sleeping already?

516
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,033
Oh my!

517
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,134
Well,
the lights were all turned off,

518
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,833
so I thought you weren't back yet.

519
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,400
- Look, today…
- You must be tired, go inside.

520
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,433
I'll go inside soon, too.

521
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:01,900
Yes.

522
00:46:01,966 --> 00:46:02,866
Yoon So-ah.

523
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:10,967
Come home early. It's too late.
It's too dark too.

524
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,266
Ah, yes.

525
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:24,000
However, you sometimes stood by
the street lamp

526
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:27,033
and thought about how to
get back your divine powers.

527
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,300
I thought that maybe... today as well?

528
00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:32,066
I won't worry about this
from now on.

529
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:35,400
I'll soon go back to
the Water Kingdom anyway.

530
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,734
Traces of the gods' realm can be
left behind.

531
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,933
But why has blood?

532
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,466
- What is it?
- Our talk of minor gods…

533
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:08,133
Is there anyone who knows about
gods' realm from a long time ago?

534
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:09,633
Long time ago?

535
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,166
This blood stain.

536
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,766
I have a hunch.

537
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,667
Why is he like this?
I will freeze to death.

538
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:30,934
Did he watch a movie with a cold
and handsome main character?

539
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I mean, why is he calling me by
my full name?

540
00:47:34,766 --> 00:47:39,300
I won't worry about this from
now on. I'll be returning soon.

541
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:40,533
As if I didn't know.

542
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:45,133
He doesn't need to
drive it home late at night.

543
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:50,066
Does he by any chance know
that I signed the contract?

544
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:53,466
Who cares if I sign my land away?

545
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:00,833
(Contract Of Sale Of Real Estate)

546
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,500
It's all finished.

547
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,333
I'll arrange everything.

548
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:10,000
Vanuatu.

549
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:13,500
You can sell whatever else
you want. But not the gods' land.

550
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:20,833
You're not saying this, right?

551
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:24,766
What am I thinking?

552
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:52,766
Are you there?
See me for a moment.

553
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:02,666
Goodness! You scared me.

554
00:49:03,866 --> 00:49:06,300
- Why don't you answer?
- What is it?

555
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:10,200
I have to ask you something.
For my mental health.

556
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:13,466
- What is it?
- Why can't I sell that land?

557
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,634
Even if the owner changes,
the gate doesn't disappear.

558
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,334
Right.

559
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,234
Then why not? It won't be blocked.

560
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,100
Might be a little uncomfortable,
but it should be nothing for you.

561
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:27,100
That's why I told you
to do as you deem fit.

562
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:29,500
You did say that,
but let's hear your reason.

563
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:34,066
They will say I am a king
who couldn't even keep that.

564
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,400
You said it doesn't matter,
since you were born to be king.

565
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:46,633
It doesn't matter.

566
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:51,800
However, even in our world,
there is always someone waiting.

567
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:56,733
Is that enough for an answer?
If it's enough, you should go.

568
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:01,933
Rest well.

569
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,933
It's nothing compared to
my situation.

570
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:20,333
It's not something that's certain.
Isn't it just an assumption?

571
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:23,933
If he asks me to give in for that,
that's not the attitude of a god.

572
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:26,400
It's alright. Clear.

573
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:50,100
They will say I am a king
who couldn't even keep that.

574
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,800
(Sima Qian:
Questioning the Ways of a Man)

575
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:13,367
Germs are living beings too.
It's sad to kill them by sunlight.

576
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:14,133
What?

577
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:20,267
Did you eat?
Shall we go down and eat together?

578
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:23,167
We'll meet Moo Ra and
eat together.

579
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:25,166
Is that so? That turned out well.

580
00:51:26,766 --> 00:51:30,800
- We saw you with the CEO.
- What?

581
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:33,000
That guy who looks like
he has a lot of gold.

582
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:34,966
You two look good together.

583
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:39,566
Let's go.

584
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,200
We'll be back.

585
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,200
They saw us? So they also know
that I signed the contract?

586
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:59,766
There is no way they would know
he's the buyer of the land.

587
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:01,800
Wait.

588
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:04,366
He saw the contract.

589
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:06,100
So doesn't he know?

590
00:52:07,066 --> 00:52:10,600
No, that's not it. He definitely
said he doesn't know back then.

591
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:13,900
Does he know?

592
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,034
That's why they were plotting with
that goddess.

593
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,033
So what if he knows?
He told me to do as I deem fit.

594
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:23,766
What shall I do?

595
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,733
Did something happen? You are
even coming to my house.

596
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,133
Why don't you answer your phone?
I called you all last night.

597
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,100
Is there anyone who's been alive
as long as the high priest among

598
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:42,667
- the minor gods?
- As long as the high priest?

599
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:44,134
One.

600
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:44,800
Who?

601
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:47,633
Someone you know as well.

602
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,033
You're working hard.

603
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,700
Madam Choi. Just do as you
usually do. It's just us.

604
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:31,134
- It was you caused a ruckus.
- What about?

605
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,300
When a department store employee
tried to stop someone from

606
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,867
parking in a handicapped space,
a grandma slapped the employee

607
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:40,300
and made the employee kneel
for not recognizing a VIP.

608
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:45,500
I just educated ignorant human
beings and they went berserk.

609
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:48,666
It's slowly getting harder
to live here.

610
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:52,534
Oh, Eunuch Kim. Long time no see.

611
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,934
Who are you calling a eunuch?
Can't you see this?

612
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,266
Wow, what a great car.

613
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:04,467
They say you live off of what
you know. Three hundred years ago,

614
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,967
the skills you honed going
in and out of prison,

615
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:07,866
are finally able to reap
their fruits.

616
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,300
Because you tattled on me to the
human king, do you know how much

617
00:54:11,366 --> 00:54:14,567
suffering I had to go through?
Low being with no business ethic!

618
00:54:14,633 --> 00:54:16,900
We are all low beings.
What business ethics?

619
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:19,900
Do you have anything interesting?

620
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:24,034
Politics, society, economics,
entertainment, anything!

621
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,967
Let's all live well.

622
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:26,800

00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,000
Hey,
have you heard his voice before?

625
00:54:34,366 --> 00:54:36,066
Can he even speak?

626
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:42,033
Oh, our hero.
Coward Joo Geol Rin is here too!

627
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:48,567
- God Joo Dong disappeared?
- Yes!

628
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:52,134
The other gods can't even find him
and are pressuring us to.

629
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,934
I thought I wouldn't have to deal
with the high gods if I'm here.

630
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,067
So that's why Ha Baek still hasn't
gone back.

631
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:03,634
But ambitious Joo Geol Rin!
You're our hero.

632
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,700
You're the only one able to leave
a mark on bastard Ha Baek's face.

633
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:11,000
He will soon become the king and
you guys call him a bastard?

634
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:11,800
What's going on?

635
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,767
Why are you scared? He's the king
over there, not over here.

636
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:20,033
Why else would we have escaped
to this pathetic human realm?

637
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:22,633
If I see that jerk now...

638
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,666
Ah, I don't know.

639
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,900
Well.

640
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:49,267
I have never seen
a breakfast meeting of criminals.

641
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,367
What are you doing gathering
in the morning?

642
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:54,000
You are not even able to
come up with ideas during the day.

643
00:55:57,366 --> 00:55:59,966
I don't know. I don't know.

644
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:06,466
It's not your turn yet. Just wait.

645
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,534
Goodness. What's going on?
Why is goddess Moo Ra here too?

646
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,733
I don't know.
I can't live because of them.

647
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:47,700
Lady Moo Ra… Lady Moo Ra, I...

648
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:51,700
You dare leave a wound on
Ha Baek's face and run away?

649
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:54,534
I ran away because you were
so worked up and saying you were

650
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:59,034
going to kill me. I really
didn't do anything to Ha Baek.

651
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:05,500
The person who told me to
challenge Ha Baek to a duel was...

652
00:57:05,566 --> 00:57:07,134
Shut your mouth!

653
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,567
Of course. If I said that Lady
Moo Ra told me to challenge him…

654
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:14,934
- I told you to shut your mouth!
- Yes. Yes.

655
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,467
You asked me to beat Ha Baek
to a pulp…

656
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:21,534
Shut it! Shut it! Just shut up!
If you don't want to

657
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,567
lose your tongue, shut it!
If you want to live here safely…

658
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:29,666
Yes! I'm shutting my mouth!
I'm shutting it!

659
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:32,333
Are you guys shooting a comedy?

660
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:40,800
What's so funny?

661
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,300
You and him are like
Dumb and Dumber.

662
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:50,066
You're probably more worried about
him learning of the jealousy.

663
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:53,700
That duel out of the blue happened
around the time of that incident.

664
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:56,734
When Miss Sim was sold for sacks
of rice to be offered to Buddha.

665
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,133
It was then.

666
00:57:58,533 --> 00:58:01,767
You misunderstood.
Ha Baek hated her too.

667
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,766
You just couldn't see because of
what happened with Nak Bin.

668
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:14,600
Just fess up. Getting dumped
afterwards is much better.

669
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,000
How is it any of your business?

670
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:19,600
- I just can't stand it.
- What?

671
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,266
It isn't good for a goddess to
look like that.

672
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:36,833
Hey!
Take me with you! What's going on?

673
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:38,366
Hey!

674
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,100
Am I some kind of loser?

675
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,167
- You like it? It's gourmet.
- Not really.

676
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,833
Eat a lot.
You must always be prepared.

677
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:04,234
Would someone like Joo Geol Rin
know anything about that rock?

678
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,433
The high priest told me
something a long time ago.

679
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:10,834
I thought it was nonsense and
didn't pay much attention to it.

680
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,400
But having lived as long as
he has, he might know something.

681
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,733
- What did he say?
- You...

682
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,933
Have you heard of him?

683
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:28,100
I brought him.

684
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:38,800
Lord Ha Baek!

685
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:41,333
Lord Ha Baek!

686
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:53,900
Kill me...I mean spare me.

687
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:58,600
I mean kill me...spare me.

688
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:01,667
I lost my mind for a second.

689
01:00:01,733 --> 01:00:03,366
Aren't you going to
shut your mouth?

690
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:07,234
Listen carefully.
We're going to ask you a question.

691
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:13,700
If you answer, we'll let you go.
However, if you run your mouth,

692
01:00:13,766 --> 01:00:15,867
I'll freeze that tongue of yours
and smash it into pieces.

693
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:20,333
Do you know
why Jin Geon can't speak?

694
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:28,900
What is this?

695
01:00:28,966 --> 01:00:33,900
Arock I brought from the gods'
gate. There's human blood on it.

696
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:35,066
Is that so?

697
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,066
What?

698
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:42,934
That's impossible.
The gods' gate should...

699
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,400
I know. That's why I'm asking you.

700
01:00:46,366 --> 01:00:49,400
In what situation is
this possible?

701
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,900
There's no way that
this is possible.

702
01:00:54,966 --> 01:01:00,600
I will phrase it differently.
Who can make this possible?

703
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:03,833
There's no one who could
make it possible...

704
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,833
There's no way.

705
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,900
There's no way…
there's no way it could be.

706
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:17,833
What are you talking about?
Tell it to us straight!

707
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:26,100
If this is human blood and gods'
land erases all human trace

708
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:30,067
and this is human blood that
can't be erased, then that person…

709
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:34,234
What's this gibberish.
Who's this person?

710
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,100
Right, that person.

711
01:01:38,066 --> 01:01:39,900
You think it's that person too.

712
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:40,966
What are you talking about...

713
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:46,534
You can't be thinking...

714
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,834
What are you all talking about?
Could you let me in on it?

715
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,733
There's no way that person
could still be here.

716
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,666
What I mean is that no one's
seen him so he can't be here.

717
01:02:08,533 --> 01:02:10,733
Bi Ryeom is always bringing
that person up.

718
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:15,200
- You could talk all night.
- What is this about?

719
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:19,534
Joo Geol Rin's probably right.
When I heard from the high priest,

720
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,600
it sounded plausible. Thinking
back, it sounded nonsensical.

721
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:25,167
What did he say?

722
01:02:25,233 --> 01:02:28,834
Then, why did the high priest say
such things to me?

723
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,034
- What did he say?
- What was it he said?

724
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,300
It looks like you're having
a late meal.

725
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:46,367
He's a friend. You saw him
yesterday. He's CEO Sin Hoo-ye.

726
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:50,167
We also saw you last night. You
were meeting with a woman we know.

727
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:50,933
Ah.

728
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:58,734
Are you the patient that came here
last time with Yoon So-ah?

729
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,066
Did you pretend to be a patient?

730
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,333
I guess I jumped to conclusions.
I apologize.

731
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:11,700
He can be a little difficult.
Please understand.

732
01:03:11,766 --> 01:03:15,467
There's no need. I'm the one who
offended him in the first place.

733
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:17,633
Then, please enjoy your meal.

734
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,066
If I were human, he has everything
to make me fall for him.

735
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:28,200
He's too good for our servant.
But I guess getting them together

736
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:31,966
is the right thing to do.
Where were we?

737
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,733
The high priest.
What did the high priest say?

738
01:03:35,966 --> 01:03:37,600
Miss Yoon.

739
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:40,566
Oh, it's the descendant.

740
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,834
What are you doing here?

741
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,733
Well, it's…

742
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,334
I came to meet someone. Did you
happen to meet up with someone?

743
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,400
What?

744
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:58,166
No, it's nothing.

745
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:01,567
- Miss Yoon.
- Yes?

746
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,800
You are being antsy and
speaking nonsensically.

747
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:09,533
If you act this way, I might think
you changed your mind overnight.

748
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:13,533
I've been rejected, haven't I?

749
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:15,833
What?

750
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:21,200
I guess she's really on good terms
with the CEO with a lot of gold.

751
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,366
This the first time I've seen
CEO Sin smile that way.

752
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:30,466
Ha Baek!

753
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,600
CEO Sin, come over here with me.

754
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:40,733
Hey!

755
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:49,566
You've been figured out by me.

756
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,666
I'm saying I've figured you out.

757
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,666
(The Bride of Habaek)

758
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,767
- Did you also know?
- It doesn't make sense.

759
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,567
This person's true identity!

760
01:05:34,633 --> 01:05:35,733
True identity?

761
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:36,934
Yoon So-ah.

762
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,300
Just as we are suspecting
Yoon So-ah who's with that person.

763
01:05:39,366 --> 01:05:41,234
Are you close with that hotel CEO?

764
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,867
That person is probably also
curious about Yoon So-ah.

765
01:05:43,933 --> 01:05:46,467
We weren't able to get off work
together, how about tomorrow?

766
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:48,334
Who is he to know all of
their identities?

767
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,067
- Show your true identity.
- He's stronger than Ha Baek?

768
01:05:51,133 --> 01:05:54,867
I guess you haven't heard anything
about the power I possess

769
01:05:54,933 --> 01:05:58,033
- That power!
- Ha Baek! Stop it!
