What do you mean?

8

CEO.

9
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:56,833
Yoon So-ah.

10
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,700
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,900
Why are you here?

12
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,866
Wait!

13
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,966
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,300
CEO Sin.

16
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,300
What are you doing?

17
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:38,300
I should be asking you that.
What are you doing?

18
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,167
Why do you always use violence
without knowing the details?

19
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,666
Details?

20
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,634
What I saw was that bastard
attacking you. What was that then?

21
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:55,200
What is it? Was I intruding on
your future together?

22
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,233
What did you say?

23
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,000
Was I intruding?

24
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:38,167
I don't think that's something
that a dignified god should say.

25
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,800
You are the one who talked
about details.

26
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,966
Tell me.

27
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,133
Was I intruding?

28
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,633
I don't want to explain.

29
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,867
So you do not care
how I might think of it?

30
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,900
Why are we even having
this conversation?

31
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,033
We…

32
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:06,366
What are we?

33
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:40,834
What's with you, Yoon So?
Why did you come again?

34
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,000
If you're coming,
you should have come properly.

35
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,833
What was she doing before
coming here?

36
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,367
Who did she come with?

37
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:57,766
If it's like this, not even Freud
or his grandpa can explain this.

(Episode 11)

40
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Yoon So?

41
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,100
She really came.

42
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Did you come by yourself?

43
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,734
What's with you all of a sudden?

44
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,233
Why are you going around
getting drenched in the rain?

45
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,233
Did something happen?

46
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:38,800
Can I stay at your place tonight?

47
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:40,300
Why?

48
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:42,833
I can't

49
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,266
go home.

50
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,766
What's wrong?

51
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,766
Is this good? Done.

52
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,966
What kind of dream gives you
such a hard time?

53
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:12,200
How did you think of
giving me a call?

54
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:16,633
Did something happen?
Did Lord Bi Ryeom come again?

55
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,366
No.

56
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,366
You once said that being born with
that strength wasn't my choice

57
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,966
and that it wasn't my fault.

58
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:33,400
Do you remember that?

59
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:34,366
Of course.

60
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,500
Is it really not my fault?

61
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:40,133
What are you saying?

62
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,766
Did you tell me those things

63
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:50,233
because you were scared of me?

64
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,000
If I'm not at fault,

65
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,900
then at that time,

66
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,800
who killed those people
who died because of my power?

67
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,733
You comforted me countless times,
saying that I did not kill them.

68
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:11,766
I believed it.
But then, who killed them?

69
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:35,034
I'm sorry.
I've been losing my confidence

70
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,233
since they appeared.

71
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:45,300
I forgot what I originally was

72
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,333
and lived like that.

73
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,766
It keeps on becoming clearer
these days.

74
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:59,833
It doesn't mean anything.

75
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,133
Yesterday,

76
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,266
I could have killed that woman.

77
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,100
Why is the door open?

78
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,166
Is she here again already?

79
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,000
They say you sleep less when
you get older but…

80
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,833
Why did you
come early again today?

81
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:44,133
Who are you?

82
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,967
Neighborhood Resident!

83
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,534
Blessed Mental Health Clinic's

84
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,300
nurse, Yoo Sang-yoo
is still very clumsy.

85
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,700
What are you doing here?

86
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:57,834
I was waiting.

87
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,733
For whom?

88
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,000
Whomever.

89
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,867
How did you get in here?

90
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,134
What about our Doctor?

91
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,967
What are you doing?

92
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,967
Will you please get us some tea?

93
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:11,900
Why did you follow me
all the way here?

94
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,266
Then stop appearing in my dreams.
It upsets me.

95
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,866
You're making me dizzy. Sit down.

96
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,600
Why? Why?

97
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,867
She was surely supposed to
meet CEO Sin last night.

98
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,600
Why did Neighborhood Resident
spend the night in her office?

99
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,167
The nuance of
what you said is weird.

100
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,834
She spent the night with me.

101
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,034
That's what I'm saying. It's just
that the story's not making sense.

102
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,567
You can't figure out this story
with that brain of yours.

103
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,167
She can't keep on getting mixed up
with the Neighborhood Resident.

104
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:54,300
I'm personally against
this pair, too.

105
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,533
I have to go.

106
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,934
I thought you went home.

107
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,533
I was going to, but I couldn't.

108
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,700
Were you waiting?

109
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
I wasn't exactly waiting for you.

110
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:08,300
Pardon?

111
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:11,800
While thinking of a way,
I fell asleep for a bit.

112
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:14,367
What way?

113
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:17,100
A way to get out of here.

114
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,000
You couldn't leave because
you couldn't lock the door?

115
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,233
The thing that I hate
the most is irresponsibility.

116
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,434
When you ran out did you not think
about the door you left behind?

117
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,966
Is it okay as long as
you're true to your emotions?

118
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,766
Don't you think about
other people's losses?

119
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,267
How can you be so selfish?

120
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,366
You should have at least left
a key.

121
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,666
It's fine as long as
you are sorry.

122
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,933
Thank you.

123
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,234
You can go now.

124
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,666
Is it okay for you to be
irresponsible?

125
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,633
Even if it's irresponsible
and it will end up that way,

126
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,100
is it okay for me to start?

127
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,366
You asked me what "we" are.

128
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,100
To me, you are

129
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,966
someone I've come to
not want to wish unhappiness for.

130
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,133
You're not like a faraway sound
that gets further away,

131
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28,900
you're not
an insignificant nameless thing.

132
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,333
That's how I've come to
think of you.

133
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,600
I want to embrace you.

134
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,700
I want to kiss you.

135
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:50,100
I want you to be
my beginning and end.

136
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,266
I want my mind and heart
to be full of you

137
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,066
and just leave it like that,
even if it's overflowing.

138
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:02,333
I want to justify my jealousy

139
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,900
and be honorable even if
I use my fists.

140
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,733
If I'm going to do all that,

141
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,200
I have to start.

142
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:27,300
Like you said, our predetermined
fate probably cannot be changed,

143
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,100
despite that, is starting

144
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,000
okay?

145
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,333
No.

146
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,233
Please don't...

147
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,900
start.

148
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,100
Good morning!

149
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:37,567
When did you come?

150
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,666
There are times when
I get jealous of humans.

151
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,300
I drank a lot until dawn

152
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:48,634
but coming home with a clear mind
leaves me embarrassed.

153
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,433
I wanted to know
how it feels to be drunk.

154
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,466
About humans,

155
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,934
they are weak, inferior,

156
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,100
and beings that are lacking.

157
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,900
But I'm jealous of that.

158
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:16,633
Look at this, you're not fazed by
things like this. Because you're

159
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:22,233
not lacking anything,
there's nothing I can do for you.

160
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:26,900
Should I erase the hate comments
for you at least?

161
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:38,233
By the way, I can't get used to
seeing you at home every morning.

162
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,700
Why do you listen to
Ha Baek so well?

163
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:45,566
You don't have anything today,
right? What are you going to do?

164
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,733
Keep an eye on you.

165
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,933
It won't be easy.

166
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,167
- Hey, hey.
- What?
- Isn't that Hye Ra?

167
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,000
Wow.

168
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,000
You go.

169
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,200
Let's go.

170
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,866
(Photo was not saved)

171
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,900
What happened?

172
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:48,667
Isn't that Hye Ra?

173
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,100
Hye Ra.

174
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,866
Does he tease you like this too?

175
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,866
But why are you not talking?

176
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,966
Did I really freeze
your tongue and smash it?

177
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,167
You know that I've really held it
in today, don't you?

178
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,867
Pretend you're rewarding me
and tell me.

179
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:31,000
Why are you being
so reckless these days?

180
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,734
This is so fun!
And you want me to give it up?

181
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,467
Even if I tell the whole world,
I won't tell you.

182
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:39,900
Fine.

183
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,133
Then what is it that you want from
CEO Sin? At least tell me that.

184
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,400
Huh? What is it?

185
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,166
I want him to die.

186
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:10,334
Mr. Kim, cancel
whatever appointments I have.

187
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,333
I have something I need to do.

188
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,900
Just pay for all of the penalties.

189
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:22,834
If you want to go to
another company, then just go.

190
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,567
You're going to abandon your work
and keep following me around?

191
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:29,500
I won't let you out of my sight
for a second starting today.

192
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:34,266
Okay,
I'll forget about him for today.

193
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:49,633
Why don't you just tell her
everything and ask for her help?

194
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,700
What? For what?

195
00:21:56,766 --> 00:22:00,167
You said that you think she saw
your wound disappear.

196
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:02,567
I'm not sure.

197
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:05,267
Either way, what reason do you
have to hide everything?

198
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:10,600
You said before she's probably the
human most likely to understand.

199
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:21,233
Yes?

200
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,000
You didn't tell me you were
coming. What are you here for?

201
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:29,633
What's going on?

202
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:38,634
Are you perhaps engaged to that
woman from the psychiatry clinic?

203
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,800
- What are you talking about?
- Has she found out some

204
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:45,400
huge weakness of yours? It's
because I can't understand it.

205
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's not like you to make
such an irresponsible decision.

206
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,700
We will most likely continue the
work with Chungcheong in mind.

207
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:56,000
The assessment of the Chungcheong
land came out pretty comparable

208
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,967
to Gangwon and the investors from
the U.K. feel positive about it.

209
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:00,466
But I own no land over there!

210
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,300
Ah, what I meant to say is

211
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,000
I came because I was worried you
were going through something.

212
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:15,567
After your mother brought you,
she raised you with such care.

213
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,800
When you first arrived
at our house...

214
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:19,966
I have to leave for a meeting.

215
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh?

216
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:27,534
Oh, okay.

217
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,934
In any case, I think Gangwon is
better than Chungcheong.

218
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,734
Reconsider it and contact me.

219
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,600
I will not reverse my decision.

220
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:53,934
Secretary Min was not
at his office earlier.

221
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm here.
Just tell me what you want.

222
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:00,034
I have a half-day today and
I'm on my way out. Time is gold.

223
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,034
I'll give you that money.

224
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,867
-Two minutes have passed.
- CEO Sin has been giving signs.

225
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,467
What signs?

226
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:10,666
He's trying to act like a bad guy
but it's really awkward.

227
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:18,634
Should I act like I know so he
goes back to how he was before?

228
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,867
- Or act like I don't know?
- Just act like you don't know.

229
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:26,033
That would be best for
your mental health. Then...

230
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,333
No. Don't

231
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,966
start.

232
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,667
I've been turned down.

233
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:58,634
This is the first time I've been
turned down by a human woman

234
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,166
in 2800 years. Does she have
any idea whom she turned down?

235
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:17,600
I thought she only had a knack for
being  clumsy, rude,

236
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,366
clueless, and dumb.
She's also a coward.

237
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,366
What's going on that
you're calling me of all people?

238
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,000
If he wants to get wild, I'm your
man. I'm finally starting to

239
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:42,767
like him. I'll have to give him
a hundred ways to get wild.

240
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,667
What's going on here?

241
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:48,500
Why?
Why does he want to become wild?

242
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:53,567
You don't need to come. If he
needed you, why would he call me?

243
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:57,233
That's what I'm saying!
That's why it's strange!

244
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:04,000
It's only because I'm a guy.
If Joo Dong was here, he would've

245
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:07,134
called him. To put it simply,
something is better than nothing.

246
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,034
- What does that mean?
- It means there's a time when you

247
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,900
need only a man to talk to. I'll
go find out what's going on. Okay?

248
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:21,767
You just practice your kiss scene.
It would be ridiculous for you to

249
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:26,633
become an Amazoness because
you can't kiss.

250
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,934
Go to the powder room. I prepared
everything so you can practice.

251
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,100
Only I would do things like this
for you.

252
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:38,134
You're only going to stay with
Ha Baek, right?

253
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,100
You're not going to do
anything else?

254
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:47,100
- I'd better watch both of you.
- I get it. I said that I get it.

255
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:52,867
-You know I usually listen to you.
- What are you going to do?

256
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,967
He says that he wants to get
out of control like humans do.

257
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:59,667
I'll show him how to become
corrupt in a short period of time.

258
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:03,366
Even if it doesn't work on me,
it could on Ha Baek.

259
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,866
Powder room?

260
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:20,700
Welcome. This is your first time
with someone like me, right?

261
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,200
I'm going to kill him.

262
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,333
Welcome. This is your first time
with someone like me, right?

263
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,833
I bought it for you.

264
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,900
Is this the way to
get out of control?

265
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,967
No, it's like a platform.
If you pass this,

266
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:47,633
you will get out of control
whether you want to or not.

267
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:53,900
I have no idea what you're saying.

268
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:03,366
Like crawling on all fours?

269
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:10,600
It could happen. In any case,
you will do things you'd never

270
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,066
do with a sober mind
so don't be too embarrassed.

271
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:18,133
But first, what's the reason
you want to get out of control?

272
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:23,166
Why are you laughing?

273
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:28,067
I'm wondering whether I should
act like I know or say something.

274
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:32,633
- What is it?
- Is it not going well?

275
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,000
What?

276
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:42,667
I thought So-ah would be useless,
but she can make the almighty

277
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,366
Ha Baek get out of control. Who
among us could accomplish that?

278
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:49,800
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

279
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:58,033
Should I tell you something
about her that you don't know?

280
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:01,300
You didn't think about that,
did you?

281
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:06,167
That my friend and I share
a common past.

282
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:10,966
I know the face of 20-year-old
So-ah that you don't know.

283
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,566
Okay.

284
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:23,700
She was like a spring freesia.
She liked wearing mini skirts.

285
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:28,267
She was full of life. I also
remember that she had lots of guys

286
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:32,300
following her around. She even
dated a couple of them.

287
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:36,600
She was even pretty intimately
acquainted with some of them.

288
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,600
There's something else.

289
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:42,567
The reason she refused my diamond
ring was pretty memorable too.

290
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:47,967
She said that if she had taken it,

291
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:51,200
she had a bad feeling that she
would have to pay an unknown cost.

292
00:29:56,633 --> 00:30:00,066
Goodness. I need to record this.

293
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:09,634
- Why are here by yourself?
- Look at him.

294
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:15,100
-Did you get rejected too?
- I knew we'd find a new side.

295
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:20,034
I agree that he is
always one step ahead of me.

296
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,967
You want to be by yourself?

297
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,233
I'll leave now.

298
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:28,167
Why are you here by yourself?
Did you get rejected too?

299
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,167
He keeps repeating himself.

300
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,934
- Did you get rejected too?
- He's the type you get tired of.

301
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,167
Is your woman also...

302
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:38,533
Hey mister. What are you doing?

303
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,767
What do you think about
that problem?

304
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,100
Ah, what are you doing?

305
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,933
How dare you lay a finger
on my body?

306
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,534
The things I say, each word I speak
is taunt of this evil tongue

307
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,867
the things trapped in time...

308
00:30:56,933 --> 00:31:03,434
You seem to be very serious.
You should talk with us too.

309
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,966
I am talking about the misfortunes
of all things standing.

310
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,767
Haha.

311
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:16,334
We're all unfortunate. These guys
too. He's not the only one.

312
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,167
But is the world fair?

313
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:23,834
But if you try a bit harder,
we can be happy.

314
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,933
Enough to put your hand in your
pocket and take out your wallet.

315
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,666
This kind of small happiness?
What do you think?

316
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,567
They seem to be getting along.

317
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:40,600
I really think that's a dumb idea.

318
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,500
I hate it the most
when people say it's dumb.

319
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,033
Huh?

320
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,066
Ah, what a day full of gifts.

321
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:14,366
If Moo Ra saw this she would flip.

322
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,566
Can I be irresponsible?

323
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:56,167
To do all that, I must start.

324
00:32:56,233 --> 00:33:01,100
Like you said,
our future isn't going to change.

325
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:05,166
But... can I start anyway?

326
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Even if I think it over a million
times more, I don't think so.

327
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,633
Aren't you coming?

328
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,333
I'm coming.

329
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:47,800
Whatever it came to,
there is no reason to hide it.

330
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:55,633
As I told you before, she'll be
one to understand you the most.

331
00:33:56,733 --> 00:34:00,234
Why?
Is she not that kind of person?

332
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,267
No, she is more than that.

333
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:10,367
Ms. Yoon So-ah will be my
biggest desire since I was born.

334
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,800
And I will earn her love
in a fair way.

335
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:15,766
I heard you can only kill or destroy.

336
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:28,366
Can someone like me
be near someone like her?

337
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,100
Hello?

338
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,834
Descendant, Lord Ha Baek
isn't answering his phone.

339
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,700
I don't think I can come
home today. I have a night shift.

340
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:38,700
There are people who ride
the duck boat this late?

341
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:43,366
The duck boat ended, but the
chicken store asked me to help.

342
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:48,367
Because it's a night shift,
I'll get paid more!

343
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,967
Yes, I will tell him that.

344
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:52,500
You don't have to do this!

345
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:56,366
Hello? Hello?

346
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,433
Hello?

347
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:06,300
Yoon So-ah.

348
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,800
Yes, CEO Sin.

349
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,500
Can you talk?

350
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,366
Yes, of course.

351
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:21,500
Did you return safely yesterday?

352
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,634
Nothing happened, right?

353
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,900
How are you feeling?

354
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:30,100
I am sorry.

355
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,834
I should have called you earlier.

356
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,000
It's all good. I am fine.

357
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:39,534
I am really sorry.

358
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,500
I was negligent as your doctor.

359
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:42,300
It's okay.

360
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:49,500
That person from last time…
I can't exactly explain.

361
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,134
There might have been
a misunderstanding.

362
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,934
He asked me to apologize to you
for him.

363
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,134
I see.

364
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,067
I will set up another appointment
for Monday.

365
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,233
You can come, right?

366
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,400
Of course.

367
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,534
Should we discuss the sessions for
resort employees on Wednesday?

368
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,834
Sure.

369
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,766
You don't have to work
on your farm yet?

370
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,800
I'll see.

371
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:21,500
Okay, I understand.
Rest up on the weekend.

372
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:24,600
You looked tired when
I saw you yesterday.

373
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,867
Yes. I have to hang up now.

374
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:33,233
I understand.
I will see you on Monday.

375
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,300
You really don't have
to do all this.

376
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:50,700
Why do you work alone? Does
the Water God not do anything?

377
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:54,167
What?
What kind of blasphemy is that?

378
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:57,567
Because your world's and
our world's morals are different.

379
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,634
You don't do
any other part-time jobs?

380
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,034
I can't because I don't have
a resident registration number.

381
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,167
Ah, I see.

382
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:11,434
Hey, but when curses happen,

383
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,167
you always have to kiss right?

384
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:19,667
When the gods curse someone, it
always has to be mouth to mouth?

385
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:22,233
There is no other way, right?

386
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:28,300
Hey! I am not asking to do
something at the moment!

387
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,767
Take care of him. You aren't going
to let me, in right?

388
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:41,934
Did he drink alcohol?
How much did he drink?

389
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,234
Hey but... were you crawling on
all fours when you were drunk?

390
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,833
What?

391
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,034
You didn't pole dance or anything,
right?

392
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:54,133
I told him you were the innocent,
pure type, just in case.

393
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,833
I am going.

394
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:04,800
What?

395
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:12,600
If I had to ask, I'm not sure if
I should ask you to hold on

396
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,666
or to let go. I honestly am not
sure about my feelings.

397
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:18,100
What?

398
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:22,833
Give me a consultation someday.

399
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,800
Hey, wait.

400
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,833
Wake up.

401
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,566
Nam Soo Ri isn't home yet.

402
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:03,367
So, for now stay here.

403
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:07,800
As soon as he comes back,
I will tell him to take you.

404
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,166
Gosh.

405
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,433
Stay like that.

406
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:09,266
I won't start.

407
00:40:12,766 --> 00:40:15,633
Don't be afraid.

408
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:27,133
Let's just stay like this
for a bit.

409
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:17,467
Why are you here by yourself?
Did you get rejected too?

410
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:21,400
You were also rejected.
Is your woman also...

411
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:25,200
It's a rare footage.
I'd better save it well.

412
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:29,100
How did he become so messed up?

413
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,134
He usually can do
all kinds of things.

414
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,400
He has times when
he's petty, cheap, and cowardly.

415
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:37,767
Especially right now,
he's half-human.

416
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,500
He might even pass gas.

417
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:40,700
You did this on purpose,
didn't you?

418
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:44,267
No, I was curious about it and he
really did end up getting drunk.

419
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,167
That's something I really wanted
to be able to do.

420
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,600
I'm jealous of him for
all kinds of reasons.

421
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,466
Why is he like this? What's
causing him to act like this?

422
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,800
Why?

423
00:42:57,633 --> 00:43:02,166
Why is he doing this here
instead of going back?

424
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:06,367
Stop worrying.
He said he's just trying it.

425
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:09,034
He's burdened since the ascension
to the throne will be soon.

426
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:14,367
Once he ascends to the throne,
he won't be as free as he is now.

427
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:16,867
So he said that he has a lot to
think about.

428
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:19,566
For real?

429
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:26,167
Why is he being weak?
It's so unlike him.

430
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,600
Maybe the water doesn't suit him.

431
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:35,900
Should I get him a prescription o
herbal medicine?

432
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:29,400
Why are you standing there
like that?

433
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,166
It looks like it'll be
hot today too.

434
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,566
Should I get you
a fruit drink too?

435
00:44:57,266 --> 00:45:00,300
Books seem to gather here
and there in this house.

436
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:03,100
- They're travel books.
- Travel?

437
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:08,234
There was a time when I said
anywhere but Korea and only read

438
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,333
travel books.
I haven't read that one yet.

439
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:19,466
Since it's sunny, I'm going to
hang the laundry on the rooftop.

440
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,766
Let's eat after I hang up
all the laundry.

441
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:42,633
Would you read me
the first sentence?

442
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:49,800
I can tell if it's a book I need
to read from the first sentence.

443
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:54,134
All humans are stars.

444
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,300
Flowers bloom in
every abandoned island.

445
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:02,833
If I read first sentences like
these, I can read all night long.

446
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,734
Why aren't you reading it to me?

447
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,567
It's fine.

448
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:20,734
All I asked for was for you
to read the first sentence.

449
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,933
If you read the first sentence
and I don't like it, you can stop.

450
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,400
I know randomly reading aloud from
a book is a little embarrassing.

451
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,900
How did we meet?

452
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:42,400
One day a
butterfly flew in like a petaland gave me a tiny flutter.

453
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:48,100
How did we get from there to here?

454
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:54,300
That corner of springtime when
your love and my love overlapped.

455
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,433
An unexpected miracle.

456
00:46:57,933 --> 00:47:03,834
Your hand that furtively grabbed
as we walked along the path.

457
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,000
That time when the dandelions brightly
trembled under the telephone pole.

458
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:17,767
How did we traverse that long
period between then and now?

459
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:24,100
Were we able to pass through love
and arrive at love?

460
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:27,967
Have come to
believe that there are
no coincidences in love.

461
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:30,267
In order to bring about one love,

462
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,534
I have come to believe that
the universe has planned out even

463
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:39,734
the wingbeat of a butterfly.
This miraculous inevitability,

464
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,767
that I was able to stand
in front of you, was something

465
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:46,166
I didn't want to twist into
mere coincidence.

466
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:54,834
Therefore, the best thing I can do
is do my best and...

467
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,566
It seems good.

468
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:02,366
Stop reading and let's go eat.

469
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,533
I'll do the rest later.

470
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:23,333
(If There Were a Word
More Loving Than Love)

471
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,066
Gosh.

472
00:49:01,933 --> 00:49:03,034
Is it edible?

473
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,034
I tried my best.

474
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,066
- Where's Nam Soo Ri?
- He said he'd be here soon.

475
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:19,300
Is it delicious?

476
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,800
Not really.

477
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:29,800
Why did you show off
your legs in mini skirts?

478
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,634
- What?
- Back in the day.

479
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,934
I heard that you looked like
a spring freesia back then.

480
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,766
But what's wrong now?

481
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:47,667
I told him you were the innocent,
pure type, just in case

482
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,166
I heard that you were on
intimate terms with lots of guys.

483
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:54,267
Were you the kind of woman
who was good at flirting?

484
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,500
Do you still meet with them?

485
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,500
Look here, you're not supposed to
talk with your mouth full.

486
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:07,200
Then in those 2800 years that
you've lived, there must've been

487
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:09,934
countless women that you've been
on intimate terms with.

488
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,666
Who were you the closest with?

489
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:13,766
Who?

490
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,000
Hm?

491
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:24,800
you must have been
intimate with a lot of women.

492
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:26,267
I just won't be curious about it.

493
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,266
I'm thankful.

494
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,600
If I had my powers,
I would repay you.

495
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,433
What would you have done for me
if you had your powers?

496
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,534
Since you are a woman with many
flaws, I would have fixed them.

497
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,267
I would take you swimming and
allow you to drink lots of water.

498
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:45,267
I can fix those things on my own.

499
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,833
Since it's a fantasy
you might as well go all out.

500
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,767
What? Mansour?

501
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,634
That would be good too.
There's lots of things.

502
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,067
First off, turn all my stony land
into gold mines,

503
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:01,400
and also make it so that there's
tons of oil pumping out of

504
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:03,934
the East Sea
and put it all under my name.

505
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,200
Reunify North and South Korea.

506
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:09,667
Build me a house that's like
a Greek temple in Vanuatu.

507
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,867
If possible, transform my body into
that of a voluptuous goddess.

508
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:13,666
I am scheduled to have breakfast
at the White House today.

509
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,900
It's a headache to be president
so maybe just the shadow cabinet?

510
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:21,967
Later, I'll go to London in my jet
for the opening of Saatchi.

511
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:30,600
I'm a global celebrity. After
London, I need to go to New York.

512
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,800
Jude Law wants to have coffee
with me.

513
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:35,067
I'll shop a little and stay at
the Presidential Suite at

514
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:40,567
the Four Seasons. If I'm tired, I
can just go to Vanuatu right away.

515
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:42,333
I'll tell Jude Law that
I'll see him next time.

516
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,366
A life like this?

517
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,333
What? Where did he go?

518
00:51:56,766 --> 00:51:57,667
What are you doing?

519
00:51:57,733 --> 00:52:02,934
Don't know what you're saying,
but you're giving me goosebumps.

520
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Experiencing human feelings is
pretty bothersome.

521
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,666
A king should know how to listen.

522
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:20,000
How does a dessert of iced coffee
suit a god?

523
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:21,833
Find.

524
00:52:23,866 --> 00:52:26,133
Let's have a quick cup of coffee.

525
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:28,967
If you had the servant's crest,
your circumstances

526
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:31,500
-  would have been different.
- Servant's crest?

527
00:52:32,633 --> 00:52:35,267
Oh, the token that proves that
my family belongs to the gods?

528
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:38,300
The crest has the power to
grant the servant a wish.

529
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:41,267
You can call it a little token of
goodwill from the gods.

530
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,600
Then give it to me.

531
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:44,000
I told you I lost it.

532
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:48,333
He's really no help.

533
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:54,333
He might as well have
not said anything.

534
00:53:01,766 --> 00:53:05,666
My ex-boyfriend also
really liked iced Americanos.

535
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:16,367
You shouldn't have lost the crest.

536
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:18,200
You could have granted me my wish.

537
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:20,667
Even if I had it, I wouldn't be
able to grant a wish like that.

538
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:21,600
Why?

539
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,833
Do you have to make the wish
in a specific dialect?

540
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,300
It has to be a genuine wish,

541
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:30,634
just one wish that you really want
to come true.

542
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,900
Just one?

543
00:53:31,966 --> 00:53:34,900
From what I know, your wish is not
to become Mansour.

544
00:53:37,566 --> 00:53:38,666
I am back.

545
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:41,333
Oh, here you are.

546
00:53:42,033 --> 00:53:43,466
You must be hungry. Come.

547
00:53:50,866 --> 00:53:52,500
Nothing happened, right?

548
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,967
I couldn't work because I was so
worried about you being alone.

549
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,067
Nam Soo Ri.

550
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:57,600
Yes?

551
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:58,766
Go and eat your food.

552
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:00,366
Yes.

553
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,134
I earned a lot.

554
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,200
If you want to eat something or
there's a book you want, tell me.

555
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:07,934
I don't need anything.

556
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,100
Okay, then I'll buy you
what I think you need.

557
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:21,666
Sit down.
I haven't finished my food either.

558
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:27,867
- You must have had a hard time.

559
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,733
but I almost failed.

560
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:35,633
It's a cute cup.

561
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:38,634
Lord Ha Baek bought it for me
with money he made from working.

562
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,700
Yes?

563
00:54:40,766 --> 00:54:41,566
Why?

564
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:47,900
Did Lord Ha Baek really buy it
with money he made from working?

565
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:48,833
Yes.

566
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:58,533
Nam Soo… Nam Soo Ri!

567
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,134
Why is he like that?

568
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,566
He's probably just sleepy.

569
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:09,566
Eat this before you sleep. She
said it's not good when it's cold.

570
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:18,833
Where are you going?

571
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,666
What is wrong?

572
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:33,333
I think he's suffering from
the heat.

573
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,166
Would you rather go sea-bathing
than take a bath?

574
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,434
You don't turn into a merman
if you go into the sea do you?

575
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,233
Sea?

576
00:55:57,466 --> 00:56:00,967
Search for picnic basket online
and you'll see what to prepare.

577
00:56:01,033 --> 00:56:02,967
- Me?
- You don't want to?

578
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:05,166
Then I'll just bring that leftover
kimchi fried rice with us.

579
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,600
Picnic basket.

580
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:19,100
What do we need to buy?

581
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,934
Avocado, salmon, abalone, eel,
pine, and domestic Korean beef.

582
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,734
What the heck?

583
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,400
Why?

584
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,533
Why?

585
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,200
You said that it was a picnic basket.

586
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,666
Isn't kimbap picnic food?

587
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:40,033
What?

588
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,033
Why are you sulking?

589
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,533
That guy.

590
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,600
Once it goes into your mouth
it bursts apart anyways.

591
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:33,333
Who is it?

592
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:37,800
It's me. I'm going to go eat lunch
with Bi Ryeom. Come with us.

593
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:38,800
I am busy.

594
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:41,234
I saw you get wrecked yesterday.

595
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,100
I don't think I should let you
be alone.

596
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,667
I have to stay and watch Bi Ryeom,
so you should come live here.

597
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:50,267
- I'm going to go sea bathing
- What? You're doing what?

598
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm making kimbap. I'll try it
first and take you if it's good.

599
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:55,667
Don't put in the kimbaps with
the sides bursting out!

600
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:56,766
I'm hanging up.

601
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:00,200
Why is it so undignified?

602
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:08,566
Kimbap with
the sides bursting out?

603
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:14,734
Is he not coming with us?

604
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,766
What does it mean to pack
kimbap and go sea bathing?

605
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,833
What?

606
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:29,533
That guy is making me like
him more and more.

607
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:32,833
I'm going to change my clothes.
Let's go boxing.

608
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,934
Unbelievable. Kimbap?

609
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,333
Has he actually gone mad?

610
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:54,034
Why are you here alone?
Did you get rejected too?

611
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,467
Were you rejected too?

612
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,666
Does that woman get scared
easily like that too?

613
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,433
I haven't seen this one.

614
00:59:43,266 --> 00:59:44,766
If it's at all possible,

615
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:49,666
I madly,

616
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:57,000
want to live with that woman.

617
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,066
Here, just like this.

618
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:13,766
Ha Baek!

619
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:23,366
Where did she go?

620
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,500
The customer cannot answer
their phone at the moment.

621
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,200
- Not answering?
- Yes.

622
01:00:50,633 --> 01:00:51,466
He must be here.

623
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,166
Nam Soo Ri,
let's go to the beach...

624
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,233
What are you doing here?

625
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:08,400
How did an insignificant human
like you get this kind of honor?

626
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:13,434
If you knew that it was because of
your ancestor's wicked behavior,

627
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,100
what are you doing?

628
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:16,734
I'd like to see if you can stay by
his side then.

629
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,900
Moo Ra!

630
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:22,266
Should I tell you now why your
ancestor became a god's servant?

631
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:24,166
Stop it.

632
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,666
Moo Ra! Moo Ra!

633
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,066
(The Bride of Habaek)

634
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:02,700
Persuade him
using any means necessary.

635
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:04,134
I heard you didn't do
anything about it.

636
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,867
If Ha Baek isn't king,
he's nothing.

637
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,200
The words I really want to say…

638
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,934
Please.
Don't become a trap for him.

639
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,334
Why did I say that I could
protect you?

640
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,767
I had to confirm that
he loves her.

641
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:18,400
Why did I make promises I can't
keep? Is it alright if I leave?

642
01:02:18,466 --> 01:02:20,967
I realized that with everything
you have, you want me to leave.

643
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:23,700
Go back
to the place you need to be.

644
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:26,200
Let's part ways here.

645
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:28,166
Bye. Go safely.
