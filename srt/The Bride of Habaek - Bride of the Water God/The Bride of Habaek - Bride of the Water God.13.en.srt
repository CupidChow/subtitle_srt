(The Bride of Habaek)

7
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:38,966
Miss Yoon So-ah?
So-ah, is something wrong?

8
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,400
Didn't I tell you not to be
out late?

9
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:08,233
You really don't listen.

10
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,967
You've lost weight from your face,

11
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:50,367
and your eyes are sunken in. And
what are these under your eyes?

12
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,366
Are those what you call
dark circles?

13
00:02:53,766 --> 00:03:00,366
Good. If you had resembled spring
freesias, I would've gone back.

14
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,900
I warned you, didn't I?

15
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:13,934
That if you fall for me

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,166
there isn't even a remedy for it.

17
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,333
Let's go home.

18
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,700
(The Bride of Habaek)

19
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:53,800
(Episode 13)

20
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,666
Descendant.

21
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,567
What happened?

22
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,634
He's been given a new assignment.
He can come for an assignment.

23
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,266
An assignment?

24
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,634
What kind of assignment?

25
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,467
He has to find the meaning of
something. That's going to be

26
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,334
tough, since he'll have to come to
a realization about something.

27
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,000
There are assignments like that?

28
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:25,834
So stubborn, he is. The most
stubborn person you'll ever find.

29
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,666
By the time we returned,
the red water had come four times.

30
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:34,366
Good thing Lord Ha Baek was
still suffering from jet lag.

31
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,400
Jet... jet lag?

32
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:40,867
Yes. The things he saw here are
different from the Water Kingdom.

33
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,267
Oh, that kind of jet lag.

34
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,067
Lord Ha Baek usually just gets
a bit more fussy,

35
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,400
but he didn't say a word the
entire time, like he was angry.

36
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:54,366
He was in low spirits.
Then, one day, he became stubborn.

37
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,400
Lord Ha Baek.

38
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,434
The High Priest left for Heaven.
But he left a message.

39
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:07,834
What is it?

40
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,934
When the High Priest asked you to
find the reason for leaving

41
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,567
the divine stones in the human
realm, that wasn't your task.

42
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,734
That old man, he's going to
continue being obstinate like this?

43
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Back then, he clearly said it
in a meaningful way.

44
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,534
He said he remembers
your answer was "It's tiresome."

45
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,067
That's true.
However, he repeated that

46
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,600
since I asked the question,
I need to find the answer.

47
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,967
It's not a question.

48
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,034
He remembered you saying that.

49
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,933
It is a question.

50
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,367
Also, if the next emperor says
it is so, then it is so.

51
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:47,067
Why is he continuing to be
so obstinate?

52
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,400
Good job.

53
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,633
Seriously, our Lord Ha Baek says
he will go find the answer.

54
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,333
Have you ever seen him
voluntarily go look for something?

55
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,234
So that's what happened. The High
Priest barely managed to secure

56
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,000
the Lord Energy of the Universe's
permission, and sent us here.

57
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,400
I wonder what he's looking for.

58
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,366
Yong Yong is here.

59
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,134
Oh, that's…

60
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't know you're the type of
woman to empathize with a doll.

61
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,166
No, it's not like that…
that is just...

62
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,967
You punished it because you were
upset, or you abused it.

63
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,866
And every night,
you were lonely, so...

64
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,333
you didn't do anything
weird to it, did you?

65
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,733
Gosh, what are you saying?
Ridiculous.

66
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,567
There's been a shorter way this
whole time, yet you've been taking

67
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:10,300
the longer way until now?

68
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,200
Not a single thing has changed.

69
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,333
Didn't I tell you to
clean up regularly?

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,534
I told you it's harder if you
put it off. I also told you to

71
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,867
replace the lamp light bulb,
and to not skip meals.

72
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,333
And to cancel
the cell phone contract.

73
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,266
You haven't done a single thing
I've told you to do.

74
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,233
What have you been doing
until now?

75
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
What is it that
you said you are looking for?

76
00:08:58,366 --> 00:08:59,934
Is there such a thing?

77
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,434
Nam Soo Ri said that you've been
assigned a new task.

78
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,733
You need to find the reason for
leaving the divine stones here.

79
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,900
I don't know, whatever that is.

80
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:21,266
I came because I thought that
you wouldn't be doing well.

81
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,400
I...

82
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,933
must go back.

83
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Returning is still my path
to take.

84
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:45,033
I came to say goodbye properly.

85
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,800
Properly.

86
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,400
Because I wanted to
love without regret.

87
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,567
I wanted to love to a degree

88
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:01,300
that I could come to
accept parting afterwards.

89
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,600
If you aren't ready yet,

90
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:15,800
if you do not agree,

91
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,033
I will go back.

92
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,700
To have a proper farewell,

93
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,000
we should love properly.

94
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,400
Although those words
don't make any sense,

95
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,866
they sound so wonderful…

96
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,666
Come to think of it,

97
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:02,866
I think I had been too heartless
towards my life.

98
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,633
When I don't love myself,

99
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,066
who will love me?

100
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,933
I must have been pitiful.

101
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,700
This fortune has found me.

102
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,233
It's because you have
lived your life with kindness.

103
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,866
- I am not kind.
- You're kind.

104
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,233
Sure then.

105
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,100
It's very hard to live
with kindness in today's world.

106
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,400
Is the lesson that if you're kind,
you meet a nice guy in return?

107
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,600
Those fairy tales don't even sell
these days.

108
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:58,367
Am I just a nice guy? I am a god.

109
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:03,367
Then, I guess it's a lesson about
meeting a god if you're kind.

110
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:06,700
- Don't you think that's lacking?
- Then…

111
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,000
what else is there to know?

112
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,233
Something like this.

113
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,334
Whatever it is, just
make her forget about Ha Baek.

114
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
That's not something
you can just do.

115
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,500
Try. I know you wanted to.

116
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,166
That's not something

117
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,900
you can just do.

118
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh, descendant.

119
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,534
Why are you coming out from that room?

120
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,234
What?

121
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,134
Oh. It's just…
I was looking for something.

122
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,766
Are you looking for something?

123
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,400
No.

124
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:48,567
- What were you looking for?
- I'm not looking for anything.

125
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,766
Are you looking for me?

126
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,434
I have a part time job
starting today. I called

127
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,300
the owner of the duck boat shop.
He wants me to come today.

128
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:13,866
He was really disappointed when
I told him you can't work anymore.

129
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:15,600
Aren't you leaving for work?

130
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:21,067
No, my clinic is temporarily closed.

131
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,300
What? Why?

132
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:27,434
Something came up.
But it's better this way.

133
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,600
I am living with a omnipotent god.
Why should I work?

134
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,333
Let me benefit from
his great divine powers.

135
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,333
- He doesn't have them.
- What?

136
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,800
- The divine powers.
- What?

137
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:47,767
Still? You said they'd be
restored in the gods' realm.

138
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,667
- I recovered them.
- Then what?

139
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,266
He left them behind.

140
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,767
Leave what behind? Leave
the divine powers behind?

141
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:01,700
If you insist on returning he said
to return in the state you came.

142
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,767
Oh, why? Why must he?

143
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,400
He said it's fair that way.

144
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,133
Fair?

145
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,867
This fairness is for whom?

146
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,700
- No more negotiations. It's just…
- What?

147
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,300
As you won't be able to complete
the task, he will plan ahead.

148
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,634
We can't have you miss coronation
because you can't come back.

149
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,667
Plan ahead?

150
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,667
He will allow a one-time use of
divine powers.

151
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,100
With that, you'll be able open
the Divine Gate to return.

152
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,500
He will send the messenger when
the sixth red water arrives.

153
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:32,600
- Pardon?
- Forget it if you don't want it.

154
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,833
Is what he said.

155
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,200
That's what happened.

156
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,866
It's not like the divine powers
are like lunch to be left behind.

157
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,734
But why did those powers disappear
in the first place?

158
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,634
I asked a few times, but
that old man only kept laughing.

159
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,734
He just evaded the subject,
saying those things can happen.

160
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,034
Then, are you saying
you came empty-handed?

161
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,500
Nope, he came with hunger.

162
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:03,634
Don't worry. My Water Kingdom is
not such a heartless place.

163
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,367
I brought the thing that I need
most here, apart from my powers.

164
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:11,834
Really? What is it? Is it like
a goblin's club or something?

165
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,000
Is it something that you can
pull gold or silver out of?

166
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:18,400
It's something much grander
than that.

167
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,700
Nam Soo Ri!

168
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:28,866
(Identification Card/
Driver's License)

169
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,867
What is that?

170
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,934
Are those driver's licenses?

171
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
Mine's an ID.

172
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,267
From now on, leave driving to me.

173
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,100
From now on, leave working to me!

174
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,833
- What is it?
- Pick up the phone.

175
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:36,934
Stop harassing manager Kim.
Don't you pity him a little?

176
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,467
In this human's life,
he is his own hero.

177
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:44,934
And in manager Kim's life,

178
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,166
you're a supporting character.
The antagonist.

179
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:52,134
Oh, and don't say that
he makes a living thanks to you.

180
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,066
Thanks to his work,
you're able to relax like this.

181
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,800
You are compensating for
each other's shortcomings.

182
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:05,267
- Did you eat something wrong?
- No, I saw something wrong.

183
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,600
Yesterday, on TV, some humans were
talking about things like that.

184
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,966
Hurry, pick it up.

185
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,133
What?

186
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,234
What is it, Manager Kim?

187
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,634
Please, tell Mr. Bi Ryeom that
I'm very thankful.

188
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,600
Mr. Bi Ryeom, thank you so much!

189
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:35,267
The director said he'll wait until
you're ready for the kiss scene.

190
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:39,700
That Bi Ryeom..
that Mr. Bi Ryeom.. tell him

191
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:43,400
Hello? Why did she hang up on me
when I wasn't done?

192
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,300
Let's eat lunch. I made
a reservation at a new restaurant.

193
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:50,200
Life is about eating and
drinking properly.

194
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,400
If you continue like that, you'll
end up living here forever.

195
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:56,334
Yesterday, the TV humans said "You
don't exist for someone else."

196
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,134
False. I can say with confidence
that I exist for you.

197
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Really? But you go for 10 years
digging up archaeological sites?

198
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:07,167
I visited you once in awhile
to put on a cute show.

199
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,866
Did you hate it that much
that I was gone?

200
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:15,666
No! Do you think
that could be possible?

201
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:22,066
Its so peaceful without Ha Baek.
We should've sent him sooner.

202
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,800
You're pretty as you are, so just
change your clothes and come out.

203
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:26,134
Goodbye, my drunk love.

204
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,700
Don't come again.

205
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,300
Don't ask the forest the way.

206
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:36,266
Don't talk to the wind, either.

207
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,167
I will only remember you

208
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,933
the one who was my everything.

209
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,833
Why do you come in
without knocking?

210
00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:55,100
That will turn into a trauma.
What shall we do?

211
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,834
What trauma?

212
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,033
I am Moo Ra, the number one
goddess of the Water Kingdom.

213
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,700
This won't do.

214
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:06,133
I will set this straight
once and for all.

215
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:43,034
It's this feeling.

216
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,434
Treasure this feeling.

217
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,234
Then you will be able to
free yourself from the quagmire.

218
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,166
Hey!

219
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
Why?

220
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:57,766
You seem to keep forgetting
but I am your betrothed.

221
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:12,266
If you mention that you're
my betrothed one more time…

222
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,334
What are you saying?

223
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,367
You begged me to become betrothed
to you. Did you change your mind?

224
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:23,867
When did I?

225
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:26,834
You asked me to tell Ha Baek
that we are betrothed. You were

226
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,400
jealous of that woman who offered
300 sacks of rice to Buddha.

227
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:34,867
You told Ha Baek, do you not
remember that he congratulated us?

228
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:38,100
That time, because I was doing
what you asked me to do,

229
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,967
I even dumped my girl.

230
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:43,500
That goddess was
Heaven's number one beauty.

231
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,134
That...

232
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,767
You didn't care much for
that girl anyway.

233
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,534
You're a famous player up there!

234
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
Why are you like this?

235
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:57,300
Even for a player, there can be
a little innocent love.

236
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,934
Let go. Why aren't you letting go?

237
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,933
Since Ha Baek isn't here,
we're so peaceful.

238
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:13,933
Why do you keep pretending to
not know my feelings for you?

239
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,667
It's tiring to pretend for
such a long time,

240
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,800
and it's hard to accept it for
such a long time,

241
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:26,933
but we did that.

242
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,333
Let's go eat.

243
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:43,300
Stop hitting me, it hurts.

244
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:46,100
Don't talk to me anymore.

245
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,634
Did I do that again?

246
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,867
You were in an even worse state
than the last time.

247
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm sorry for bothering you.

248
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,200
Is it because of that girl?

249
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,667
I don't know why I keep contacting
you, when I have Secretary Min.

250
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:29,600
It won't happen again.

251
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,534
When the king of the Heaven
asked me to take you away from

252
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,400
your mother when you hadn't even
weaned, I didn't want to do it.

253
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:47,567
It was the same thing when they
asked me to trap you in that cave.

254
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:52,100
However, there was nothing
a measly minor god could do.

255
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,534
I told myself to just forget
about it, but I couldn't do it.

256
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,967
As a human,
you were so small and pitiful.

257
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:02,967
I hoped you would stop breathing
on your own.

258
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:06,334
I then realized you are a creature
fated to die, but won't die.

259
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,500
So you'd be alone forever.

260
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:13,400
You'd be
lonely in this cave forever.

261
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,567
I was scared, and miserable.

262
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:20,467
I wanted to leave you and
I wanted to save you.

263
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:25,800
I tried not to grow attached
to you.

264
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:29,800
When I visited you and told you
the news from the gods' realm,

265
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:33,167
it wasn't for you, but for me.

266
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:37,400
Coming here was also to avoid you.

267
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:41,334
But it didn't work out.

268
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:48,166
That entire cave had taken over
me. And you were still inside.

269
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,200
I also have my own secret that
I could show you.

270
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:03,234
In the human world, looks are
important even as a beggar,

271
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,334
so I had no choice but to wear
this, but it's very uncomfortable.

272
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,600
You look a lot better.

273
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,133
Could I give you
one piece of advice?

274
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,500
Confess to that woman.

275
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:18,900
Tell her who you really are.

276
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:23,200
That's how everything starts.

277
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:29,333
If it doesn't work out even after
you show her everything,

278
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:33,666
then it isn't fated for
you two to be together.

279
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,134
No, but wait.
Why is a car so important?

280
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,500
How can that be?

281
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,534
Do you know what I had to do
to obtain this?

282
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,667
Exactly. So why bring that? You
should've brought a goblin's club.

283
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:59,833
I wanted to speed legally
like you said.

284
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:05,600
Let's speed. Starting tomorrow,
we'll run along the Han River.

285
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:12,933
How can a man love
without a car?

286
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,800
What did you say?

287
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,066
What is he?

288
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:24,200
Where did you learn such
twisted values?

289
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,200
What happened?

290
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,500
I have been assigned a new task.

291
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,100
How could that be?

292
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:38,966
That kind of thing has been made,
so use it to your needs later on.

293
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,800
You really...

294
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,733
Did you have to go this far?

295
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,800
Aren't you being too much
to Moo Ra?

296
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,434
I know
what Moo Ra is worried about.

297
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
If you know,

298
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:09,134
can't you at least pretend to
listen to her worries?

299
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,700
There are things that can be done,
and there are things that can't.

300
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:16,334
You're not going to not go back,
right? Then what will happen?

301
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,567
You know best what will happen
if you don't.

302
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,800
I will go back.

303
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,833
Why can't it be

304
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,534
Moo Ra for you?

305
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,967
Don't insult Moo Ra.

306
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:31,767
I know you're not asking
that sincerely.

307
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:35,100
Instead of testing me,
why don't you become braver?

308
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,734
I wish hatred and resentment were
allowed in the gods' realm,

309
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,700
like the human realm.
So I could hate you freely.

310
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:42,067
When I become King,
I'll think about it.

311
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:47,033
I look forward to it.
And let's meet as enemies.

312
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,334
Are you okay?

313
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,800
You're only book smart.

314
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,067
Ah, I'm not on your side.

315
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm definitely not on
Ha Baek's side either.

316
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:17,866
When Moo Ra wants something
to be done, then I'll do it.

317
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,267
It was me that made
your family like that.

318
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:25,800
Moo Ra was so mad because of
your ancestor, that girl,

319
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:29,034
- I took it out on them for her.
- What?

320
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,067
You should hope Moo Ra doesn't
get as mad as she did that time.

321
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:36,866
It's much easier to do things in
the human world, than up there.

322
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:53,867
What did you talk about for
so long with a nobody?

323
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:54,833
Did you order?

324
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,267
I asked for the black water.

325
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,300
They understood you?

326
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:02,634
They didn't look as if they had
a hard time understanding.

327
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,300
Did you come here for this?

328
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,900
I can't say it wasn't for this.

329
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,600
So, is he giving you a car?

330
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:10,600
He said it's gone.

331
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:14,700
-That's good.
- I asked him to buy me a new car.

332
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,067
I asked for one so
I could drive immediately today.

333
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,667
What did you say?

334
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:21,600
So? What did he say?

335
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:25,033
- He said he can't.
- Of course.

336
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,934
I'm shocked you can't buy a car
right away like buying clothes.

337
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Did you turn into a fool
on your return?

338
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,333
So I asked them to make it
using the divine powers.

339
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:41,700
What kind of
childish complaint is that? And?

340
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:43,267
He said he can't.

341
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:47,666
Instead, he said he'll go to
a car dealership where he's a VIP.

342
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,133
What the...?

343
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,267
She's Ha Baek's woman.

344
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:59,766
I was one step too late.

345
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
He's the king.

346
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:09,000
The position I was born doesn't
change no matter how I try.

347
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:15,266
I can't help but feel
I'm getting smaller.

348
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:19,667
Thinking that he went back,

349
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:24,666
I got confident.

350
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:32,267
Since his limitations and mine
are different.

351
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,867
What a relief it is.

352
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:36,766
But...

353
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,800
he came back.

354
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,933
Joo Geol Rin?

355
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:23,700
- What are you trying to do?
- So I can lift your curse.

356
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:26,167
Then you should've said that. Why
would you scream and run to me?

357
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:29,000
Sorry.

358
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,067
Come here.
Release the curse and leave.

359
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:44,066
So you still don't have
your powers?

360
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,866
Then, I'm coming.

361
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,766
No!

362
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:27,734
Yes, no I can't do this
when I'm sober.

363
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,400
I'm used to the hunger and
living this way, so just leave.

364
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:33,600
- Okay.
- And you.

365
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:38,333
Later, later, later,
I will surely deal with you.

366
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:48,366
Yes.

367
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:55,100
He got the car.

368
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,300
What does it mean, to give
the "Shrek" cat eyes?

369
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,767
He gave the "Shrek" cat eyes and
a killer smile to the lady

370
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:04,033
who was to buy the car and
she cancelled the sale.

371
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:40,767
Jin Geon,
find out where Moo Ra is.

372
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:44,134
He lost his powers?

373
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,567
Yes, it was like that since
he came here.

374
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:52,467
There wasn't a reason to tell you,
so I kept quiet.

375
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:55,000
How did he lose his powers?

376
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:58,234
I know, right?
But this is what I think.

377
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,567
I think it's something he has to
go through because he's a king.

378
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:04,934
We have no way of knowing
the things the kings-to-be

379
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,033
experience when they come here
to find the stones.

380
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:14,034
So, what are you trying to say?

381
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,967
This is the human world,
it isn't the gods' realm.

382
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:20,934
Think! Between you and a god
who has lost his powers,

383
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,166
who has more?
Who can overpower the other?

384
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,266
Seriously...

385
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:38,833
Joo Geo Rin?

386
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,400
Lady Moo Ra, we meet here.

387
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,600
Why are you here?

388
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,833
Then...

389
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,066
Do you know each other?

390
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,866
What is it?

391
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:12,333
No, why is Goddess Moo Ra...

392
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,866
Lord Bi Ryeom?

393
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:21,100
Ha Baek has come back.

394
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,967
I know.

395
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:26,733
You know? How do you know?

396
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:33,333
It seems like you have witnessed
the scene in person.

397
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,567
How was it? Were they lovey-dovey?

398
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:43,733
No, that's not important.

399
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,200
Listen well.

400
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:51,300
It's a war from now on,
and I'm on your side.

401
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:54,300
- My side?
- Yes, your side.

402
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:57,300
The best goddess of
the Water Kingdom has your back.

403
00:38:57,366 --> 00:39:01,267
If you can't win this woman's
heart, take her by force.

404
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:05,300
Using whatever means,
quarantine her from Ha Baek.

405
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,133
Take her by force.

406
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,167
That's a dangerous statement.
Also, is So-ah a patient with

407
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:20,134
some kind of contagious disease?
What do you mean quarantine?

408
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,067
Ha Baek isn't an easy opponent,
but I'll help you.

409
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:30,033
I heard he lost his powers.
Your king.

410
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:33,100
What? What are you saying?

411
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:36,634
He's an ordinary man
who's lost his powers.

412
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,367
So, am I not
the more powerful one here?

413
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:41,234
What did you say?

414
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,100
I don't need your help.
Just stay neutral.

415
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:50,200
If you guys use your powers to
help the man who has lost his,

416
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:55,834
I have no choice but to use mine.
But let's not take it that far.

417
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,334
I really don't like using

418
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,066
my powers in the human world.

419
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,734
What are you doing here?

420
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,400
Let's go.

421
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:31,334
How dare you use
your filthy hands?

422
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,133
Hey!

423
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm staying still because she's
making such a fuss. Stay away.

424
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:43,400
If you don't attract attention to
yourself, I won't touch you.

425
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,266
You, seriously.

426
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:02,366
Come.

427
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,300
You better let go.

428
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:13,800
CEO Sin and I just had a talk.
He was only steadying me

429
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:15,700
because I was about to fall.
Why do you act like this?

430
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:18,867
Don't talk with that idiot.
He is not one of us.

431
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:21,067
It's true that he's different
from us.

432
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,934
Like you said, he's a half-breed.

433
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,134
You can look down on him,
scorn him, or hate him.

434
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,033
You could just treat him like
a lowly human being.

435
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:34,934
Are you like this because
you're scared? The god of Death?

436
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,900
No such thing. The stories we
heard as kids are just myths.

437
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,334
Fine, I understand your fear.
No matter what you say,

438
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,767
you're immature. However,
I don't understand your fury.

439
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:55,534
There are other reasons, but
before you tell me truthfully

440
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,900
I can't accept your behavior.

441
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,400
What is it?

442
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:06,133
What is it?

443
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,934
I asked what it is!

444
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,900
I can't tell you,
because you're you.

445
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,900
Because the person requesting
an explanation is you.

446
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:19,334
I'm saying I can't tell you,
because it's you.

447
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,133
What? What are you saying?
What is it?

448
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:28,834
Do you have to drag that bastard
into this?

449
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,867
Do you have to solve
Ha Baek's situation like this?

450
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,334
Then I'll seduce So-ah for you.

451
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,966
I can do it.
I can make her go crazy for me.

452
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:44,333
That's my specialty.

453
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,133
You really are low. You force me
to hit you in the end.

454
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:22,866
Jin Geon. Jin Geon!

455
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,700
Tell me why Bi Ryeom is like that.
Tell me what you know, Jin Geon.

456
00:43:36,766 --> 00:43:40,866
If you don't tell me, I'll really
freeze your tongue and crush it.

457
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,400
Tell me why he is going crazy
like that!

458
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:46,400
It's because of me.

459
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,834
- What?
- I can't tell you anything more.

460
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,900
You can do whatever you want
with my tongue.

461
00:43:58,066 --> 00:43:59,300
Slow down.

462
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:02,100
I read online that you have to get
a new car acclimated to the road.

463
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:05,100
That you need to drive it on this
thing called a highway. Shall we?

464
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,434
No, slow down.

465
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,700
I have a license now,
so it's okay to speed.

466
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:11,100
What did you say?

467
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:14,467
A driver's license isn't
a license for you to speed.

468
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,334
It isn't? Then what is it for?

469
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,534
It's a license that says
you can drive.

470
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,400
I know, I was joking.

471
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:25,266
Why do you joke like a fool?

472
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,733
Why are you so obsessed
with the license?

473
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:33,134
You said I have to have a license
for you to be reassured.

474
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,233
I'm okay without one,
but you feel uneasy.

475
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,000
Are you pissed?

476
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:08,767
Hey, today's not the only day.

477
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:13,600
You were really excited today

478
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:21,000
and I want to
look at your face calmly.

479
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:26,400
Is this reality or
is it a dream...

480
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:31,333
Is this reality or is it a dream...

481
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,233
Is this reality or is it a dream...

482
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,266
If it's a dream,
I don't want to wake up.

483
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,366
Reality.

484
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:00,933
It's true.

485
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,700
It's mediocre.

486
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,633
That's true.

487
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,134
Let's not do stuff
that's mediocre.

488
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,033
That would be nice.

489
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:51,334
Where are you going to go to
acclimate the car?

490
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,134
- Go see the sunset?
- A sunset?

491
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,034
Sunrise and sunset. People
purposely go out to see that.

492
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,600
What's the point? What's so
special about the sun rising?

493
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,634
Why climb the mountain when
you have to come down?

494
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,200
If you go to the ocean,
all you see is a lot of water.

495
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:15,567
I used to say that to the
high school students I tutored.

496
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:18,967
I said that to the editor at the
publishing company I worked at.

497
00:47:19,033 --> 00:47:23,634
Same to the manager of
the restaurant I worked at,

498
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,200
and to the manager of the
department store. To the owner of

499
00:47:27,266 --> 00:47:31,600
the convenience store where
I also worked. Ah, and... Anyway,

500
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:34,600
I went around telling this to
people here and there.

501
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,567
In the end, it's Vanuatu.
I'm doomed, aren't I?

502
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:41,067
Tell me all the places
you want to visit.

503
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:44,100
Places you want to visit, things
you want to do, everything.

504
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:47,034
Why? Are you going to do
everything for me?

505
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,133
- Of course.
- Wow.

506
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,500
But do you know?

507
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:55,066
You need money to do all of that.

508
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,400
I am unemployed and
you're unemployed too.

509
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:01,267
What money will we go around with?

510
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:05,400
That's why you should have brought
the goblin's club.

511
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,400
Don't call me.

512
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:30,666
You need to give me money, a lot.

513
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:54,134
That man was Nam Soo Ri.

514
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,666
So-ah didn't come with you?

515
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,200
What? Ah, no.

516
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:03,600
But why do you always go around
with So-ah?

517
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,667
When did I?

518
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:09,267
Why did you get rained on with
her? What was the meaning of that?

519
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:12,267
So, I thought the person with
those shoes were the Water Gho…

520
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:15,233
I thought it was Ha Baek,
but it was Nam Soo Ri.

521
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:20,300
Oh, it's not the shoes from
that time...

522
00:49:20,366 --> 00:49:23,167
Excuse me,
what are you talking about?

523
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:26,200
This... isn't a dream?

524
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:27,333
I don't think so.

525
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,500
What are you?

526
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:35,967
You're Nam Soo Ri.

527
00:49:36,033 --> 00:49:38,334
Why are you here...?

528
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,734
I heard you went back.

529
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,000
I went and came back again.

530
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:43,900
Came back again?

531
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:48,033
It's true.

532
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,033
How did this happen?

533
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:57,567
You go over there.

534
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:00,400
What? Okay.

535
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:08,867
What happened?

536
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:12,833
He came back,
because he wanted to see me.

537
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:19,734
Why did you
bring that weird woman?

538
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,067
Last time she told me
she'll give me a part-time job.

539
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:24,867
Since I now have an ID,
I went to ask about it.

540
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:26,234
- Part-time job?
- Yes.

541
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,300
She said I just need to
sit at her shop.

542
00:50:29,366 --> 00:50:32,066
I give her inspiration
or something?

543
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,067
- What?
- I open up her inspiration.

544
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:38,033
Her mystical powers come and go.

545
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:44,866
It is the same as you,
Lord Ha Baek.

546
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:51,167
She receives energy from me.
I avoided it last time because

547
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:56,033
I was a bit scared. But I thought
I might give it a try.

548
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Why would you do that?

549
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:05,267
All right, work hard.

550
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,933
I think I need a lot of money.

551
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,833
He came to break up?

552
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,300
So-ah.

553
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:25,400
I feel hollow.

554
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,634
Jo Yeom-mi.

555
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,900
Why isn't anything easy for you?

556
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,134
Yeom-mi.

557
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,234
I feel bad when I see you.

558
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,900
I, as the daughter of
a rich family,

559
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:46,267
I won't starve even if
I live doing whatever I want.

560
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:51,100
Life is beautiful even if
I do all crazy things as I please.

561
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,634
When I see you,
I feel bad sometimes.

562
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,000
Not often.

563
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:02,567
So I wish you could be happy.

564
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:07,100
Then I can feel less sorry and
do more stupid things.

565
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeom-mi…

566
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:12,666
So-ah...

567
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,700
They're truly strange women.

568
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:49,134
Yes?

569
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,834
Did you go somewhere?

570
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,100
Did that woman leave?

571
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,134
Yes.

572
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,400
I'm going to meet Moo Ra.

573
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,967
Ah, okay.

574
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:02,700
Then... do what you need to.

575
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,167
But, why?

576
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:05,234
I have something to tell her.

577
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,834
Ah, okay then.

578
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,134
What do you have to tell her?

579
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,034
Just something.

580
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,966
Okay. I'm hanging up.

581
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,833
But... Is it something important?

582
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,167
Hello?

583
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:24,100
What are you trying to do?

584
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:26,067
Is this jealousy, perhaps?

585
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:28,734
What? No, no, it isn't.

586
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,000
It sounds like jealousy.

587
00:53:30,066 --> 00:53:31,467
No, no.

588
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:33,867
I'm not that kind of woman,
who gets jealous of other women.

589
00:53:33,933 --> 00:53:36,167
I'm very reasonable.

590
00:53:36,233 --> 00:53:38,000
Really?

591
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:42,067
I'm a man who gets jealous of
male friends, so be warned.

592
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,666
I am not reasonable.

593
00:53:45,733 --> 00:53:48,333
Now that you mention it...

594
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:53,733
I guess I do have a jealous side.

595
00:53:53,966 --> 00:53:55,300
Can I hang up?

596
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:58,000
I have a part-time job, so
I'm going out. I'll see you later.

597
00:53:58,066 --> 00:53:59,300
Part-time job?

598
00:53:59,366 --> 00:54:02,367
I'm meeting a male friend.

599
00:54:02,433 --> 00:54:04,834
Hel...? What is she saying?

600
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,200
Why can I hear you and then
not hear you?

601
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:10,033
Jealousy.

602
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:12,767
Yes?

603
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,134
Doctor!

604
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,933
What?

605
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:21,567
Hey, hey what happened?

606
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,734
The building got sold?

607
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,700
The building owner suddenly sold
this building,

608
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:27,100
The new building owner said to
just leave the clinic here.

609
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,800
There has to be a clinic for
it to look good.

610
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:30,934
Really?

611
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,734
They even lowered the rent a lot.

612
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,134
They won't kick us out either.

613
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,800
Really?

614
00:54:38,866 --> 00:54:40,767
How can there be someone
like that?

615
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,134
Shouldn't we go greet them?

616
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,034
They said they will come once to
make the rounds.

617
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,400
Let's rest this week,
and open up next week.

618
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:49,700
Okay, okay.

619
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:52,534
With a heart to start afresh,
let's work hard!

620
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,900
Passionately!

621
00:54:53,966 --> 00:54:57,066
Okay, let's do well.

622
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:16,700
Tell me why Bi Ryeom is like that.

623
00:55:16,766 --> 00:55:19,434
Tell me why he is going crazy
like that!

624
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,666
It's because of me.

625
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:25,700
- What?
- I cannot tell you anything more.

626
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,100
What is going on?

627
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:35,100
The shoot with your stand-in is
over. You need to film

628
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,534
a night scene.
You need to get here now.

629
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,967
- There are things to prepare.
- Okay.

630
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:43,067
And the fans' presents. I'll give
them to you when you get here.

631
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:46,000
Presents?
I told you not to accept them.

632
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:49,800
But they forced them on me.
What can I do?

633
00:55:49,866 --> 00:55:50,533
Okay.

634
00:55:52,366 --> 00:55:55,900
She's so strange. What star
forbids presents from fans?

635
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:57,634
Why? I like Moo Ra.

636
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,633
Isn't she just going to throw them
out when we give them to her?

637
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,767
- Where are you right now?
- Why?

638
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:11,667
- Where were you last night?
- Tell me why you've called.

639
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:13,434
I have something to say.

640
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,634
Since I am leaving for a shoot, we could meet at Beriwon...

641
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,600
- Or rather, some other place
- I will be at Very One.

642
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,366
- Somewhere else.
- I'm on my way now.

643
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,567
- Are you done?
- Yes. Assistant Min

644
00:56:47,633 --> 00:56:52,266
- isn't here today.
- He's on a business trip.

645
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:58,334
The employees are saying it's
a great help to cope with stress.

646
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,167
I don't deserve the thanks.
I am doing this to repay my debt.

647
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:06,000
- You're in a good mood today.
- A miracle happened.

648
00:57:06,066 --> 00:57:09,767
My clinic... I can continue to
keep my clinic open.

649
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:14,134
The landlord changed and he's
lowered the deposit and the rent.

650
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,367
Really? He seems like someone
hard to come by these days.

651
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:23,733
I know. I should bring him
a watermelon to say thank you.

652
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,200
Today's dinner…
I guess you can't make it?

653
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:31,967
- Oh, today, I have...
- Of course you'd have plans.

654
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:35,634
- I am being serious.
- I didn't say it was an excuse.

655
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:41,400
I think tomorrow, the day after
tomorrow, the next day

656
00:57:41,466 --> 00:57:44,166
and the day after that too.
I don't think you'll be available

657
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
for a while. I will wait.

658
00:57:47,066 --> 00:57:51,866
You're good at enduring things,
right? I am good at waiting.

659
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:56,366
Let's go. I want to walk you out.

660
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:09,700
I'm sure your new landlord is
a really cool guy.

661
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:16,000
A gentleman, warm, classy,
pretty good-looking.

662
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:21,700
Everything makes sense, but
on what grounds do you say

663
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,334
he would be good-looking?
Isn't that a bias?

664
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,567
No grounds or bias.
I have mystical powers.

665
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:29,700
Pardon?

666
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,133
- It's really annoying.
- Pardon?

667
00:58:34,366 --> 00:58:38,100
Stay still.
It's making me feel ticklish.

668
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:46,600
- Thank you.
- I feel much better.

669
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,766
What are you doing here?

670
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,400
Oh, he's my friend.

671
00:59:00,766 --> 00:59:02,700
Why?

672
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:06,600
You're busy going from
here to there. Yoon So-ah.

673
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:11,867
I'm not trying to say things like,
"what about Ha Baek?"

674
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:18,600
It's annoying when our servant is
chatting with this bastard.

675
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:20,100
What are you doing now?

676
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:22,900
Do you know
what else I find annoying?

677
00:59:22,966 --> 00:59:26,867
I'm wondering if you're like this
after finding out about him.

678
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:31,800
Oh, by chance, is he your plan B?
A backup to Ha Baek?

679
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,300
You!
What exactly are you doing now?

680
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:37,800
Move away from him.
I can't stand to look at it.

681
00:59:39,433 --> 00:59:42,000
What are you doing now?

682
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,034
Why don't we set our powers aside
and really have a go?

683
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,234
What's your reason for being
like this?

684
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,134
My reason? Your damned existence
itself is the reason.

685
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,600
Unless I can accept the reason you
won't get what you want from me.

686
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:17,400
Common sense. Justice. Turning
what's abnormal to normal.

687
01:00:17,466 --> 01:00:22,534
I don't like that someone like you
continues to exist in the world.

688
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,434
I will continue living with
your dislike.

689
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,333
Do you think things will go
as you wish?

690
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:37,034
If I let you beat me up,
will you let me go?

691
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:42,267
No way. I'll even rewrite
the law of the gods realm that is

692
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,034
full of tolerance, and I will
make you pay for your sins.

693
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,833
I haven't sinned!

694
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:52,666
Right. That's it.

695
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:58,233
The fact that you are not aware of
your sins. That's the reason.

696
01:01:00,433 --> 01:01:06,934
Because of you, I don't like
myself. That's what's driving me

697
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,233
crazy. I already told you the last
reason. I just don't like you.

698
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:28,400
Jin Geon. If you try to interfere,
I won't let you get away with it.

699
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,100
I won't give you a single penny.
So get lost.

700
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,267
This is the king's order.

701
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:37,367
How funny. The king's order is to
rip someone off?

702
01:01:37,433 --> 01:01:40,734
I will punish you once I return to
the Water Kingdom.

703
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,334
Yeah. Before that, I will freeze
your tongue and crush it.

704
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,900
Since I am king, I can't beg.

705
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:53,400
Is that the only thing? You won't
be able to do anything here.

706
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,534
- Yes.
- Where are you?

707
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,767
Ahn Bin, Ahn Bin.

708
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:06,900
- What is it?
- Ahn Bin dragged CEO Sin away.

709
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:09,633
What do you mean? Speak slowly.

710
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,800
What's going on?

711
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,067
- Let's stop.
- No

712
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:54,167
Since we cannot die, let's take it
to the point just before dying.

713
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:57,767
You're wrong. Have you forgotten?

714
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:01,967
I can kill you guys.

715
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:05,333
Isn't that why you asked to
put our divine powers aside?

716
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:50,733
Jin Geon.
I told you not to interfere!

717
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,833
You are.

718
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:14,367
That's right.
Do you realize it now?

719
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:19,366
That face you killed.
What your sin is.

720
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,166
(The Bride of Habaek)

721
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:15,400
Why didn't you tell me about it
till now?

722
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:17,867
I shouldn't have gone there.
I regret it a thousand times.

723
01:05:17,933 --> 01:05:20,634
Lay it down. The thing that's
weighing on your mind.

724
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,700
- He's like you guys.
- He's not like us.

725
01:05:22,766 --> 01:05:25,534
Miss Yoon So-ah.
I think we've met before.

726
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,534
I'm a god who really gets jealous
over guy friends. Remember that.

727
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,667
It this being jealous too?

728
01:05:30,733 --> 01:05:33,067
Send her to CEO Sin.
It's better for her too.

729
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,600
- CEO Sin.
- By chance...

730
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,367
- Please look at me.
- Let go of me.
- Please stay still.

731
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,667
Are you with that bastard now?

732
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:38,900
Did something happen?

733
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:39,900
Come back right away.

734
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:41,467
Don't come close to me.

735
01:05:41,533 --> 01:05:43,300
Please!
