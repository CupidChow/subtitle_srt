00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,500
Father.

9
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,300
- Father...
- What is it?

10
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,967
Father! Father! Father!

11
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,367
Lord Bi Ryeom!
You can't harm a human.

12
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:11,533
A god's servant's an exception.
Grace, punishment, honor, pain.

13
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:27,400
It's up to the god. Ha Baek,
it's really your turn now.

14
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,133
You guys lost the divine stones,
didn't you?

15
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:57,233
The divine stones...
Why did you lose them?

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,066
- What are you...
- It was him, not me.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,767
Moo Ra,
how can you surrender so fast?!

18
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,266
He lost them and he's the one
who said we should delay you.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Did you really lose
the divine stones?

20
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:21,767
That's why you won't...
I mean, you can't give them?

21
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,067
I said that we should
just come clean.

22
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:28,900
But he said we shouldn't.
Saying you wouldn't let us off.

23
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,800
Oh, descendant.

24
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,033
Oh.

25
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,300
What is she? Is she leaving with
my car right now?

26
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,266
Ah, Yoon So-ah.

(Episode 6)

29
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,733
Did you two really lose
the the divine stones?

30
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:55,667
Yeah...
What happened is, Ha Baek...

31
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:59,266
Let's go. We'll talk tomorrow.

32
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,733
Let me tell you now. I don't
want to wait for my punishment.

33
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,100
- Give me the keys.
- I'm sure I'll be quicker.

34
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:14,467
Let's clear it up now. Let's
come up with a solution quick.

35
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,066
Bi Ryeom.

36
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,134
This is a real beating. Getting
hit for days by humans is nothing.

37
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,600
Hey, are you crazy?

38
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,066
I surrender.

39
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,666
He's crazy.

40
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,200
Why would you use violence?
What are you going to do now?

41
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:41,933
You have no divine powers.
What if that punk attacks you?

42
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,066
Are you okay?

43
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,400
His punch is as solid as always.

44
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,734
The phone has been turned off.
You will be transferred...

45
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,267
Yeom-mi.

46
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,966
to voicemail. After the beep
additional charges will incur.

47
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:27,133
What was Yoo Sang-yoo's number?

48
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,200
Ah, my cell phone...

49
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,800
That damned Ahn Bin punk.

50
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,766
How did Ha Baek find out?

51
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,933
I thought you gave him
the heads up.

52
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,933
I think I know now.

53
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,567
It was like this 2000 years ago.

54
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,867
- We got caught then, too...
- Wait...

55
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:24,134
We took Ha Baek's water fireflies
that Seo Hwang Mo gave him

56
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,266
and then lost them.

57
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,934
Give it to me.

58
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,334
Why do you only ask me?

59
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,900
Come to me after you take it
from Bi Ryeom.

60
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,534
- Give it to me.
- Moo Ra didn't give it to you.

61
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,966
Why should I give it to you?
Get it from Moo Ra first.

62
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,334
Give it to me.

63
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
I told you to come when
you take it from Bi Ryeom.

64
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,200
At that time,
he figured out that we'd lost them

65
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:52,567
and I got beaten up and
you almost got turned into a fish.

66
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:56,666
And you used the same plan?
Do you have a bird brain?

67
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:00,334
Yeah, I have a bird brain,
why are you surprised?

68
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,134
You spoke correctly.
You know, with your bird brain,

69
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
you should only concern yourself
with matters of

70
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:08,200
the Heaven Kingdom. Why did you
butt into the Water Kingdom?

71
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,934
A god's servant? Why does he need
something like that?

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,267
To cause chaos in the gods realm,

73
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,000
our god from Heaven Kingdom has
contributed to it.

74
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:19,134
As a god of the Heaven Kingdom,
I should smooth things over.

75
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,767
Smooth things over? Do you call
provoking the Seo Hwang Mo's anger

76
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,200
and harming a god's servant
smoothing things over?

77
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,667
You did it to torment Ha Baek,
just for the fun of it.

78
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:33,867
You're right. The dignified
Ha Baek didn't fall for my tricks

79
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:38,534
so I was disappointed. Ha Baek
didn't do anything at that time.

80
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,633
Would you have?

81
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,600
Why in the world did Ha Baek say
he'd listen to us tomorrow?

82
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,000
He seems to have
more important things to do.

83
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,366
What?

84
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:56,400
She's not coming. It wasn't right
for us to send her off on her own.

85
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,900
She must have been
really scared this time.

86
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,066
I'm here.

87
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,000
(Haesari)

88
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,866
How have you been?

89
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,266
She must be well. What worries
would you have there?

90
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:50,133
I'm sorry, Mom.

91
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,666
For not coming often.

92
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,633
(Grave of Gang Yoo-seon
RIP with no pain, I miss you.)

93
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,300
Mom, in our family history,

94
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:13,267
have you ever heard of being god's
servant or anything like that?

95
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,800
What in the world
did our ancestor do?

96
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,233
Was it your side of the family
or dad's?

97
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,966
Either way, one of you got conned
in this marriage.

98
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,266
Mom...

99
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:35,766
These days I'm experiencing
some ridiculous things

100
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,000
and I have no one around me
to talk it over with.

101
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:46,067
I only have Yeom-mi and Sang-yoo.

102
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,167
You know who Sang-yoo is, right?

103
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:53,000
You remember, the most cowardly of
the kids who stayed at our house.

104
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:57,067
Yeah, he's still clinging to me.

105
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,966
He's going to talk my ear off.
He's the king of nagging.

106
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Mom, do you know his phone number?

107
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,733
How about
my clinic's phone number?

108
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,866
I still haven't heard any news
about Dad.

109
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,400
People say he's missing,

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,433
but we know he's just
not coming back.

111
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:48,900
I am at loss for words.

112
00:11:54,133 --> 00:12:00,100
It's not that I miss him.
I just want to put an end to it.

113
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:08,100
If he wants to disappear,
he should at least explain first.

114
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:26,733
(Haesari)

115
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,234
Mom, don't tell me

116
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,834
you are going to show yourself

117
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,734
or something, like in the movies?

118
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,600
There's no need for you to show up.
I am leaving.

119
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,267
Goodbye, Mom.

120
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,600
I will come again.

121
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,366
Was everything alright?

122
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
What?

123
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,000
What sin
did my ancestor commit exactly?

124
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:10,200
What grave sin did I commit that
you play with my life and fate?

125
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:18,867
You know me, yes, me. Life is not
exactly fun or meaningful to me.

126
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,834
Because I never had a chance
to think about such things.

127
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,000
Future? Dream?

128
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,700
Yes, I guess I must have had
those at one point.

129
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:34,734
I'm paying for dreaming too big.

130
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,134
I got tired in the process.

131
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,333
But that doesn't mean I could die
a careless death.

132
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:44,866
You said you're a god.

133
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,700
Grant me one wish.

134
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,200
Let me meet my dad.

135
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:54,600
I want to ask him, why
he left all these burdens to me.

136
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:59,934
If he's doing just fine. For him
to take everything away now.

137
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,134
He can't save his own daughter
so how can he save the world?

138
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,866
If I could ask that one question,

139
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,766
I wouldn't have any other wish.

140
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,334
That's why I can't die.

141
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,333
I can't die before I meet my dad
to tell him all these things.

142
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,833
I promise you,

143
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll never again put you in danger
because of our issues.

144
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,266
I will protect you.

145
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,366
Since that's a god's duty.

146
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,100
I would like to retort that
I will protect my own body,

147
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,033
to be honest, you guys are

148
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:10,366
a bit overwhelming for
my abilities.

149
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,266
Okay, you should promise.

150
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,800
You must keep your promise.

151
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:22,200
I will.
It's a promise made by a god.

152
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,366
Deal?

153
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,400
Deal.

154
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,800
It's a promise.

155
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,133
Seal.

156
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,800
Copy.

157
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,866
What sin
did my ancestor commit exactly?

158
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:33,600
What grave sin did I commit that
you play with my life and fate?

159
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,334
If you could just spare my life,

160
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,700
I will dedicate my life to
all of the gods.

161
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,833
Will your life be enough?

162
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:50,866
For generations, your family must
dedicate their lives to the gods

163
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,767
Only one offspring will be
permitted per generation,

164
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,666
and once the child is born,
the spouse will always leave.

165
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:04,200
Joy from short-lasting love and
pain from long-lasting betrayal,

166
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:07,067
will be the outcome of
deceiving a god.

167
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:11,600
The children of your clan will
only exist for the gods,

168
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:16,933
and will pay for the crime of
deceiving a god. Do you promise?

169
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,867
I can't get used to this.

170
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,833
Oh, descendant.

171
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I better put up a partition soon.

172
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,266
Why?

173
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,000
Where,

174
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:30,267
Where can I meet the goddess?
I'd like to return the car to her.

175
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,534
- Why should I return my car?
- What?

176
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,567
I told her I will keep it.

177
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,933
I asked her to do this thing
called changing ownership.

178
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,467
You don't even have a license,
how ownership be changed?

179
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,600
That was her excuse too. So, I had
her to put it under your name.

180
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,900
- What?
- The car belongs to me.

181
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,734
Never,
if you don't have a license.

182
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,100
I am a god.
That's the law for humans.

183
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:58,100
Forget it, I am going to work.

184
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:10,800
For some reason, feels like I did
the work and she got the credit.

185
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,766
I didn't notice yesterday
but this car drives really well.

186
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:20,200
Look at this leather.
So luxurious.

187
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:25,833
This is my first time riding
such a car. I will just sell this.

188
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,067
How do you conduct yourself that

189
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:37,067
there are rumors that CEO Sin
is your sugar daddy?

190
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:40,300
It's so confusing. Grandfather.
Let's talk after I park.

191
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:43,700
It's so filthy that I can't stand
to listen to it.

192
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,834
What did
Department Chief Bang tell him?

193
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,600
Thank goodness it was revealed
that he's a relative. Otherwise...

194
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,334
Relative, my butt. Why's he a Sin?
He had no name or home before.

195
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,900
Just because you gave him
the name, doesn't make him a Sin.

196
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:02,267
You're being ridiculous. Are you
really not going to fire him?

197
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,600
Again! Again! Here you go again
saying useless things.

198
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:09,666
Behave yourself or I'll shave your
head and send you to a temple.

199
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,000
Really.

200
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,834
How are things progressing with
the Gangwon Province land?

201
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,334
No one's buying the land and
trying to sell for higher, right?

202
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,200
Yes, everything is going smoothly.

203
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:26,234
Since it is originally land that
wasn't selling before,

204
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,966
the owners were saying that
they wanted to sign right away...

205
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,100
But?

206
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,734
The landowner with
the land for road construction

207
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,734
is delaying the conclusion of
the contract for personal reasons.

208
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,100
You don't think they're trying to
pull a fast one on me, do you?

209
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:47,200
Writer Kim, I'm here now.

210
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,334
You told me that we needed
a garden,

211
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,300
a hotel suite,
and a restaurant, correct?

212
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:57,934
Sorry? You want to
interview CEO Sin as well?

213
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,267
Of course, that's possible.
Don't worry.

214
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,967
You should have told me sooner.

215
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:07,067
Well,
we should help each other out.

216
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,866
Yes, I will contact you again.
Yes.

217
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
If it wasn't time for
a new TV show line up.

218
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,866
What bast...

219
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Who's that?

220
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,100
Hey!

221
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
It's Assistant Min.

222
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,067
Who drives like that?

223
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:36,134
All I did was go around you because
you were blocking the lane.

224
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,900
Stop first then honk the horn.
Don't you know?

225
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:43,834
I went the quiet route because
I thought you'd throw a fit.

226
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,934
- Hey.
- It's Assistant Min.

227
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,834
And, if you came to see CEO Sin,
you're out of luck. He's out.

228
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,334
We decline the interview request
for "A Day as Opinion Leader."

229
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,333
We could provide places
for the shoot.

230
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:05,067
Ah, please return his handkerchief
as soon as possible.

231
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:09,633
Someone else's item shouldn't be
kept for so long.

232
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:21,234
How can there be such a guy?

233
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,800
After the leopard that was raised
in Changkyungwon died in 1973,

234
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:27,667
the last of the Korean leopard
bloodline disappeared.

235
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,600
In Gangwon Province,
the extinct Korean leopard...

236
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,066
Doctor!

237
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,900
Look for a place to sell
a used car.

238
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,334
What in the world happened?

239
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,134
Why are you making such a ruckus?

240
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
You went out
to meet CEO Sin yesterday.

241
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,567
What?

242
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:41,867
Oh!

243
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:45,767
You failed to show up with
no notice, and your phone was off.

244
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,800
I went to your house,
but you weren't there either.

245
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,300
I've had the news on all morning
in case you got into an accident

246
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:51,666
and have been anxiously watching.

247
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,066
I'm sorry.

248
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:56,734
I really thought
something happened.

249
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,134
How can I face the senior doctor?

250
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,934
If you'll keep being like this,
I'll move back to that area.

251
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Stop talking nonsense and
worry about yourself.

252
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:10,200
CEO Sin also made a ruckus,
calling a hundred times!

253
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,034
Yoon So-ah.

254
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,600
Oh, I'm sorry. Yesterday, I...

255
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:26,866
Doctor! CEO Sin...

256
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,366
...is here.

257
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:41,666
What brings you here?

258
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:47,066
I didn't know what was going on
and what to do so I came.

259
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,934
I'm sorry.
Something suddenly came up.

260
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,300
I should have notified you, but...

261
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:58,867
...My phone's broken, and I didn't
remember your number, and...

262
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,534
...I was far away and
I came back very late and?

263
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,934
Stop it. It's fine as long
as nothing happened to you.

264
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,033
That's enough.

265
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:20,066
About the contract,
please wait here a mom...

267
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,966
Yoon So-ah?

268
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,733
Yoon So-ah.

269
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:37,800
- Well...
- I got it.

270
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:41,067
Contact me when you're ready.

271
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,866
Then.

272
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:45,133
Let's meet in the evening.

273
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:48,966
Where will you be?
I'll come to you.

274
00:26:56,733 --> 00:27:00,266
This evening I'm planning on
being somewhere very private.

275
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,934
Ah, okay...

276
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,200
...then I'll contact you
as soon as possible.

277
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,266
Please do so.

278
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:27,666
That damned Ahn Bin.

279
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,600
I'll have to see
that bastard again.

280
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,167
Sorry.

281
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,267
Go ahead.

282
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:03,734
So, I didn't do anything wrong,
it's all his fault.

283
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,733
Moo Ra!

284
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:10,266
So, we once had a gathering
in the past.

285
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,100
But Bi Ryeom, that jerk,
kept provoking me into fighting.

286
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,200
I put up with it at first,
but this jerk constant...

287
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:20,134
Isn't it a bit much to call a
neighboring kingdom's god a jerk?

288
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,000
Be quiet.

289
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,200
Moo Ra threw the first water bomb.

290
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,033
That stings!

291
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:49,200
Hey! Let's talk it out, talk!

292
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,067
- Then.
- She attacked me like an enraged

293
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,533
leopard,
so I defended myself a little.

294
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,800
You defended yourself a little?

295
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,600
He threw a lightening bolt at me.

296
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,600
Joo Dong ran in to stop us.

297
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:08,800
In the midst of our battle,
the divine stones flew out.

298
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,700
We found two pretty quickly
but Moo Ra's flew pretty far.

299
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,934
Joo Dong went to find it but
he hasn't returned since.

300
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
- What?
- We waited, but he never

301
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:38,534
returned. Haven't seen him since.
I think his signal has stopped.

302
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,167
What are you saying now?

303
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:42,334
We tried everything to find them.

304
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,600
But idiot Bi Ryeom left for Rome
saying he loves archaeology.

305
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,533
I was going to continue looking
once I returned.

306
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,234
How was I supposed to know that
the water would turn red already?

307
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,234
Lies! He said he'd go for a year,
but he spent ten years traveling.

308
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,000
Moo Ra. Archaeology becomes more
interesting the deeper you go.

309
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:04,867
They say humans and chimpanzees
diverged from a common ancestor

310
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:08,134
6 million years ago. It's possible
that man originated before us.

311
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,600
See, how can I stop myself from
fighting when he's so ridiculous?

312
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,133
You two.

313
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,334
How can you be so irresponsible?

314
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,333
No, no.

315
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,700
Ha Baek. The essence of
the problem is this.

316
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:27,300
There'd be no problems if
you didn't lose the coordinates.

317
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:33,666
The coordinates would've shown you
the way no matter where we were.

318
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,767
I tried really hard to find them.

319
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,967
But I was also really busy.

320
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:50,767
I'm stressed because the rivers
in the south have become strange.

321
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:51,800
I got it.

322
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:55,867
You know Joo Dong always
stupidly focuses in on one thing.

323
00:30:55,933 --> 00:31:00,367
When he remembers something he
needs to do, he just disappears.

324
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:01,667
Why did you go there that day?

325
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,800
Joo Dong must have been
working around that area then.

326
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,733
But that day, he asked me to
come saying something was strange.

327
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,867
Strange?

328
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,366
What?

329
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,767
I don't know.

330
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:18,200
I got into a fight with
Bi Ryeom as soon as I got there.

331
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,700
Why did you fight?

332
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,700
You don't need to know.

333
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,166
Don't worry.

334
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,400
It will be a while before
the last red water arrives.

335
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,300
We'll be able to find them
before that.

336
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:48,767
I don't like it, but Bi Ryeom's on
good terms with the lowly gods.

337
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,200
He's probably working on things
on his end too.

338
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,866
You losing the coordinates is
not the problem.

339
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,600
Putting the divine stones in
the human world was the problem.

340
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,400
How is this connected to becoming
king in the realm of gods?

341
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,800
What is the connection between
becoming the Emperor and humans,

342
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:11,866
that the divine stones have to
remain in the human realm?

343
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:16,500
That's what I'm saying.

344
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,967
I have a shoot. I'm leaving first.

345
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:19,833
Okay.

346
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:21,433
Ha Baek.

347
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:26,800
I'm sorry.

348
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,766
Also...

349
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,533
I really dislike your clothes.

350
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,300
Exactly how many phones
do I have to buy?

351
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:09,267
Damned Ahn Bin's phone number...
I don't know it.

352
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,467
Ha Baek's phone number...
also don't know it.

353
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:16,766
No. My precious first contact
shouldn't be those guys.

354
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,266
Hello?

355
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,666
It's me.

356
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:25,734
What? Who?

357
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,934
Bring my car.
I have to go somewhere.

358
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,733
What?

359
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:43,733
That's why I asked for the keys.
You didn't have to come with me.

360
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:48,300
How do I get a license?

361
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:53,167
You need an ID, 3 photos taken in
the last 6 months, and you need to

362
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:57,200
take a written and driving test.
Why? Are you going to get one?

363
00:33:57,266 --> 00:34:00,066
It will be a bother but
I'll do it.

364
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,366
How will you get an ID?

365
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:06,433
ID?

366
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,033
You could buy it for me for
the time being and bill me later.

367
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:12,600
Whatever.

368
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,666
Why did we come here?

369
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,533
Here?

370
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,000
What a weird coincidence.

371
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,667
This land is a failure.
I lost my ring here too.

372
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,767
The jerk who stole it
should've gotten foot disease.

373
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,500
You should have been careful.

374
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:37,867
If there's a god, please curse
that man with athlete's foot on

375
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:40,867
every toe, and plenty of
fungus on his toenails.

376
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,366
None of the gods I know
do things like that.

377
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,400
Nam Soo Ri also couldn't find it.

378
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,700
Still, I wanted to look.

379
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:56,034
What do the coordinates look like?

380
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,900
There's no use.
Your eyes won't be able to see it.

381
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:01,600
You never know. A god servant's
eyes might be special.

382
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,634
You won't be able to understand,
even if I tell you.

383
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,500
You never know. A god servant's
ears might be special.

384
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,800
It's hard to explain it with
one word.

385
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:12,766
You never know. My ability to
understand might be special.

386
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,100
It has the properties of water
but the decisiveness of fire.

387
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:20,334
A dogged truth carved on
a hard and dry surface.

388
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,834
Every moment is at pause
and every moment is flowing,

389
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,300
a response that is finally whole.

390
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:30,967
If you see something like that,
quickly, in a hurry

391
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,200
pick it up fast.

392
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,133
I'll wait. Take your time looking.

393
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,966
That damned Ahn Bin bastard.

394
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,800
- Tell me Ahn Bin's phone number.
- Who?

395
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:39,734
Ahn... Oh, that...

396
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
The phone number of
that male god Bi Ryeom.

397
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,834
I told you not to associate
with him.

398
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,333
It's because I left something
in his car.

399
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:54,233
This person, seriously!

400
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,000
Fine, I won't bother you.

401
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,766
(The one who protects)

402
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,733
(Guardian)

403
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:49,400
(Water Ghost)

404
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,034
You're always sitting in
the bathtub, always reading

405
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,966
the paper, always sitting and
surfing the internet.

406
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:04,933
It's interesting to see him moving
around since he's always sitting.

407
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,100
But that day, he asked me to
come saying something was strange.

408
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,933
Something strange...

409
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,467
What is he doing?
Is he praying? Is he sleeping?

410
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,233
Is he showing off his jawline?

411
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,300
I promise you,

412
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:41,900
I'll never again put you in danger

413
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:44,100
because of our issues.

414
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,200
I will protect you.

415
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:53,200
Since that's a god's duty.

416
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:54,800
A god's

417
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:57,766
duty.

418
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,100
What are you taking a photo of?

419
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:10,467
J-just...

420
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:11,267
I was just taking...
Did you find it?

421
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,133
I couldn't find it.
As expected, I lost it on the street.

422
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:15,933
What is it?

423
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,234
Do you want to take a photo?

424
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,034
- Photo?
- A commemoratory photo.

425
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,233
This is where we both got ruined,
so we should commemorate it.

426
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:29,034
So you're a woman who
commemorates any random thing.

427
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,200
Think of it as an honor.

428
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,866
Then, okay.

429
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,266
- I don't see anything.
- Give it to me.

430
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,933
- You want the tree to be in it?
- Yes.

431
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:11,533
It's good.

432
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:23,666
One... Two...

433
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:25,833
Three...

434
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:28,266
Again.

435
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,033
Again. Again.

436
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:34,800
Again.

437
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,800
- Are you an idiot?
- I thought you're a god.

438
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:41,633
Again.

439
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:47,566
One... Two... Three!

440
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,100
Let's go. Let's go.

441
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,533
I'll send you the photo.

442
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:07,333
Show me the photos taken today.

443
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:09,833
You have 6 pictures.

444
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,766
Send it to the water ghost.

445
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:16,000
What?

446
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,366
Select your sharing method.

447
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:25,433
You're very obedient.

448
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:46,533
Does it all end when you find
the last god?

449
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:47,966
That's right.

450
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,266
Then... Are you going to go back?

451
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:52,733
I have to go.

452
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:56,033
So your promise of
protecting me is temporary.

453
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:57,366
What?

454
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,666
Never mind.

455
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:02,666
What if your divine powers don't
come back after you return?

456
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:06,566
That won't happen. Because
the Kingdom of Water is me.

457
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,766
Nature is bound to return
to nature.

458
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:12,366
But, it's really ridiculous.

459
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:15,633
They were giving you such
a hard time over lost stones.

460
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,400
Honestly, I thought there was
a bigger conspiracy.

461
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,000
- Conspiracy?
- Yes.

462
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:23,600
For example, something like
a fight for the throne.

463
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,400
I guess there's nothing like that
in the gods' realm.

464
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:29,500
No, as you're born to be king.
I heard humans pick their own?

465
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:31,866
There's no king here.

466
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:37,366
It's delegated by the citizens,
because they are busy.

467
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,134
- Delegated?
- Yes.

468
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,833
But the problem is that once
in power, they usually forget that.

469
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,866
So it's best to choose someone
with good memory.

470
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,466
Of course, it doesn't matter since
I'm leaving this country soon.

471
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,000
- Does it really not matter?
- What?

472
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,833
How would it be if I leave
the Water Kingdom for good?

473
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:05,233
How would it be if I can't
go back?

474
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:11,966
Will I think that
it wouldn't matter, like you do?

475
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:15,033
Of course, that wouldn't happen.

476
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,000
Because I can't imagine
the Water Kingdom without me.

477
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,400
What is this smell?

478
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,134
I drank with my boss.
There were barely any customers.

479
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,134
- I have to meet Ahn Bin.
- I have to go to my land. Go.

480
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,400
- What?
- There's something I gotta check.

481
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:49,700
My business is urgent too.

482
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:52,367
I told you there's no need to see
a guy like him, so go to my land.

483
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:53,834
I determine whether there's
a need or not.

484
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,333
There's something I have to
check today.

485
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:58,833
The gods are seriously...

486
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:00,700
Aren't you hungry?

487
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:13,534
- Hello?
- Are you closing down?

488
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,534
Yeom-mi!

489
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,334
Heard you went out in the morning
and haven't come back yet.

490
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,233
It's okay. She doesn't have any
patients to look after anyway.

491
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:23,667
- Even so.
- You brat! How could you do this?

492
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:28,100
Do you know what happened?
Do you care if I'm alive or not?

493
00:44:31,366 --> 00:44:33,334
You said you're my only friend.

494
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,867
Do you care if I get robbed,
get conned, or meet a water ghost?

495
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:40,866
You, you… Hello? What the?

496
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:43,566
Hello?

497
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:45,866
(Come to my store. There's someone
I want to introduce to you)

498
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:50,933
Robber, swindler,
and especially that water ghost...

499
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:53,433
You're not talking about me right?

500
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,834
- If you're done, go to the land.
- After we eat?

501
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,466
I'm going to my friend.

502
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,534
Why is Jude Law still stuck to
you like a piece of gum?

503
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,500
You shouldn't be saying that now.
Everything has a time and purpose.

504
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:21,900
Since you're curious,
this is the Water God Ha Baek,

505
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,700
and this is
his subordinate Nam Soo Ri.

506
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:26,666
Hello.

507
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:34,033
You're really mad, huh? I know
I stayed away for a bit this time.

508
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,666
There's a reason. I met
someone great at Mt. Gyeryeong. Taoist

509
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,467
- Dong Gak. He's like a god.
- Oh, really?

510
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:48,800
He received his ability
a while ago, but he's still great.

511
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:49,567
Of course.

512
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:52,634
He has to go back tomorrow,
so make sure to visit him today.

513
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,233
- Forget it. I'm busy.
- I'm telling you to listen to me!

514
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,300
The two of you wait there for
a moment.

515
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:03,866
For no reason...

516
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,267
This is
the friend I told you about.

517
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:15,200
She's been living a rough life,
even though she's young in age.

518
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,400
Ask where your father is. How
great will it be if I could see?

519
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:25,300
I see everyone else's. That's why
I went, thinking I was lacking.

520
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:31,333
You don't have luck in parents.

521
00:46:32,966 --> 00:46:34,433
I told you.

522
00:46:35,766 --> 00:46:37,566
Please take care of her.

523
00:46:47,566 --> 00:46:49,600
You don't look like someone
to work as a subordinate.

524
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:55,433
No luck with parents,
and none with men, either.

525
00:46:56,266 --> 00:47:00,700
Gosh... you are having a headache
due to land nowadays.

526
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:05,034
It's yours, but not. And can't be
someone else's. You can't sell it.

527
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,266
You're wrong.
I'm about to sell it.

528
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,167
What's the point if you have
unexpected luck coming your way?

529
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:14,300
Thought it was jackpot, but it's
not. Like spraying ashes all over

530
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:18,667
- perfectly cooked rice.
- W-why?

531
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:22,700
Someone tough is standing strong
and sticking to you.

532
00:47:22,766 --> 00:47:25,466
That's why even luck from heaven
is still evading you.

533
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:30,600
- Someone tough...?
- You have a god in your life.

534
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:36,033
A trash god. Kick him or the most
fertile land is like a wasteland.

535
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,933
He isn't a trash god.
He is a real god.

536
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,400
Would a trash god call himself a trash god?

537
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,600
Who is calling me a trash god?

538
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,900
Son of a dog bone?

539
00:47:54,966 --> 00:47:55,667
Wh-Why are you like this?

540
00:47:55,733 --> 00:48:02,666
Joo Geol Rin, how dare you?
You bastard!

541
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,767
Ha Baek, please spare me.

542
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:11,633
No, kill me. No, spare…

543
00:48:14,466 --> 00:48:16,033
You scared me,
you golden Mandarin fish!

544
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:19,066
Joo Geol Rin!

545
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:23,866
Catch him.

546
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:35,066
- Excuse me, let me...
- Ah yes.

547
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,033
No, not this.

548
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:42,733
This isn't right, you jerk.

549
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:21,900
- Where, where did he go?
- Over there.

550
00:49:21,966 --> 00:49:23,300
What happened?

551
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:24,233
It's a voracious god.

552
00:49:25,466 --> 00:49:26,700
Voracious god?

553
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:11,133
Aigoo, I escaped.

554
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:42,067
Stop right there!

555
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:58,167
Even though I'm not good enough...

556
00:50:58,233 --> 00:50:59,133
Ugh.

557
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:04,000
Hey, come here. Come here!

558
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:05,233
Ugh.

559
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,300
- What happened?!
- I thought He would soar to

560
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:20,700
- the sky, but  he sank!
- What is this...

561
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:46,200
Your food's here.

562
00:51:53,966 --> 00:51:55,200
Enjoy your meal.

563
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:58,434
He's gotten worse after
seeing Joo Geol Rin.

564
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:03,333
Looks like a severe self awareness
issue. It'll calm down soon.

565
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,734
- What were you going to do?
- Break the curse.

566
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,900
- You can break it?
- Of course, it's not hard.

567
00:52:17,966 --> 00:52:19,766
Nam Soo Ri.

568
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:21,600
How do you break it?

569
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,466
Ah, that...

570
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:31,766
Do you have to kiss him again?

571
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:38,633
What's wrong with that?
It would be a bit weird.

572
00:52:40,066 --> 00:52:42,634
Hey, what's wrong with tha…

573
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,133
Is it a bit weird?

574
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:49,100
It's better than being hungry
forever. Just close your eyes and…

575
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,400
- I won't be hungry forever!
-The curse will break on

576
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:55,100
its own in the gods' realm.
His divine powers as well.

577
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,766
Once he goes back.

578
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,333
But, about this curse.

579
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:08,533
How do I solve the curse of
my household?

580
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:15,566
It is not a curse. It's a promise.

581
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,267
- Is it different?
- It's different.

582
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:20,834
But why on earth did my ancestors
make such a promise?

583
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,767
Because they committed a crime.

584
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:25,200
What crime was it? I'm really
curious, that's why I'm like this.

585
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:26,600
If it's fair,
I will agree and back off.

586
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,667
There was a woman.

587
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:32,434
She was thrown in the water after
being sold for 300 bags of rice.

588
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,567
The King of Water had compassion
and let her live in his kingdom.

589
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,500
She ate and slept well.

590
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,533
But one day,

591
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:47,734
she started to starve herself
worrying over her blind father.

592
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,034
So the god let her go see him.

593
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,900
He sent her off with water lilies
around her, bearing lots of gold.

594
00:53:54,966 --> 00:54:00,367
She never returned. She fell in
love with a king from her world

595
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:06,700
and married him. The god's realm
was outraged by her betrayal.

596
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,400
They had treated her so well.

597
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,767
Is this woman's last name "Sim"
by chance?

598
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,366
And her given name "Chong"?

599
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,700
Let's go.

600
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,100
Let's go.

601
00:54:35,366 --> 00:54:37,167
Excuse me, please wrap this up.

602
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,033
Yes.

603
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:51,034
My Dad is a "Yoon" and
my Mom a "Kang."

604
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,734
Next time at least tell me a story
with the same last name please.

605
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,667
Lead me to Ahn Bin.

606
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:57,233
I said you don't need to see him.

607
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,333
Hey, look here.

608
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,833
- What is this?
- The thing you're looking for.

609
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,500
I think it's Yoon So-ah's.
Give it back to her.

610
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,666
(Very One Resort)

611
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:20,966
(Real Estate, Land, Yoon So-ah)

612
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:23,567
T-this, what is this?

613
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:25,800
How dare you think about selling
the gods' land so fearlessly?

614
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:27,267
- Hey!
- I was so shocked that I didn't

615
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:30,800
even read it. You see right away
that it's about selling the land.

616
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:34,134
I don't know who you were trying
to sell it to, but don't bother.

617
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,734
I will forgive you for this once.

618
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,667
Go.

619
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:40,967
Why is this your land?
This is my land!

620
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:42,600
This land won't sell anyway.

621
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,767
Why the hell not?

622
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:48,100
Why are you like this?

623
00:55:48,566 --> 00:55:51,600
I, this...this...

624
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:54,000
this is so important to me.

625
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:57,167
You can sell everything else
you want. But not the gods' land.

626
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:58,800
I have nothing else to sell.

627
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,200
Ms. Descendant!

628
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:12,433
Wait.

629
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,300
When you said you'd protect me,
I was a little happy.

630
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,800
I wanted to believe you
because you said "god's duty"

631
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:31,400
It's not wholesome,

632
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,566
but I thought I had someone
who was on "my side" as you said.

633
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,566
Because we lived under
the same roof,

634
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,534
I thought it was really...

635
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,033
really fortunate.

636
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,566
I had such impossible thoughts.

637
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:13,300
One day when I wake up, you'll
have disappeared like a mirage.

638
00:57:14,466 --> 00:57:16,333
It will definitely be like that,
but...

639
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,100
I thought it would be nice for me
to daydream for a bit.

640
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,233
Even if it's foolish,

641
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,600
today, I was a little happy.

642
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:53,166
I'm so angry about this. So angry.

643
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:09,400
I don't get what kind of
human you are, no,

644
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:18,000
what kind of god you are.

645
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:28,234
I…
am the God of the Water Kingdom...

646
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,900
That's what I'm saying.

647
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:34,000
You're from a bigger world.

648
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:40,166
You're someone who has
to do bigger things.

649
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:49,566
Even if small nameless things
leave like sounds from afar,

650
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:53,900
it won't matter to you.

651
00:59:42,766 --> 00:59:44,100
(Sales contract, price offered
100,000,000 won)

652
01:00:33,633 --> 01:00:37,966
(Doctor Yoon So-ah)

653
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:43,733
Miss Yoon So-ah?

654
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:51,366
Can I visit the private place
you're at right now?

655
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:57,200
I beg you.

656
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,666
Yoon So-ah!

657
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:33,966
Yoon So-ah!

658
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:45,533
Yoon So-ah!

659
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,000
Yoon So-ah!

660
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,200
Yoon So-ah!

661
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:56,333
Yoon So-ah!

662
01:02:19,566 --> 01:02:21,800
(The Bride of Habaek)

663
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,067
That I said that
I'll protect you...

664
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:26,367
If I want, I can see
the emotions of my counterpart.

665
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:28,467
I said don't bother my woman.

666
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:30,634
- Excuse me?
- We'll get off work together.

667
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,567
What's the meaning of this?

668
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:33,867
Only I am having it hard. Only me.

669
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:37,200
Since Ha Baek also doesn't seem to
want to go back quickly...

670
01:02:37,266 --> 01:02:38,134
What's going on?

671
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,034
Because of the gods,
nothing is going well.

672
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,534
I'm also sorry, for now.

673
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,767
What are you trying to do?

674
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:45,300
I'm thinking of having
a farewell party in advance.

675
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:47,500
The wind that swayed your heart…

676
01:02:47,566 --> 01:02:49,666
It already stopped.
