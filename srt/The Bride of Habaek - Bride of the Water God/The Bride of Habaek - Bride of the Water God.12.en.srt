(Episode 12)

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
Ha Baek.

10
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,800
Ha Baek.

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,033
Ha Baek.

12
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,233
Nak Bin was a sacrificial human.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,166
Human sacrifice was something
foolish humans did.

14
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:09,933
Ha Baek may be more foolish for
falling in love with a sacrifice.

15
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:22,200
The King of Heaven had a useless
dream to establish a new order.

16
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:25,000
He thought he could realize
his dream with Ha Baek's powers.

17
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:28,100
Ha Baek.

18
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,867
The King of Heaven deceived
Ha Baek's woman with promise of

19
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:36,534
eternal life and the foolish woman
willingly agreed to betray him.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,700
So did the woman who deceived
Ha Baek and passed along

21
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,300
the King of Heaven's curse,
get the eternal life she desired?

22
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,833
The sun will set soon.

23
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:43,300
Nak Bin.

24
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,000
Ha Baek.

25
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,600
Ha Baek.

26
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,000
The Queen Mother of the West
said she will kill you.

27
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:03,600
With your blood,

28
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:09,333
she will break this curse
you started.

29
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,467
You'll receive eternal life you
so desperately wanted, with death.

30
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:23,933
You won't be able to reach nirvana
and reincarnation

31
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,333
will not be bestowed upon you.

32
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,534
Save me.

33
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,700
Please, save me, Ha Baek. Please.

34
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,033
Never,

35
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,366
I will never forgive you.

36
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,100
I came to tell you that.

37
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,300
Ha Baek, I did wrong.

38
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:56,167
I won't do it again, Ha Baek.
Please, Ha Baek.

39
00:04:56,233 --> 00:05:00,133
I didn't know.
I didn't know that it was a curse.

40
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:06,967
I did it because I loved you.
I wanted to live with you forever.

41
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:10,634
I love you, Ha Baek. I love you...

42
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,234
Please, I love you.

43
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,800
Ha Baek!

44
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,033
Ha Baek.

45
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,766
Spare me.

46
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:37,233
Spare me.

47
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:00,900
No! I don't want to!

48
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:07,700
No.

49
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:12,300
Ha Baek. Ha Baek. Save me.

50
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,866
Please save me, Ha Baek.

51
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,966
Ha Baek. Save me.

52
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:46,134
However, the measly life of
that woman wasn't enough.

53
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,834
The Mother of the Water Kingdom
wanted that woman's

54
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,967
older brother and his son
to pay the price as well.

55
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,800
If you spare us, if you spare us!

56
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:58,500
That girl's elder brother paid
the consequence for pleading.

57
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:03,366
That fool promised devotion from
the rest of his descendants.

58
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,500
You're funny. What does that
matter have to do with me?

59
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:19,500
If my ancestor from 1,000
years ago betrayed the country,

60
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:21,734
killed someone, or stole, what
does that have to do with me now?

61
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,334
After hearing the legend,
am I supposed to feel guilty?

62
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,933
What to do? Guilt is something
one feels when they do

63
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,667
something very wrong.
I just can't relate.

64
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:41,733
They said you were dim-witted.
You really don't understand.

65
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,267
Whatever Moo Ra said to you...

66
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,066
Why are you glaring at me with
that expression on your face?

67
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,766
Let's just eat.
It's past dinnertime.

68
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,633
You guys just have perfect timing.
This isn't the first time.

69
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,734
It's gone bad.

70
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,633
What to do?

71
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,800
Should we have instant ramen?

72
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:50,633
What did Moo Ra say?

73
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:55,934
Nothing special. She just talked
about your old dating life.

74
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,100
It wasn't that interesting.
Have a seat.

75
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,934
- What about Nak Bin?
- That's right, Nak Bin.

76
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,134
You said her name was Nak Bin.

77
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,733
I told you so. The woman with the
last name Shim was just a bluff.

78
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,867
The woman whom you loved to death,

79
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:16,634
she deceived you and
then was prosecuted.

80
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,000
Her relatives made a ridiculous
promise. So they are my ancestors?

81
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:30,267
To blame me for wrongdoings
committed by my ancestors not 120,

82
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,000
but 1200 years ago…
I'm truly dumbfounded.

83
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,600
There's something I really want
to tell you.

84
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,800
Go back.

85
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:44,833
Go back to the place where
you need to be. Go back.

86
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:55,200
Please leave this house
as soon as possible.

87
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,966
I will decide when I will leave.

88
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,300
I heard you didn't do
a single thing.

89
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:07,834
Using whatever means,
convince him.

90
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,434
The woman you loved...

91
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,833
When she was dying,
you didn't do anything for her.

92
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:38,834
They said you were dim-witted.
You really don't understand.

93
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,767
I'm not telling you to
make you feel guilty,

94
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,566
I'm telling you to let Ha Baek go.

95
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Let him go.

96
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,833
I know you as a woman who is
at least that discerning.

97
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:55,666
I'm going crazy from anger,
but I'll acknowledge it.

98
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:04,167
That man loves you.

99
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,700
Do you understand what that means?

100
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,767
He will be going back anyway.

101
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,066
He's wavering.

102
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,967
Ha Baek is not only responsible
for himself.

103
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:20,834
Ha Baek is the Water Kingdom.
The Water Kingdom is Ha Baek.

104
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,733
Like you said, he has to return.

105
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:27,200
Do you know what's ironic?

106
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:32,366
If Ha Baek isn't a king,
he is nothing.

107
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,766
That's why, no matter how much
he hesitates, he will return.

108
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,267
Then it's all settled.

109
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,266
Please help him return before
he turns into a ball of fire.

110
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:49,366
Let him return, while it's still
bearable for him. I don't want to

111
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:59,300
see him ruin himself again
like when he lost Nak Bin.

112
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm asking you this favor.

113
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:11,200
Don't become a trap for him,
like that woman, Nak Bin.

114
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,066
I wish I could cry.

115
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:08,333
Like you said,
I wish I could get drunk.

116
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:16,266
All the lowly things humans do…
I wish I could do all of them.

117
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:24,833
I'm so angry. I'm going
crazy from anger.

118
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,434
I had to admit to her that
he loves her.

119
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,834
There was no need to go that far.

120
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,600
Why was that the only method
to get him to return?

121
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,000
Then you did all you could.

122
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:49,300
There is no reason for you to be
angry or upset.

123
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,800
I am going to hug you.

124
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:07,266
If you'd allow it, I would beat
that idiot, Ha Baek, to death.

125
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:10,166
Don't you dare.

126
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,533
Of course.

127
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:10,666
Nam Soo Ri.

128
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:14,666
Get up, Nam Soo Ri.

129
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,500
- Where did you go yesterday?
- Just here and there.

130
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:25,500
Are you upset because I worked
to get a present for the servant?

131
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:28,300
Pardon? No.

132
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,400
Yes. Very much.

133
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,533
I am sorry.

134
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,734
During the day, you drive the
duck boat under the scorching sun,

135
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:45,067
at night you get bitten by
mosquitoes making deliveries.

136
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:48,267
All for me. Although I'm able and
healthy, I just take baths, enjoy

137
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,900
meals, books and tree-fruit water
that you provide for me.

138
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:56,167
I only mooch off you,
how could I not understand that?

139
00:20:56,233 --> 00:21:00,333
No, no. I've committed a sin
worthy of death, Lord Ha Baek.

140
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,000
You don't expect me to say
such things, do you?

141
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,500
No, sir.

142
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,566
If you understand, go downstairs
and tell the servant...

143
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:13,700
Let's eat breakfast.

144
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:16,900
Excuse me, sir? Of course.

145
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,366
I ate well.

146
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,533
Give me your cellphone.

147
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,433
You take care of it.

148
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,066
You have to do this thing
called 'cancelling the contract.'

149
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:58,800
The newspaper, too. And my clothes
and books. Take care of it.

150
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,300
What are you talking about?

151
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,700
Please contact his boss at
the duck boat company.

152
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:09,133
Don't be out too late at night.

153
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:14,633
I hear there's a light fixture
that turns on when it gets dark.

154
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,166
Replace your light by the gate
with one of those.

155
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,966
Don't always eat cup ramen.

156
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Even if you're not a good cook,
make homemade meals.

157
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
Don't just clean once in
a million years,

158
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,400
do it often.

159
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,666
It's not hard to do.

160
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,300
About the street lamp
in your alley...

161
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,866
I heard you can file a complaint
to the city if it's not working.

162
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:49,000
Even if it's bothersome, don't
walk around in the dark anymore,

163
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,333
go and file the report.

164
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,133
You like to report things.

165
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,634
Excuse me...

166
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,900
- Nam Soo Ri.
- Yes?

167
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:08,833
Please give us some privacy.

168
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:10,966
Yes.

169
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:27,000
Do you remember how I said
it's always obvious when you lie?

170
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:33,500
But this time I couldn't guess.

171
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,933
I came to realize that you want me
to leave with all your might.

172
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,867
Why did I say with such assurance
that, since I am your god,

173
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,500
I will protect you?

174
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,466
I am embarrassed about it too.

175
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,733
Why did I make promises that
I can't keep? I regret it.

176
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,566
I want to ask you if I can leave,

177
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,933
if that's alright.

178
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,833
I want to ask that.

179
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,200
But as I haven't done anything
for you, it should be alright.

180
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,833
I am alright.

181
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,700
You really didn't do anything
for me.

182
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,933
After you leave, your absence
won't even be noticeable.

183
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:38,100
Even if it feels a bit empty,
it's alright.

184
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:42,966
I told you already.
I am second rate.

185
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Right.

186
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,233
- Are you leaving today?
- Now.

187
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,600
Then I will take you to
Gangwon Province.

188
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,033
No. There is no need.

189
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,566
Let's part ways here.

190
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,200
Let's go, Nam Soo Ri.

191
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,100
Yes.

192
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:42,933
Live a good life, Descendant.

193
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:50,333
Lord Joo Dong said to wait until
he comes back here.

194
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:35,933
Goodbye.

195
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:07,833
Take care.

196
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,800
You want me to fill in
for a reporter?

197
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:19,000
Then, what is the issue?

198
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:24,667
Catching a sailfin sandfish?

199
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:26,900
But I get severe seasickness

200
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:29,333
so I can't really ride
small fishing boats.

201
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:34,934
-So you don't want to do it?
- No, it's not that.

202
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,100
Oh, I am disappointed to
hear that.

203
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:43,166
Fine, I'll do it. Just make sure
I come out really pretty.

204
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,733
Yes, I will see you tomorrow.

205
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,934
- What?
- Just say no very clearly.

206
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,167
What do you know? If I am picky,
when will I make it big?

207
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:59,667
- Give me the phone.
- Hey! What are you doing?

208
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:03,634
- Oh, Miss Ja-ya.
- Hello, this is her manager.

209
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,567
- Yes, and?
- PD Kwon. If you have

210
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:09,734
our Ja-ya ride a boat, you'll have
to clean as soon as she gets on.

211
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,700
- Clean?
- Yes, clean.

212
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:15,767
I am talking about vomit. She will
throw up like there is no end.

213
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:20,334
Instead of catching any fish,
she'll have to return a mess.

214
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,334
Let's cancel the shoot.

215
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,034
Cancel? I am sorry.

216
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,000
Please give us a call if
a good opportunity comes up.

217
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,033
The shoot is cancelled.

218
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,800
Oh, thank you.

219
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:37,166
Then, I have to leave for
a fresh fruit juice delivery.

220
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,833
Stay still.

221
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,433
Stay still.

222
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:57,766
Why? It's not going well?

223
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:02,333
Should I get you another one?
How about a mannequin?

224
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,866
One that looks like Brad Pitt?

225
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,900
There is such a thing?

226
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:14,067
There is.
You care about a guy's looks.

227
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:18,967
I guess you can't get in the mood
since that doll isn't your type.

228
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:23,700
Then should I try changing it?
Though I'm not dying to do so.

229
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:26,333
Why are you laughing?

230
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, do you think this will
really solve the problem?

231
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,333
Dummy. The problem is you.

232
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,400
The male actors are not
the problem. The problem is you.

233
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:51,500
You have to make them love you,
but you make them scared of you.

234
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:54,800
I will really
freeze your tongue...

235
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,667
Look, the male actor did that.

236
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,100
But you have an expression like,
"Don't you dare try to kiss me.

237
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,734
I will freeze your tongue
and smash it."

238
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,467
If he feels that kind of threat,
will he still want to do it?

239
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:15,300
What?

240
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:29,500
Right. With this kind of
chemistry. You got it now?

241
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:33,666
Keep your mouth shut.
It's not a NC-17 movie.

242
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:40,066
I think I have been
too easy on you lately.

243
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,766
If you need to practice, let me
know. I'm better than a mannequin.

244
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:01,166
Yeah.

245
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,233
I got it. I will film it.
I will film it!

246
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,300
Has the date to shoot
the kiss scene been scheduled?

247
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:19,066
I guess paying for the breach of
contract won't solve it?

248
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,900
Humans are like that.
When their pride is hurt,

249
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,467
they sometimes say no to
even a million bars of gold.

250
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:31,733
Look at So-ah. As soon as Ha Baek
left, she returned the car to you.

251
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,366
How is that woman coping?

252
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,300
This kid is really cheerful.

253
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:45,766
You dropped it.
Good job. You're so cute.

254
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,567
Your brain is so… pure.

255
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:56,734
I am really sorry, Doctor.

256
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,600
No. He has such a pure soul.

257
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:00,567
Bye.

258
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:04,567
Bye.

259
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,166
Wow. You're amazing.

260
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,067
He's so cute.

261
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:12,067
What are you so happy about?
It was too chaotic for me.

262
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:15,034
Why? He's cute.

263
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,567
You're just so negative.

264
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:20,666
It was nice.
He was full of energy.

265
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,234
I received a call saying that our
loan application was approved.

266
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,500
Ma Bong-yeol's father was
a great help.

267
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:29,367
Really? I am really very thankful.
As soon as the money is ready,

268
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:33,034
contact Mr. Bang. You told him
we'll raise the deposit, right?

269
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,067
Yes. We're a little past renewal,
but he said he can wait.

270
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,500
I think things are going well
lately. We have more patients too.

271
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:44,400
We have just one more patient.
Why are you so elated lately?

272
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:48,266
Why are you so negative
about everything?

273
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:48,700
(Red Ginseng)

274
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,033
- Isn't that mine?
- It is.

275
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
You had a lot.
I took some for myself.

276
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,700
I've decided to start taking
health supplements.

277
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,167
The most important thing
in the world is my health.

278
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,500
Even if I go to Vanuatu,
I have to go with a healthy body.

279
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:02,734
Then you should buy it!
Why did you steal mine?

280
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,267
What? Steal?

281
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,300
You're not very greedy, but
you're super hung up about this.

282
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:11,867
That's because Ma Bong-yeol
gave it just to me to drink.

283
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:12,933
Get out.

284
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,734
Oh, Doctor.

285
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,234
So-ah, did you ask Ji-won to
set you up on a blind date?

286
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,534
- Yeah.
- What?

287
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,100
Why is she spreading that
all over the place...

288
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,634
Oh yeah, I told her to spread it.
How forgetful of me.

289
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,833
Oh my goodness. I'm sorry.

290
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,666
Is a blind date such a big deal
that you have to show up?

291
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:41,667
I feel nothing at all. I knew it'd
be this way. It's no big deal.

292
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:45,000
I thought it was going to
sting so much.

293
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:49,234
If I knew it was going to be this
easy, I would have dated him

294
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,533
more passionately before I sent
him on his way. I regret it now.

295
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:57,267
Do you not get it? Do you know why
police dramas don't have romance?

296
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,634
Because they're so pressed for
time. They have urgent problems.

297
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,367
While they're trying to fix things,
romance gets pushed back

298
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:07,234
and then the drama just ends.
Do you understand what I mean?

299
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,500
So my life is more like a genre
drama than a romance drama.

300
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:18,733
- So what I'm saying is...
- I get what you're saying!

301
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,100
Why are you being so embarrassing?

302
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,167
I also support this parting.
But I can't say that what you're

303
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:26,600
doing is better than
you crying and carrying on.

304
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:30,167
Why? Because I'm also
a fortune-teller with a degree

305
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:32,234
in psychiatry.
Also, romance is also a genre.

306
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,533
You know this way or that,
you're still a quack.

307
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:39,734
I did praise you for being
the best at enduring things but...

308
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,966
I'd better get back.
I have a patient.

309
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:52,234
But that god is pretty strange
and cold-hearted. If I had known

310
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,300
it would be this way, I would have
just thrown myself at him.

311
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:04,267
She said it won't take long with
her friend. She'll be here soon.

312
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,066
Thank you.

313
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:11,034
You don't have to worry about me.

314
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,134
I'll figure out my own life after
the doctor finds a guardian.

315
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,767
I also need to get married.

316
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,300
Yes.

317
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,000
Ironically, because of kids like
me, she's been hurt a lot.

318
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:27,234
Her father was not able to focus
much on her because of us kids.

319
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
It is also a fact that she faced
reverse discrimination.

320
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,234
She was excluded by her classmates
at school.

321
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,000
They said she smelled like a
beggar, since she lived with them.

322
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:40,666
Has she not shared these things
with you yet?

323
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:45,934
- Oh...
- I apologize. I thought you at least

324
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,500
had talked about things like
these. Please treat her well

325
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:51,167
so she doesn't think about
going on blind dates.

326
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,566
Doctor Yoon is going on
blind dates?

327
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,533
Oh, you're here.

328
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,067
My apology for what happened last
time is pretty overdue, isn't it?

329
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,534
It's all right.
I should also apologize.

330
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,700
You must have been very startled.

331
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:30,733
Were you having a bad dream?

332
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:32,367
Yes.

333
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:35,300
Something related to
your sleeping disorder?

334
00:36:35,366 --> 00:36:36,300
Yes.

335
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:40,334
As I told you, the best method is
to change your train of thought.

336
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,600
That's not easy, is it?

337
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,034
Then let's try this.

338
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,567
You said you had an experience
that reminded you of your past.

339
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:52,166
Can you tell me what happened?

340
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,900
Do you think this would be
difficult for you as well?

341
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:02,100
I met people I didn't want
to meet.

342
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,167
What kind of people?

343
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,300
Those who imprisoned me
in the past.

344
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:09,700
- How exactly?
- People who condemn me.

345
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:14,966
People who are awakening
the person I was in the past.

346
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,567
Your unhappy past, CEO Sin,

347
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:22,534
is not something to be condemned.

348
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,233
There's no person who can choose
where or when to be born.

349
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:31,333
Is there something else?

350
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:39,367
Are you unable to tell me today?

351
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:42,967
Then there cannot be any further
progress in today's consultation.

352
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:45,334
- I am sorry.
- It's alright.

353
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,366
Let's give it more time.

354
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:53,333
But CEO Sin, I think you need to
trust me some more.

355
00:38:01,266 --> 00:38:02,666
Let's have dinner together.

356
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,300
Yes?

357
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,167
I don't eat dinner with patients
during my personal time...

358
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:13,667
Don't overthink it and
just join me for a meal

359
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,300
as colleagues who
otherwise would eat alone.

360
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:27,667
It's not like we get hungry so why
are we eating meals like humans.

361
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:30,534
Eating and drinking
moderately is life.

362
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,434
- Julia what's her name said it.
- Are you human?

363
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,333
You said you wished you could do
all things that humans can do.

364
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,533
You don't know that
I'm still sulking, do you?

365
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,600
- Come again?
- I'm still upset.

366
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,900
I just asked to have dinner.
Why put up such a wall?

367
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:50,666
The thing is that...

368
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:57,000
How can I establish a relationship
with you, Doctor Yoon?

369
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,900
- What?
- Did you know this?

370
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:04,067
I know all about your finances
and how to provoke you.

371
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:08,400
I know how caring you are,
even though you pretend not to be.

372
00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:12,734
I know you incur many losses and
that enduring is your specialty.

373
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,367
I also know whom you like
and why you are hurting.

374
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,400
I learned about your childhood
by chance, and I even know

375
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:24,334
your address and ID number. Sorry.
I have a photographic memory.

376
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,000
I found out, not by stalking you,
but because you told me.

377
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:33,900
You also know me well. You even
comforted and encouraged me.

378
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:38,500
So then, how can I establish
a relationship with you?

379
00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:42,300
Are you asking to be friends?

380
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,900
Aren't we more than enough past
a stage where we can be friends?

381
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,767
I'm rich and of upstanding mind.
I'm rational, well-mannered,

382
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:52,933
I work hard, I'm handsome,
I plant trees. I'm pretty great.

383
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,167
My pride is about to get hurt.

384
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,700
It's not like I'm asking you to
get married. I'm asking to be

385
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:06,500
friends. Do I have to list
my qualifications for that?

386
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:26,633
Don't cause a scene. Go.

387
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,400
Let's go to this restaurant
I know of.

388
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:39,500
Jin Geon, take her home.

389
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:59,433
Do you really not know why
he's being like that?

390
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,133
No...

391
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,633
You knew.

392
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,933
Why didn't you say anything?

393
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:17,533
Let's go. Let's go.

394
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:25,734
Did you know that I'm still
about 0.1 percent upset?

395
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,700
What?

396
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,433
It still hasn't been resolved.

397
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,066
I'm also a prickly person.

398
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,666
I'm not someone who asks
just anyone to be my friend.

399
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,934
I'm sorry. What kind of
grudge lasts this long? I have

400
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,600
something to say too. You ask
to be friends but don't trust me.

401
00:41:45,566 --> 00:41:50,734
You're friends with your doctor,
but no progress. Explain that.

402
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,533
Do you not trust me as a doctor?

403
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,167
- It's not that...
- Okay.

404
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:59,500
I can't force you.
I'll try harder.

405
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,600
Also, this stuffed animal is cute.

406
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:11,966
I am going first.

407
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,567
Will you give me that
stuffed animal?

408
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,367
Isn't it cute?
I designed it with my friend.

409
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,434
It came as a set with some mugs
but those are all sold out.

410
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,166
- How much...
- I will buy it.

411
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,666
What kind of situation is this?

412
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,566
This is supposed to be
the first token of our friendship.

413
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:47,800
How old am I that you'd give me
a stuffed animal as a present?

414
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,100
- How much is it?
- It's $45.

415
00:42:58,866 --> 00:42:59,833
Yes?

416
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:05,066
Alright. I will go there now.

417
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,900
I have to go. There are some
minor problems at the hotel.

418
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,366
Thank you for today.

419
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,167
I am sorry I can't take you home.

420
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:20,466
Go back safely. See you again.

421
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,834
Where is this?

422
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,100
You don't remember?

423
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,433
Remember what?

424
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,633
Why aren't you reading it to me?

425
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,667
All I asked for was for you
to read the first sentence.

426
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:13,200
If you read the first sentence
and I don't like it, you can stop.

427
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,300
I know randomly reading aloud from
a book is a little embarrassing.

428
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:26,434
How did we meet? One day
a butterfly flew in like a petal

429
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,534
and gave me a tiny flutter.

430
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,100
There's been a time that I've
read aloud the page that you read.

431
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:39,167
Sitting in the chair that you
sat in, I've close my eyes,

432
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:44,900
in order to feel the warm of
your back against the cushion.

433
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:50,000
I've even stroked my finger
over the rim of the cup

434
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:52,800
that you drank from.

435
00:46:52,866 --> 00:47:00,134
How did we traverse that long
period between then and now?

436
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:06,667
Were we able to pass through love
and arrive at love?

437
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:09,700
This miraculous inevitability.

438
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:14,267
That I was able to stand
in front of you, was something

439
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:19,500
I didn't want to twist into mere coincidence.

440
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:25,734
Therefore,
the best thing I can do is…

441
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:32,034
Stop reading and let's go eat.
I'll do the rest later.

442
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:43,100
give my all in loving you.
I'm passing through your love.

443
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,067
Why? Why not?

444
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:41,500
I want to keep coming here,
so just fill the prescription here.

445
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:45,233
Who makes a fuss over
filling prescriptions?

446
00:48:46,266 --> 00:48:50,900
CEO Sin called and asked how it'd
be if he sent his employees here.

447
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,034
That'd be great.

448
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,034
See, CEO Sin is the only one
that knows how you feel.

449
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,800
- Afternoon appointments?
- Just Ma Bong-yeol.

450
00:49:08,766 --> 00:49:12,666
You said you were fine.
You don't look that way.

451
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:22,167
You rambled nonsense about first
rate, second rate, third rate

452
00:49:22,233 --> 00:49:26,134
and look at you now.
Looks like you can't handle it.

453
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,934
It’s like not being able to sober up
after drinking when I can’t.

454
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,167
That's not possible. I dumped you.

455
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:40,067
You dumped me, but it feels
like you got dumped, right?

456
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:44,100
You're cursing me for not being
able to see through your lies.

457
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:48,067
Do you get it know?

458
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:51,567
There's no magical answer
that hurts no one, science girl.

459
00:49:51,633 --> 00:50:00,234
Someone who is good to everyone
could be the worst of them all.

460
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,534
Look at the truth behind
the move you praised so much.

461
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,900
At times, people just live
as if today is their last.

462
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:12,467
They instinctively know that
they just seize today for

463
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:19,167
there to be a tomorrow. People who
do not fear a tomorrow like today.

464
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:25,700
People who can survive
holding onto the memories of today.

465
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:29,867
Isn't that more sensible than
searching for a move that won't

466
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:34,600
hurt anyone?
You said that an imaginary number

467
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,500
that is squared comes out
to less than zero.

468
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:43,666
You're not even human.

469
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,233
Why do you keep getting rained on?

470
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:16,366
What?

471
00:51:27,866 --> 00:51:31,966
She must still be out of it.

472
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,033
- What?
- Stop by if you have time.

473
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:48,400
Okay. Ha Baek has returned.

474
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,700
Did our servant tell you? Funny.

475
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,900
How did she do it?
As solace? As a solution?

476
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:03,634
If So-ah had said it,
why would I be asking you?

477
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,900
Okay. I have something to say too.

478
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:13,934
Take care of that woman.

479
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,566
No, you can just have her.
You can have her.

480
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:32,434
Forget about all this servant of god stuff.

481
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,600
This is so annoying.

482
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,766
I'm not trying to be
a good goddess okay?

483
00:52:42,633 --> 00:52:43,767
Do you feel responsible?

484
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:49,734
No, it's not that. I know
it's hard to believe, but I don't

485
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,434
think it's right for humans to
suffer because of the gods.

486
00:52:53,500 --> 00:53:03,967
Then you should tell me to
make her happy, not to have her.

487
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:07,666
Isn't that more accurate?

488
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:12,267
Whatever it is, just
make her forget about Ha Baek.

489
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,100
That's not something
you can just do.

490
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:17,700
Try. I know you wanted to.

491
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:23,734
And get married. Stay by
her side until she dies.

492
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,200
Don't let any other man
come near her.

493
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:35,633
That's the only way to break the
cycle. You need to do it for her.

494
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,766
You help her.

495
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,166
What is it this time?

496
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:57,866
You scared me! Why do you
always quietly appear?

497
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,934
Hey, so how much do you get paid?

498
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,600
Why do you ask?

499
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:05,067
I'll pay you 1.5 times more if
you become my manager.

500
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:07,667
Really? There's no need.

501
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:09,367
2 times more.

502
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:17,400
Okay.
Then just be a nice church oppa.

503
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,100
You really want to get my advice?
Officially, seriously?

504
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:24,767
You said you would if I paid.

505
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:27,267
Then there's a prerequisite.

506
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,200
What is it?

507
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:30,834
Call me oppa.

508
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,833
What?

509
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,767
What nonsense is that?!

510
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,567
You don't want to?

511
00:54:39,633 --> 00:54:40,933
You don't have to.

512
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:45,200
Hey!

513
00:54:45,266 --> 00:54:47,233
Hey. How old are you?

514
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,934
I heard that we are the same age.

515
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,733
Then you can't be my oppa.
I was born in January.

516
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:58,733
I was born on
January 1st, 12:01 am.

517
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,467
- Why?
- What do you mean?

518
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:05,667
You don't like it?
If you don't like it, forget it.

519
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:06,666
Oppa!

520
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:12,800
Fine, I'll call you oppa.

521
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,366
Okay, what do you need to
consult me about?

522
00:55:20,966 --> 00:55:25,500
About that thing from that time,
you didn't advise me properly.

523
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:27,666
Why would CEO Sin hug me.
It's not only my misunderstanding.

524
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,933
He's continuing to play
the bad guy.

525
00:55:34,066 --> 00:55:38,033
Since we've made it official, I'll
take responsibility and explain.

526
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,234
The woman who's inside of his
heart is your classmate, So-ah.

527
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,933
So it'll be best if you down some
water and come to your senses.

528
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:49,700
- What?
- It's become clear right?

529
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:52,333
That's why all the younger sisters
at church all consult me.

530
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:04,834
Grandfather, kick her out.
Out right now! Now!

531
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,734
If you can't,
I'm going to go to America.

532
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,200
I'm going to live with mom!

533
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,266
I'm going to disown you, grandpa!

534
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,100
Why are you asking a busy person
to come?

535
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:23,466
Go out and come in
the way you came.

536
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,133
Why?

537
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,967
Darn it. I should have just taken
advantage of him then.

538
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:40,034
What are you saying?
Why did you ask to see me?

539
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,434
I've never read your fortune. Give
me your date and time of birth.

540
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,067
Ah, why? I don't need it.

541
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:46,433
I said give it! It's because you
keep appearing in my dreams.

542
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:51,333
19... Hold on.

543
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,900
Who is it?

544
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,934
What? Is there a patient?

545
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,534
Doc!

546
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,300
Why? What's wrong?

547
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:01,034
I said move!

548
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,500
No, just leave it.

549
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:05,833
What's going on?

550
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:10,167
The contract ended so long ago!

551
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:13,100
I can't tolerate it anymore!

552
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:15,766
is what he said, the chairman.

553
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:22,234
He lives off of the measly rent,
and he met the worst tenant,

554
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,000
so he also said he felt
his life was threatened.

555
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:31,034
What are you talking about?
I said I'd raise my deposit!

556
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,100
Didn't you say
you'd give it today?

557
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:35,166
That's what he said, and then out
of the blue, he said to just move.

558
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:37,134
I said leave it!

559
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,234
How can that be! Don't move that!

560
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,100
Ah, by the way. All this has been
decided by the chairman's

561
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:47,500
precious granddaughter
and hidden influence,

562
00:57:47,566 --> 00:57:51,534
miss Shin Ja-ya. It was her doing.
Miss Shin Ja-ya.

563
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,500
What?

564
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:54,566
What? What did you say?
Shin Ja-ya?

565
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:58,833
Take your dirty hands off!

566
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,100
Mr. Ma Bong-yeol!

567
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:13,234
Put it all down. Don't touch
a thing. You over there!

568
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,067
Put it down right there.

569
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:18,934
Mr. Ma, it's okay. It's not
a big deal. Don't get overworked.

570
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,100
Please stay outside.

571
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:26,034
Don't touch a single thing.
You can't just evict the hospital.

572
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,466
I said don't touch anything!

573
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:52,234
- How can this person...
- I said don't touch!

574
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,800
#$^@$#$^**@!

575
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,233
Be quiet over there!

576
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,866
He's a patient. A mental patient.

577
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:03,500
It's difficult for him to control
his emotions. I'm his doctor.

578
00:59:03,566 --> 00:59:05,834
I'll be held liable.
If you let him leave...

579
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,267
I can't investigate because of
him. How can I let him leave?

580
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:12,600
Let's talk once
his guardian arrives.

581
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:17,100
Excuse me, officer.
I really didn't hit him even once.

582
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:21,300
Since he was involved in assault
too, both of them need to settle.

583
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:24,067
His guardian is on
a overseas business trip.

584
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:26,200
It will take awhile for
someone else to come here.

585
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:29,267
Why are you closing down my
clinic? You call yourself human?

586
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,767
You ruthless bastards!

587
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,266
Be quiet! It's so noisy.

588
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,566
Miss Yoon So-ah.

589
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:39,200
CEO Sin!

590
00:59:42,566 --> 00:59:43,600
Hello.

591
00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:47,500
(Gibberish in "alien" language)

592
00:59:47,566 --> 00:59:49,500
(Gibberish in "alien" language)

593
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:54,967
Don't worry about these two. Just
worry about tidying things up.

594
00:59:55,033 --> 00:59:56,600
Thank you.

595
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:57,966
I will call you.

596
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:09,334
- Can I take your arm?
- Pardon?

597
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,066
It seems like you're about
to collapse.

598
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,100
I am fine.

599
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,934
Nurse Yoo made unnecessary fuss
by calling you.

600
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,133
It's great he made the unnecessary
fuss. Give him a raise.

601
01:00:26,366 --> 01:00:28,367
I laughed a bit after you called.

602
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:32,534
Like me, you must keep
your circle small.

603
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,967
And yet, I ask to become friends
and you play so hard to get?

604
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,800
How is it? Isn't it convenient to
have a rich friend?

605
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,800
Do you want something to drink?

606
01:00:43,866 --> 01:00:45,534
I want to go home and rest.

607
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,667
Alright, then.

608
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:48,933
Get in. I will take you.

609
01:00:50,966 --> 01:00:55,400
It's not far. I'll walk. So I can
collect myself with the breeze.

610
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,034
Alright.

611
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,600
But I will call you to make sure
you arrived home safely.

612
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,266
I am really thankful for today.

613
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,800
Bye.

614
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:54,566
(Very One CEO Sin Hoo-ye)

615
01:01:54,566 --> 01:01:55,666
Hello?

616
01:01:56,766 --> 01:01:58,400
Did you arrive?

617
01:01:58,466 --> 01:01:59,800
No, not yet.

618
01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:03,100
I knew it. You said it's close by.

619
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,400
I walked slowly.

620
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,766
Then I will have to call twice to
make sure you arrived home safely.

621
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:19,567
I found out my landlord's
granddaughter is an old classmate.

622
01:02:19,633 --> 01:02:25,300
I'm not interested in her. I don't
get why she hates me so much.

623
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,234
We have a lot in common.

624
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,167
Pardon?

625
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:30,500
I am being harassed by people
like that too.

626
01:02:31,933 --> 01:02:33,266
How about your clinic?

627
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,834
I have to go
beg the landlord tomorrow or

628
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:43,134
cling onto that girl who holds
the power behind the scenes.

629
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,334
Should I come too? I am pretty
good when it comes to blackmail.

630
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,600
What?

631
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:52,600
Should I just buy the whole
building? I'm pretty loaded.

632
01:02:56,466 --> 01:02:57,666
I am being serious.

633
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:55,333
I told you to not go around
late at night.

634
01:04:56,133 --> 01:05:43,066
You really don't listen.

635
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,500
(The Bride of Habaek)

636
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,367
Ha Baek is back.

637
01:05:49,433 --> 01:05:52,367
I came to give a proper farewell.
So I may love without any regrets.

638
01:05:52,433 --> 01:05:55,567
She's Ha Baek's woman.
I was a step too late.

639
01:05:55,633 --> 01:05:58,967
From here on, it's a war.
If you can't change her mind,

640
01:05:59,033 --> 01:06:00,400
take her away by force.

641
01:06:00,466 --> 01:06:02,800
You know how I feel. Why do you
keep pretending like you don't?

642
01:06:02,866 --> 01:06:06,734
Is this real or dream? If it's
a dream, please don't wake up.

643
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,934
I will wait. I am good at waiting.

644
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,967
Move away from her.
I can't stand it.

645
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:11,834
Have you forgotten?

646
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,367
- By chance?
- You guys,

647
01:06:13,433 --> 01:06:15,000
What I saw that day
I wasn't mistaken?

648
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:16,333
I could kill you people.
