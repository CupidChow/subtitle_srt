8
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,500
I told you not to interfere!

9
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,300
You are...

10
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,934
That's right.
Do you understand now?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,400
The face that you killed,
the sin that you committed.

12
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,166
What are you saying?

13
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:22,367
Do you know what else I find annoying?

14
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,166
I'm wondering if you're like this
after finding out about him.

15
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,034
You're going to explain? Does that
mean you knew about it too?

16
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,133
- About what?
- This person's true identity!

17
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,033
Could it be?

18
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,133
So I wasn't mistaken?

19
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,766
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:01,200
The face that he killed?

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,500
Was it Mo Myeong?

22
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,000
Did he kill Mo Myeong?

23
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:22,600
I childishly gave you a chance.
Though the right answer wouldn't

24
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,900
have changed anything. You said
that you only speak the truth.

25
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:28,500
- You're lying.
- I don't do such immature things.

26
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,900
I only speak the truth.

27
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,534
I don't know how many times
I killed you in my mind in

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,834
the last 1200 years. You probably
don't know how much I wish I could

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,700
exchange my powers for yours.
Then it occurred to me that you

30
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:01,134
would be dying and being reborn
countless times in that cave

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,000
and rot away like that. I couldn't
think of better revenge than that.

32
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,933
But,

33
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,800
you are here looking at the sun
and breathing this air?

34
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,534
You breathe like that and laugh?

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,066
Leave him alone.

36
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,000
Stop it.

(Episode 14)

39
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,200
He's not answering.

40
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:19,367
When the heck was the first time
he met him?

41
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:24,500
He said it's been 1200 years.
And the cave, what cave?

42
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,800
How do you think he's going to be?

43
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,800
I think that guy pulled back
his strength at some point.

44
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:35,434
If he had used it fully, something
irreparable would have happened.

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800
Who's Mo Myeong?

46
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,333
You don't know him?

47
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:44,634
His twin.
He was Bi Ryeom's shadow.

48
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,033
Bi Ryeom really treasured him.

49
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,833
A while back,
I stopped seeing him around.

50
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:58,500
I didn't even know that happened.
I was too indifferent.

51
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't feel guilty. You've always
been indifferent to Bi Ryeom.

52
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,534
But why didn't he tell me?

53
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,434
I can't tell you, you're you.

54
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,466
Because the person requesting
an explanation is you.

55
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:21,166
Why?

56
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,667
Why did that guy kill Mo Myeong?

57
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,433
I don't know.

58
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm really disappointed in
CEO Sin.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You self-proclaimed gods of life!

60
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:48,867
What can you do to me?
Are you going to try and kill me?

61
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:52,134
Can you do it as well as I can?

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,300
I don't know how many times
I killed you in my mind in

63
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:01,600
the last 1200 years. That you would be dying and being reborn

64
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:07,166
countless times in that cave
and rot away like that.

65
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,233
I couldn't think of better revenge than that.

66
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,000
But you are here looking at
the sun and breathing this air?

67
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,866
You breathe like that and laugh?

68
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:00,366
(Very One CEO Sin Hoo-ye)

69
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,534
Don't worry. Bi Ryeom was just
playing around. He tried to…

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
He's like you guys isn't he?

71
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:22,900
CEO Sin, he came from your world,
didn't he?

72
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,767
Why didn't you tell me?

73
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,367
Did I have to tell you?

74
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:30,033
- What?
- You didn't ask me.

75
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,233
He's not like us.

76
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,900
But

77
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,000
- it was you guys, right?
- What?

78
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:47,000
The ones who scorned him, saying
he shouldn't have been born.

79
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,500
When did you become so close
with this guy

80
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:52,067
that you were able to
share such things?

81
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:57,000
Why? Why do you criticize him?
You guys are gods. Gods...

82
00:07:57,066 --> 00:08:01,366
Was it after I left?
Or was it before?

83
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,466
Could it be that you were
wanting me to leave?

84
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:12,867
You said you were second-rate,
that you were bearing it,

85
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:17,767
but were you crying like
you were third-rate?

86
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,100
Is that how you were able to
easily give him your heart?

87
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:27,200
Why are you like that?

88
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,400
I told you to
take into consideration that

89
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:35,434
I'm the kind of god who gets
very jealous of male friends,

90
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,100
I told you I don't have
such a thing as rationality.

91
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
When the heck was the first time
he met him?

92
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:10,533
He said it's been 1200 years.
And the cave, what cave?

93
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,734
I heard that Nak Bin is hiding in
the Heaven Kingdom.

94
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,300
I heard it's a cave that the
King of Heaven has. Go find out.

95
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:29,367
No use. No matter where she is in
gods' realm, she won't be safe.

96
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:31,067
It'll be the same if you send her
to the human realm.

97
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,667
I'm not trying to save her.

98
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,734
I won't forgive her either.
I just want to know one thing.

99
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,834
What is it you want to know?

100
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,433
What was I to her?

101
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,266
Could it be?

102
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,467
- Yeon-mi.
- What now?

103
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,734
There's this person, A.

104
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,734
Tell me.

105
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,167
What does it mean if A suddenly
loses it during a conversation?

106
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,667
- Break up with him!
- What?

107
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,400
- A is probably a man, right?
- Huh?

108
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,934
- Yeah.
- He has anger management issues.

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,967
It's not like that.

110
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,434
He's someone who already had
a bad personality.

111
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,567
It's definitely not
something like that.

112
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,700
- He's hiding something.
- What?

113
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:47,134
When men realize they're in the
wrong they tend to get more angry.

114
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,900
That's why they test a woman's
patience.  Break up with him!

115
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,100
- Hello?
- Dr. Yoon, it's Secretary Min.

116
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,967
Ah, yes. How are you?

117
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,367
You haven't heard from the CEO,
have you?

118
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:13,200
No. Has he not come to work yet?

119
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:17,000
He hasn't.
If you hear from him, please call me.

120
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,766
I will.

121
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:28,233
(Very One CEO Sin Hoo-ye)

122
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,933
(Doctor Yoon So-ah)

123
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,800
I found Bi Ryeom.

124
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:57,500
You,

125
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,300
at that time,

126
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,500
went to that cave, didn't you?

127
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,833
Did you meet him there?

128
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Did Mo Myeong die then?

129
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,000
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,634
You told me that you didn't go.

131
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,034
You said that
you wouldn't help me.

132
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,967
I thought about it and
I can't fulfill your request.

133
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:29,867
No, actually,
I don't want to fulfill it.

134
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,967
Moo Ra suffered all that heartache
because of you.

135
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,833
How about you experience
some unhappiness too?

136
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,967
I'm telling you to
get more punishment.

137
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,433
But

138
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,934
why did you tell me you didn't go?

139
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,667
Yes,

140
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,900
I shouldn't have gone there.
I regret it a thousand times.

141
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:52,934
Why did I go? Who are you to me
that I'd listen to that request?

142
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,867
Was that request more important
than Mo Myeong?

143
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,434
I keep asking myself that.

144
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,700
What happened? Why...

145
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:04,967
was that guy there?

146
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,567
She was locked in that place
with him.

147
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:10,933
Of all places, she hid there.

148
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,433
At first I didn't know
the kid was that guy.

149
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:29,300
He probably thought we were
trying to take Nak Bin away.

150
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:37,634
At that time, the gods sent by the
King of Heaven came for the woman.

151
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,400
What are you doing?

152
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,266
Mo Myeong.

153
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,833
Mo Myeong!

154
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,334
Mo Myeong!

155
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,133
Mo Myeong!

156
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,500
Why? Why?!

157
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:07,100
Why didn't you say anything
till now?

158
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,166
The King of Heaven gave us
an order.

159
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:17,834
He told us not to tell anyone that
the boy was held in that cave.

160
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,800
We're gods of the Heaven Kingdom,
so we have to follow his orders.

161
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,033
Mo Myeong's death

162
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,300
was my fault.

163
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,167
This may be impertinent but Mo
Myeong's death was no one's fault.

164
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:41,700
Mo Myeong and I were twins
who shared one fate.

165
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:47,766
If it wasn't him, it would've been
me. One was fated to die.

166
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:55,200
Yes, it's your fault.

167
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,200
I don't think you did anything to
deserve being hit,

168
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:03,100
but Bi Ryeom has always wanted to
hit you.

169
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:08,766
Let's go. You were right, hitting
someone feels pretty good.

170
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,133
Let it all go.

171
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,100
That anger in your heart,

172
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,166
your hatred towards Ha Baek,

173
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:45,366
and your inability to
forgive CEO Sin.

174
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:50,500
And also... your self-hatred.

175
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,734
- It's because of that, isn't it?
- What are you talking about?

176
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,333
That thought that you ran away.

177
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,434
You think that you left Mo Myeong
and ran away.

178
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,267
That's why
you can't forgive yourself

179
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,133
and that's why you hate everyone.

180
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
I'm sorry.

181
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:20,100
I am the one who needs to be
the most sorry in all this.

182
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,367
Isn't that so?

183
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:26,734
I'm the one who told you to
run away if you met that guy.

184
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,567
Divinity of fire. We should catch
him and make him a blacksmith.

185
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,434
Catch? My butt.

186
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,833
If you run into him, run away.
He'll be stronger than you.

187
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,566
Did those words push you?

188
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,534
No.

189
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,900
You didn't run away.

190
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:56,166
Jin Geon is the one who pulled you
away against your will.

191
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,334
If you don't know what you're
talking about, just stay out of it.

192
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,366
Nevertheless...

193
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,767
Here, there's a part of you
that wanted to run away.

194
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,966
You're thankful that
Jin Geon dragged you away.

195
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:18,000
Did you think that?

196
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:26,534
This is why I say that you haven't
fully grown up.

197
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,834
You didn't turn your back on
Mo Myeong; you saved Jin Geon.

198
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,134
If something had happened to you,
would Jin Geon have been safe?

199
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,133
Do you think that the Heaven
Kingdom would have forgiven him?

200
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:46,234
Don't listen to what I say
from now on.

201
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,433
These kinds of side-effects
always happen.

202
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,500
And also,

203
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,500
of all the things I can do
for you,

204
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:59,866
I think this is the best
consolation I can give you.

205
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:31,400
It's fine now, right?

206
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,533
Are you playing around?

207
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:05,900
She was locked in that place
with him.

208
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:09,300
Of all places, she hid there.

209
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,966
Ajusshi.

210
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:30,400
I know that you came, Ajusshi.
I know that you came.

211
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Are you playing hide and seek?

212
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,200
Oh, I fell.

213
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,900
Did he not come?

214
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:49,766
It's strange.

215
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:29,500
He's not like us.

216
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:31,400
He's not?

217
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,934
Then what is he?

218
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,566
He came from the gods' realm
but he's not a god like them?

219
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,367
I don't know who my mother is

220
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:47,234
and my father treated me
like a monster.

221
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,266
I was not supposed to be born,

222
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,300
so Shame was my name.

223
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:59,066
My father was afraid of
my existence being known

224
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,800
so he locked me away for
a long time.

225
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:11,434
There are no family relationships
in the gods' realm like humans.

226
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,766
He said there are no family
relationships in the gods' realm.

227
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,333
Could it possibly be...?

228
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,966
Could there be something
ike that?

229
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,166
What am I going to do after
I meet him?

230
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,767
Are you going somewhere?

231
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,500
No.

232
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,066
I'm sorry about last night.

233
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,766
Is something going on?

234
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,866
No.

235
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,300
- Um
- Yes?

236
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,367
It's nothing.

237
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,933
Where have you been all day?

238
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:35,933
Did you meet with your friends to
borrow money?

239
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,433
It sobers you up
pretty fast right? Reality.

240
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,366
Food.

241
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,966
You didn't forget.

242
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,700
Let's eat. Is curry ok?

243
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:53,700
What is that?

244
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:55,334
There's something like that,
something yellow.

245
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,100
I'm going to go buy curry,
so you peel some potatoes.

246
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,400
Do it well, alright?

247
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:17,533
How to peel potatoes...

248
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,167
Yes?

249
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,534
Your potatoes have sprouted and
are playing rock-paper-scissors.

250
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,100
What?

251
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,133
I understand.

252
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,966
Is he addicted to search engines?

253
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:41,100
Do you have any potatoes?

254
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,300
She was ugly.

255
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,334
Curry and

256
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
potatoes. Potatoes and

257
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,000
bell peppers.

258
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,300
Wait a second, wait a second.

259
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,834
It's me. Do you not recognize me?

260
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,900
The last time me
and Lord Ha Baek...

261
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,300
You?

262
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:32,166
Yes. I'm the voracious god,
Joo Geol Lim.

263
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,800
Woah.

264
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:41,100
Wait a second, wait a second,
wait a second.

265
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:45,067
Listen...just listen…
just listen to me.

266
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:48,900
Hoo-ye, just meet with Hoo-ye.

267
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,233
Please, Hoo-ye…

268
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
CEO Sin.

269
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:16,566
CEO Sin.

270
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,067
- Let me go.
- Look at me.

271
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,733
- Let me go!
- Stay still!

272
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,567
It's okay.

273
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,733
It's okay.

274
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,966
Stay still.

275
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:37,466
It's okay, it's okay. Stay still.

276
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,767
Yoon...
- Yes, it's me.

277
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,500
Where are you? Are you okay?

278
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:58,267
I'm okay. Don't worry.

279
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:01,866
Was it his doing?
Are you with him?

280
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:04,933
Come back this instant.

281
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:08,934
I'm okay. I'll be back later.

282
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,133
Come back this instant.

283
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:14,300
You don't know that guy.

284
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:17,167
He's not the kind of person
you think he is.

285
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,533
I know what kind of person he is.

286
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,767
What?

287
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,534
So don't worry about me.

288
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,466
He won't harm me.
I'll be back soon, don't worry.

289
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,933
I told you so,
she says she's okay, right?

290
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:38,867
Harm?
However dangerous CEO Sin may be,

291
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:42,867
he wouldn't do anything to
that woman.

292
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:45,534
- She's probably at the farm.
- Send her to CEO Sin.

293
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,834
That's what's best for her.

294
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,734
Transport me there.

295
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,500
Think about this clearly. You
can't do anything for that woman.

296
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:55,334
CEO Sin is a very wealthy man.

297
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,600
The car takes too long.
I'm asking you for a favor.

298
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,400
I don't want to.

299
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,400
CEO Sin.

300
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,000
Go back.

301
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,334
CEO SIn.

302
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,466
Please!

303
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,433
Go back.

304
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:40,866
Don't come close to me.
I kill everything.

305
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,533
If you stay by my side,

306
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:46,866
you'll become unhappy.

307
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:50,866
You too.

308
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,966
I almost killed you too.

309
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:05,334
There are some things that don't
change no matter what you do.

310
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:12,700
No matter how much you change
your external appearance there are

311
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,866
things that don't change.
No matter how much you try,

312
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:21,866
it's back to square one, square one,

313
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,867
square one...

314
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:29,000
Square one, what is that?

315
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:37,900
Are you trying to say even if you
change, your sin doesn't go away?

316
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:39,766
Yes.

317
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:46,700
I'm always someone who can
commit a sin again.

318
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,334
I'm never going to change.

319
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,766
No.
You're not that kind of person.

320
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:57,234
Person...

321
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,266
Then, would you rather be a god?

322
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:05,000
Do you want to be
a person or a god?

323
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Be a person, a person is better.

324
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,466
Being a person suits you better.

325
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:22,667
The people you've helped,
the orphans you've sponsored,

326
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:26,600
the many sick people who got to
live because of you,

327
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:29,933
those many people whom you saved,

328
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:34,500
do you know what you are to them?

329
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:36,866
You are a god.

330
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:40,967
The things you've done while
you've lived as a person,

331
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:44,866
those are the works of a god.

332
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:49,967
If a god looks down from way up there,

333
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:54,900
in this leopard poop-sized world,
in this leopard poop-sized country

334
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:59,033
he'll see a small person the size
of a leopard's poop saving people.

335
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:03,534
God will say "Oh, I am so busy, so

336
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
thank you for helping me
with my work".

337
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:11,066
He will say that you did well.
You will flourish.

338
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,334
I told you before

339
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,800
that the trees that you plant
will make big forests.

340
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:26,566
The days that you've lived
up till now will not disappear.

341
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,467
If you decide to be a human,

342
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:37,300
then I will be on your side.

343
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:44,766
Whatever the situation, I'll be
on your side no matter what.

344
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:54,600
I'll be your god.

345
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,266
I...

346
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:15,333
Yoon So-ah.

347
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:50,600
I'm his doctor.

348
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:59,333
Is this jealousy too?

349
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,667
I think it may be better than
not being jealous,

350
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,534
but I've never had
a jealous man before.

351
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,000
So I have no idea if you're being
jealous right now.

352
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,166
Did you wait
without eating anything?

353
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:45,134
Your face looks hungry.

354
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,766
I think it's too late for curry.
Sorry, but it'll be instant nood…

355
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:48,467
What are you doing?

356
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,700
Up to here.

357
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,367
I said it's up to here.

358
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,500
Why?

359
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,734
Why?

360
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,766
Nothing.

361
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,600
Should we continue?

362
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,566
No, no.

363
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,934
Candy is not something
you just bite into all at once.

364
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,433
- What?
- Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

365
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:18,500
What is he saying?

366
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:24,567
Is he possibly teasing me?

367
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,300
He's a complete player.

368
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:02,334
10,001, 10,002, 10,003.
Lord Ha Baek...

369
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,033
Keep going.

370
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,633
10,009, 10,010.

371
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:13,433
Lord Ha Baek,
why are you acting this way?

372
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:27,700
Tree water is definitely the best
for thirst. My thirst is gone.

373
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:54,767
What are you doing?

374
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,200
Up to here.

375
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:58,700
I said up to here.

376
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,700
Why?

377
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,300
Why, why did I say why?

378
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:40,333
Why?

379
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:44,600
Oh nothing. Why are you so wet?

380
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:48,200
Annoyingly, I seem to be sweating.
I need to use your washroom.

381
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:49,100
What?

382
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:53,300
Why my washroom?
You have your rubber tub.

383
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:56,566
You said last time not to
sit in there.

384
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,334
Ah, no...that's...

385
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,933
Where is it?
Is it on the second floor?

386
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,367
- What?
- Nothing. I'm going to work.

387
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,667
Really?
Okay let's go home together later.

388
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:23,433
What? Okay.

389
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:31,033
I must be crazy.

390
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:38,500
What did that guy do to me
last night?

391
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:52,966
Can I see you briefly? You need to
see how your patient is doing.

392
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:20,400
Would you go to Songdo?
They were asking me to come but

393
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:23,234
I think you could go in my place.
Manager Kim will explain.

394
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,733
Yes.

395
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,433
- What's going on?
- Oh…

396
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,467
I have nothing more to say
about Block World.

397
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:50,000
It'd be a good idea to pass
the message along to the Chairman.

398
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:54,400
Okay.
That is, it's not about that.

399
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,300
Are you busy?

400
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,733
Do you have something to say
to Secretary Min?

401
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,034
Yes.

402
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,667
Why didn't you answer my calls?
You know that I called you a lot.

403
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:17,100
- Because I didn't want to.
- Why... Oppa?

404
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,033
Are we in consultation mode?

405
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:23,434
Are you the one who made
Yoon So-ah lose her clinic space?

406
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,334
Oh?

407
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,567
Yeah. How did you find out?

408
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:31,800
I didn't give you that information
so you could use it so despicably.

409
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:36,034
Despicable?
Is that why you're angry?

410
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,467
Don't say... Is it possible that
you also like Yoon So-ah?

411
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:43,600
I don't like anyone. I just want
you to become a decent human.

412
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:47,900
- Decent human?
- Call me when you've become one.

413
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:51,566
I have no further advice.
I'm very busy.

414
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,000
Also, your strategy was a failure.

415
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,633
I need to become a human?

416
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:03,933
That jerk.

417
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:11,234
The flower that we planted
has already become this big?

418
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,067
I gave it water every day and
a butterfly came and gave it love

419
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,667
so it blossomed like this.

420
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:21,700
There's nothing our Min
doesn't know.

421
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,766
Don't grow up too fast,
I'll be bored.

422
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,234
You had a kid guest with you.

423
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,966
You came.

424
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,333
Hello.

425
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:52,034
Min say hello. She's a doctor.

426
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,367
Hello.

427
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:55,700
Hello. You have a pretty name.

428
00:44:55,766 --> 00:45:00,234
Ajusshi, why did the doctor come here?

429
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,500
I'm not sick.

430
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,600
She has an appointment with me.

431
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,500
Appointment?

432
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:09,900
Is this doctor Miss Yoon So-ah?

433
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:14,800
Last time you said that you
needed to keep your appointment

434
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:18,900
and over the phone you said,
"Yes, Miss Yoon So-ah."

435
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,434
At that time you were very happy.

436
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,400
You and Yoon So-ah...

437
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:27,567
- Min.
- Yes?

438
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:30,034
Ah, is it a secret?

439
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,266
No, it's not anything like that.

440
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:45,966
Min needs to go now.

441
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,334
She's my neighbor's kid - and my only friend.

442
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,267
Her parents passed away and
she lives with her grandmother.

443
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,634
Her grandmother goes to
the hospital twice a month.

444
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,500
She comes along with her,
gets some air and then goes back.

445
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:03,167
She draws well.

446
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:06,900
She may not see with her eyes, but
sees everything with her heart.

447
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,800
Her eyes...

448
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,966
I did that.

449
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:28,234
When I came here, it was hard to
control my strength for many years.

450
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:34,167
I didn't know if something could
happen out of my control.

451
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:36,700
So I was nervous.

452
00:46:37,966 --> 00:46:43,533
The first day I went to the farm,
I saw Min swaddled up.

453
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:49,600
In the short while her grandmother
had left her by herself,

454
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:52,600
a wild dog attacked her. In my
haste to chase away the wild dog,

455
00:46:53,466 --> 00:46:54,633
I used my power.

456
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,733
The dog died and the baby

457
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:06,466
lost her eyes.

458
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,366
Min's life is my life.

459
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,766
I live thinking that way.

460
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,666
So-ah.

461
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,200
I've just decided something.

462
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:46,267
Yes?

463
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:50,266
It'd be okay for me to enjoy a bit
regardless of your intentions.

464
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:52,466
What?

465
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:57,633
There's something like that.

466
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:11,333
So-ah.

467
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:15,400
We've never met before, have we?

468
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:16,500
What?

469
00:48:16,566 --> 00:48:18,167
I mean

470
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:22,266
a long time ago,
a really long time ago,

471
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,166
I think we met once.

472
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:28,500
It's okay,

473
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:30,900
it's okay,

474
00:48:30,966 --> 00:48:32,166
stay still.

475
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:38,566
It's okay, it's okay, stay still.

476
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:49,866
Sir.

477
00:48:51,366 --> 00:48:52,734
The meeting is ready to start.

478
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,300
Okay.

479
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,133
I need to go. I'll see you later.

480
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,366
Yes. Yes?

481
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,966
Later?

482
00:49:04,966 --> 00:49:06,366
She called me over
and she's sleeping.

483
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,267
Why did you come again?

484
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,400
Yes? Me?

485
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,134
Yeah you.

486
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,234
I came to do a part-time job and
you told me to just sit here.

487
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,633
What did you say?

488
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:24,700
Ah, what did you say?

489
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,500
What did you say?

490
00:49:34,566 --> 00:49:38,733
What did you say? Speak loudly.

491
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,100
That person...

492
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:46,200
Oh, that person, what person?

493
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:48,866
That person

494
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,933
is the person who saved me.

495
00:49:58,033 --> 00:50:00,234
That person.

496
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,533
But...

497
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:14,500
What?

498
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:17,533
Now what are you saying?

499
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:28,866
I can't hear!

500
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,634
- Oh, when did you get here?
- A little while ago.

501
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,467
What kind of dream are you having
that's so intense?

502
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:38,634
Ah, I really, your landlady,
that woman. Why does she

503
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,300
follow me into my dreams to
brag about her boyfriend?

504
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:44,700
- What?
- It's unbelievable.

505
00:50:44,766 --> 00:50:47,700
It's enough to make a person
without a boyfriend feel so empty.

506
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:51,467
I thought it was a bad omen. I was
even going to read her fortune.

507
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:56,766
What age is she living in, for her
to go on about a man saving her?

508
00:50:58,066 --> 00:51:01,867
You know, I think you really have
some mystical powers.

509
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,866
I'm hearing things that
I couldn't hear before.

510
00:51:15,566 --> 00:51:18,500
Oh yeah, the owner of the building
said that he'll drop by later.

511
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:19,967
Oh really? What am I going to do
about the state of this place?

512
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,500
Do we have anything to serve him?

513
00:51:22,566 --> 00:51:25,900
You could just go buy some
cold drinks.

514
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:30,267
Oh, Hyung-sik.

515
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,767
Why are you crying?

516
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,867
What? Your appendix burst?

517
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,400
Oh, oh, oh.

518
00:51:35,466 --> 00:51:37,967
Ok. I'll go right away.

519
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:39,300
What hospital are you at?

520
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:41,000
Hey. Hey!

521
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,333
That guy.

522
00:52:06,866 --> 00:52:10,966
Why is he like that over
a burst appendix?

523
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:25,300
Is this the only rag there is?

524
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:31,034
Would he have left to come
pick me up?

525
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,833
I'll ask him to bring me more rags
when he comes.

526
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,700
Why am I like this?

527
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,334
(Water Ghost)

528
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,300
(My Servant)

529
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,367
Why do you look like that?

530
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:06,000
I...

531
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,000
did it for fun.

532
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,433
Why?

533
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,900
Ah, it's nothing.

534
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:27,433
Am I handsome?

535
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:36,033
Ah...it's...

536
00:53:36,766 --> 00:53:40,900
when you come,
bring a couple rags.

537
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,266
I asked you if I'm handsome.

538
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:51,966
Ah! I'm hanging up!

539
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:04,167
This guy, really...

540
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:07,800
What did he do to me last night?

541
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,033
I must have been possessed by
a lustful demon.

542
00:54:18,366 --> 00:54:21,567
Why does this woman keep
losing her mind?

543
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,633
Whom does she dare to
ask to bring rags...

544
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,766
You.

545
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:31,767
How did you get in here?

546
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,500
Don't you think it's weird to
ask it that way?

547
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:38,333
I can go anywhere. I'm a god.

548
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,167
Do you think I want to see your
face right now? I came because

549
00:54:44,233 --> 00:54:47,734
Moo Ra told me to. She told me to
hear what you had to say.

550
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,700
- How is Jin Geon?
- He's alright.

551
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,166
Whatever Jin Geon says,

552
00:54:52,566 --> 00:54:54,066
Mo Myeong's death is my fault.

553
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,766
I'm the original cause of it.

554
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,867
The one who caused it all, without
even knowing that he caused that,

555
00:55:01,933 --> 00:55:06,433
has been living without any blame.

556
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,966
This is what makes you angry,
isn't it?

557
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:13,933
I'm sorry.

558
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,033
These are the words

559
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,900
that Moo Ra told you to hear,
isn't it?

560
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:23,600
That guy

561
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,634
was probably trying to
protect Nak Bin because

562
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:33,300
she was the first human woman
he met in thousands of years.

563
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:41,600
I don't know about that part.
I need some time.

564
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,400
Just a second.

565
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:54,600
He didn't ask you for money
with this kind of face?

566
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,934
- He did.
- He did? And?

567
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,500
I asked him who carries
cash around these days?

568
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:01,467
- And?
- Then he said to give him a card,

569
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:04,400
and if I didn't have that,
a diamond.

570
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:08,767
When I told him no, he said,
"this is a king's command."

571
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,966
Unbelievable.
Definitely don't give it to him.

572
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:14,234
You too, shouldn't listen to him.

573
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,200
You said you wouldn't take him to
the farm, but you did in the end.

574
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:22,033
That was the last time. I'm going
to torture him and send him back.

575
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:27,033
What?

576
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,900
- Can I kiss you?
- Do you want me to

577
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:30,900
- freeze your tongue?
- Just once.

578
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:31,666
Get going.

579
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:37,466
Oh. You want to go home and
do something more risque?

580
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,700
Should I tell him not to come?

581
00:56:55,766 --> 00:57:01,000
Should I tell him to start
going home with me tomorrow?

582
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:08,466
(Nurse Yoo)

583
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,733
Hyung-sik is okay.

584
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:17,533
But, the drinks for
the building owner...

585
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:22,233
This guy, he gives me a headache.

586
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:39,000
What? Bring some rags?

587
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:44,700
Who does this woman think I am?

588
00:57:58,166 --> 00:57:59,366
Why are you here?

589
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,567
I came to introduce myself as
the building owner.

590
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:02,700
Building owner?

591
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:06,467
What is that?

592
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:07,867
There's something like that.
They say that a building owner

593
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:13,100
is above the creator.
Can wield great power at times.

594
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:16,566
Building owner or creator, get lost.

595
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:23,034
Even though I've already said
this to So-ah, I'll say it again.

596
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,067
The thing I'm best at in this world
is waiting.

597
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:27,767
What?

598
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,000
You can't go against
time or gravity.

599
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:32,267
When time passes,
you'll have to go back

600
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:35,633
and I'll keep living here.
That's what I mean.

601
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,933
And...?

602
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:45,434
I'll do the things that someone
who cannot be with her

603
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:55,200
forever cannot do. And luckily,
I possess everything she needs.

604
00:58:55,266 --> 00:58:57,200
What did you say?

605
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,233
Hey.

606
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,467
Why are you here?
It's not the day for our session.

607
00:59:07,533 --> 00:59:10,833
- I thought you knew I was coming.
- Yes?

608
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:16,467
The last time I saw you,
you didn't mention it.

609
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,266
Don't talk to him.

610
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:22,033
I'm telling you not to
talk with him.

611
00:59:24,466 --> 00:59:28,566
Lock the door and leave
the keys under the plant.

612
00:59:48,866 --> 00:59:52,600
Stop being angry.
You'll get into an accident.

613
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:03,233
Is this jealousy too?

614
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,266
This seems more like jealousy
than yesterday.

615
01:00:09,366 --> 01:00:13,666
In any case, you very handsome
when you're jealous.

616
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:23,466
Your angry face is also
very handsome.

617
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,667
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

618
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:31,967
Shall we go watch the sunset?

619
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:36,534
Let's go quickly. We don't know
when and how people will

620
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,200
come and spoil our fun. Let's go.

621
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,733
Over there.
The sun will set over there.

622
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:26,200
Let's watch it from over here.

623
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,266
It's a lingering picture,
the lingering picture of a day.

624
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,800
This is why people come see the
sunset even though they're busy.

625
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:02,867
Actually, I came here just once
with my parents.

626
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:07,767
At that time,
I didn't feel this way.

627
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:10,800
My dad kept saying that he felt
guilty that he left the kids

628
01:02:10,866 --> 01:02:17,000
at home and my mom was mad
at my dad for saying that.

629
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:23,166
They kept fighting and
I felt so nervous.

630
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,866
I ate a bowl of clam noodle soup
and went home.

631
01:02:38,233 --> 01:02:39,867
What are you thinking about?

632
01:02:39,933 --> 01:02:42,000
Tomorrow.

633
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,900
And the tomorrow after that,
and the tomorrow after that.

634
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,933
The tomorrow without me.

635
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:56,733
Let's just think about today
for today.

636
01:02:58,266 --> 01:03:01,567
Last time you came and
said something pretty cool.

637
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:03,967
About people who can live
the rest of their days

638
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:07,000
off the memories of today.

639
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:09,833
I did?

640
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:13,266
When?

641
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:17,733
You came once and said that.

642
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:45,666
I heard that if stories fade away
by sunlight, they become history,

643
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,500
if they are lit by moonlight,

644
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,200
they become legends.

645
01:03:55,366 --> 01:03:58,400
It seems that our story

646
01:03:58,466 --> 01:04:01,266
will become a legend.

647
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,133
(The Bride of Habaek)

648
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:27,767
- The messenger came.
- Prepare to return, Lord Ha Baek.

649
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:30,800
- Can I be greedy?
- I'm saying this just in case

650
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:33,000
but you know what will happen
if you don't go back, right?

651
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:34,934
- Let's be together.
- Okay.

652
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,034
If Ha Baek doesn't become king,
he'll cease to exist.

653
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,834
I don't want to witness
such a tragedy.

654
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,834
Don't be lonely for a long time.

655
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,200
Will you be able to stand
losing Ha Baek?

656
01:05:42,266 --> 01:05:45,434
I'll let you know something that
you don't know.

657
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,934
I heard that that person is
the person who saved me.

658
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,167
You'll die.

659
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:52,866
But the person who saved me...
