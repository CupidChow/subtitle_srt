He's woken up?

13
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,100
Go.

14
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:23,566
I can see the end now.

15
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:28,766
If you find that stone,
show it to me too.

16
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,000
It's probably another thing that
only you gods can see.

17
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,000
You were right.

18
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm going to leave,
while you belong to this world.

19
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,400
So we can't be
each other's happiness.

20
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:15,333
Since we have flightless wings

21
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,166
it's not right to think that
we can fly.

22
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:26,766
Ha Baek!

23
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,300

(Episode 10)

26
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,334
- Hospital?
- Yeah!

27
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,100
When I woke up I was in a hospital.
Someone found me and

28
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,767
brought me here. I didn't know who
I was or what had happened.

29
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:09,100
The man left his number so
I called but couldn't get through.

30
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,333
How did you end up at the temple?

31
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:16,334
After the hospital, I was homeless
for a bit and went to a salt farm.

32
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,234
I was also at a donkey farm,
perilla farm, and a larva farm.

33
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,700
I went on some boats and worked as
a herbal remedy seller.

34
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:28,667
One day only! With this medicine,
your shoulder, knees, back...

35
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:32,034
I did some of that and
somehow I ended up at a temple.

36
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,434
You were struck by Bi Ryeom's
lightning bolt and collapsed,

37
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,734
but I don't understand how you
lost your memory.

38
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,733
It was CEO Sin's doing.

39
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,566
He confessed to Bi Ryeom.

40
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,100
The divine stone?

41
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,133
Finally.

42
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,267
Uh oh. Didn't you see my
divine crest?

43
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,434
You brought that with you?

44
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,600
Why did you bring something
like that?

45
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,767
I was told to bring it.
Did you leave it behind too?

46
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:49,700
Yeah.

47
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,200
What use would there be
in bringing it here?

48
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,967
You're just as stuck in your ways
as Ha Baek.

49
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:59,933
I knew I was missing something.
Where did I leave it?

50
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:04,667
Why do you keep going back there?
And why are you following him?

51
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,234
Just stay with us. It's not like
we're going to be here for long.

52
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,400
I heard that Ha Baek's house has
open air all around.

53
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,600
Your and your husband's house has
walls on all sides so it's stuffy.

54
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,333
What?

55
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,700
Are you crazy? Husband?

56
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:33,534
Am I confused because it's been
so long? When you were fighting,

57
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,534
You said you were engaged to
Bi Ryeom, but haven't spent

58
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,000
a night together yet, so since you
met him that night, you were...

59
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,033
Hey!

60
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,400
Do you want to
get your tongue shattered?

61
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,600
By the way,
Bi Ryeom is acting strangely.

62
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,267
He's being overly sensitive
and hostile towards CEO Sin.

63
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,267
I think he keeps
purposely provoking him.

64
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,500
He can't exactly be friendly.

65
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:12,666
And on the other hand, what's
the use of being overtly hostile?

66
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,534
It's not like he's in the gods'
realm, what does it matter here?

67
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,067
You said that he's the one
who made Joo Dong that way.

68
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:24,534
That's only half-right. He did
use his powers but not on purpose.

69
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,734
He probably did it without knowing
because he was frightened.

70
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,334
Bi Ryeom thinks he did it
on purpose.

71
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,534
If he keeps going this way,
he's going to cause a problem.

72
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,600
But does that person fall into
the category of human or god?

73
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,467
If he's human,
you're not supposed to harm him.

74
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:42,200
That's why I'm worried.

75
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,600
Is it here?

76
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,066
Yes. This way.

77
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,666
It looks like
the descendant is back.

78
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,567
Hm...

79
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:06,167
- I like it. What about the owner?
- Should I call her?

80
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,700
Just leave her be.
I think she's sleeping.

81
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,633
She would be happy to know that
we've found the divine stone.

82
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,366
Then I'll be going.

83
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,166
Gods' servant.

84
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,700
Bi Ryeom probably pushed the Queen
of the West to create something

85
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,500
like that. There were quite a few
gods who were against it.

86
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,934
Moo Ra was also one of them.
I thought it was unfair to make

87
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,333
a human pay the price of a mistake
made by the king of Heaven.

88
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,167
Are you okay?

89
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,634
What?

90
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,100
About the gods' servant.

91
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,767
I know it was erased from
your memory...

92
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,733
Did you hear about
the servant of the gods?

93
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:56,934
You mean how they promised to be
gods' servants for generations.

94
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,934
If you're in a bad situation, go
find a descendant of that family.

95
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,700
I don't know if the high priest is
right in acting like

96
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:06,734
he knows nothing and playing along
with you You know pain is...

97
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm not pretending I don't know,
I really did forget everything.

98
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,067
The moon has
waxed and waned 1200 times.

99
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:22,100
Whether I fight it, or resist it.

100
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,233
With that much time, it's logical
that it'll become insignificant.

101
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,534
The high priest...
he should know as much, right?

102
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,034
You found all the divine stones.
Why is your face like that?

103
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,234
And what's with Moo Ra?

104
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,500
She's all flustered about
not being able to send you back.

105
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,733
She's already asked
a couple of times.

106
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,534
Are you leaving already?

107
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,766
Yes, I have work to do.

Two Americanos, light.
Is that correct?

I think I should ask.

00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,067
Donate my talent?

161
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,600
Much of a hotelier's work involves
service among other things.

162
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,467
There's a significant amount of
emotional labor involved.

163
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,534
This is especially true
for operators.

164
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,233
They have to lower themselves
to guests no matter what.

165
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Treat my employees' work stress
as a psychiatric professional.

166
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,233
How does once a week sound?

167
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,334
Yes, then, what about
the other half?

168
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,000
I decided to receive 30% through
farm labor.

169
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:58,000
Last time you told me to
call you if I needed a worker.

170
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,367
I was going to use you for free
back then

171
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,733
but I generously decided to take
that off your cancellation fee.

172
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:09,066
And the last 20% will be for
being my doctor.

173
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,000
Excuse me?

174
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:12,934
I still cannot sleep at night.

175
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,034
I'd like an appointment for the
afternoon the day after tomorrow.

176
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,600
Payment for farm labor and medical
care will be paid from my account.

177
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,766
It'll be deposited to the Very One
account under your name.

178
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:27,800
Where in the world is he?

179
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,134
I'm right here.

180
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,767
Oh, you scared me.

181
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,333
Where did he pop out from?

182
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,700
Come closer.

183
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:40,867
What's the matter?

184
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,500
I have something to ask you.

185
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:44,366
Go ahead.

186
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Why are your eyes...

187
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,766
Have a seat.

188
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,133
What's wrong?

189
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,134
Did you go to church this week?

190
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,700
Of course I did. Are you
planning on attending my church?

191
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,567
Just go to a church near
your house.

192
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,234
No, not that.

193
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,200
Then, did they come too?

194
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,667
Are you asking me to give you
dating tips?

195
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:21,566
No. Not dating.
I just have something to ask you.

196
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,967
If a man suddenly hugs a woman
from the back, what does it mean?

197
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:30,300
- That's sexual assault.
- I don't mean that.

198
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:33,334
Did it happen to you? You
should've turned and socked him.

199
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,100
No, he's not that kind of person.

200
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,067
No, why would CEO Sin

201
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:47,000
hug me from behind?

202
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,600
Well that was for nothing.

203
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:53,000
You seemed out of it yesterday.
You should go get some more sleep.

204
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,733
Hey. Do you not believe me?

205
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:05,000
What do I do?

206
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:09,833
Wait,

207
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,734
isn't that Yoon So-ah?

208
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Yes, it's her.

209
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,666
Do you know her?

210
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:18,666
What is their relationship that
they've got that mood about them?

211
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:22,267
You haven't heard the news yet,
right?

212
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,666
The contract for Block World in
Gangwon has been rescinded.

213
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,666
What?

214
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:31,034
It's amazing, truly amazing.

215
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,900
What? It's to be moved to
Chungcheong Province?

216
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:34,200
Because of Yoon So-ah?

217
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:35,200
Hello?

218
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:38,100
Grandfather, do you have land in
Chungcheong Province?

219
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,333
It turned out well.

220
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,500
To be honest, this has been
the luckiest situation of my life.

221
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:56,600
It's the first time I'll be busy
in awhile.

222
00:22:57,566 --> 00:23:00,700
Why in the world doesn't that
woman want to sell her land?

223
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:03,233
How would I know?

224
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,334
What did you say about that land?

225
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,934
Didn't you say they had
a hard time finding a buyer?

226
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,834
Ah, yes.

227
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,400
It's been on the market for a bit
for lower than the usual price.

228
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:19,534
Because it was by the road, they
also offered a great price for it.

229
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,534
What a weird person...

230
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,300
Chairman,
I need to take this call.

231
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:29,267
So, do you have land in
Chungcheong Province or not?

232
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,300
They said they're going to
construct at another location.

233
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,200
What land would I have in
Chungcheong Province?

234
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:34,367
What the heck?

235
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:37,434
You always bragged about how you
have land in all eight provinces.

236
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,034
So how come you don't have
any land in Chungcheong Province?

237
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,666
What have you been doing all this
time instead of buying land there?

238
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,766
Chairman,

239
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:50,434
Team Leader Lee from Very One said

240
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,100
that woman, after stamping
the contract to sell the land,

241
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,734
she suddenly changed her mind.

242
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,834
What? Why?

243
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,633
Because of leopard's... poop.

244
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,733
What?

245
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,300
What... poop?

246
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:10,300
- Leopard's poop.
- What the heck?

247
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,134
Hey Sang-yoo, starting today
I'm going to work at a 2nd job.

248
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,233
Doc.

249
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,866
Why are you here?

250
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,634
I would've already wrecked the
place had I known you were here.

251
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,333
- What?
- I forgot why I don't like you.

252
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:35,900
You have nothing, yet you you
appear to have it all.

253
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:39,634
With that innocent face of
yours, you attract attention

254
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,634
and pretend you're different
from everyone and special.

255
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,200
You pretend to be
something you're not.

256
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:48,100
Shin Ja-ya, who are you
talking about right now?

257
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,167
I forgot about it,
but when I saw him,

258
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:53,167
I suddenly remembered.
Him. He's that beggar kid

259
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:57,234
who used to mooch off you at
your house, right?

260
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Watch your mouth.

261
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,367
You said you wouldn't sell the
land because of leopard poop!

262
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,800
What?

263
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,567
That's why
you're the unfortunate one.

264
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,634
What's so special about
that leopard poop

265
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,500
when you can't even
pay your rent? You're so clueless.

266
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:16,267
What's with the pig snorting?

267
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,600
What's this? It's Shin Ja-ya!

268
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:19,267
Jo Yeom-mi?

269
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:22,800
It's been a while, but it's not
nice to see you. Why are you here?

270
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:28,167
We have all the variety here.

271
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:31,400
A beggar, an eyesore,
and a shaman?

272
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:35,333
It's not like
it's a countryside fair.

273
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,767
What's that, that, what was it?

274
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:43,200
If you just hire a street singer,
it will be perfect!

275
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:47,233
Ja-ya, are you bipolar?
Why are you being so dramatic?

276
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:52,167
Shin Ja-ya, you!

277
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,167
What?

278
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:56,100
There's a woman with long hair
behind you.

279
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,334
It's also on your leg.

280
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,266
She doesn't have a nose...

281
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,733
There is
a grandma standing there too!

282
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:16,233
Oh my goodness!

283
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,400
Hurry, let's go.

284
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,234
Give us something to drink.

285
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,866
Yes.

286
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:29,667
Grandfather, kick her out!

287
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,734
Rascal! Who are you to be telling
your grandfather what to do?

288
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,134
Grandfather,
there's a ghost in the building!

289
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,834
Be quiet!

290
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,767
You're going to make
the building's value fall.

291
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,766
Come home now!

292
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,767
It's so weird.

293
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,667
How did Shin Ja-ya know?

294
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:57,634
How did she know about my rent?
Has she been stalking me?

295
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,334
Why is she making a fuss?

296
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,834
She's getting prettier by the day.

297
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,667
Hey, do I look like I have a lot?

298
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,134
Do I attract people's attention
with a blank face?

299
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,834
Do I pretend to be special, like
I'm better than everyone else?

300
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,600
What did I do, seriously!

301
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,600
How would I know about
your high school days?

302
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:14,734
High school days?

303
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,167
Her stream of consciousness,
it's so high school.

304
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:21,100
She's like that because
you didn't do anything.

305
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:26,167
Like those kids who never study
but always get the best scores.

306
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,734
You hate them more because they don't do anything. It's probably like that.

307
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,367
Hey, I studied so hard!

308
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:34,333
I'm not talking about studying.

309
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,267
Why did you come here
without contacting me first?

310
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,534
- Why'd you appear in my dream?
- What?

311
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,067
Since I took this road, I've seen
everyone in my dreams except you.

312
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:49,700
But you came this morning, laughed
like a crazy woman, then left.

313
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:53,766
So I thought you were eating rice
cakes without me like last time.

314
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:58,134
On that note, you look like you
got sick after eating too many.

315
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,866
Is something wrong?

316
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
I'm just...

317
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,034
I'm in the middle of  figuring out
an extremely hard math equation.

318
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,767
You were good at math.

319
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,700
I was.

320
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:13,366
But this problem is a bit scary.

321
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,700
The answer is already determined,

322
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
but the process of solving it
doesn't match the answer.

323
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,000
Then your process of solving it
is probably wrong.

324
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,766
It's wrong.

325
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,400
That's why I have to find
a new method for x.

326
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:34,034
A process that results in
no one getting hurt.

327
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,633
No idea what you're saying,
but I do know math is innocent.

328
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,267
You're right.

329
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,833
Math is innocent.

330
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,934
Both he and I,

331
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,333
everybody is innocent.

332
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:57,333
Anyone without guilt should not
be punished.

333
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:05,200
Therefore, I must force innocent
math to pay the price of the sin.

334
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:14,367
I must think of a creative and
mind-blowing new process.

335
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,500
A solution that will cause you to
be dumbfounded.

336
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:22,333
A workup where no one gets hurt
in approaching an answer.

337
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:41,433
What is this?

338
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:45,734
I thought you stopped
pondering about how to get

339
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
your abilities back.
You made a big fuss about that.

340
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:51,133
Let's go.

341
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,100
Yoon So-ah.

342
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,366
Today,

343
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,634
I was solving
a math equation all day.

344
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
You know math right?

345
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:10,867
I have to find x, but the formulas
that exist don't work.

346
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:16,400
So I worked all day on making a
formula and found an answer for x.

347
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:24,233
The answer I found

348
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:30,366
is to stop here.

349
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,167
This problem has an answer
that is already determined

350
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:42,766
and a hint has been given
that it's not time to be expanding

351
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,833
but to be wrapping it up. I even
asked how it can be wrapped up.

352
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,733
The wrap-up has to be done well,
on good terms.

353
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,166
I'm asking you this favor.

354
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,633
That way,

355
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,300
I can live as a second-rate.

356
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:23,666
What do you want me to do?

357
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:30,866
Go back to how we were
before yesterday.

358
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,333
Let's go.

359
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,900
Are you
going out early today, too?

360
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:16,266
Yes. the clinic opens two hours
earlier now

361
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,866
because someone caused an incident
and I needed to wrap that up.

362
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:23,034
- What are you talking about?
- It's better for you not to know.

363
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Even if you did know,

364
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:29,400
there's nothing you can do for me.

365
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:33,300
I missed that arrogant gaze
of yours. It drives my competitive

366
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:37,100
nature. Alright, before I return,
I will do everything I can do.

367
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,733
- What do you need?
- 'Mo-ney.'

368
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:45,066
Let's pretend this conversation
never happened.

369
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,233
Before you leave, are you not
going to have a goodbye party?

370
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,100
You treat me.

371
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,334
You're the king now.

372
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,167
I have no 'mo-ney,' so I can't.

373
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:58,366
- Geez, then earn some.
- What?

374
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:12,266
(Ha Baek
Yoon So-ah)

375
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,134
The human world is more fun
than you'd think, isn't it?

376
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,667
That's the same thing
the high priest said.

377
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,534
Is it because of her?

378
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,266
How you don't look happy, even
though you found the divine stone.

379
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,300
And the reason that Moo Ra is
feeling insecure.

380
00:33:57,866 --> 00:34:00,400
About Moo Ra... I can understand.

381
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:05,567
When you were going through
all that, we were also struggling.

382
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,067
And you know Moo Ra hated
that woman.

383
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:12,934
- Stop it.
- You might not know this Ha Baek,

384
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,434
but I've always been on your side.

385
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,934
Your decisions were always correct

386
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,166
even if the decision led
to tragedy.

387
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,067
Do you know what the difference
between humans and us is?

388
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:28,334
Their lifespans are really short.
That's a human.

389
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,567
So even if they break the rules
at times, they get less criticism.

390
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,466
This is especially true when
they are in love with someone.

391
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,534
When they think about
how short their lives are,

392
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,000
they'll hold on tight to even
a flaming hot stone

393
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,600
saying things like,
"life is too short."

394
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:49,066
That girl seems like she might be
an exception.

395
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:53,100
Shall I now address
your hesitation?

396
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:56,634
Right now you're wondering
whether your feelings are

397
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,633
sympathy towards a human or love.

398
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:05,200
You aren't sure.

399
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:10,034
But Ha Baek, the last time
you started this way too.

400
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,134
And the end result of that was
a disgrace.

401
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,333
I already told you, I even support
you in those kinds of decisions.

402
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:24,600
Moo Ra said that she'd buy us
a delicious lunch. I wonder...

403
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:00,566
Are you allowed to do this?

404
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,700
I don't know.

405
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:06,567
But who the heck is that guy?

406
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:07,533
I don't know.

407
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,667
I should've asked the granny
to do it instead.

408
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:13,734
I'd rather hit Bi Ryeom than
that guy.

409
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,367
Don't even say things like that.
You don't know if he's listening.

410
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:17,700
He should do this himself.
Why is he making us...

411
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:23,200
Oh. Oh no.

412
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,800
What? Is he not human?

413
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:29,134
I don't know. He must be
if he's spilling blood like that.

414
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,666
What is he?

415
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:53,166
It's me! It's me!

416
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,600
Isn't that Joo Geol Rin?

417
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,200
Leave quickly!

418
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:21,034
They're minor gods. I went to see
if I could get some food from them

419
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,134
and they happened to be
working on some secret plan.

420
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,934
I overheard them talking about
this place so I followed them.

421
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,500
Ah, you're bleeding a lot.

422
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:36,666
Why the hell are they doing this
to me?

423
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:42,533
I sent them.

424
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,367
You're right.
We're different from you.

425
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:47,767
That's how we are.

426
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:51,467
But those guys live recklessly.

427
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,767
They have no intention of going
back and have nothing to protect.

428
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,267
That's why it's too small
a retaliation for what you did to

429
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,333
my friend,
but let's call it even with this.

430
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,733
And

431
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,333
if you overstep your position
and threaten us again,

432
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:13,634
then don't even dream of
making it even then.

433
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,500
Why the hell are you doing this
to me? Why me?

434
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:22,634
Don't look at me like that.

435
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,500
Just because I don't want revenge,
doesn't mean that I forgive you.

436
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:33,367
What are you doing in
such an uncivilized place?

437
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,833
You just got here?

438
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:41,700
If you felt the taste of
these gloves,you'd also know

439
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:43,700
how insignificant our powers are.

440
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:57,867
Since when did he stop speaking?

441
00:39:57,933 --> 00:40:00,500
Since you froze his tongue
and smashed it into pieces.

442
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,500
I thought he had a twin.

443
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,367
Was his name Mo Myeong?

444
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:07,200
Did he not come too?

445
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:10,166
Actually, I haven't seen him
for a few hundred years.

446
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,333
Let's go.

447
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:25,834
I don't think it's a good idea
to meet him.

448
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,666
You said you wouldn't become
the dark within the darkness.

449
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,666
Please.

450
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,866
(Lane Departure Alert System)

451
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,333
Be careful!
You're going over the line!

452
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,600
Eating for fun

453
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:19,666
and eating when you're hungry,
what's the difference?

454
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,833
Therefore you should go back
right away.

455
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:27,500
I said that he doesn't seem to
want to return right away.

456
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:35,566
Yes?

457
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,633
You're getting a house?

458
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,333
No, cancel it.

459
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,333
Just a minute.

460
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:51,133
Our servant seems quite skilled.

461
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:54,767
I heard she returned the land.

462
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,767
The business plans have
been cancelled.

463
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:00,100
Other landowners were very much
against it.

464
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:04,100
What are you talking about?

465
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:08,533
Why is it that you always
know everything?

466
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,466
I have nothing else to do.

467
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:19,734
More importantly, with
his strong spirit, I didn't think

468
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,833
he'd give up so easily. How did
Yoon So-ah convince him?

469
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:27,766
From your expression, doesn't
seem like the land is the issue.

470
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:33,034
If you don't want to get your
hands bloody, tell me any time.

471
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,534
I have lots of methods.

472
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,634
Why did he become so twisted?

473
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,066
By nature he is twisted.

474
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,867
Why?
Did you cause another problem?

475
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:47,734
What secret code are you speaking
in? You're leaving me out.

476
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,534
So, when are you going back?

477
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,500
Ah, really.

478
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:55,700
Why do you keep repeating the
same words like a broken record?

479
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,134
You're being an eyesore.

480
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,634
He's not a kid. He'll leave when
it's time to leave.

481
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,166
Not like he doesn't know what
will happen if he doesn't go back.

482
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,467
I'll leave first. I heard you're
taking a trip somewhere?

483
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:14,434
Yeah, it'll take a couple of days.
Don't leave before I get back.

484
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,667
You don't have to wait.

485
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,633
I'll see you when you return.

486
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:32,367
More importantly, with
his strong spirit, I didn't think

487
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:35,566
he'd give up so easily. How did
Yoon So-ah convince him?

488
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:40,100
Yoon So-ah is the first
during my time here

489
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,600
that I've most ardently desired.

490
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:46,267
What nonsense are you saying?
She is a servant of the gods.

491
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:50,000
I heard you're going back.
So-ah called you a passing breeze.

492
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:57,100
Or rather, what she actually
said was a wind that has stopped.

493
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,600
Why are you being that way
with Ha Baek?

494
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:14,700
You're impossible. You're
the same as when you were a child.

495
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:17,634
How can you be so irrational,
irresponsible, and selfish?

496
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:23,666
You're overreacting. I can say
things like that to Ha Baek.

497
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:28,900
That's what I'm saying. He's
letting it go because it's you!

498
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,400
Because it's him! If you were
an inferior god or a rookie,

499
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:33,767
if that relationship didn't exist,
do you think

500
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,800
the Water Kingdom would accept
your unreasonable behavior?

501
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:41,900
Are you mad because I upset Ha Baek?

502
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:44,400
Or is it because he doesn't want to leave,

503
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:53,334
so he might use
my words as an excuse to stay

504
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,100
until the last minute?
Stop beating around the bush.

505
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,767
Stop pretending to be
a mature adult.

506
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:00,734
What are you talking about?

507
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,434
Say that So-ah makes you nervous,
that you think she may already be

508
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,167
in Ha Baek's heart.
That you can't lose him again!

509
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:11,800
Ask me to find some way like
I have been all this time.

510
00:45:11,866 --> 00:45:13,766
Are you crazy?

511
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:18,600
I may have fond feelings
towards Yoon So-ah

512
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,700
but between the two of you
I wouldn't hesitate.

513
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:24,000
So don't worry about it and just
tell me. I have a lot of methods.

514
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:30,666
Why are you like this?

515
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:40,366
You did as you pleased,
but you were never this insecure.

516
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:49,600
Did you change after that
half-god, half-human appeared?

517
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:59,066
What did that person stir up?
What is it that I don't know?

518
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,433
Thank you, young man.

519
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:28,400
Young man, wait a second!

520
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:04,833
Yes. Right here.

521
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,700
If you've done the work,
then you should get the pay.

522
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:27,700
Is it your first time working?
And first time earning money.

523
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:31,100
If I have lived this long,
I am almost a psychic.

524
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:35,600
With your first paycheck, you
buy your parents red underwear.

525
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:39,634
However, you look like you don't
have any parents to give it to.

526
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:46,034
Try your best. If you do,
something good will happen.

527
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,534
I found a diamond ring before.
I gave it to a patrol officer.

528
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,533
If the owner appears, good.
If not, it's even better. You see?

529
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:11,533
Take a look here.

530
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:20,067
It's cute isn't it? I designed
them with my friend.

531
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:24,633
Right here. There's an old saying
that chipped china is unlucky.

532
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:31,600
- Does this cover it?
- It's not enough.

533
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:34,833
(100% handmade)

534
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,333
Shall I pose for some pictures
for you?

535
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:33,534
Shall I make an appointment for
Wednesday next week?

536
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,533
- Yes. I'll see you next week.
- Sure.

537
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,533
Goodbye.

538
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:46,267
Did you make an appointment for
Kim Cho-hee for next Wednesday?

539
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:49,100
- Yes. We can pay rent this month.
- Oh, really?

540
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:55,334
Ma Bong-yeol referred a lot of
people to us.

541
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,300
Oh.

542
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:01,000
(Water Ghost)

543
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,700
Aren't you going to answer it?

544
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:07,266
Hello?

545
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:13,167
Give me an iced Americano please.

546
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,500
Give me an iced caffe latte please.

547
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:41,233
Why does he keep looking around
like a kid?

548
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:48,200
He must be really curious.
I can just tell now from his face.

549
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,600
Why do you keep looking around?
Do you want something to drink?

550
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:23,766
- I'm not going to drink anything.
- I'm going to order as I please.

551
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:32,566
Please give me a hot Americano
and an iced Americano.

552
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:42,766
Yes.

553
00:52:56,233 --> 00:53:00,600
What's this? Why's it black water?
There are other good colors.

554
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,700
- I thought you were curious.
- Me?

555
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:07,200
No way. I'm thinking that
it's strange, not curious.

556
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:09,367
ROYGBIV. There are seven colors
and even a rainbow to choose from.

557
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,434
Why is the water murky?

558
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,434
You're really talking a lot now.

559
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,034
Talking too much means there's
something you want to talk about.

560
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,267
I don't know the reason is but
I know there's something.

561
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,367
Isn't it bitter?

562
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:26,600
It's bitter. It's bitter, sour,
chalky, and a little sweet.

563
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,733
Your tastebuds are amazing.

564
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:32,767
How interesting.
I think I should come here often.

565
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:37,266
Dream big. Tell me what
you really want to say.

566
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,766
What is it?

567
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:55,434
Are you giving this to me?
Could it possibly be a present?

568
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,267
You said that it's unlucky to
use chipped ones.

569
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:03,367
Don't be so touched by it. I got
it to remind you of your place.

570
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:05,800
- Remind me?
- Watch closely.

571
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,800
This is you. It's a living being
that wags its tail at its owner.

572
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:17,800
Owner. Servant.

573
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:20,634
So this is you, natural man?

574
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,367
That's right. You're teased to
high heaven right?

575
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:25,334
That's why her name is Yong Yong.

576
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,000
I named her.

577
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:31,166
Every time you use these, don't
forget that you're the servant.

578
00:54:44,633 --> 00:54:48,266
This woman is
embarrassing me again.

579
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:50,634
Then, what is this?

580
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,666
Does this mean that you'll be
my servant?

581
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:59,100
Yong Yong. Yong Yong. Yong Yong...

582
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,100
I'm going to take it back.

583
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,467
Why are you doing that? It's mine.

584
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:04,333
Why are taking back
a present you gave? This is mine.

585
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:07,067
But where did you get the money
for it?

586
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:08,733
Did Nam Soo Ri give you
some money?

587
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:11,233
I did that part-time job thing,
two of them.

588
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:14,633
What did you do?

589
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,533
You picked up used cardboard boxes
to resell?

590
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:27,833
Also

591
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,534
I let them take some pictures.

592
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,266
They let me take a couple
as souvenirs.

593
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,367
Are you touched?

594
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:40,266
A lot.

595
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:44,566
Also, this stuffed animal is
pretty too.

596
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:47,366
I'm leaving first.

597
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:51,500
Why? I said it was pretty!

598
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:53,200
Am I not even allowed to say
that it's pretty?

599
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,167
Yong Yong, take my
cups home safely. Got it?

600
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:59,467
He's so clueless. How'd he take
pictures and not see?

601
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:01,433
He must only see what
he wants to see.

602
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:05,267
Doctor, I'm leaving.

603
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,167
Is it really ok for me to leave
before you?

604
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:09,767
Ask CEO Sin to come
half an hour early.

605
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:10,600
Just go.

606
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,567
Why did Hyung-sik choose today
of all days to...

607
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:13,734
I said to go.

608
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,666
I'll see you tomorrow.

609
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,134
That Hyung-sik.

610
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,700
You could at least show me
his face.

611
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:31,600
(Doctor Yoon So-ah)

612
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:10,567
If you overstep your position
and threaten us again,

613
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:14,333
then don't even dream of
making it even.

614
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,766
Ha Baek is just as you see him
and I'm very simple.

615
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,200
I hate you.

616
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:31,467
I will also continue
hating you a lot in the future.

617
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:36,166
Because I'm different from
you people?

618
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,333
Let's say that's half the reason.

619
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:51,500
I heard that you can only
kill or destroy.

620
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:53,200
I heard that you hate the gods.

621
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:54,767
I heard that you even killed a
couple of gods in the gods' realm.

622
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,267
I've never done anything
like that.

623
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,200
Even though you're only half,
did you want to prove you were

624
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:01,500
a god that badly?

625
00:58:12,366 --> 00:58:14,466
(Doctor Yoon So-ah)

626
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,766
Did something happen?

627
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:30,700
You must have come by yourself?

628
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
Can I join you?

629
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:42,433
It looks like someone's been
trying to call you for a while.

630
00:58:51,266 --> 00:58:53,333
(Doctor Yoon So-ah)

631
00:59:02,433 --> 00:59:03,600
Hello?

632
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:07,833
Oh, CEO Sin!
Why aren't you coming?

633
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:09,833
Hello?

634
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:12,067
I'm sorry.

635
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,967
If today is too difficult, shall I
reschedule your appointment?

636
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,400
No, I'll head over there now.

637
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,600
I'm sorry.

638
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:25,233
Is he ill?

639
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:36,666
When are you going back to
the Water Kingdom?

640
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:40,500
Are you really going to wait
until Joo Dong gets back?

641
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:46,600
The descendant seems to be
out late today.

642
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,433
(Water Ghost)

643
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:02,634
- Hello?
- Why aren't you coming home?

644
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,734
I'm still not finished.
My patient is a bit late.

645
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,967
He said that he's on his way,
so when I'm finished...

646
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:09,267
CEO Sin.

647
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:10,800
I'll talk to you later.

648
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:16,666
CEO Sin.

649
01:00:19,266 --> 01:00:21,166
CEO Sin.

650
01:00:21,866 --> 01:00:23,400
Oh!

651
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:27,200
When did this guy drink so much...

652
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:30,200
CEO. Get a hold of yourself.

653
01:00:30,266 --> 01:00:31,200
Goodness.

654
01:00:50,933 --> 01:00:52,034
Give me some money.

655
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,600
Pardon?

656
01:01:13,066 --> 01:01:15,867
CEO Sin. CEO Sin.

657
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:18,233
Please get a hold of yourself.

658
01:01:21,466 --> 01:01:23,233
This is a big problem.

659
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:26,666
I can't give him fever medication
because he's been drinking.

660
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,534
We don't care about you either.

661
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,367
But I need to confirm something.

662
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:43,034
If my suspicions are correct,

663
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:47,466
you yourself will prove that you
are the monster of those rumors.

664
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,533
His fever is not going down.

665
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,233
What are you talking about?

666
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,333
CEO Sin.

667
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:40,566
Yoon So-ah.

668
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,266
I'm sorry.

669
01:04:46,366 --> 01:04:48,266
(The Bride of Habaek)

670
01:04:48,266 --> 01:04:50,167
- Is it okay to be irresponsible?
- What are we?

671
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,367
She asked me what we are.

672
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,134
If I have to ask one thing of you,

673
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,300
Gaining that woman

674
01:04:55,366 --> 01:04:56,934
whether I want you to hold onto me

675
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,134
is that permitted?

676
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,634
or ask to let me go.

677
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,434
- I want to hold you.
- Don't do it.

678
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,134
I want to kiss you.

679
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,534
Let's just stay like this.

680
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,700
Thinking it over a hundred, a
thousand times, this isn't right.

681
01:05:07,766 --> 01:05:09,100
I want you to be my beginning...

682
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:11,267
I'm telling you to let Ha Baek go.

683
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,434
and my end.

684
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,367
He's in love with you.

685
01:05:14,433 --> 01:05:16,700
Can I begin?
