=Episode 22=

4
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,914
I'll be leaving now.

5
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,154
Say goodbye to Ms. Li.

6
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:46,955
Goodbye, Ms. Li.

7
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,035
Remember how to say it in English?

8
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,035
See you next time.

9
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,235
So clever!

10
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:57,595
But, there won't be a next time.

11
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:59,115
Why?

12
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:02,794
Because Ms. Li has done

13
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:03,634
her part.

14
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,235
Thank you, Ms. Li,

15
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:09,835
for your care for the children

16
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:10,794
all these while.

17
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:13,674
Not at all.

18
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,155
I'm the one who's been troubling you.

19
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:17,914
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,074
I'll miss you all.

21
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:23,595
Ms. Li, I'll miss you too.

22
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:24,954
Really?

23
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:25,954
Yes, really.

24
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:27,514
No, you won't.

25
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,435
You'll have a new teacher soon,

26
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:30,715
and you'll forget about me.

27
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,875
I won't.

28
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:32,954
You won't?

29
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,394
Say goodbye to Ms. Li.

30
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,475
Goodbye, Ms. Li.

31
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:38,715
Goodbye.

32
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,435
Mrs. Gao.

33
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:42,794
Gao Ping.

34
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:43,995
I get to go now.

35
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:08,634
Mum, why did Ms. Li say
I'd forget her?

36
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,394
Because you'll meet many new friends,

37
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:17,555
and some will be
people you like too, right?

38
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,794
I won't forget her.

39
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:24,794
It'd be better if you could forget her.

40
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,035
Why?

41
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,035
Because Mum doesn't like her.

42
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:28,794
Why?

43
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,954
Why doesn't Mum like her?

44
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,435
It's not that I dislike Ms. Li.

45
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,354
Ms. Li is excellent.

46
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,035
Then, I don't understand now.

47
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,074
Look, it's like this.

48
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,834
You and your sister

49
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,275
are in kindergarten now, right?

50
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:46,834
You have teachers

51
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,234
and friends in your kindergarten, right?

52
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:49,435
After this,

53
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,875
you'll go to primary school,

54
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:54,354
then middle school,
high school, and university.

55
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,954
You'll make new friends

56
00:03:57,674 --> 00:03:59,914
and meet new teachers.

57
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,114
You will meet

58
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,315
your favorite teacher too, right?

59
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:04,234
There will always be new coming in.

60
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,114
But, they won't always stay with you.

61
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,155
But, this handcrafted family portrait

62
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,394
that you made with your sister
is a different concept.

63
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,354
We are family,

64
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:18,035
and family will always,
always be together.

65
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,514
Do you understand?

66
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:20,794
Yes, I understand.

67
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:21,875
That's good.

68
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:26,195
Where are you going?

69
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,634
Mr. Lu is in a rush
to discuss the project.

70
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,195
Where will you go?

71
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,555
Anyway, it's not
a hot spring this time.

72
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:39,435
Come on, Cong and Qi.

73
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:41,154
Say goodbye to Dad.

74
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,235
Dad is leaving.

75
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,394
Stay well at home.

76
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:48,634
Stay well at home.

77
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,474
You must listen to Mum.

78
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:52,315
Dad,

79
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,675
can't you stay?

80
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,034
I'll be back soon.

81
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:05,875
Very soon.

82
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,995
Dad, when is 'soon'?

83
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:24,954
It's soon.

84

(Ultrasound Report
of Gynecologic Examination)

85
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,034
Mum, mum.

86
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,675
I finished my drawing.

87
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:38,514
Yeah.

88
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,074
Look how beautiful it is!

89
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:40,795
Yeah.

90
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,074
It's so pretty.

91
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:45,875
How about drawing one more?

92
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:47,714
Alright.

93
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,394
(Xiang Qian: Can you
tell me what this is?)

94
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:32,995
Sorry.

95
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:34,074
The subscriber you dialed

96
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:35,315
can not be connected for the moment.

97
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:17,235
Hello?

98
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,634
Qian, are you home?

99
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:19,795
Yes, I'm home.

100
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,594
I'm in Shanghai for an interview today.

101
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:23,594
Great!

102
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,115
Are you still in Shanghai?

103
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:26,235
Yes.

104
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:27,555
That's good.

105
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:28,875
That's just in time.

106
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:30,034
Can you come over?

107
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,074
I urgently need to go out

108
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:32,915
and settle something.

109
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,235
There's no one to watch
the kids at home.

110
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:35,034
What's wrong?

111
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:36,115
Did anything happen?

112
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,354
Just come over quickly.

113
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,155
Where's Gao Ping's Aunty?

114
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,074
She went back to her hometown.

115
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:45,114
What happened? Where's Gao Ping?

116
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:46,994
Don't ask too many questions.
Just come over now.

117
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:10,635
Hello?

118
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,754
Hello, are you Xu Lihong?

119
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:14,915
Yes, I am.

120
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,275
Who is this speaking?

121
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:18,555
I'm a friend of Li Shu.

122
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:19,675
Hmm,

123
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:21,515
I tried calling her,
but she didn't answer.

124
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:25,195
We had a meal with Dayuan them all.

125
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:26,754
Dayuan gave me your number.

126
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,594
I have something urgent
to discuss with her.

127
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,515
If she is in the dorm now,

128
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,795
can you let her answer the call?

129
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,114
She's not here now.

130
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,275
She's out on a date.

131
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,795
Do you know where she went?

132
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,234
It might be Suzhou.

133
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,555
She left in a hurry.

134
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,675
I didn't ask her in detail.

135
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,515
Alright, thank you.

136
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,155
I'll try to contact her again.

137
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:07,354
Where are you going?

138
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,714
Mr. Lu is in a rush
to discuss the project.

139
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,275
Where will you go?

140
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:18,754
Anyway, it's not a hot spring this time.

(Suzhou Bay Hot Spring Resort)

142
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:10,874
Come on, Cong and Qi.

143
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:12,114
Dad is leaving.

144
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:16,714
Dad, can't you stay?

145
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,074
I'll be back soon.

146
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:24,435
Dad, when is 'soon'?

147
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:26,795
It's soon.

148
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:41,275
Hello?

Sorry to trouble you.

Please help the children

152
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:45,714
pack somethings

153
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,714
and bring them back
to their grandparents' house.

154
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:49,395
What happened?

155
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,074
Nothing, don't worry.

156
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:53,155
I have something urgent
to handle right now.

157
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:53,834
Oh yeah,

158
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,354
other than the clothes

159
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,315
and the toiletries,

160
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:58,435
bring them some picture books

161
00:11:58,714 --> 00:11:59,994
and their vitamins too.

162
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:00,834
You can ask Qi,

163
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:01,874
she knows where they are.

164
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,234
I'll hang up first.

165
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:04,315
Alright.

166
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:09,795
Qi, Cong,

167
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,515
let's go to the grandparents' house, okay?

168
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:12,035
Okay!

169
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:12,635
Okay.

170
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:40,474
Hi, madam.

171
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:41,555
Are you here to check in?

172
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:42,594
No.

173
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,234
I lost my card.

174
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,515
My husband isn't back yet.

175
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:46,994
I'd like to get
a replacement room card.

176
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:48,114
Sure, madam.

177
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:49,114
But, we have regulations here

178
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:50,555
that require you to cooperate
in providing proof.

179
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:51,354
Do you have

180
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,354
a marriage certificate
or similar document?

181
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:55,714
Yes, I have.

182
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:57,435
I have it stored on my phone.

183
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:00,195
We checked in earlier
using my husband's ID number.

184
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,074
Here's our marriage certificate,

185
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,515
and there's his ID number.

186
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:13,155
Alright.

00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:10,354
This is my wife.

192
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:12,795
We need to discuss something.

193
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:13,395
Excuse me.

194
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:16,195
Let's talk outside.

195
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:18,915
Li Shu,

196
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:20,795
you come out too.

197
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:30,555
What's wrong?

198
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,114
What is this?

199
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:04,795
Your ultrasound report.

200
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:11,395
Why did Li Shu's ultrasound report

201
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:12,954
end up in our home?

202
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,594
How would I know?

203
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,035
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gao.

204
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,635
My boyfriend and I are still studying now.

205
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:24,675
We're not even thinking
about having kids.

206
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:26,555
We can't even afford to rent a place.

207
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:29,834
When I saw this report in your house,

208
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:32,594
I panicked and tossed it aside.

209
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:34,874
After all, it's an ultrasound report

210
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,354
of you and your boyfriend.

211
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,994
Why would you throw it in my home?

212
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:38,754
Why do you want

213
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:40,714
to express your upset at my home?

214
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,474
Couldn't you have thrown it
away somewhere else?

215
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,035
Are you doing this on purpose?

216
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:46,275
I...

217
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,915
I wasn't doing it on purpose, Mrs. Gao.

218
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:50,635
This is my very first time
experiencing this.

219
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,114
I just don't know what to do.

220
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,594
Why didn't you answer my calls?

221
00:15:57,234 --> 00:16:00,594
My boyfriend kept calling me
from yesterday,

222
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,474
so I put my phone
on Do Not Disturb mode.

223
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:04,114
I didn't know how to face him.

224
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,155
I am not asking you.

225
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:11,275
My phone is broken.

226
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:13,074
It got damaged when I got out of the car

227
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:14,714
and couldn't turn it on now.

228
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:15,874
Check it if you want.

229
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:29,354
Alright, Li Shu,

230
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,035
you may go back first.

231
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:31,035
You may go.

232
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,155
Mrs. Gao, I'm sorry.

233
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:38,635
There's nothing
you should apologize for.

234
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:39,954
You may go.

235
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:02,234
It is a late night now,

236
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:03,555
and you came all the way here,

237
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:05,555
getting yourself a room card

238
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:08,035
without even planning to knock.

239
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,195
What were you hoping to see?

240
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:13,714
This will only make Mr. Lu

241
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:15,635
and my classmates think badly of me.

242
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,915
Li Shu's phone was
on Do Not Disturb mode,

243
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:21,034
and it's just a coincidence
that yours was broken.

244
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:24,274
Then, I happened to see
this ultrasound report at home.

245
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,274
That's just too coincidental.

246
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,355
Do you think any woman
would be fine with this?

247
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:33,314
If this wasn't intentional,

248
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:33,994
then what was it?

249
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,115
Who did this on purpose?

250
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,514
Who has to do it deliberately?

251
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,195
Why does it have to be
someone else doing this intentionally?

252
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:40,274
Can't it be you the one
who is overthinking about it?

253
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:42,474
You've been
overthinking too much recently.

254
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:43,314
You become better at making up stories

255
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:43,954
than the TV dramas.

256
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:46,115
So now, it's my problem?

257
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,034
I'm just being paranoid?

258
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:47,794
What else?

259
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:48,875
What are trying to tell?

260
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:50,835
Are you implying that the child is mine?

261
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:54,075
I found the ultrasound report at my home,

262
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,435
I can't even ask about it?

263
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:56,915
What about us going
to the hospital right now?

264
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:58,274
Let's go to the hospital

265
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,115
right away for a DNA test.

266
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:00,635
Is that okay?

267
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:04,034
I just wanted a reasonable explanation.

268
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:04,554
Is that too much to ask?

269
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:06,835
This is not your first time.

270
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,635
I thought that you really put in effort

271
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,474
to repair our relationships,

272
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:16,875
but now it seems
that I was overthinking.

273
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:21,514
You forced Li Shu away, and also my Aunty.

274
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:24,314
Who's next that you want to push away?

275
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:27,554
I told you,

276
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,635
I just want to live a quiet

277
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,474
and peaceful life with you and the kids.

278
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:35,915
But what have you done?

279
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:40,915
You've ruined all the trust we had.

280
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:43,954
Are you satisfied now?

281
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:46,474
There's never been anything

282
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:47,954
between me and Li Shu,

283
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:51,234
as well as between me and the baby.

284
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,395
This is the last time I'll explain this.

285
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:10,954
Hello.

286
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,994
Qian, where are you now?

287
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:15,514
I...

288
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,395
I'm coming to find you now.

289
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:58,314
If Gao Ping really did that,

290
00:20:58,355 --> 00:20:59,274
what are you going to do?

291
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:05,595
I don't know.

292
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:12,514
I don't think

293
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:16,675
the child is his,

294
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:19,635
but

295
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:23,034
why would Li Shu do this?

296
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:28,155
On my way driving over here,

297
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:30,155
I kept analyzing this.

298
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:32,794
I wonder if it is his,

299
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:34,635
but he doesn't want it.

300
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,754
So, Li Shu left the report on purpose

301
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:40,675
at my home as a hint for me.

302
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,195
Anyway, recently,

303
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,754
Gao Ping's behavior has been so strange.

304
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,954
I don't know if it's because

305
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,635
he's been trying hard

306
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:50,754
to stay at the faculty,

307
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:51,875
but he failed

308
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:54,514
that makes him so irritable and depressed.

309
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:56,395
He's been acting so distant

310
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:57,835
and frustrated.

311
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:01,675
When I try to talk to him,

312
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:02,395
he'd say

313
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,794
I'm being sensitive, paranoid,

314
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:06,395
that I don't trust him,

315
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:08,314
and he wants me to give him more space.

316
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:10,355
Is he trying to control you emotionally?

317
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:14,155
But, why is he suddenly

318
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,355
trying to control me emotionally?

319
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:19,395
I can't understand all of these at all.

320
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:22,635
I just feel like
you are emotionally exhausted

321
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:25,435
for these days.

322
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:31,675
You've been carrying
everything on your own.

323
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:33,994
You care too much
about Gao Ping's feelings.

324
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:35,675
From my perspective,

325
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:37,435
I thought we were on the same page.

326
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:38,635
We have reached a mutual understanding.

327
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:41,675
We both agreed on this division
of roles in the family

328
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:42,875
was the most comfortable.

329
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,675
I thought we are similar people

330
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:47,754
who just wanted a simple life.

331
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:52,155
And, we have Cong and Qi.

332
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:55,115
From when Cong and Qi couldn't speak

333
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:56,075
or recognize people,

334
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:57,794
to now when they have cognition,

335
00:22:58,355 --> 00:23:00,835
they recognize Gao Ping as their dad.

336
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:02,514
And, Gao Ping has always

337
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:03,835
been good to the kids.

338
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:06,554
The main issue is
that I can't figure out

339
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:07,994
where the problem is.

340
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:15,915
I still want to try to solve it,
to communicate,

341
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,954
but I don't know what the problem is.

342
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:21,514
Forget it.

343
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:22,195
I don't want to think about it anymore.

344
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,714
I can't figure out anything.

345
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:27,635
How's your job search going?

346
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:30,474
Not too bad.

347
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:31,554
Anyway,

348
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:33,474
it's a

349
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:34,954
startup company.

350
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,355
There are a lot of young people there.

351
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,595
It's for a public account related
to geography,

352
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,474
which is pretty aligned with my field.

353
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,635
Are you satisfied with the salary?

354
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,835
The internship pay is 5,000 yuan.

355
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:51,234
And, when I become a full-time,

356
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,274
it'll be about 9,000 yuan after tax.

357
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:53,954
Where is it?

358
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:55,155
In the Changshou Road area.

359
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:56,554
Changshou Road?

360
00:23:57,794 --> 00:23:59,234
The rent there is very expensive.

361
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,075
I'm not renting there.

362
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:02,395
I'll just live at home.

363
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:04,835
It's about an hour or so each way.

364
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:05,875
It's still within acceptable distance.

365
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:08,754
That's quite a trek.

366
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:12,115
That's fine.
Make it a start over from scratch.

367
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:12,754
It's not a big deal.

368
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:14,474
You're right.

369
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:16,474
It's great

370
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:17,554
that you're finally

371
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:18,314
doing something you enjoy.

372
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:22,514
Go get some beer

373
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:23,355
and we celebrate it.

374
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:25,195
Since Deng Haiyang left here,

375
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:25,595
I'm not sure

376
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:27,435
if I still have any alcohol at home.

377
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:28,915
Let me check if I have the stock.

378
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:30,554
Maybe

379
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:31,915
there's only cooking wine left.

380
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:32,794
Let me find it.

381
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:37,875
Who is it?

382
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:38,954
I'll get it.

383
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,274
I ordered takeout.

384
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:42,754
Hello,

385
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:43,675
here's your order.

386
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:44,794
Thanks.

387
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:45,514
Thanks.

388
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:49,635
Xiang Zhong,

389
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,314
could you look for a lighter

390
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:52,395
in the kitchen for me?

391
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:53,075
I need it.

392
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,754
I found two beers there!

393
00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:15,395
What are you doing?

394
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:18,155
Come on, come on!

395
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:20,514
I almost forgot.

396
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:23,274
I nearly missed your birthday.

397
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:24,314
Look at you,

398
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:26,554
suddenly becomes so emotional.

399
00:25:27,314 --> 00:25:28,554
Back when we were little,

400
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,075
I was the one secretly
celebrating your birthday.

401
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:32,474
After you married Deng Haiyang,

402
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:33,915
I hand over this task to him.

403
00:25:34,195 --> 00:25:35,915
But this year, there's no Deng Haiyang,

404
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:37,994
so I'll take over the place.

405
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:40,514
Should we sing?

406
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:42,754
Of course.

407
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:43,514
Alright.

408
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:45,195
Chinese or English?

409
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:46,835
Do we need to light the candles first?

410
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:50,195
Oops, I forget about that.

411
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:51,274
Let me light it up before we sing.

412
00:25:53,675 --> 00:25:54,395
Are you ready?

413
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:55,954
Ready.

414
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:56,754
Let's start.

415
00:25:56,875 --> 00:26:00,155
Happy birthday to you,

416
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:03,395
Happy birthday to you,

417
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:06,994
Happy birthday to you,

418
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:09,954
Happy birthday to Zhong.

419
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:12,514
Happy birthday to me.

420
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:13,234
(Thank you, Qian.)

421
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:14,395
(All these years,)

422
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:15,355
(you're the only one who's always
celebrated my birthday with me.)

423
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:16,034
Qian.

424
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:17,314
Look, what I brought you!

425
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:17,994
What is it?

426
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:22,155
A cake!

427
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:24,514
It's my birthday today.

428
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:25,554
Aunty bought it for me.

429
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:26,234
Hurry, eat it!

430
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:28,754
Thank you, Qian.

431
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:30,395
Happy birthday.

432
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:33,714
Actually, dad and mum

433
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:35,034
remember your birthday.

434
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,435
But if we celebrate it at home,

435
00:26:38,115 --> 00:26:40,675
Xiang Nan might get upset

436
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,474
because it would
remind her of her parents.

437
00:26:44,595 --> 00:26:45,115
Hurry, eat it now.

438
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,115
Where do you get the cake?

439
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:53,474
It's my birthday today.

440
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:56,554
Haven't I told you

441
00:26:57,395 --> 00:26:58,994
that no one in the family
is allowed to celebrate a birthday?

442
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:00,994
As the eldest sister,

443
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,915
can't you set an example?

444
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:05,075
I'm sorry, dad.

445
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:06,794
It's my mistake.

446
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:10,714
Why can't anyone celebrate birthday
because of Xiang Nan?

447
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:11,835
There's no reason!

448
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:13,714
If I say no, then it's no.

449
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:17,075
Xiang Zhong,

450
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:19,514
you're already a big kid.

451
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:21,635
How can you be so thoughtless?

452
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:26,754
Xiang Zhong.

453
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:28,234
Xiang Zhong.

454
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:32,954
Xiang Zhong,

455
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:34,514
what are you doing here?

456
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:36,994
Dad and mum dislike me so much.

457
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:39,875
So, why did they bring me back
from the countryside?

458
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:44,474
It's not that they don't like you.

459
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:45,835
It's just that Xiang Nan

460
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:47,435
needs more care.

461
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:50,075
It's alright.

462
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:56,835
You still have me.

463
00:27:57,355 --> 00:27:59,034
From now on, we'll celebrate
your birthday together.

464
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:00,435
Alright.

465
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:02,474
Blow it.

466
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,075
Let's blow together.

467
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,954
One, two, three.

468
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:11,115
I want to hug you.

469
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:15,395
What's wrong?

470
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:16,514
Did I sing so badly

471
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:17,274
that it made you cry?

472
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:19,954
You still have me too.

473
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:22,075
I know.

474
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:28,195
Let's eat the cake!

475
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,554
I want to eat the cake.

476
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:34,075
We're just like the two of us.

477
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:01,474
There's more dish?

478
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:02,835
Why doesn't dad come in?

479
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:04,034
Alright, I get it.

480
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:04,714
He's so slow.

481
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:05,994
Alright. Thank you.

482
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:06,635
Still not here.

483
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:11,595
Thank you, mum.

484
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,355
Let's eat.

485
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:13,034
Yeah.

486
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:13,395
Let's eat.

487
00:29:13,595 --> 00:29:14,155
Xiang Zhong,

488
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:17,514
did you quit your job?

489
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:21,314
Yes.

490
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:21,994
I quit my job.

491
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,075
And I found a new one.

492
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:23,875
Why don't you tell me

493
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:24,994
for that?

494
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:26,355
If Gu hadn't mentioned it,

495
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:27,355
I wouldn't have known.

496
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:29,554
I knew Gu would tell you,

497
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:30,395
so I didn't.

498
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,435
But, didn't I tell you

499
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:33,954
to withdraw your resignation letter?

500
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:35,714
Dad,

501
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,274
you only heard that Xiang Zhong quit,

502
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:39,395
but did you hear the rest?

503
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:40,875
She said she found a new job.

504
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,115
How can it be the same?

505
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:44,474
Nowadays, everyone

506
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:46,554
hopes to get a stable job.

507
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,155
But, now Xiang Zhong

508
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:49,514
joins such a small company

509
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:51,675
that could go under any day.

510
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:52,915
What will she do
if it stops operating?

511
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,195
Then, I'll find another one.

512
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:55,115
It's no big deal.

513
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:56,234
My dear,

514
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:57,075
by that time,

515
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:57,954
you'll be in your forties or fifties,

516
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,835
who's going to hire you?

517
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:01,155
Can you stop

518
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:02,474
making me sound so pathetic, Dad?

519
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,195
Am I that incapable?

520
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:04,635
Start eating now.

521
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:05,395
You're capable, sure.

522
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:07,195
But, don't just think about the present.

523
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:08,714
You won't be able
to bear the consequences.

524
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,554
And you, Xiang Qian,

525
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:13,514
you have richer experience.

526
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:15,714
Why can't you advise her?

527
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:17,435
Dad, have you considered

528
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:18,474
that switching jobs

529
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:19,835
might be good for Xiang Zhong too?

530
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:20,954
Exactly.

531
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:23,835
People say moving on can bring new life.

532
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:24,274
That's right.

533
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:25,435
You, keep quiet!

534
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,355
You're the most unprincipled one.

535
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:28,994
How come she is right?

536
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:29,474
How come...

537
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:30,994
Why are you getting so furious?

538
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,195
Keep your voice down.

539
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:34,355
Stop yelling in front of the kids.

540
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:35,274
This is not yelling.

541
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:37,355
What I mentioned is not a big deal?

542
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:37,675
Don't you think...

543
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:38,075
Let's eat.

544
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:39,514
Who was it that said
they were hungry earlier?

545
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:40,635
I don't want ribs.

546
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:41,675
I want braised pork.

547
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:42,075
Alright,

548
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:42,554
braised pork for you.

549
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:43,635
I want ribs.

550
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:44,115
You see?

551
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:45,395
Do you even respect me?

552
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:47,115
Fine, I get it.

553
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:48,314
Next time, I'll tell you
if I change jobs.

554
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:48,915
Okay?

555
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:49,954
Come on.

556
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:51,115
Let's eat.

557
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:51,954
Why are you getting so worked up?

558
00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:52,675
You are...

559
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,195
Look around you,

560
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,195
three against one.

561
00:30:55,714 --> 00:30:56,155
What do you mean...

562
00:30:56,195 --> 00:30:57,514
I'm with Grandpa.

563
00:30:57,714 --> 00:30:58,274
You see.

564
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:00,794
I'm with Grandma.

565
00:31:01,115 --> 00:31:02,274
Are you serious?

566
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:03,514
Of course I'm serious.

567
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:04,635
Do you really mean it?

568
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:06,195
Four against one.

569
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:07,474
Yeah.

570
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:08,595
This dish is for you.

571
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:11,794
Give the meat to Cong.

572
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:13,875
What Grandpa said is right.

573
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:14,514
See!

574
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:15,794
What my grandma said is

575
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:16,875
always right in this world.

576
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:20,714
Qi, she's just like Grandma, a traitor.

577
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:26,034
Alright,

578
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:26,954
let's just eat.

579
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:28,155
Come on, Cong.

580
00:31:29,994 --> 00:31:30,675
What do you want to eat?

581
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:31,514
Braised pork, right?

582
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:32,435
Here's a piece for you too.

583
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:32,954
I'll have one more piece.

584
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,115
See, even the traitor gets to eat.

585
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:37,355
Grandpa is just so kind.

586
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,875
Come in.

587
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:42,115
Come in.

588
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,355
Dad's home!

589
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:47,554
Dad! Dad!

590
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:48,794
Dad! Dad! Is that you?

591
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:49,994
Dad! Dad!

592
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,034
Cong, Qi.

593
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:52,794
Dad! Dad!

594
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,435
You're back!

595
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:56,155
I missed you so much!

596
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:00,435
You two haven't changed your shoes yet.

597
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:01,314
Come and change your shoes.

598
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:02,314
Go and change shoes.

599
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:03,314
Let's go change.

600
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:05,635
Didn't you just get back?

601
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,554
Where are you going?

602
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:08,635
The thesis defense is coming up.

603
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:09,675
I'll be staying in the dorm
for a couple of days.

604
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:13,115
You...

605
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:16,675
I've changed shoes.

606
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:18,155
Qi.

607
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:18,875
Me too.

608
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:19,554
Take your brother

609
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:20,514
and watch the tablet for ten minutes.

610
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:22,355
That's great!

611
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:24,115
That's great!

612
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:24,954
I'll complete the mission.

613
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:25,954
Let's go!

614
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:32,474
Didn't you say

615
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:34,195
not to bring negative emotions
around the kids?

616
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:36,675
So, what's this?

617
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:37,794
No need to use the kids

618
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:38,754
to exert moral pressure on me.

619
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:40,474
You can just tell them
I'm on a business trip.

620
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:43,754
What about after the thesis defense?

621
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:45,314
We'll talk then.

622
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:49,635
I get to go now.

623
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:10,314
Mum! Mum!

624
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:12,754
Why doesn't Dad stay at home

625
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:14,835
and go to the dorm instead?

626
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,675
Because he's preparing
for the thesis defense.

627
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,155
He probably wants

628
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:21,195
to focus and prepare in peace.

629
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:21,794
Let's go.

630
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:23,675
Oh, okay.

631
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,075
Okay.

632
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:35,835
Hurry up and eat.

633
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:36,595
Hurry!

634
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:39,754
Today, I'll have
a very, very important meeting.

635
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:42,635
It's as important as when you'll need

636
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:43,754
to take exams after going to school

637
00:33:43,994 --> 00:33:44,635
when you grow up.

638
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:45,234
Alright?

639
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:46,435
Can you cooperate with me?

640
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:46,915
Hurry up!

641
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,155
Finish your breakfast in ten minutes,

642
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,675
and I'll take five minutes
to change clothes.

643
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:50,835
Peel the eggs yourselves.

644
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:51,794
Okay, mum.

645
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:52,875
Okay, mum.

646
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:56,155
Ouch, it's hot.

647
00:33:59,034 --> 00:33:59,835
I'm coming.

648
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:01,915
Who's here so early?

649
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:06,714
Why are you here so early?

650
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,195
I'm getting older,

651
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:10,314
so I sleep less.

652
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:12,595
I couldn't sleep, so I got up.

653
00:34:14,314 --> 00:34:14,874
And,

654
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:16,595
I brought you some breakfast.

655
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:19,195
Alright, wait for me a while,

656
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:20,035
and we'll go together.

657
00:34:28,914 --> 00:34:29,515
Xiang Zhong,

658
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:31,555
I'm going for my exercise.

659
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:33,754
Don't forget your breakfast!

660
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:35,675
Hey, wait for me!

661
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:37,714
It's okay. I get to go.

662
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:42,834
Why are you so rushed?

663
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:56,434
Dad!

664
00:34:57,155 --> 00:34:59,035
This old man is running too fast.

665
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,675
Dad, please slow down.

666
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:07,794
Why are you looking at me like that?

667
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:09,754
It feels like

668
00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:11,195
you haven't called me 'Dad'
in a long time.

669
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:14,075
Did I?

670
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:15,274
Didn't you?

671
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:17,794
You call me "old man" behind my back.

672
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:19,195
Don't think that I don't know.

673
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:21,874
Hold on.

674
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:22,834
Take this. I don't need it.

675
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:23,635
Take it.

676
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:26,394
It's meant for you to spend.

677
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:27,234
Keep it for yourself.

678
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:28,475
I have money to spend.

679
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:29,635
What money do you have?

680
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:32,115
All your savings were
spent by Deng Haiyang.

681
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:33,475
Your salary isn't that high.

682
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:34,595
How come you have money?

683
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:35,274
No, this is

684
00:35:35,274 --> 00:35:36,195
the retirement fund for you and mum.

685
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:37,075
I can't take it.

686
00:35:37,075 --> 00:35:38,354
Your mum and I have enough.

687
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:38,874
Take it.

688
00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:39,595
I don't want to.

689
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:40,515
- Listen to me.
-Take it back.

690
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:41,995
You see.

691
00:35:42,035 --> 00:35:42,434
See.

692
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:44,555
Take it back.

693
00:35:44,595 --> 00:35:45,675
If I'm short, I'll ask you.

694
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:46,274
Okay?

695
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:47,434
I'm not incapable of managing myself.

696
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:49,394
If you could ask me for help,

697
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:50,035
that'd be great.

698
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:52,195
You don't tell me anything.

699
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:53,035
Let's go.

700
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:56,555
Are you going to exercise now?

701
00:35:58,434 --> 00:35:59,195
Have you brought along your breakfast?

702
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:00,675
It's here.

703
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:06,874
You're too slow.

704
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:08,475
Qi finished her egg.

705
00:36:08,515 --> 00:36:09,274
Cong, eat faster!

706
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:28,434
Hurry up!

707
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:29,754
Hurry up, it's too late.

708
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:30,555
It's too late for mum to go.

709
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,434
Hurry up. Let's go.

710
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:32,635
Put down the food in your hand.

711
00:36:47,314 --> 00:36:48,475
Aren't you going to exercise?

712
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:49,434
Why are you standing
around here with me?

713
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:50,075
You may go.

714
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:51,555
No rush,

715
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:53,234
there's time.

716
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:01,155
Xiang Zhong,

717
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:04,555
you're a grown woman now.

718
00:37:05,794 --> 00:37:07,555
Once you make decisions,

719
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:10,314
it's not my place to say much.

720
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,754
But, your mum and I

721
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:17,595
still worry when you get older,

722
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:19,555
you have no one to depend on.

723
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:20,595
That will be bad.

724
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,434
I'm at this age already.

725
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:25,874
What's there to worry about?

726
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,515
How could we not worry about you?

727
00:37:29,354 --> 00:37:30,754
You may go first.
Don't stay here with me anymore.

728
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:32,354
Keep asking me to leave. I...

729
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:39,675
Hello?

730
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:41,914
I'll be there soon.

731
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:45,075
You go ahead and start.

732
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:47,955
See, they’re urging you.

733
00:37:47,995 --> 00:37:48,635
You can go first.

734
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:50,234
No need,

735
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:52,195
it's not that urgent.

736
00:37:54,635 --> 00:37:55,515
I...

737
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:56,635
I just feel that

738
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:57,914
if you stay here waiting with me,

739
00:37:57,914 --> 00:37:59,874
I'm not used to it.

740
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,234
I'm not gone forever.

741
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:02,874
There you go again.

742
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:04,075
You, this kid,

743
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,195
always say such unpleasant things.

744
00:38:05,555 --> 00:38:06,195
Alright,

745
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,434
then I'm leaving now.

746
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:10,714
Don't forget to take your breakfast.

747
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:12,354
And,

748
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,434
if you're back late, take a cab.

749
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:16,794
Don't worry about the cost.

750
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:18,314
Alright, Dad.

751
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:20,394
Okay.

752
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:21,155
Fine.

753
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,195
When I bought the breakfast,

754
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:27,035
I took some napkins too.

755
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:27,675
Here you go.

756
00:38:27,794 --> 00:38:28,794
There are too many.

757
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:29,515
I'm a girl.

758
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:30,955
Of course, I have tissues with me.

759
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:35,434
You never say anything
that makes me happy.

760
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:38,595
Look,

761
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:40,314
the bus is here.

762
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:43,595
You may go now.

763
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:46,714
Go quickly.

764
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:00,075
Go quickly.

786
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:26,515
This is the concept we've been promoting

787
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:28,354
for smart elderly care.

788
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:28,955
It is...

789
00:40:30,714 --> 00:40:31,874
Xiang Qian,

790
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:34,155
how about you introduce this?

791
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:35,075
Sorry.

792
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:35,914
Carry on,

793
00:40:35,995 --> 00:40:37,155
I'll add anything if needed.

794
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:37,834
Alright.

795
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:39,955
I'll continue then.

796
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:44,834
Our concept uses intelligent robots

797
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,995
through our cloud platform,

798
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,155
centering on the services, like

799
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,955
lifestyle care, safety assurance,

800
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,274
memory care, emotional needs,

801
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:55,314
and medical rehabilitation,

802
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:56,314
covering six dimensions.

803
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:59,195
We use the
technoloical advancement

804
00:40:59,274 --> 00:41:00,515
to build a three-in-one
smart elderly care service platform

805
00:41:00,595 --> 00:41:02,035
that integrates institutions,
communities, and homes,

806
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:03,115
(Li Shu: I'm downstairs at your office
and I want to talk to you.)

807
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,635
to provide the elderly

808
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:05,714
with a high-quality,

809
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,955
happy and healthy life
in their late years.

810
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:10,475
In addition to the
significance of our project,

811
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:11,754
we can also see...

812
00:41:12,394 --> 00:41:14,115
This is the introduction for our system,

813
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:15,354
the main functions,

814
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,195
and our service principles.

815
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,354
Here I want to emphasize on our

816
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:22,075
reliability and security,

817
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:23,834
because this is directly

818
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:25,354
related to the safety
and privacy of the elderly...

819
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:26,475
(Li Shu: I'm already in your office.)

820
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:27,754
So, it is necessary...

821
00:41:39,515 --> 00:41:40,675
Meeting me in the office,

822
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,155
is that for a work or personal matter?

823
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:43,035
Five minutes.

824
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:43,475
Go ahead.

825
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:44,754
Why did you do it?

826
00:41:45,555 --> 00:41:46,354
What did I do?

827
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:48,234
Don't play innocent.

828
00:41:49,515 --> 00:41:51,035
I don't understand what you meant.

829
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:52,914
Why did you

830
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:54,035
send an anonymous letter

831
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:55,115
to my research institute

832
00:41:56,115 --> 00:41:57,675
accusing me of being a home-wrecker

833
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,115
destroying someone else's family,

834
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:00,475
and saying that I'm pregnant
with someone else's child.

835
00:42:02,155 --> 00:42:03,475
Regarding my pregnancy,

836
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:04,394
besides Gao Ping,

837
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:05,115
my boyfriend and you,

838
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,354
no one knew about it.

839
00:42:08,115 --> 00:42:08,995
Mrs. Gao,

840
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:12,834
I've always respected you.

841
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:15,274
But, why would you harm me?

842
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:17,874
All I did was help tutor your children.

843
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:19,955
I may have been
too friendly with Gao Ping.

844
00:42:20,675 --> 00:42:22,314
You repeatedly doubted me and Gao Ping.

845
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:23,234
I can understand.

846
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:24,635
That's all because you think
Gao Ping is so excellent.

847
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,635
And you lack confidence.

848
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:27,834
But, that's your personal affair
between the two of you.

849
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:29,035
Why drag me into it?

850
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:33,515
Do you know how hard it was for me

851
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:34,714
to get into that research institute?

852
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:40,834
I spent three years preparing
to obtain it.

853
00:42:42,914 --> 00:42:43,874
Once I was there,

854
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:46,515
I went out of my way
to take on the smallest tasks,

855
00:42:48,075 --> 00:42:49,754
hoping for a chance

856
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:50,635
to apply for becoming
a teaching assistant

857
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:53,475
in the faculty after graduation.

858
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:55,794
But now,

859
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,555
with a few strokes on a keyboard,

860
00:42:57,595 --> 00:42:59,675
you've ruined all my hard work.

861
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:01,595
I never have any ill will towards you.

862
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:03,195
