00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 26=

4
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:13,136
Grandma, Grandma!

5
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,935
- Slow down.
- My baby.

6
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,205
Grandma, I want to water the plants.

7
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:17,684
Give me a kiss first.

8
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:18,615
Okay.

9
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,165
Good.

10
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,725
Grandma, I want to water the plants too.

11
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,285
Does that mean you don't want
to give me a kiss?

12
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:24,416
You just want to water the plants?

13
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,576
Where's Gao Ping?

14
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:26,644
Water the plants...

15
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:27,736
Gao Ping...

16
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,495
He'll come
after he finishes his oral defense.

17
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,804
Your dad is trying to call Xiang Zhong.

18
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:37,605
He's been at it all morning.

19
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:38,605
Xiang Zhong refunded

20
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,935
the rental house again.

21
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,696
Where are you going?

22
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:44,055
I've been calling Xiang Zhong.

23
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:44,885
I'm going to look for her.

24
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:46,244
She isn't picking up my calls.

25
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,084
No, Dad. Dad!

26
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,165
I'll go.

27
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,244
I'll go look for her.

28
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:50,205
It's nearby. I'll go.

29
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:51,256
Look at this.

30
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:56,736
Who let her water the plants?

31
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:58,205
- Grandma said it's okay.
- I just did it.

32
00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:58,804
Any more...

33
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,565
Any more and it'll die!

34
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:01,404
You can't overdo it!

35
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,404
Just watering a little bit.

36
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:03,644
It's not going to die. It's okay, go on.

37
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:04,495
It's okay.

38
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,175
Coming.

39
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:27,375
You came.

40
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,095
Why didn't you answer Dad's calls?

41
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:33,765
I just got home this morning.

42
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:34,565
After I showered,

43
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:35,084
I just laid here

44
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,456
in a daze.

45
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:37,335
I didn't hear it.

46
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,335
Where were you last night?

47
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:42,935
Last night,

48
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,605
Deng Haiyang had too much to drink

49
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:45,765
and got admitted into the ICU.

50
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:46,736
So I went to the hospital.

51
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:48,964
What?

52
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,175
How is he now?

53
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,016
He's stabilized.

54
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,296
He...

55
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,005
Dad and Mom rented a house in Shanghai

56
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,296
for me, right?

57
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,644
He used his connections

58
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,285
to get the house refunded.

59
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,524
He treated those people to dinner

60
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:05,655
and then drank too much.

61
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,615
So much that
he ended up in the hospital.

62
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,165
So Deng Haiyang's drinking

63
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,576
ended up being useful.

64
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:15,524
How did he know Dad and Mom

65
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:16,976
got a rental for you in Shanghai?

66
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:18,655
Are you two

67
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:20,816
in close contact right now?

68
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:22,844
We bumped into each other

69
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,136
in Shanghai.

70
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,484
He did me a favor,

71
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:27,176
so I couldn't
possibly ignore him, right?

72
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,735
There's something else
I need to tell you.

73
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,056
Yes?

74
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,456
This morning, I saw Gao Ping's car

75
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:43,964
on the road,

76
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:45,245
waiting for the traffic lights.

77
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,016
There was a woman sitting next to him.

78
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:48,816
It wasn't Li Shu.

79
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:54,295
He knows plenty of women.

80
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,655
You can't expect me to look into them
one by one.

81
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:58,895
That's true.

82
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:00,376
Perhaps I'm thinking too much.

83
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:10,936
Dad.

84
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,616
Where are Cong and Qi?

85
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,415
Your mom brought them
to visit your second aunt.

86
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:18,016
Xiang Zhong didn't come?

87
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:19,016
She's here.

88
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:19,975
At the back.

89
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:21,245
She was in the shower just now

90
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:22,535
and didn't hear the phone.

91
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,415
So what happened with the rental?

92
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:29,016
Dad, next time if there's anything,

93
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,005
just ask me directly.

94
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,044
Stop pestering Qian about it.

95
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:31,964
She has her own problems.

96
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,376
She's not the neighborhood committee.

97
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,016
Talk to you straight?

98
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:36,456
Can you agree?

99
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:37,484
She's your older sister.

100
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:38,855
Who should I look for, if not her?

101
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:40,885
Mom and Dad are just worried

102
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:42,445
about you going home so late at night.

103
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,016
It's not very safe.

104
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:46,095
I know.

105
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,415
What I'm trying to say is,

106
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:50,445
you guys should watch less
of those sensationalized news

107
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:51,805
on the Internet.

108
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,164
It's just going to make you all

109
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:54,016
more paranoid.

110
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:55,295
You made it sound like

111
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,816
your mom and I are clueless.

112
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:57,484
Gosh.

113
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,696
If you weren't clueless,

114
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,016
why would you rent
that kind of house then?

115
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:02,335
What's wrong with it?

116
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,376
It's nothing.

117
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:05,084
I know you guys

118
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,456
are worried about me.

119
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:07,844
I'm already at this age.

120
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:08,964
I can take care of myself.

121
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:09,765
No need to fuss over me.

122
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,724
Also,

123
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:11,644
the refund for the rental

124
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:12,696
has been transferred to your account.

125
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:13,604
Remember to check it.

126
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:14,376
Hey.

127
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:15,925
Your mom and I

128
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:16,925
will not bother with

129
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:17,484
these matters anymore.

130
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:18,335
Okay.

131
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:19,565
Look at that girl.

132
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:20,616
Look.

133
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:21,805
You should

134
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:22,925
talk to Xiang Zhong directly

135
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:23,724
if there's anything.

136
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,616
Why must you make me the messenger?

137
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:32,535
Qian, Zhong.

138
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,095
Dad.

139
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:34,925
He's inside.

140
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:35,616
Dad.

141
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:36,576
Xiang Nan.

142
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,205
You're back.

143
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,084
Yeah.

144
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:39,696
I brought fruits for you.

145
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:41,376
Where's Hongbin?

146
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:43,816
He's on a business trip.

147
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:44,735
Is he?

148
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,044
Doesn't he know

149
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,415
that Gao Ping is graduating today?

150
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:48,445
He's not graduating.

151
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:49,855
He's doing his oral defense.

152
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,604
What has Gao Ping's oral defense

153
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:52,484
got to do with Hongbin?

154
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,724
It's a chance for everyone to gather

155
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:54,365
and celebrate.

156
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:55,484
What's wrong with that?

157
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,136
He's been quite busy lately.

158
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:58,604
When is he not busy?

159
00:06:58,605 --> 00:06:59,524
Dad.

160
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:00,456
Mom.

161
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:04,056
Dad.

162
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:06,885
Xiang Qian, Xiang Zhong, hello.

163
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:07,604
Hongbin?

164
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:08,404
Aren't you...

165
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,735
Aren't you away on business?

166
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:11,176
Away on business?

167
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:11,925
Yeah.

168
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:13,176
He...

169
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,936
I went to Shanghai.

170
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:18,325
Come, Wang,

171
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:19,335
bring the things in.

172
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,496
Hey, Wang.

173
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:23,005
Thanks a lot.

174
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:23,925
Jiang, can I have a word?

175
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:24,685
Come and sit.

176
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:25,245
Come.

177
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,816
It's okay. Maybe next time.

178
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,176
See you again.

179
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:38,816
Why are you here?

180
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:41,125
It's an important family gathering.

181
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,376
I should be present.

182
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:43,925
How many times have you attended

183
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,256
our family gatherings?

184
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:47,616
This time is different.

185
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:48,975
How so?

186
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,056
You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?

187
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:51,685
You're trying

188
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:52,975
to embarrass me in front of my family.

189
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:55,136
Why would you think that?

190
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:56,164
Why would I

191
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:57,535
embarrass you?

192
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,415
I don't suppose you're going to announce

193
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,215
that we're having a cold war,

194
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,696
that you're throwing a tantrum?

195
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,735
I'm throwing a tantrum?

196
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:08,136
What do you want then, Xiang Nan?

197
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,215
Should we

198
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,256
fight in front of everybody?

199
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,415
Will that satisfy you?

200
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:25,765
Dad...

201
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,456
I missed you.

202
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,205
Daddy,

203
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,644
I miss you so much.

204
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,095
I miss you guys too.

205
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:32,335
Gao Ping,

206
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:33,565
you're here.

207
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,335
Congrats.

208
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,136
Hello everyone.

209
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:36,376
Aunty.

210
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:37,525
My goodness, Aunty,

211
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:38,685
look at you all dressed up.

212
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,165
Mommy...

213
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,095
Those pearls are lovely.

214
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,004
Your dad said

215
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,615
we're having a celebration.

216
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:45,656
Is this formal enough?

217
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,056
Right?

218
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:48,484
Dad.

219
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:49,176
Gao Ping.

220
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:50,176
How was the oral defense?

221
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:51,685
Good, it went well.

222
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:52,936
Congratulations to you.

223
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:55,056
I'm glad that everyone's here.

224
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,285
It's been a long time

225
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,124
since our home was so lively.

226
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:57,764
Perhaps we should

227
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:58,936
set off some fireworks.

228
00:08:59,005 --> 00:08:59,724
Don't you dare.

229
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:00,776
If you dare

230
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:01,604
break the law,

231
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:02,964
you're going to be arrested.

232
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:03,936
My younger sister is mad.

233
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:04,445
She's mad!

234
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,525
You're mad.

235
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:07,165
Let's go inside and chat.

236
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,335
Come, come.

237
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:09,884
Hurry up.

238
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:10,936
Xiang Qian.

239
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,244
I bought some things.

240
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:13,084
Can you help me?

241
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,004
You're eating too many snacks.

242
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:15,536
Are you not going to eat later?

243
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,296
It's okay. These are just biscuits.

244
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:24,576
Why did you buy so much?

245
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:26,696
In the past years,

246
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,405
I've not bought anything good

247
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:29,576
for the family.

248
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,416
Consider this my last token
of appreciation.

249
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:34,685
I bought these

250
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:36,416
using my own money.

251
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,215
I've been saving up my writing fees

252
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:40,536
and allowances.

253
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,004
It's not much.

254
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,696
I only have a bit left
after buying the things.

255
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,296
It's all here.

256
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,090
(Savings Card)

257
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:49,936
What do you mean by this?

258
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,964
Is this the condition

259
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:53,855
for divorce?

260
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,645
Mr. Lu introduced

261
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:22,135
me to a project in Fujian.

262
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:25,495
I'll probably be based there
until I graduate.

263
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:27,936
When are you leaving?

264
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,656
My plan is to leave tomorrow.

265
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:32,576
That's quite sudden.

266
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,416
Gao Ping.

267
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:39,176
Dad called everyone here

268
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:42,285
for dinner today to celebrate

269
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:43,936
your finishing your oral defense.

270
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:45,964
You're the star today.

271
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,205
Why don't I tell everyone

272
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:48,375
that we're getting a divorce

273
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:49,855
at the dinner table later?

274
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:52,776
You're the one who wanted a divorce.

275
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,056
I didn't say it.

276
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,536
You made me say it.

277
00:10:57,765 --> 00:10:59,255
You abused me emotionally.

278
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:01,325
You wouldn't answer my calls,

279
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,495
or reply my messages.

280
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,375
You used your oral defense as an excuse
to move to the dorm.

281
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,896
Now, you're going to hide from me
by moving to Fujian.

282
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,735
Are we going to avoid
each other forever?

283
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:09,776
Not talk?

284
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:10,844
If this isn't breaking up with me,

285
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:11,724
then what is it?

286
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,776
Xiang Qian, has it never occurred to you?

287
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:14,604
Over these years,

288
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:17,375
you've been giving me so much pressure
in everything, big or small.

289
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:26,604
Give it more thought

290
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:27,975
once you've calmed down.

291
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:32,095
How did we become like this?

292
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:34,375
Who is it that destroyed
the trust between us?

293
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:42,975
I don't know.

294
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:48,735
It's fine if you don't want a divorce.

295
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:50,735
I won't force you.

296
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,296
I'm willing to continue acting the part.

297
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:56,176
What are you saying?

298
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,004
That you can act along

299
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,615
even though you don't love me anymore?

300
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,095
Good, good.

301
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:31,015
Come.

302
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,095
Today is a good day.

303
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:34,724
Everyone has to drink a bit.

304
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,615
Does that include me, Grandpa?

305
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,095
You'll drink juice.

306
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:42,325
Children cannot drink alcohol.

307
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,205
Right, Grandpa?

308
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:43,724
Look,

309
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,215
Qi is so smart.

310
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:47,255
Wow, Xiang Zhijun.

311
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:48,656
You're going all out today.

312
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:49,685
You brought out

313
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,776
the good stuff.

314
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:51,604
You're leaving it

315
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,445
all on the table today.

316
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,296
Today's the best time to drink it.

317
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:55,844
Look at this,

318
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,495
how wonderful our family is.

319
00:12:58,406 --> 00:12:59,445
A table full of people,

320
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,056
a mark of prosperity.

321
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:02,685
Not everyone has enough members

322
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:03,975
to fill up one table.

323
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:04,604
Look at us.

324
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,735
Just a normal weekend.

325
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:06,855
We sit down,

326
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:07,964
and this table can barely fit all of us.

327
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:09,255
We need a bigger table.

328
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,045
Jolly goodness, this is.

329
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,084
Come, come.

330
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,456
Enjoy the moment.

331
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:13,936
Let's raise our glasses.

332
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,844
Come on.

333
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:17,615
Come.

334
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,215
Dad.

335
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,176
Thanks.

336
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,735
- Drink.
- Yes.

337
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,405
Okay, let's eat.

338
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,325
Are you done talking?

339
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,255
Come on.

340
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,456
Get me a crab.

341
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:30,844
Cong, here's a crab for you.

342
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,335
I don't want it, thanks.

343
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:33,244
Qi,

344
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,045
Aunt Nan will give you some corn.

345
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:34,896
Hongbin,

346
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:37,084
you and Xiang Nan

347
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,056
have the good living conditions.

348
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:40,045
While your mother and I are around,

349
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,764
and while we're still capable,

350
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:42,925
we can help look

351
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:44,685
after your kids.
You should have more children.

352
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,095
Fine by me, Dad.

353
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,896
It's mainly up to Xiang Nan.

354
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:49,696
It's not fine.

355
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:52,056
Why?

356
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:53,604
We just got married.

357
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:54,844
It's too early for kids.

358
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:55,925
Besides, I think

359
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,215
I'm still a kid myself.

360
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:58,805
When I married

361
00:13:58,806 --> 00:13:59,645
your father,

362
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:00,925
I was young then too.

363
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,416
I still gave birth
to your eldest sister.

364
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:04,416
We basically matured together.

365
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:05,764
Stop it, Mom.

366
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:06,764
Just look at me.

367
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:07,896
I didn't grow up well.

368
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:09,205
Oh, stop.

369
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:10,724
That's because of the government policy.

370
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,604
I think Second Aunt

371
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:12,405
is living the life.

372
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,296
She has no kids so no worries.

373
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:16,285
Right, Aunty is living
the carefree life.

374
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:17,165
That's right.

375
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,364
That's what I wanted to say.

376
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,255
You shouldn't encourage that.

377
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:21,405
What?

378
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:23,244
Are you taking me for a bad example?

379
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,604
Don't you jest.

380
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:25,844
Why must we have kids?

381
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,004
Okay, okay. You're a positive example.

382
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:27,844
A good example.

383
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:28,724
I support Xiang Nan.

384
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:29,405
Kids or no kids, you decide.

385
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:30,165
Dad, here.

386
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:30,484
Yes.

387
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:30,764
A toast to you.

388
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:31,335
Okay.

389
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:32,816
Let us do our best.

390
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,615
We should make a toast to Gao Ping.

391
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:42,884
Dad, Mom,

392
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:44,004
I should drink in honor of you.

393
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:44,936
No, no, Gao Ping.

394
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,896
Your mom and I
want to toast to you first.

395
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:49,495
Firstly,

396
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:50,656
well...

397
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,884
We hope the best for your oral defense

398
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,285
that you'd achieve

399
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:56,495
a good result.

400
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,244
Thanks, Dad.

401
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:58,495
Other than that,

402
00:14:58,526 --> 00:14:59,576
we want to thank you

403
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:03,176
for taking care of Xiang Qian
and the kids

404
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:04,576
all these years.

405
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:05,964
You are

406
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:07,215
the family's indispensable support.

407
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,335
Thank you.

408
00:15:08,686 --> 00:15:10,244
We won't say more.

409
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:11,335
We'll drink to that.

410
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,296
May you two continue to be happy.

411
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,045
Here.

412
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:14,855
Thanks, Dad.

413
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,615
Gao Ping, I'd like to toast to you too.

414
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:23,805
Drink mine.

415
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,095
I can't drink because I have to drive.

416
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:26,724
Thank you for taking such good care

417
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,456
of Cong and Qi

418
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:30,335
over the years.

419
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,375
They're happy kids because of you.

420
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,416
I wish you all the best

421
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,776
after graduation.

422
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,135
Thanks.

423
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,296
What's up with her? On a diet?

424
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:48,604
Off to the bathroom probably.

425
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:50,095
It's fine. Let's eat.

426
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:51,735
Eat up.

427
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:53,536
The food's getting cold.

428
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,056
Come, let's all eat.

429
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,416
Aunty.

430
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:03,525
A toast to Aunty.

431
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:03,884
To Aunty.

432
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:05,536
Come, come.

433
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:06,615
Here.

434
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:14,565
Qian, what's wrong?

435
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:15,735
You were fine a moment ago.

436
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,285
Gao Ping and I

437
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,855
are probably getting a divorce.

438
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:41,135
How nice to have
the whole family together.

439
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,004
In the future, I'll make time

440
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,615
to attend the family gatherings more.

441
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,735
Why haven't you changed?

442
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:51,456
Jiang.

443
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:52,696
- Oh, right.
- You...

444
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,095
Biao opened another restaurant.

445
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:57,015
Could you make a gift for him
when you're free?

446
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:58,964
Make a gift?

447
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,015
What gift?

448
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,015
How about a golden toad?

449
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:03,416
It's an auspicious sign

450
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:04,656
to represent good business.

451
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:05,975
What?

452
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:07,255
Golden toad.

453
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:08,936
Haven't you seen one before?

454
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:19,336
This thing.

455
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,085
You want me to make him

456
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,336
a frog?

457
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:28,255
It's not just any frog.

458
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,136
It's a golden toad.

459
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:31,205
If you have the golden toad,

460
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,376
riches will come.

461
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:34,535
Better still

462
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,176
if it's biting onto a copper coin.

463
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,336
That's the most auspicious.

464
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:38,405
These things

465
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:39,605
can be easily found in the market.

466
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:41,096
Why do you need me to make it?

467
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:43,055
It's different when it's hand-made.

468
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,376
I can't do it. I don't know how.

469
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:49,616
Aren't you the art school's top student?

470
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:51,535
Why can't you make such a simple thing?

471
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:52,724
Are you trying

472
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:53,975
to degrade me?

473
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:55,724
I'm asking you to make a golden toad.

474
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:57,336
How is that degrading you?

475
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:58,925
Biao

476
00:17:58,926 --> 00:17:59,605
gave me

477
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:01,215
a lot of financial support.

478
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,255
For the sake of our business,

479
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,775
you should take a step down

480
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,535
from your high horse.

481
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,176
If you really want
to show your gratitude,

482
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,284
you can get a gold one.

483
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,535
Isn't that more valuable?

484
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:16,205
My glassware isn't worth anything.

485
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:17,856
Why must you make me make it?

486
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:19,484
You're purposely

487
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:20,775
getting on my nerves, aren't you?

488
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,775
To run that studio of yours,

489
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,456
I've spent quite a bit, haven't I?

490
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,176
Consider it my buying a commission
from you.

491
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,336
Is that too much to ask?

492
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,176
I'm not negotiating with you.

493
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:45,176
I'm stating a request.

494
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,616
Qian,

495
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,495
how did it come to wanting a divorce?

496
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:02,735
Are things that bad?

497
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:04,724
Right now, I don't think

498
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:06,295
it's something

499
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:08,815
I can control anymore.

500
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,964
Lately, Gao Ping

501
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,975
has been acting all weird.

502
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,125
The frequency

503
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,775
of arguments between us increases.

504
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,616
The amount of times

505
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,376
we've argued recently,

506
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:29,336
is much more than all the times

507
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,764
we've butted heads

508
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,015
or had misunderstandings

509
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,456
in the last five years.

510
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,616
It happened suddenly.

511
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:38,696
Especially

512
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,975
after he got Li Shu to come

513
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,925
and be the kids' home tutor,

514
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,495
things became even weirder.

515
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:48,575
So many mysterious things
started happening.

516
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,255
Now,

517
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:51,764
I started to have suspicions

518
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,136
and started looking into them.

519
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:54,764
But nothing substantial

520
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:56,136
came off it.

521
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:57,925
Gao Ping is always saying

522
00:19:57,926 --> 00:19:59,575
how suspicious I am of everything.

523
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,535
He said I don't trust him.

524
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,936
In the beginning, I agreed with him.

525
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,735
But now, I don't think that's the case.

526
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,775
I think he's treating me like this...

527
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,295
because he no longer wants to live with me.

528
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,176
So in the beginning,

529
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,365
he'd say he wouldn't be home

530
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,044
for a few days.

531
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:29,255
Now, he's pretty much disappeared.

532
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,255
So tell me,

533
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,735
what other choice do I have?

534
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:36,365
Have you thought about

535
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,896
how you'd tell the kids?

536
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:39,724
Cong and Qi are quite close

537
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,176
with him.

538
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,215
Yeah.

539
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:49,495
I haven't thought about it.

540
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,176
Because... How do I say it?

541
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,616
I think the way I think

542
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:04,575
is too naive.

543
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:06,405
I figured I'll tell Cong

544
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,575
and Qi,

545
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,255
your dad

546
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:10,925
wants to further his studies.

547
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,015
He wants to go abroad.

548
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:14,284
So you guys won't be able

549
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:15,975
to see him for a while.

550
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:18,365
When it's the school break,

551
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,804
I'll get you two your passports

552
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:21,255
and we'll go visit him.

553
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:24,295
After all,

554
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:27,205
Gao Ping has no blood ties
to the children.

555
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:28,685
It's not right to force him

556
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,365
to continue being their father.

557
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:31,136
Right?

558
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:34,015
I thought telling the kids this way

559
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,205
would prevent

560
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,856
the relationship to become overly tense.

561
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,564
I mean, if Cong and Qi miss him a lot,

562
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:55,096
I can let them meet.

563
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,284
But right now, I don't think

564
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:59,044
I have the right to ask that of him.

565
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:00,564
Besides, the way things are
between us...

566
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:03,896
I think it's better to cut him off
once and for all.

567
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:10,616
I have to think it through first.

568
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,405
Don't say anything to Mom and Dad.

569
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,416
I haven't decided what I want to do yet.

570
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,616
Don't worry, I won't say anything.

571
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:21,975
I won't tell them.

572
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:26,295
You're often so busy.

573
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:28,405
Without a nanny

574
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:29,696
to look after the kids,

575
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:31,295
it's just too hard.

576
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:33,365
I don't dare to simply hire a nanny,

577
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,165
you know?

578
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,845
I've been asking

579
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:36,896
my friends.

580
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:38,685
Whether

581
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:39,764
they had hired a long-term nanny,

582
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:40,764
who perhaps was let go

583
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:43,096
because the children have grown up.

584
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,764
I only asked those friends

585
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,735
who I'm close to.

586
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,405
Just so I can feel more assured,

587
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:50,255
right?

588
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:52,004
I'll call you

589
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,176
if I need anything.

590
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,205
You don't have to worry about me.

591
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:57,205
I... I think the worse part

592
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,416
has already passed.

593
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,975
When was that?

594
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:11,125
I suppose

595
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:12,815
it was when I made the decision.

596
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:44,456
Cong's mom, good morning.

597
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:45,416
Mu's mom.

598
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:47,004
How come I haven't seen

599
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,535
your professor husband lately?

600
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:50,284
He's been quite busy.

601
00:23:50,285 --> 00:23:51,405
So I'm taking the kids to school.

602
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,205
What a great husband you have.

603
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:53,885
If only my husband

604
00:23:53,886 --> 00:23:55,376
was half as good as him.

605
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:56,696
Good morning, Cong.

606
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:57,656
Ms. Huang.

607
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:58,815
Good morning, Ms. Huang.

608
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:00,085
Morning, Qi.

609
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,136
Morning, Cong.

610
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:01,964
Bye-bye.

611
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:02,804
Bye, my babies.

612
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:03,365
Bye-bye.

613
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:03,964
Bye-bye.

614
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:04,764
Eat your meals.

615
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:05,975
Cong, Qi!

616
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:09,376
Daddy!

617
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:10,856
Dad!

618
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:13,735
Where did you go, Daddy?

619
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:16,376
Dad, I'm almost out of battery.

620
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:17,125
Dad,

621
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:19,295
you haven't charged me up yet.

622
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:21,495
Sorry, my bad.

623
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,896
Come, let me charge you guys up.

624
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,495
Okay, done.

625
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:40,845
Go to class.

626
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,324
I'll leave them to you, Ms. Huang.

627
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:43,645
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye.

628
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,456
Bye-bye. Listen to your teacher.

629
00:24:45,606 --> 00:24:46,896
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

630
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,970
(For the children)

631
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,964
You could pay more attention

632
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,336
to the class groups.

633
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:04,936
The parents are quite united.

634
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:06,656
They can usually
solve problems.

635
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:09,215
The neighborhood group
is also pretty active.

636
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,165
I think it's better

637
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,295
for you to hire a nanny.

638
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:13,244
With so many things on your plate,

639
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,575
it'd be hard to manage alone.

640
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:16,696
So,

641
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:17,925
regarding the details

642
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:19,215
of the divorce agreement,

643
00:25:19,846 --> 00:25:20,964
I think we should sit down

644
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:22,495
and go through them.

645
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:25,295
Okay.

646
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,125
(Divorce Agreement)

647
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:32,125
I bought the house

648
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:33,416
before we got married.

649
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,564
I've been the one

650
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:36,815
paying the monthly payment.

651
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:38,696
So it should go to me, right?

652
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,136
Right.

653
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:43,015
The two cars.

654
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:45,775
I'll take one, you can have the EV.

655
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,015
No thanks.

656
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,815
As for the savings,

657
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:52,975
I can only give you 200,000.

658
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,616
So you've got it all sorted out.

659
00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:03,605
I have to work

660
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:05,336
and look after two kids.

661
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:07,975
I should be prepared, right?

662
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,295
I was already caught unawares.

663
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,336
You can decide.

664
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,255
I'm fine with
whatever decision you make.

665
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:54,815
What's this?

666
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,176
Praying for wealth?

667
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,656
Praying for dignity.

668
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,055
What happened?

669
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,495
Jiang Hongbin

670
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:04,804
asked me

671
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:05,964
to make a big, glass frog

672
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,336
as a gift for someone.

673
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:10,495
I guess

674
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:12,215
it is pretty hard to make.

675
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:14,055
It's not about the difficulty.

676
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:16,136
It's that he's doing it to spite me.

677
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:17,964
Not long ago,

678
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:18,764
we had a cold war

679
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:20,495
because of Lv Liang, remember?

680
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,524
Then, he suddenly turned up

681
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:24,416
at our family gathering,

682
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:25,484
acting as if

683
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:26,764
nothing happened.

684
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:27,685
He was a total gentleman

685
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:29,055
in front of my family.

686
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:30,815
I couldn't get a word in

687
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:32,775
and quietly followed him home.

688
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:34,295
That's the person he is.

689
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:35,484
The moment

690
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:36,605
you don't do as he says,

691
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:38,044
he'd use all kinds of tricks

692
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:39,495
to manipulate and mock you.

693
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:40,775
Including this thing.

694
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:45,656
Xiang Nan.

695
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,975
Do you want to
have a good life with Jiang?

696
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:54,096
There's an old saying.

697
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,845
A marriage is a process

698
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:57,255
of constant compromise.

699
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,964
But why am I the one keep having
to compromise

700
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:01,495
while he gets his way?

701
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:06,856
Think of it another way.

702
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,284
See,

703
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:09,936
take the studio we have right now.

704
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:12,176
To be honest,

705
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:13,605
if we wanted to start a business

706
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:14,564
with just three of us,

707
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:15,936
having such a studio

708
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,136
would be quite impossible.

709
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,564
From its inception to now,

710
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,044
how much help and money

711
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:22,456
has Jiang given us?

712
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:23,804
Think of Jiang

713
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:25,735
as our benefactor.

714
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:28,055
The benefactor wants you
to make him a frog.

715
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:29,616
Don't you think it's very reasonable?

716
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,055
You could even disregard it
being a frog.

717
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,365
Even if he asked me to make

718
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:34,964
a shining pile of gold poop,

719
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,535
I wouldn't see it as a problem.

720
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:39,215
Xu Miao, you're beyond help.

721
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:40,205
The way you spoke just now

722
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:41,896
was exactly like Jiang Hongbin.

723
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:42,885
That's why

724
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,284
you should apply
a different perspective.

725
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:45,804
Put yourself in Jiang's shoes,

726
00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:47,255
he thinks there's nothing wrong.

727
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:49,055
He thinks you're the one
being unreasonable.

728
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:49,845
That's why

729
00:28:49,846 --> 00:28:51,616
he keeps wanting to correct you.

730
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,376
No!

731
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:58,015
You correct someone
when they made a mistake.

732
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:00,125
He's using his own way

733
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:00,804
to force me

734
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,096
into doing what I don't want to.

735
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,336
Think about it some more.

What is it?

739
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:46,524
You must have thought about

740
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:48,616
filling this application
a long time, right?

741
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,696
You're the one who wanted the divorce.

742
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:04,495
And what if I change my mind now?

743
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,656
I've filled in my portion.

744
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:14,324
I'll leave the form with you.

745
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:15,815
Whenever you're ready,

746
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,616
you can hand it in.

Where did you park your car?

750
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,255
At the carpark.

751

Mine's over there.

After wrapping up the things,

753
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:13,775
I'll park the car in the basement.

754
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:15,575

Of course.

855
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,205
I'm just curious.

00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,404
What would your wife think

857
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,376
if she found out about the woman

858
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:07,776
named Lin Xiao?

859
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:16,575
You received the offer letter
from the UK, right?

860
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,284
Could you help me get an offer letter

861
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:20,336
from a London Medical School?

862
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:25,085
You think too highly of me.

863
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:26,936
I... I don't have the capability.

864
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,495
But Lin Xiao does.

865
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:29,565
Besides,

866
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,336
she is the daughter of the old dean.

867
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:33,575
It's not hard to write
a recommendation letter.

868
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:36,856
I think it's doable.

869
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:39,404
Sorry.

870
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:40,816
I'm afraid I won't be able to help.

871
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,216
So are you saying

872
00:37:43,445 --> 00:37:44,764
that our working relationship is over?

873
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:45,856
Is it?

874
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:49,256
Gao Ping.

875
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:53,005
I helped you sow discord

876
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,485
between you and your wife,

877
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:55,975
played along with you

878
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:57,645
so that your wife
would start suspecting.

879
00:37:57,646 --> 00:37:58,924
And then you gave her
the silent treatment,

880
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,485
forcing her to ask for a divorce.

881
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,605
Now you've found a new backer,

882
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:04,296
and both of you
will be leaving for the UK.

883
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:05,884
Who knows, you might win

884
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:07,816
a Nobel Prize in biology in the future?

885
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,376
What about me?

886
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:11,495
Have you thought about me?

887
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:12,485
Now the matter has gotten out of hand.

888
00:38:12,486 --> 00:38:14,324
I've even lost any chance of becoming

889
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,575
a stand-in professor's aide.

890
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:16,724
Is that fair to me?

891
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:17,816
So what is it you want?

892
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,125
What is it I want?

893
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:20,856
Let me remind you.

894
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:23,085
Our working together means

895
00:38:23,086 --> 00:38:24,615
that we either win together,
or lose together.

896
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:26,244
Now that you're ahead,

897
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:27,535
you have to help me.

898
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:44,535
I forwarded your WeChat to Xiang Qian.

899
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:47,615
Do I have to pass?

900
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:50,244
What reason

901
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,495
do you have not to pass?

902
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:55,605
Rest assured.

903
00:38:55,606 --> 00:38:57,615
My Moments is secure.

904
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,936
I have a really good habit.

905
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:03,216
Which is, every time when I meet you,

906
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:05,655
I'd record all our conversations.

907
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:07,296
Just in case.

908
00:39:17,046 --> 00:39:18,135
How much is there inside?

909
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,324
It's all the money I have.

910
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,376
About 30,000?

911
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:24,575
Gao Ping, are you playing with me?

912
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:26,615
How much do you want?

913
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:29,376
400,000.

914
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:35,444
I don't have that much.

915
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:36,495
But you do.

916
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:39,456
I've calculated it for you.

917
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,296
After you get the divorce,

918
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:44,324
taking into account the car,

919
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:46,055
house and your wife's income,

920
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:48,605
400,000 is not too much.

921
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:50,416
It's just right for the two of you.

922
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:52,535
You can do it.

923
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:54,896
Moreover,

924
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:58,216
I don't think you're
in the position to haggle.

925
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:01,936
Keep it safe.

926
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:21,244
Mrs. Deng.

927
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:22,165
Mrs. Deng!

928
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,045
Mrs. Deng!

929
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,015
Mrs. Deng!

930
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:26,764
- What's wrong?
- Mrs. Deng.

931
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:28,296
Did something happen
to Deng Haiyang again?

932
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,364
He's good.

933
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:30,695
He's being discharged tomorrow.

934
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:32,216
Okay, that's good.

935
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:34,165
Why are you so in a rush then?

936
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,284
Something happened?

937
00:40:35,285 --> 00:40:36,244
The car's fixed.

938
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:37,856
Haiyang asked me to deliver it quickly.

939
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:39,535
Thanks.

940
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:40,764
He also said,

941
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:42,605
you're not very good at driving.

942
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,055
He asked me to teach you.

943
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,055
Don't listen to him babble.

944
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:48,284
I heard you drove into the curb.

945
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:49,605
It's okay. We can practice.

946
00:40:49,606 --> 00:40:50,615
Safety is most important.

947
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:51,444
It's fine.

948
00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:52,736
I can drive just fine.

949
00:40:55,126 --> 00:40:56,495
Wait for me, Mrs. Deng!

950
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:03,575
Mrs. Deng,

951
00:41:03,606 --> 00:41:05,015
you can relax a little.

952
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,485
Stop calling me "Mrs. Deng".

953
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:08,015
You being here is making me
more nervous.

954
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:09,444
I can get off.

955
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:10,615
What are you doing?

956
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:12,244
Look, Mrs. Deng,

957
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:13,485
the way you're driving,

958
00:41:13,486 --> 00:41:14,816
it's as if the car is parked.

959
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,336
Oh, shut up.

960
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:18,095
No, this won't do.

961
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:18,844
I can't drive.

962
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:20,055
I'm too scared.

963
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:23,336
No.

964
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:24,645
My palms are sweating

965
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:25,776
right now.

966
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:32,256
Mrs. Deng.

967
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:34,284
Have some water.

968
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:36,284
Stop calling me Mrs. Deng.

969
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,936
Deng Haiyang and I are divorced.

970
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,015
Haiyang is my brother.

971
00:41:41,486 --> 00:41:42,284
What else do I call you

972
00:41:42,285 --> 00:41:43,655
if not Mrs. Deng?

973
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:46,485
I know you two

974
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:47,205
are divorced.

975
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:48,816
So I shouldn't be calling you that.

976
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,045
But I've done it

977
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:51,165
for so many years.

978
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,856
It's hard to change it.

979
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:55,575
I'll try my best to stop.

980
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:58,655
Haiyang told me

981
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:00,416
that whenever you drive,

982
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:01,736
you get nervous.

983
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:03,205
When you're nervous,

984
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:04,336
you need to drink water

985
00:42:04,365 --> 00:42:05,575
to calm the nerves.

986
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,095
But the weather is too stuffy.

987
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:08,416
You shouldn't drink too much.

988
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:13,575
I will drink myself.

989
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,776
Bottoms up then.

990
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:18,495
I can't drink it all.

991
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:23,575
Mrs. Deng.

992
00:42:23,885 --> 00:42:25,256
Honestly,

993
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,095
Haiyang got alcohol poisoning

994
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,776
isn't because he drank too much.

995
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:34,336
It's because
he hasn't eaten a proper meal

996
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,095
in over a week.

997
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:38,975
I've never seen him skinny.

998
00:42:40,365 --> 00:42:42,615
You know he's planning to apply for

999
00:42:42,845 --> 00:42:44,085
the certification
of Odor Detection Specialists.

1000
00:42:44,086 --> 00:42:45,444
I don't know where he heard it from,

1001
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:47,924
Supposedly, eating and drinking less

1002
00:42:47,925 --> 00:42:50,336
can help improve nose sensitivity.

1003
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:52,284
Haiyang is not the same guy

1004
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:53,896
from before.

1005
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:55,736
He's really working hard.

1006
00:42:56,046 --> 00:42:57,844
If his mother knew how much he's changed,

1007
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,936
she wouldn't bar him from going home.

1008
00:43:01,566 --> 00:43:03,055
Why isn't she letting him go home?
