00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 20=

4
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:41,936
Xiang Nan.

5
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:45,056
I was in a meeting
and couldn't step away.

6
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:48,856
What happened to your face?

7
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,015
Growing up, I've never once
been slapped in the face.

8
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:54,735
Where is she?

9
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:57,616
Get a cold compress

10
00:01:57,655 --> 00:01:58,416
and put it on madam's face.

11
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,375
What is it you want?

12
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:11,415
I already told you

13
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:14,135
what I want over the phone, didn't I?

14
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,855
You're asking too much.

15
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:20,056
I can't do it.

16
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:30,896
You

17
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:33,056
can go over this first.

18
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,336
Then you can tell me

19
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:36,815
if I'm asking too much.

20
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:47,056
This is just part of it.

21
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,896
I have more.

22
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:00,855
Add another 200,000.

23
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:04,056
My nose is crooked because of your wife.

24
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:05,336
It's fee for fixing it.

25
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,456
Don't forget to vacate the room.

26
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:17,575
Miss.

27
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:18,375
Is my brother back?

28
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:18,896
Yes, he is.

29
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:19,736
That's good, that's good.

30
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:23,016
Xiang Nan.

31
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:24,135
Is she...

32
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:28,695
Did Xu Sumin hit you?

33
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:29,655
I got bitten by a dog.

34
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:32,336
That's great.

35
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:34,056
What the heck?

36
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:35,456
Do you have a conscience?

37
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:36,655
Gloating at my misfortune, are you?

38
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:38,016
No, I'm not gloating.

39
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,176
I'm seriously glad.

40
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:39,655
Listen.

41
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:41,016
Let me explain.

42
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,975
When they were married,
she always bullied me.

43
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:46,216
Now, my brother can finally
put her in her place!

44
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:47,456
Think about it.

45
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:51,296
His ex slapped his current, beloved wife.

46
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,296
Would he spare the ex-wife?

47
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:54,176
Right?

48
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:54,896
Rest assured.

49
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:55,975
He'll stand up for you.

50
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,016
I'll get you a cold compress.

51
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,736
Xiang Nan, pack a bag.

52
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:00,855
We'll stay outside for a few days.

53
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:07,815
What do you mean?

54
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,375
I'll explain to you later.

55
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:10,855
No.

56
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,336
Explain it to me now.

57
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:16,575
It's complicated.

58
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:17,656
You wouldn't understand.

59
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:19,536
Even so, you better explain.

60
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:21,936
Please, Xiang Nan.

61
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:22,416
Let's not argue.

62
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,056
I'm asking you, Jiang.

63
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,176
Is this house ours?

64
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:26,375
It's just a house.

65
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,976
You told me this is our home.

66
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:32,135
Are you going to make more trouble
for me right now?

67
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:32,936
Come on, Xiang Nan.

68
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:33,296
Let's...

69
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:34,976
Xiang Nan.

70
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:35,856
Xiang Nan!

71
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:39,455
Jiaqiao, go and help Xiang Nan pack.

72
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:40,215
Hongbin.

73
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:41,895
This isn't fair for Xiang Nan.

74
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:43,335
I don't want to hear it from you!

75
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:44,895
You've been divorced a long time.

76
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:46,296
Why do you still give in to her?

77
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:46,895
What do you know?

78
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:47,695
What...

79
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:48,936
It's been so long,

80
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:51,215
but looks like you haven't improved at all.

81
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:52,936
Still as dim as ever.

82
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:54,695
You should learn from your brother more.

83
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,976
Especially on knowing your priorities.

84
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,736
So you got whacked too?

85
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:05,296
Should I introduce a hospital for you
to fix yourself up?

86
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:05,976
Shut up.

87
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,296
You're in no position to speak.

88
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:08,455
Jiang Hongbin,

89
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,536
get me a car to go to the hospital.

90
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:11,496
I need to check my injuries.

91
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:48,296
Mom.

92
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:50,656
Mom.

93
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,575
You scared me, goodness.

94
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:05,056
You dare laugh?

95
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,616
I think I saw Xiang Nan over here.

96
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:11,895
Xiang Nan?

97
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:14,215
Why is she out there
and not in the house?

98
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:15,536
You go inside.

99
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:16,215
I'll go check.

100
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:33,976
Xiang Nan?

101
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:36,895
It is you.

102
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,215
Mom said she saw you.

103
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:39,296
Why aren't you home?

104
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,775
Qian.

105
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:43,895
What's wrong?

106
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,215
I'm not going home.

107
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,375
Who hit you?

108
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:50,815
Was it Jiang Hongbin?

109
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:53,335
Today,

110
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:54,976
Jiang Hongbin's ex-wife

111
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,335
suddenly showed up.

112
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:58,775
And she was being totally unreasonable.

113
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:00,335
She went to my room

114
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:01,775
and said she was going to stay there.

115
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:02,656
She even wanted

116
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,736
to clear away my things.

117
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:04,936
Can you believe it?

118
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:06,616
So of course I said no way

119
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,976
and we got into a fight.

120
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:09,976
She slapped me.

121
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:11,215
Did you hit back?

122
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,056
Yes.

123
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,015
Does Jiang Hongbin know?

124
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,335
How did he react?

125
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,656
I don't know why.

126
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:23,775
When he got home,

127
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:26,856
he went and spoke
to the ex-wife and then...

128
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,096
He asked me to move out.

129
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:32,895
He told you to move?

130
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,015
I want to talk to him.

131
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:35,176
No, don't, Qian.

132
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:36,416
I want to know what's up.

133
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,815
I can't believe you left just like that.

134
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:38,856
Don't look for him.

135
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:40,335
I don't want more trouble.

136
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:41,096
No way.

137
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:42,575
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

138
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:43,856
I don't want to trouble you.

139
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,335
I can handle it myself.

140
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:45,976
If you could,

141
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:47,296
then why are you sitting here crying?

142
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,335
Jiang Hongbin is a grown man.

143
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,135
How could he have handled it so badly?

144
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:55,616
I'm going to ask him why his ex-wife
is stepping all over him.

145
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:57,936
And how dare he ask you to move out.

146
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,416
Most importantly,
why is Jiang Hongbin acting this way?

147
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,255
Why don't you go back home first?

148
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:04,695
If Dad sees me,

149
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:05,976
he'll blow his top.

150
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,695
Okay, listen. I'll go find him.

151
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:10,736
I'll take you to the studio.

152
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:11,775
Wait for me there.

153
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:12,375
Okay?

154
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,176
Come on, stand up.

155
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:15,936
No use crying over here.

156
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:17,416
I'm not crying.

157
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,375
Who's this bully?

158
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:27,895
Mr. Jiang.

159
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,135
Miss Xiang is here.

160
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:30,176
Mr. Tao,

161
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,375
something came up.

162
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:32,296
I'll get back to you later.

163
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:33,975
Go on.

164
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:36,936
Xiang Qian.

165
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,455
I'm sure you came
to find out what happened, right?

166
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:42,176
Sit.

167
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,376
So what happened?

168
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:50,136
I don't suppose
you know much about my ex-wife.

169
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,776
Xu Sumin is quite bossy.

170
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,136
She's difficult to be around.

171
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:56,735
Her family had some background

172
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:57,896
in the past.

173
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:01,256
When I first started doing business,

174
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:02,815
they were a big help.

175
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:05,575
To put it simply,

176
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:06,855
without Xu Sumin,

177
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:08,896
I wouldn't have been as successful.

178
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:10,656
But when we got divorced,

179
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:12,095
I gave her what was stipulated.

180
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:15,335
But she's a big spender,
and invests recklessly.

181
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,215
Now she's broke, so she's back for money.

182
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,256
She went back to the house

183
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:21,416
and purposely took it out on Xiang Nan.

184
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,615
Because she's trying

185
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:25,575
to make me give her money
to get rid of her.

186
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,296
It's not that I don't want
to give it to her.

187
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,735
My daughter is living with her.

188
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,016
It's that I don't have so much.

189
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:35,136
That's the situation.

190
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,536
Xiang Nan is your wife.

191
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:40,896
How could you

192
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,256
ask her to vacate her room

193
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:43,256
for someone else?

194
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:44,936
Who would be fine with that?

195
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,695
Xiang Qian, in this situation,

196
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,536
the more agitated one party is,

197
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:49,695
the more the other party
needs to remain calm.

198
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:51,495
This is why I asked Jiaqiao

199
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:53,416
to take Xiang Nan away
to clear her head.

200
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:55,136
Stay away for a few days

201
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,776
until I resolve the matter
with Xu Sumin.

202
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:02,256
Is this how you protect Xiang Nan?

203
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,016
I believe the best way to protect her

204
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,815
is allowing her to live
without any worries.

205
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:13,136
And not getting caught up

206
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,376
with winning arguments
over trivial matters.

207
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:16,416
Xiang Qian.

208
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:18,575
You have more real world
experiences than her.

209
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:20,855
I hope you can understand my predicament.

210
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,575
I also hope you're able
to talk to Xiang Nan for me.

211
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,656
Ask her to be more open-minded

212
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,416
and look at things more objectively.

213
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,936
I don't know who Xu Sumin is.

214
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,296
All I know is that you're
my little sister's husband.

215
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,416
I hope you can deal with this quickly.

216
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:44,975
Hongbin,

217
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:47,615
aside from living

218
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:49,016
a comfortable, worry-free life,

219
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:52,095
my wish is for Xiang Nan
to live a happy life.

220
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:55,016
So,

221
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:56,215
after you get this sorted,

222
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,656
you better make some effort
to console her.

223
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:01,776
I will.

224
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,416
Let me see you off.

225
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:08,455
It's okay. You go ahead.

226
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:15,256
Qian.

227
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,536
When did you get here?

228
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,296
Just did.

229
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:22,615
Let me wash my hands.

230
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:29,176
You bought me milk tea?

231
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:36,256
Does it hurt?

232
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:38,695
It's fine.

233
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:41,296
I'm just fair, so it looks more obvious.

234
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,136
I don't feel it.

235
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:43,615
Look at you being gracious.

236
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:47,896
I went to see Jiang Hongbin just now.

237
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:50,656
He told me the gist of the matter.

238
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,695
We don't know how many times

239
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:54,536
his ex-wife showed up before.

240
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:55,936
But I can bet this isn't the first.

241
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,615
So Jiang Hongbin has had enough
of letting her get her way.

242
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:01,575
Because every time she came back,

243
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,455
it was for money.

244
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:04,615
But he couldn't say no.

245
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,896
Because he said she has his daughter.

246
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:08,136
When he gives it to her,

247
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,256
she starts gloating
and thinks she can get away with it.

248
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,215
Anyway, this is what he told me.

249
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,896
He's trying to drag it out

250
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:16,095
and not give her so much.

251
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,455
So for the time being,

252
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,815
he asked Jiaqiao to keep you company

253
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:23,335
and take a breather somewhere.

254
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:28,776
Why don't you

255
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:29,735
come stay with me for a while?

256
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,176
No thanks.

257
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:33,735
I don't feel like going anywhere.

258
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,095
So you'll hang around.

259
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:37,376
But let's avoid

260
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:38,735
any head-on confrontation
with the ex-wife.

261
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:41,136
Because we don't know

262
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,575
the exact history between them.

263
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,615
Let them sort it out themselves.

264
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:47,056
Just keep your distance.

265
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,416
Don't get involved.

266
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:52,215
When you married him,

267
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,176
you already knew.

268
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:55,215
That he has an ex-wife and a kid.

269
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:56,656
Of course, we didn't know

270
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:57,455
the actual situation.

271
00:13:58,575 --> 00:13:59,855
Since it's already happened,

272
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,936
give him some time for him to resolve it.

273
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:02,896
Okay?

274
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:06,735
I've thought about it.

275
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:09,896
I'm going to stay at the studio
for the time being.

276
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:12,215
I can focus on producing more pieces.

277
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:13,335
Later,

278
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,896
I can organize more exhibitions

279
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,615
so that the studio

280
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:17,855
can be more self-sustaining.

281
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,896
I don't want to rely so much on him.

282
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:26,016
So my plan now is that...

283
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,855
I'll work harder and make more money.

284
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,735
So you guys can worry less.

285
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:50,896
Haiyang!

286
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:53,455
How come you're here?

287
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:54,855
Why didn't you go in?

288
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,575
I have to be able to get in.

289
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:00,495
Oh, right.

290
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:01,615
I came to take a look.

291
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:03,056
Missing your mom?

292
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:05,095
I thought you've forgotten about me.

293
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,936
Come, let's go in.

294
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:23,695
Haiyang,

295
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:25,176
stay for dinner.

296
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,256
I'll cook you something delicious.

297
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:30,536
Come and sit down.

298
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:32,495
Is it hot?

299
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:33,975
I'll turn on the air-conditioning.

300
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:35,176
Air-conditioning.

301
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,056
Do you want water?

302
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:37,776
I'm good.

303
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:39,695
Take a seat.

304
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,536
Careful.

305
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:43,335
Deary me.

306
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:44,016
It's okay.

307
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:53,936
Mom.

308
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,536
Didn't you say Xiang Zhong

309
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:56,695
locked the doors

310
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:57,896
to the kitchen

311
00:15:58,095 --> 00:15:59,095
and bathroom?

312
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,095
I know to look for
the locksmith too, you know.

313
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:06,376
Mom.

314
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,256
You should go back home.

315
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:12,575
Why should I?

316
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,016
What did she tell you?

317
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:17,376
What did she say?

318
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:18,776
What could she say?

319
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:19,936
She didn't say much.

320
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:21,016
I just think...

321
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:24,376
Look,

322
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:26,335
you made her quit her job.

323
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,215
I think

324
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:29,136
that's as far as you should go, Mom.

325
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:32,975
She said she couldn't care less

326
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:33,815
about the job I got for her.

327
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:35,296
She should've quit sooner.

328
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:36,855
But how could you...

329
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:39,656
Okay then, tell me.

330
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:42,776
What will make you stop?

331
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,215
What is the outcome you want?

332
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:45,776
Are you stupid?

333
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,095
I'm trying to get you this house.

334
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:51,975
This...

335
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,896
She and her family paid

336
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,136
for most of the house.

337
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:55,855
Right?

338
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,455
Don't kid me.

339
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,416
You two were married
for four, five years at least.

340
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:00,815
Didn't you have any savings?

341
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,855
What happened to the money?

342
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,495
I'm sure

343
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:03,615
it went to paying the house, no?

344
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,896
Listen up.

345
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,455
Don't think about going after my money.

346
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:09,856
That's my retirement fund.

347
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,616
I can't buy you a house.

348
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:15,416
As a man,

349
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,416
if you don't have a house,

350
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,215
who's going to marry you?

351
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:19,295
You don't expect

352
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:20,616
to live with me
when you're married, right?

353
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,535
Then I won't get married.

354
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:25,495
So you expect me

355
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:26,616
to look after you forever?

356
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,295
In fact, Xiang Zhong and I...

357
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:34,775
We did

358
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:36,255
have some money saved

359
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,695
during our time together.

360
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:39,656
So where's the money?

361
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,096
I lost it.

362
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,775
How so?

363
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:49,816
It's...

364
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:53,136
Not long ago,

365
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:54,816
I fell victim to an online scam.

366
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:56,576
They took

367
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:58,936
some lewd photos of me.

368
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:01,896
So I got extorted for money.

369
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:08,295
Does she know about it?

370
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:09,096
Yes.

371
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:11,176
She knows?

372
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:13,695
She...

373
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:14,975
Knowing her,

374
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:16,616
she would've burned the house down.

375
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,015
Look at the mess now.

376
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:21,455
You...

377
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:22,255
Are you

378
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:23,176
still hoping

379
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,215
she'd continue living with you?

380
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:25,455
I'm not hoping anything.

381
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:26,096
Nothing.

382
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,215
I'm telling you about the money.

383
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:28,215
It's not about...

384
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,416
I said I got scammed

385
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,376
and lost the money.

386
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,656
That's the truth.

387
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:33,656
I'm not lying to you.

388
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:40,856
Don't be a kid.

389
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:42,295
That's absurd.

390
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:43,695
How absurd can your made-up story be?

391
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:44,775
You made up such a ridiculous story

392
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:45,495
to bluff me?

393
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,576
Who would believe it?

394
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:52,535
Don't be ridiculous.

395
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,936
Mr. Wang, where are we going?

396
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:08,816
Why are we going there?

397
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,455
Mr. Jiang gave instructions.

398
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,136
He said you'd know when we arrive.

399
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,136
I'm not sure of the details.

400
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:20,775
Nan,

401
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,576
Mr. Jiang is waiting inside.

402
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:41,255
Have you calmed down?

403
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,455
I think

404
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,775
we won't be seeing
each other for a while.

405
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,535
I'm going to miss you.

406
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:52,735
Where are you going?

407
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:55,455
It's not me.

408
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:56,816
It's you.

409
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:58,416
I've made arrangements.

410
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,856
You and Jiaqiao will be going
to Sanya for a few days

411
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:01,495
to unwind.

412
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:02,975
I've asked her

413
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:03,816
to pack your things for you.

414
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:05,136
You'll leave tomorrow morning.

415
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:06,616
I don't think I said anything

416
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:07,535
about going to Sanya.

417
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,215
I'm asking you to go.

418
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:12,336
You can come back

419
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:13,096
after I sort things through

420
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:13,775
with Xu Sumin.

421
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,775
I'm preparing for
an exhibition next month.

422
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:21,936
I'm pretty busy lately

423
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:22,455
so I can't go.

424
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:24,055
Xiang Nan.

425
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,775
Why can't you grasp

426
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:27,616
the gist of the matter?

427
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,136
And what's that?

428
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,616
The fact that Xu Sumin

429
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,416
won't give up

430
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,816
if she doesn't get what she wants.

431
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:37,656
If possible,

432
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:39,215
I want to prevent any clashes
between you two.

433
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,735
Still, it doesn't mean you can

434
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:43,576
decide for me, right?

435
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:50,376
Alright.

436
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,975
So I'm asking you now.

437
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,695
Will you go to Sanya for a few days?

438
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,735
No, I'm not going.

439
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,695
Stop being difficult, okay?

440
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:02,455
Jiang,

441
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:03,695
I'm not being difficult.

442
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:04,656
I know why

443
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:05,576
she came back.

444
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:07,576
She wants money from you.

445
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:09,176
But why do I have

446
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:10,255
to purposely avoid her?

447
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,416
I don't intend

448
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:12,455
to have any clashes with her.

449
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,136
Why can't I stay at the studio then?

450
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:14,616
Xiang Nan,

451
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:15,936
why can't you understand?

452
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,535
This is about taking a step back
for the bigger picture.

453
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:19,535
Just do as I say!

454
00:21:19,816 --> 00:21:21,416
I told you, I'm not going anywhere.

455
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:22,816
I want to work.

456
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:24,295
You call what you do work?

457
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:29,176
Are you saying it's not work?

458
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:30,576
In your eyes,

459
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:31,215
what I do

460
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:32,495
is worthless, is it?

461
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,015
Value is when something
generates benefits.

462
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:34,975
Benefits

463
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:36,295
that are clearly visible, Xiang Nan.

464
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,455
So what is visible value?

465
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:38,055
Money?

466
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:39,176
Isn't it?

467
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:45,295
Okay.

468
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,775
I have a meeting to go to.

469
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:48,816
Tonight,

470
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:49,455
we'll stay here.

471
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:50,416
I'll take you

472
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:51,975
to the airport first thing tomorrow.

473
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:21,495
Hello, Haiyang.

474
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:23,255
What made you call me today?

475
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:26,576
Hey.

476
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,376
Is it convenient right now?

477
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:29,136
Is there anyone

478
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:30,535
around you?

479
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:31,936
Where are you?

480
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:33,936
It's working hours. I'm at my post.

481
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:34,695
Anything I can do for you?

482
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:40,695
Gosh, how should I say it?

483
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:45,656
What is it? Just tell me.

484
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:47,215
You want to treat me to dinner?

485
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:48,896
Sure, I'm free.

486
00:22:58,495 --> 00:22:59,255
I'm in trouble.

487
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,695
These are duplicates.

488
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,616
One is the bank statement.

489
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:39,255
The other

490
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:42,176
is the chat log from the incident.

491
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:50,576
I've submitted one copy

492
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:51,695
to the police.

493
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:53,975
This copy is for you.

494
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,215
So,

495
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:06,576
you're giving everything up for her?

496
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,015
Listen, Mom.

497
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:17,295
Right now,

498
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:18,416
I don't want to think about anything.

499
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:20,455
I really don't want

500
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:21,295
to think about it.

501
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:23,975
All I want

502
00:24:24,015 --> 00:24:25,255
is to have an amicable split.

503
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:28,936
If this gets out,

504
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,215
how will you survive in Kunshan?

505
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:32,015
What...

506
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:33,376
I...

507
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:34,856
I'm not trying to spread it.

508
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,096

00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:49,975
how come you're back?

539
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:51,896
Yeah, I came back.

540
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:53,735
There's a parcel for you.

541
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:54,936
Mine?

542
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:08,055
What is it?

543
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:10,695
Pepper spray.

544
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:14,656
My sister sent it to me.

545
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:17,055
Let me call her.

546
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:20,455
Pretty nice environment.

547
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:23,416
But too many mosquitoes.

548
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,495
Who's that?

549
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:27,695
I'm not just anybody.

550
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:31,255
I'm your funder.

551
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:33,975
Why are you here?

552
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:35,896
To settle the score with you.

553
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,055
There's nothing to settle.

554
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,896
Please leave.

555
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:47,096
You broke my nose.

556
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,096
It cost me a fortune.

557
00:26:49,656 --> 00:26:51,376
So I'm here to settle the bill with you.

558
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:52,455
Don't be ridiculous.

559
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:53,495
Listen up,

560
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:54,336
missy.

561
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:55,455
Never mind you.

562
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,735
Even if it was Jiang Hongbin
that crossed me,

563
00:26:57,936 --> 00:26:58,936
I'd skewer him.

564
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:00,336
Skewer him nice and good.

565
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:02,136
Let's see

566
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:03,856
if you're still up

567
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,055
for being the wealthy missus then.

568
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,055
If you can still hole up here,
making these!

569
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,055
What a shame.

570
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:12,816
Oops.

571
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,096
Are you crazy?

572
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:15,136
Have you lost your mind?

573
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,255
Are you mad?

574
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:18,096
Xu Sumin!

575
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,616
I'm warning you!

576
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:23,255
Too bad.

577
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,616
It was an accident.

578
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:27,215
Oh dear, what a huge accident.

579
00:27:28,936 --> 00:27:31,096
Gosh... These things are so fragile.

580
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:32,015
Don't you touch that!

581
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:32,975
Put it down!

582
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:34,295
It's heavy.

583
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:36,215
Put that down! I'll call the police

584
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:37,176
if you don't put it down!

585
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:37,936
Don't worry.

586
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,176
The pieces of art that got smashed today

587
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:40,775
will all be paid by Jiang Hongbin.

588
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:42,295
- Got that?
- Give it back!

589
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,695
- You got that?
- Give it back!

590
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:46,096
Don't you have any manners?

591
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:52,215
Are you okay?

592
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:52,975
My eyes...

593
00:27:58,055 --> 00:27:58,695
Are you alright?

594
00:27:58,775 --> 00:27:59,455
I'm okay.

595
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,975
What are you doing, Xiang Nan?

596
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:06,535
I told you to take a breather
in Sanya

597
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:07,616
but you refused.

598
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:08,896
Then you went and provoked her.

599
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:11,176
I didn't provoke her.

600
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:13,495
She came to my studio and made a scene.

601
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,015
She smashed all my work.

602
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:15,616
She even tried

603
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:16,735
to destroy Yi Yi's graduation piece.

604
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:17,695
I don't give a damn

605
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,975
about those garbage glassware of yours.

606
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:22,015
Do you know

607
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:23,255
how much I've lost
because of your shenanigan?

608
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,535
I lost

609
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:25,775
all my grounds for negotiation!

610
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,455
Why are you even negotiating with her?

611
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:29,255
Do you owe her anything?

612
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:30,215
I owe her nothing.

613
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:31,735
Then why do you need to negotiate?

614
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,775
I don't have a choice.

615
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,376
Why is that?

616
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:38,255
Don't ask what you shouldn't know!

617
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:55,336
What are you doing here?

618
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,495
Um...

619
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,136
Why don't you...

620
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:00,775
go back home for a few days?

621
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:01,936
This is my house.

622
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:03,136
I can stay here however long I want.

623
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:03,896
You can't tell me otherwise.

624
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:04,856
Yes, I can't.

625
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:07,735
I just wanted to tell you

626
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,015
that my mom

627
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:11,336
is moving out.

628
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,856
As for the wall in the house,

629
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,096
I'll find workers to tear it down

630
00:29:16,136 --> 00:29:17,215
in the next few days.

631
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:18,975
After I clean everything up,

632
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:20,535
I'll tell you and you can come back.

633
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:21,816
Why?

634
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:24,295
Why did she suddenly decide to move out?

635
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,455
That's... not important.

636
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:31,535
Well,

637
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:32,695
if you don't believe me...

638
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:36,255
I suppose it's fine if you

639
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:37,215
just stay on.

640
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:39,096
I just wanted to let you know.

641
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:44,775
Anyway, are you...

642
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:47,015
still going to resign?

643
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:48,336
Yeah.

644
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:51,176
Okay.

645
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:00,015
Our...

646
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:02,295
Our divorce.

647
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:03,975
Are we still going through

648
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:06,735
with it?

649
00:30:12,215 --> 00:30:12,695
Yes, we are.

650
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:16,055
It got revoked because we delayed

651
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:16,775
formalizing it

652
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,816
after the cooling period ended.

653
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:19,975
So we have to resubmit it.

654
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:21,896
Okay.

655
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:24,936
Got it.

656
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:09,176
Xiang Qian.

657
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:11,055
You're back.

658
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:12,295
Aunty.

659
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:13,576
Where are the kids?

660
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:15,656
Gao Ping took them down to play.

661
00:31:17,896 --> 00:31:18,695
Gao Ping is back?

662
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:29,416
Why did you

663
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:30,495
buy so many things?

664
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:33,376
I'm leaving tomorrow.

665
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:35,695
So I thought I should get more.

666
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:39,775
Is it that urgent?

667
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:42,576
Fang Yuan is in the hospital.

668
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:45,775
Is it serious?

669
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:47,775
It's gastric bleeding.

670
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:49,936
Pretty bad.

671
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:52,455
Okay, go back and check on him.

672
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:55,136
If it's really bad,

673
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:56,215
you can consider

674
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:57,816
taking him to Shanghai to get treated.

675
00:31:58,896 --> 00:31:59,656
No, that's okay.

676
00:32:01,176 --> 00:32:02,295
It's not that serious.

677
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:04,376
He's always had gastric problems.

678
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:05,775
When I go back,

679
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:06,816
I'll help regulate his diet.

680
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:15,176
Xiang Qian,

681
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:16,535
I'm sorry.

682
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:18,975
I'm not able to wait
until you find another helper.

683
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:22,136
There's nothing to be sorry about.

684
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:23,695
When a child is sick,

685
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,255
the mother should be there
to look after him.

686
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,816
I worried you guys wouldn't have
time to go to the supermarket,

687
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:33,896
so I bought more meat.

688
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:36,015
The ribs have cartilage.

689
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:37,055
Cong loves them.

690
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:39,376
These two packs of chicken wings

691
00:32:39,535 --> 00:32:40,936
I got for Qi.

692
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:43,416
I didn't buy

693
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:44,495
too many greens,

694
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:45,576
in case they go bad.

695
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,535
You love mushrooms.

696
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:52,816
So I bought quite a lot.

697
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:54,096
Remember to eat them.

698
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:55,376
They can't be stored too long.

699
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,336
Aunty, what about

700
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:08,695
you come back to us
after Fang Yuan is better?

701
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:14,055
I'm not coming back.

702
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:15,416
I...

703
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:23,975
(Gao Ping: Dearest,)

704
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,376
(give me a bit more time.)

705
00:33:26,096 --> 00:33:27,416
(Very soon, I'll be divorced.)

706
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,720
(- It'll be too late if it's not done by July.
- It won't take that long!)

707
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:34,535
What's the matter, Aunty?

708
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:38,576
Be careful.

709
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:42,816
What's wrong?

710
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:47,295
Xiang Qian, Gao Ping is...

711
00:33:51,455 --> 00:33:53,295
Come inside. Change your shoes.

712
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:53,695
They're back.

713
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:56,015
Mom, we're back!

714
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:57,735
Hello, you guys.

715
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,055
Welcome back.

716
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:06,416
Put these on.

717
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:07,015
You two,

718
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:08,256
ask Grand Aunt to help wash your hands.

719
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,816
Go wash your hands.

720
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:09,495
Grand Aunt...

721
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:11,336
Okay, come. We'll go wash our hands.

722
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:12,095
Come on.

723
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:14,535
Come.

724
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:16,175
Wash our hands.

725
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:18,696
Did you guys have fun?

726
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,216
Yes.

727
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:26,336
What's the matter?

728
00:34:28,856 --> 00:34:30,896
What is the situation with Fang Yuan?

729
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:32,816
One moment, Aunty said it's serious.

730
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:34,336
Another moment, she said it's not.

731
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:36,416
Does he have...

732
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,095
some kind of untreatable illness?

733
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,495
What I heard is that it's quite a pain.

734
00:34:44,936 --> 00:34:46,055
You have some friends

735
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:47,535
at the medical school hospital
back home, right?

736
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:49,455
Did you ask around for Aunty?

737
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:51,776
Yes, I've referred their case.

738
00:34:53,095 --> 00:34:53,696
Don't worry.

739
00:34:55,296 --> 00:34:56,816
I'm going to bathe the kids.

740
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:57,736
They're all sweaty.

741
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:00,256
Cong, Qi.

742
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:01,655
Come and bath after you wash your hands.

743
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,296
Ms. Lin, are you free?

744
00:35:13,135 --> 00:35:15,655
Can I give you a call right now?

745
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:22,896
Hello?

746
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,776
Hi, Ms. Lin.

747
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:28,015
Um,

748
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,615
I wanted to ask

749
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:31,575
about how Fang Yuan
has been doing at work.

750
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:33,816
The boy is quite good. Why do you ask?

751
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:40,135
He's ill with gastric bleeding

752
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:40,975
and got hospitalized.

753
00:35:41,296 --> 00:35:44,095
So he'll need to take a long break.

754
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,896
Sorry to inconvenience you.

755
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,175
Fang Yuan has gastric bleeding?

756
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:50,336
Are you sure?

757
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:51,575
You must have heard wrong.

758
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:53,416
I just saw him

759
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,696
leaving work on his motorbike.

760
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,416
Oh... I guess...

761
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:01,256
I guess I misheard.

762
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:03,856
Sorry about that.

763
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:05,296
I have to trouble you

764
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,615
to look out for Fang Yuan.

765
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:07,455
Thanks.

766
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:08,575
Okay. I'll talk to you next time.

767
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:09,696
Bye-bye.

768
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:19,336
Gao Ping.

769
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:21,336
Gao Ping,

770
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,455
can you come here?

771
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:26,856
What is it?

772
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:33,776
Is Fang Yuan really sick?

773
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:38,615
I... I just called

774
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,336
his manager.

775
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:40,455
See,

776
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:41,376
I thought

777
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,736
if he has gastric bleeding,

778
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:43,975
he'd have to apply for a long leave.

779
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:44,936
Because I was the one

780
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:46,655
who introduced him the job.

781
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:48,216
But the manager told me

782
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:49,896
she just saw Fang Yuan

783
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:52,615
leaving work on his motorbike.

784
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:56,696
That got me totally confused now.

785
00:36:58,256 --> 00:36:59,055
Moreover,

786
00:36:59,055 --> 00:37:00,816
Aunty has been
very absent-minded lately.

787
00:37:01,015 --> 00:37:02,095
Didn't you notice?

788
00:37:04,816 --> 00:37:05,615
Did something happen

789
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:07,336
that I shouldn't know about?

790
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:10,575
If it's to do with your family

791
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:11,696
and you prefer not to say,

792
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:12,575
then I won't ask.

793
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:20,575
Aunty wants to leave
because of the immense pressure.

794
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:25,776
What pressure?

795
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,015
The thing is,
after she started coming here,

796
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:33,936
you and I

797
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:35,095
have been arguing over little things.

798
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:37,135
Also, you kept asking here

799
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,095
about this and that.

800
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,615
She felt stuck in between us.

801
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:41,256
It's stressing her out
so she decided to leave.

802
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,856
I didn't ask this and that.

803
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:44,535
I only asked her once.

804
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:45,856
About the condition

805
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,776
at home

806
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:47,575
when I'm not here.

807
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:49,055
I think

808
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:51,055
it's pretty normal to ask that, no?

809
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,495
See, that's the problem.

810
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:53,216
You always think

811
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:54,376
whatever you say is normal.

812
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,015
But your actions

813
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:56,296
are giving pressure to others.

814
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:58,936
Take this matter for example.

815
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:01,256
Aunty wants to leave.

816
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:02,336
She feels unhappy.

817
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:03,535
So she used Fang Yuan

818
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,975
as an excuse.

819
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:07,696
Evade the actual problem a little

820
00:38:07,936 --> 00:38:08,856
and it'll pass.

821
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:09,896
A lot of things

822
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:11,216
will sort themselves out

823
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:11,776
if you let them.

824
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:12,975
But you just had to make the call

825
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:14,015
and ask about the details.

826
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:14,856
So now what?

827
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,216
Are you going to expose her

828
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:17,216
and make her feel bad?

829
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:19,416
That's not my intention.

830
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:20,736
Be it calling or doing whatever,

831
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:22,216
I'm just trying to help her.

832
00:38:24,776 --> 00:38:25,216
Fine then.

833
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,736
So long as you think you're helping her.

834
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:29,936
Just let her go if she wants to.

835
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:31,336
There's no need...

836
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:32,816
No need to make that call.

837
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:09,736
Aunty.

838
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:13,856
What is it?

839
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:15,776
Nothing.

840
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,455
You want to do laundry?

841
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:20,256
Come, give it to me.

842
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:22,416
Wait.

843
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:23,896
Why did you put the thing you removed

844
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:24,816
back?

845
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,336
It's nothing.

846
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:28,936
Just two used tickets for a hot spring.

847
00:39:30,095 --> 00:39:31,135
Hot spring tickets?

848
00:39:34,816 --> 00:39:35,655
Never mind the tickets.

849
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:36,696
When you're washing the clothes,

850
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:37,856
you should empty the pockets.

851
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:38,736
Remove them.

852
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:40,615
They're used.

853
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:43,296
I'll get rid of them later.

854
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:43,896
Okay?

855
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,376
Give it to me, I'll throw them away.

856
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:04,416
Aunty.

857
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,376
During your stay

858
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:08,736
with our family,

859
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:09,975
do you think

860
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:10,975
I'm mistrustful?

861
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:13,776
Not at all.

862
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:15,896
I think you're a good person.

863
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:19,655
I know Fang Yuan is not sick.

864
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:22,776
The reason you want to leave
in a hurry

865
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,416
is because

866
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:27,336
you feel a lot of pressure
living with us.

867
00:40:30,256 --> 00:40:30,975
That's not true.

868
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:33,296
Don't overthink it.

869
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:35,615
You're not the problem.

870
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:38,816
I'm not the problem,

871
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:40,776
neither is Fang Yuan.

872
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:44,256
So is it because the two children
are too naughty?

873
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:45,535
No.

874
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:46,936
Like I said,

875
00:40:48,495 --> 00:40:49,655
it's not your problem.

876
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:54,135
Aunty,

877
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:55,455
I just thought that

878
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,736
we had reached an understanding

879
00:40:56,816 --> 00:40:58,336
during these time.

880
00:40:58,896 --> 00:40:59,776
I'm sad

881
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:01,416
that you're leaving.

882
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:03,015
I just wanted to ask

883
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:04,975
if there's any better solution

884
00:41:04,975 --> 00:41:06,135
for the current problem.

885
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:08,256
Xiang Qian,

886
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:11,095
please stop asking.

887
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:11,975
Really...

888
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,256
I don't know anything.

889
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:15,296
I really don't know anything.

890
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,296
What did you say to Aunty now?

891
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:27,816
Aunty.

892
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:29,216
You haven't finished packing, right?

893
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:30,095
You should go pack.

894
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:41,615
What did you tell her this time?

895
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:50,816
I went there with Mr. Lu.

896
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:51,615
What's the matter?

897
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:52,575
Two grown men went

898
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:53,575
to a hot spring resort together?

899
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:55,376
He is my mentor.

900
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:57,135
He asked me to go
to the hot spring with him.

901
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:58,055
Could I have said no?

902
00:41:58,095 --> 00:41:58,896
Anything wrong with that?

903
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:03,015
Then how come Aunty's first reaction
of seeing this

904
00:42:03,055 --> 00:42:04,816
was to hide it?

905
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:06,175
How should I know?

906
00:42:07,095 --> 00:42:08,175
What are you implying?

907
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:11,936
You think

908
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:14,015
I went there with Li Shu?

909
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:17,936
You just made me remember something.

910
00:42:18,376 --> 00:42:19,495
A few days ago,

911
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,696
I saw a Moments post from Li Shu.

912
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:22,575
She was at a hot spring resort
in Suzhou.

913
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:25,135
On top of that,

914
00:42:25,135 --> 00:42:26,416
when Aunty saw the tickets,

915
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:28,416
she frantically tried to hide them.

916
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:31,175
How do you expect me

917
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,535
not to be suspicious

918
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:33,615
and connect the dots?

919
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:34,696
Okay, sure.

920
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,455
Be suspicious then.

921
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:37,575
Fine with me.

922
00:42:41,856 --> 00:42:42,336
Okay.

923
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,256
I'll go ask Mr. Lu

924
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:45,856
tomorrow.

925
00:42:47,135 --> 00:42:48,055
Ask him if there were

926
00:42:48,095 --> 00:42:49,015
so many projects lately

927
00:42:49,055 --> 00:42:50,135
that you guys had to go

928
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:51,696
to a hot spring to discuss them.

929
00:42:56,896 --> 00:42:57,816
If that doesn't work,

930
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:59,135
I can go straight to the hot spring.

931
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,696
It should be easy to find out.

932
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:03,296
Li Shu was there, alright?
