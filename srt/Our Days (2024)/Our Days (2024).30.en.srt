=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 30=

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,150
I wish to get a divorce.

5
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,670
Stop messing around.

6
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,430
After our previous gathering with Biao,

7
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,430
I was wondering

8
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,271
if I would lead a life like Mrs. Fang,

9
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:53,751
who was playing the pipa,

10
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:56,950
in the future.

11
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,351
I won't accept that.

12
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,631
I'm not willing
to become someone like that.

13
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:08,150
No one is forcing you

14
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,991
to become someone like her.

15
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:10,471
That's not true.

16
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,551
You're doing it to me.

17
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,270
You keep thinking of ways

18
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,230
to force me

19
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,871
into becoming the version of myself
that you would like.

20
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,550
I can't do it.

21
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,790
We had direct confrontations

22
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,990
one after another.

23
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,751
It hurt our relationship.

24
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,431
I don't wish to shatter

25
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,270
the remaining beautiful memories

26
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:25,510
that we had together.

27
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,471
But more importantly,

28
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,151
I no longer love you.

29
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,751
But I still love you.

30
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:37,510
You...

31
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,151
Do you think your love is healthy?

32
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,471
I don't care if it's healthy or not.

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,710
Those are my feelings.

34
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,270
I'll only have one suggestion for you.

35
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,191
I'll never say yes

36
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:47,351
to a divorce.

37
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,471
Jessica,

38
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:51,631
has everyone arrived?

39
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,871
We're waiting for you.

40
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,230
Got it.

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,911
I'm having dinner at home tonight.

42
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,230
You should come back early too.

43
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:00,230
I'm not going back.

44
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,031
I'm going to get a divorce with you.

45
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,450
(Pudong District Police Station, Shanghai)

46
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:37,790
Mr. Gao,

47
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:39,471
Mrs. Xiang Qian

48
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,710
entrusted this meeting to me

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,550
mainly to confirm two things with you.

50
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,911
Firstly,

51
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,270
you're in favor

52
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,510
of getting a divorce
with Mrs. Xiang Qian,

53
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,270
am I right?

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,191
Due to the unique circumstances
you're under,

55
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:55,871
you can only proceed with the divorce

56
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,110
with a litigation.

57
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:58,911
If you don't have any objections,

58
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,990
the court

59
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,830
should be contacting you soon.

60
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,871
Secondly,

61
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,911
back then, when you and Xiang Qian

62
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,110
discussed the divorce,

63
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,631
Xiang Qian promised that she would
give you 200,000 yuan.

64
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,656
Now, Li Shu has
returned the money to you.

65
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:17,587
Xiang Qian said

66
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,429
she's still willing

67
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,830
to lend you the money.

68
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,150
I've already handed the bank card

69
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:23,751
to the custodial officer.

70
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,991
As for the password,

71
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,350
Xiang Qian said
you know about it.

72
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,350
Morning.

73
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:47,150
Morning.

74
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,231
Judging from your expression,

75
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,270
I suppose you didn't sleep well again.

76
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,751
Listen.

77
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,910
I tried the sleep gummy
that everyone on the Internet

78
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,030
was recommending.

79
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,910
It didn't work at all.

80
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,631
You shouldn't take

81
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,431
such medicine without
professional opinions.

82
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,991
You should visit a doctor.

83
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,791
How did the discussion go?

84
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,231
We're stuck in a deadlock.

85
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,510
I'll schedule another online meeting

86
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,390
with Sun Ying, then.

87
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,030
Thank you, Boss.

88
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:17,470
I appreciate your effort, Boss.

89
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,950
Sorry, Boss.

90
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,631
How's Gao Ping doing, then?

91
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:33,991
He's waiting for
the court session to begin.

92
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,150
Has he not managed to gather
the required 300,000 yuan yet?

93
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,111
No one will help him out for that.

94
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:47,551
He

95
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,431
brought this upon himself.

96
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,270
I already lent him 200,000 yuan.

97
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,111
But he has to gather 100,000 yuan

98
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,431
through his own means.

99
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,710
You still want to reform him, huh?

100
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,551
Wait.

101
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,830
Don't you think

102
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,270
you're being too much
of a saintess here?

103
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,191
I don't have time for that.

104
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:16,751
It's not like I want to reform him.

105
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:19,991
I just want him to know

106
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:21,590
that one should maintain basic kindness

107
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,751
between human interactions.

108
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,311
No one is willing to live in a world

109
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,950
filled with malice.

110
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,111
We were husband and wife after all.

111
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:33,311
And, I know

112
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,390
that he did devote himself
to my children

113
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,431
all these years.

114
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,950
We should part on good terms.

115
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,311
Now, he should understand

116
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,270
that the person he hurt

117
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,830
is the one

118
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:51,350
who treats him the best.

119
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,231
Just let him regret it.

120
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,111
Mr. Chai,

121
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,830
I suggest you reflect upon
your company's actions as well.

122
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,431
Is it the group's regulations
that are problematic?

123
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,631
Or is it that your sales team

124
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,431
is not performing well?

125
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,470
Huadong

126
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,311
is the leader of
several subsidiary companies.

127
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,510
However, your sales performance

128
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:24,150
is deteriorating season after season.

129
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:25,751
As the group leader in charge

130
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,830
of your company,

131
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,270
how do you expect me

132
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,311
to explain myself
to the board of directors?

133
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,231
What do you mean by
poor sales performance?

134
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:34,150
Say,

135
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:37,071
I know you guys are executives.

136
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,950
But can you guys

137
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,270
stop viewing things from above

138
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,030
and try to be in our shoes for once?

139
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,590
Do you know
how many companies are currently

140
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,671
working on smart systems out there?

141
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,111
It's highly competitive.

142
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,470
Everyone is doing their best

143
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,390
to attract more customers,

144
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:48,950
do you know that?

145
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,791
But you guys?

146
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,791
You guys

147
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,510
stuck rigidly to the rules.

148
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:53,071
Do you know how many of our proposals

149
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:53,950
you guys have disapproved?

150
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:54,791
Do you know

151
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:55,671
how much energy and time

152
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,231
we've spent just to discuss the deals
with our clients?

153
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:59,431
Now, you want us

154
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,631
to prove ourselves
with our sales performance?

155
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,671
Sales performance

156
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,751
isn't real, you know?

157
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,150
Your employees are real.

158
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,150
If you treat your employees well,

159
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:05,910
the sales performance

160
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,270
will improve naturally, don't you think?

161
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,431
You don't need to throw a tantrum
in front of me.

162
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:10,631
I've gathered information

163
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,030
about your company's situation
from indirect sources.

164
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,631
Lately, your entire team

165
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:15,751
has been slacking off.

166
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,431
Do you need me to explain that to you?

167
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,071
Yes.

168
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,071
Everyone is dealing with family matters

169
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,470
since we're in our middle age.

170
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,671
But everyone has their
own fair shares of trouble.

171
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,191
I suggest you

172
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:27,111
reorganize your team.

173
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,871
Keep those who should stay

174
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,710
and replace those who should go.

175
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,231
Do not let personal issues

176
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,150
affect work performance again.

177
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,390
If you fail the negotiation,

178
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,991
that means
you didn't spend enough time on it.

179
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,631
Don't use the company's rules
as your excuse.

180
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,911
Do you truly intend to get a divorce?

181
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,031
Therefore, from now on,

182
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,391
we can't use a single cent of his.

183
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,031
We have to depend on ourselves now.

184
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:01,630
If so,

185
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,590
how can we maintain
our studio's operation?

186
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:07,311
Let's come up with a solution.

187
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:10,710
I'm so thirsty.

188
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,630
You're back.

189
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:12,870
I need some water.

190
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:15,990
How did it go?

191
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,230
The deal is over.

192
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:23,391
It did proceed smoothly.

193
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,391
However, there's an issue

194
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,391
with the deadline.

195
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,511
They are set to launch
the products in ten days.

196
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,590
Ten days? You want us
to finish 300 of them in ten days?

197
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,151
How is that possible?

198
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,990
That's why I want

199
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,950
to discuss it with you guys.

200
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,311
Ten days is fine.

201
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:37,470
Wait, Xiang Nan.

202
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,630
There are only three of us here.

203
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,630
We can't finish them

204
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:40,551
even if we skip our meals and sleep.

205
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,151
That's right.

206
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,630
What about this?

207
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,671
We have to work harder

208
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,990
and work overtime every day.

209
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:49,311
I'll try to find several coursemates
to help us out.

210
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:52,911
Jiaqiao?

211
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,720
(Daming Smart Home)
(Technology Changes Lives)

212
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:08,031
I don't think

213
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,391
this is a long-term solution.

214
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,110
You should head to the hospital

215
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:13,431
for a thorough checkup

216
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:14,710
to see what's causing it.

217
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,671
I already went for one.

218
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,791
I had a gastrointestinal endoscopy done.

219
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,350
I also had a CT scan done.

220
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,071
It's just superficial gastritis.

221
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,750
I have to tend to it.

222
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,350
Why don't I

223
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,791
arrange a TCM consultation for you?

224
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,350
No need for that. It's not that serious.

225
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,391
So,

226
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:32,671
what should we do about Datong now?

227
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,911
I plan to discuss
a deal with them again.

228
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,551
What if it doesn't work out again?

229
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:42,630
I'll give up on the deal, then.

230
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,391
Boss, I'm sorry.

231
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,750
Sorry for what?

232
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,710
What have you done?

233
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:57,110
You were implicated and reprimanded

234
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:58,551
because of me.

235
00:10:59,031 --> 00:10:59,911
Was I reprimanded?

236
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,630
Who dares to reprimand me?

237
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,470
Sun Ying doesn't have
a family to support.

238
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,110
What does she know?

239
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,151
You should rest well.

240
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,590
Will you be heading home, then?

241
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,350
I won't be heading home
for the time being.

242
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,671
Jiaqiao.

243
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:36,230
I wish to get a divorce.

244
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,750
A divorce?

245
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,511
Is the argument

246
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,590
that serious?

247
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,630
Our mindsets

248
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,110
are too different from each other.

249
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,750
Do you still remember

250
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,230
what you asked me before?

251
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,750
You asked me

252
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,470
whether or not I felt happy
when I was together with him.

253
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,590
Actually, I've been thinking about

254
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,590
that question all the time.

255
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,350
I've been wavering about it
for a while too.

256
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,750
But now, I've come to my senses.

257
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,271
I can accept compromises

258
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,830
for the sake of my marriage.

259
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,391
However,
I still have to retain my bottom line.

260
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:19,391
Xiang Nan,

261
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:22,311
you're truly brave.

262
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,191
I admire that you have the courage

263
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,350
to make such a decision.

264
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,000
(Dad)

265
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,750
Dad.

266
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,470
Come back immediately.

267
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,071
Hello?

268
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:50,950
What's the situation

269
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,071
with your sister?

270
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,791
Why are you keeping quiet?

271
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,391
Dad, just stop asking us.

272
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,710
How can I not ask?

273
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:01,511
This is a huge deal.

274
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:02,671
How could I not ask you guys about it?

275
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,870
You guys know

276
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,911
that your sister

277
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:07,511
loves to keep things to herself.

278
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,071
How could you two

279
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,031
not tell me

280
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:13,350
about this?

281
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:14,311
We didn't tell you

282
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,031
because we didn't want you
to be worried.

283
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:17,590
You think I'm not worried
just because you aren't telling me?

284
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:21,311
That's not it.

285
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:22,590
What's the point
of telling you about it?

286
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,870
It's not like you can
do anything about it.

287
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:25,431
You guys always

288
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,110
had the highest expectations
of Xiang Qian.

289
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,311
She was worried
that you guys might be disappointed.

290
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:29,830
That's why she kept it to herself.

291
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,031
Do you still remember

292
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,830
the time Gao Ping came for dinner
after his thesis defense?

293
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,870
Back then,

294
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,710
she was going through
a divorce with Gao Ping.

295
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,511
Gao Ping gave her
the silent treatment every day.

296
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,350
But you were looking at Gao Ping

297
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:40,710
with eyes full of expectations

298
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,911
and admiration.

299
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,911
How could Xiang Qian tell you about it?

300
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:46,271
But

301
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:47,191
Dad, don't worry.

302
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,950
Xiang Qian has the ability

303
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,031
to handle this issue.

304
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:51,950
She's heartbroken about it too.

305
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,191
Don't ask her about it.

306
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:54,511
You guys should've

307
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,110
told me about it earlier.

308
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:57,990
At least I can help her out,

309
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,671
can't I?

310
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,950
How can you help her out?

311
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,511
How can I help her out?

312
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:04,750
My goodness.

313
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,110
Dad, where are you going?

314
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:07,350
I'm looking for Gao Ping.

315
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,671
He's in the detainment center now.

316
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,990
That's right.
You won't be able to see him.

317
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,151
I just wish to ask him this.

318
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,031
I want to ask him whether or not
he still has a conscience.

319
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,791
Xiang Qian had devoted herself

320
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,431
to him,

321
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,110
the children,

322
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,271
and the family.

323
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:21,990
How could he let her down like this?

324
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,470
How could he bully her

325
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,350
like this?

326
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:27,630
- Dad?
- Dad!

327
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:30,911
Why is he going?

328
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,950
Forget it. He...

329
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,551
Just let him calm down for a while.

330
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:35,470
I suppose

331
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,470
he can't accept the fact yet.

332
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:06,950
Where are the children?

333
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:09,391
Xiang Zhong and Xiang Nan
are looking after them.

334
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,431
Gao Ping is a heartless scum.

335
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,311
Where are you going?

336
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,311
I'm going to look for Xiang Qian.

337
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:29,350
Why are you looking for her?

338
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,031
She didn't tell us about it

339
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:31,470
because she was afraid
that we might worry about her.

340
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,830
She's facing her toughest moments
as we speak.

341
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,031
How could we just ignore her?

342
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,031
Who said we were going to ignore her?

343
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,590
Let's just care for her in secret.

344
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,551
Let's do it in secret.

345
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,830
That'll work.

346
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:41,470
Let's hurry and head back.

347
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:49,071
Xiang Qian's calling us.

348
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:51,191
Answer it, then.

349
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:51,671
I...

350
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:52,911
You want me to answer it?

351
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,671
What should I say after that?

352
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,830
Just look at it.

353
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,870
You answered the call.

354
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,470
I'm not answering it. You can go ahead.

355
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,391
Why did you answer it, then?

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,391
Why should I answer it
when you pressed the button?

357
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,911
I should answer it, then?

358
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:12,830
Hello?

359
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,230
Mom, where's Dad?

360
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,630
Your father went out for a walk.

361
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,950
He didn't take his phone with him.

362
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,350
I was wondering

363
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,870
why he didn't answer my calls.

364
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:25,830
Mom,

365
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,750
please help Cong and Qi

366
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,870
to pack their belongings.

367
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,431
I'll pick them up now.

368
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:31,391
I'll reach home soon.

369
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,870
Drive safely, okay?

370
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,671
Okay. Goodbye.

371
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,950
What should we do now?

372
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,311
What should we do when she's here?

373
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,350
Shaking your head
is the only thing you know.

374
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:50,870
Listen.

375
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,791
When Xiang Qian's home,

376
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,830
you shouldn't talk.

377
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,551
You will give us away.

378
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:55,830
Our home is over here.

379
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,671
Where are you going?

380
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:57,391
I know that.

381
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,990
But now, I can't see Xiang Qian.

382
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,710
I'm worried
that I cannot hold myself back.

383
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,071
My goodness.

384
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,071
Where are you going, then?

385
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,990
Must I tell you where I'm going as well?

386
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:09,551
Do you have to follow me
everywhere I go?

387
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,231
You're truly a little tag-along.

388
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:12,511
The child will be here soon.

389
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:13,751
Go and receive her.

390
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:15,951
That's what I'm trying to say.

391
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,630
She's almost home.

392
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,150
Where are you going?

393
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,031
I'm going out for a walk!

394
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,951
He must be a dog. He's inhumane.

395
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,430
That's a dog.

396
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:27,271
Mom.

397
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,390
Well,

398
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,870
Xiang Qian will be home soon.

399
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,870
Don't tell her

400
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,150
that your father and I
had already found out.

401
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:35,390
We won't.

402
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,511
I'm here.

403
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:38,190
You're back.

404
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,071
Mom!

405
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,471
Time to go home.

406
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:41,830
Mom,

407
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,430
I missed you.

408
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,231
Are you guys done packing?

409
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,150
I'll go and pack them.

410
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:47,311
Go and pack your things.

411
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,991
Let's go.

412
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:51,830
Where's Dad?

413
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,991
- He...
- He went out to buy groceries.

414
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,390
I thought he went out for a walk.

415
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:00,791
Do you guys actually have any idea?

416
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,231
Did you guys see him just now?

417
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:04,190
You can ask Mom about it.

418
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,430
Mom, come here.

419
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,271
Where's Dad?

420
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,110
Dad?

421
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:11,910
I think he went out for a walk.

422
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:13,751
Yeah. I thought so.

423
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,150
Bring your luggage here.

424
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:16,031
Are you guys done packing?

425
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:16,910
Time to go.

426
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:17,551
Time to go.

427
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,311
Yeah. We need to hurry.

428
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,311
If not, we'll be stuck in the jam.

429
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,150
That's right.

430
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:21,271
I have to go too.

431
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,350
I need to return to my studio.

432
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:23,511
Let's go.

433
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,751
You're leaving too?

434
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,951
Let's go.

435
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,031
All of us should go.

436
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,670
Let me take my bag.

437
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,271
Grandma, I'll miss you.

438
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,670
I'll miss you too.

439
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,511
Be careful.

440
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,551
Let's go. Come.

441
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,551
Say goodbye.

442
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,271
Goodbye, Grandma.

443
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:37,190
Goodbye, Grandma.

444
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,150
Goodbye, Aunt Nan.

445
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,231
Goodbye, Aunt Zhong, Aunt Nan.

446
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,630
Come on, get in the car.

447
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:42,751
Cong, you should get in first.

448
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,791

Okay.

Good girl.

I'll be going now.

00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:50,150

455
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:50,670
Zhong,

456
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,870
are you driving too nowadays?

457
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:52,791
Yeah.

458
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:53,951
- I'm doing good.
- Drive safely.

459
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,511
Goodbye. See you, Mom.

00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,231

When she was young,

517
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,830
I remember that I was
on a business trip one time.

518
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,031
She said this,

519
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,951
"Dad,

520
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,271
if I get a perfect score on the test,

521
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,830

522
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,471
I promised her.

523
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,390
But I forgot about it

524
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:15,630
as I was too busy with work.

525
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:19,190
When I came back,

526
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:22,190
I came back empty-handed.

527
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,670
Our child was waiting for me,

528
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:26,031

00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,791
But Xiang Qian,

531
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,311
she didn't say anything at all.

532
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:42,430
She returned to her room
and continued doing her homework.

533
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,590
Xiang Qian

534
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,670
was sensible since young.

535
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:52,711
She managed

536
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,991
all the affairs at home and outside

537
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,991
by herself.

538
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,311
We're lucky

539
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:02,231
to have her in the family.

540
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,711
She has helped us out countless times.

541
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,150
She was the ideal elder sister.

542
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:14,430
No matter how upset she was,

543
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,551
she would never express it on her face.

544
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,150
She was afraid that we might be worried.

545
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,430
All these years,

546
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,311
I think I've already forgotten

547
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:32,271
that she's still a girl.

548
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,390
She needs someone to dote on her.

549
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,350
She needs someone to love her.

550
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,350
She'll get upset too

551
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:47,951
when someone

552
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,031
bullies her.

553
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,590
She needs us to console her.

554
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,670
We did let her down.

555
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:02,951
That day, when she sent her children

556
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,830
back to Kunshan,

557
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,670
I truly wanted to ask her

558
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,190
if she was okay.

559
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,590
After all these years,

560
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,071
that was her first time

561
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,830
sending her children

562
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,951
to us of her own accord.

563
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,590
I know.

564
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,350
It's because she was alone.

565
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,430
Life was too difficult for her.

566
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:41,190
But why haven't I

567
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:44,991
thought of that?

568
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,110
Me too.

569
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,311
It didn't occur to me either.

570
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,751
We've let down our child.

571
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:31,430
Xiang Zhong.

572
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,630
Dad?

573
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,150
Didn't I tell you already?

574
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:34,870
I'll retrieve it myself.

575
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:35,830
You didn't need
to head there personally.

576
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,190
Spare yourself from the trouble.

577
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:38,031
Your mother and I woke up early.

578
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,951
Let me tell you what's inside.

579
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,031
These are wontons.

580
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:40,951
This is century egg porridge.

581
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,791
This is for Cong and Xiang Qian.

582
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:45,350
These are egg pancakes.

583
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,471
There's also

584
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:47,231
your favorite vegetarian bun.

585
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,711
This is for you and Qi.

586
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:50,430
The bottom container
contains vegetables and eggs.

587
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:51,271
Got it?

588
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,951
I told you not to
prepare anything for me.

589
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,910
Since I'm already preparing it for them,

590
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,150
how could I omit you?

591
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:56,150
Qian isn't silly, you know?

592
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,311
You've prepared
all of her favorite dishes here.

593
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:58,150
I'm sure she'll find out.

594
00:25:58,231 --> 00:25:58,991
Listen.

595
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:00,630
Don't tell her that I prepared it.

596
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:01,870
Just tell her
that you bought it outside.

597
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,590
Alright.

598
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,630
I'll definitely accomplish the task.

599
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,071
I'll text you

600
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:06,031
when the task is completed.

601
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:07,551
Alright.

602
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:08,991
Get in. I'll send you home.

603
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:10,231
What are you talking about? Hurry.

604
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,590
Hurry and deliver the breakfast to them.

605
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,031
Alright.

606
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,190
Stay safe on your way home, then.

607
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:14,670
Okay.

608
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:15,670
Drive safely.

609
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:16,271
Alright.

610
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,031
Okay.

611
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:18,390
Strap on your seatbelt.

612
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:49,390
Hello?

613
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,190
Hello, Boss?

614
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,110
Is the nanny there?

615
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:55,951
Nanny?

616
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,311
My nanny

617
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,031
comes at 6:30 A.M.

618
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:00,390
I'll wait for you

619
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,071
downstairs later.

620
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,630
Come down when you're done.

621
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:04,071
This early in the morning?

622
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,711
What's the matter?

623
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,511
You'll know when we meet.

624
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,670
Boss,

625
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:29,190
why did you bring me here

626
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,150
this early in the morning?

627
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,830
Dr. Liu said

628
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,231
you should

629
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,630
go outside and take in fresh air

630
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,751
in the morning.

631
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,071
Did you see the mister over there?

632
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:51,190
He's casting off the old

633
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:52,991
and embracing the new.

634
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:55,430
He's expelling
the stagnant energy in his body.

635
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:56,350
Only then will your

636
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:57,830
body and mind be healthy.

637
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,991
Understood?

638
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,071
Go away!

639
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,870
Cancer!

640
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:01,551
Go away!

641
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,630
Hypertension!

642
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,711
Look at him. That's it.

643
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,910
Go away, cerebral hemorrhage!

644
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,311
Go away,

645
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:07,590
dementia!

646
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:08,910
Just shout it out.

647
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,110
Just get it off your chest
if you want to be happy.

648
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:13,190
Why aren't you doing it, then?

649
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,630
I...

650
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:18,630
I have nothing to be upset about.

651
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:19,830
Go away,

652
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:20,951
cancer!

653
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:21,951
Go away,

654
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:22,828
hypertension!

655
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,110
If so, you should give me

656
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,071
a demonstration.

657
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,311
Go away, cerebral hemorrhage!

658
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:27,791
Go away, dementia!

659
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,031
That's easy.

660
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:33,751
Look closely.

661
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,951
Go away...

662
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,630
Go away...

663
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,870
That kind of sucks.

664
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:53,791
That's not it. I...

665
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:55,751
My voice...

666
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,430
I haven't warmed up my voice yet.

667
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,630
Alright now.

668
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,751
You smiled.

669
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:07,471
You smiled.

670
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,951
That's pretty good.

671
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,670
I guess you've cast off the old

672
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:11,751
and embraced the new.

673
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,110
I need to

674
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,350
ask Dr. Liu about this later.

675
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,190
What the heck is this?

676
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:21,590
I'll head home to wake

677
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,150
Cong and Qi up now.

678
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,390
You're leaving already?

679
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,670
Cong, open your eyes.

680
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,271
Brush your teeth. Hurry up.

681
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,071
Morning.

682
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,430
You're here this early?
Did you sleepwalk here?

683
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:54,471
I'm here to deliver breakfast
to you guys.

684
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,271
I woke up

685
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,231
too early today.

686
00:29:58,311 --> 00:29:59,830
That's why I made breakfast
for you guys.

687
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:01,390
Are Qi and Cong awake?

688
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:03,430
Are you serious?

689
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,551
Aren't I amazing?

690
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:09,991
Morning, Cong, Qi.

691
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:11,071
Here.

692
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,031
Come and have breakfast.

693
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,031
Have them while they're hot.

694
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:15,751
Qi, Cong, sit down.

695
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:18,870
Look at all the delicious food.

696
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:20,190
Which one do you want to try?

697
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,150
Try this.

698
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:23,870
Do you want the buns or pancakes?

699
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,271
Pancakes.

700
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:25,870
Okay.

701
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:26,471
Here.

702
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,511
Have some eggs too.

703
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,231
This is an egg pancake.

704
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:33,150
Have some century egg porridge.

705
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,870
Did you make these?

706
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:50,630
That's right.

707
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,350
Be careful. It's hot.

708
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:58,031
Take your time.

709
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:01,630
You made so many dishes.

710
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:04,031
I suppose you had to wake up
at three or four in the morning, huh?

711
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:09,311
It's only because I woke up early today.

712
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,231
You guys won't have the chance

713
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:11,711
to enjoy them usually, you know?

714
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:20,271
Ms. Zhong, you should stop your task.

715
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:20,910
Come and join us.

716
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,350
You guys can continue.

717
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,430
I'll clean the kitchen first.

718
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:25,791
Have some vegetables, okay?

719
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,511
Okay.

720
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:34,830
(Xiang Zhong:
Breakfast has been delivered.)

721
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,711
(Qian and the children
enjoyed themselves.)

722
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,271
Xiang!

723
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,670
Xiang Zhong texted me on WeChat.

724
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,830
She said they received the breakfast

725
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,751
and that the children enjoyed it.

726
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:48,071
Look.

727
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:51,350
I'm going to buy some eels.

728
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,991
She loves eel noodles.

729
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:55,711
Look at you.

730
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,110
Xiang Zhong is terrified of eels.

731
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,910
You want to pretend that Xiang Zhong
made the noodles?

732
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,471
Even Xiang Qian wouldn't fall for that.

733
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:02,670
Fine, then.

734
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:05,311
I'll buy some shrimp.

735
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:07,471
I'll make some
fresh shrimp noodles for them.

736
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:09,110
They can enjoy themselves.

737
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,190
That'll do.

738
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:11,590
Let's go.

739
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:12,830
I didn't lock the gate.

740
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,190
You should head back, then.

741
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,190
I won't be joining you, then.

742
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,150
I'll head out myself, then.

743
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,670
Go ahead.

744
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,200
(Alarm Clock)

745
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,471
Ms. Zhong,

746
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:33,791
have you picked up the children?

747
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:35,311
(Ms. Zhong: The children?)

748
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,711
(Their Aunt Nan
will be picking them up.)

749
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,471
(Xiang Qian:
What are you doing in Shanghai?

750
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:50,350
(Xiang Nan: We're making preparations)

751
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,071
(for an exhibition in Shanghai.)

752
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,751
(Our only agenda today)

753
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:53,670
(was to check out the venue.)

754
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:08,471
(Xiang Nan: I've already picked up
Cong and Qi.)

755
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,390
(Don't worry.)

756
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,510
(Helping Group for Xiang Qian)
(Mum Lanzhi: Great!)

757
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,071
This is your ID card.

758
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:25,951
Your phone.

759
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:30,910
There's also

760
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:32,630
the divorce decree, which was sent

761
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,071
by the court.

762
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:35,511
Take a look.

763
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,910
(From Court)
Sign here

764
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:38,670
if there's no issue.

765
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,880
(Detention)

766
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:58,640
(Pudong District Police Station, Shanghai)

767
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:38,871
Did you wait for a long time?

768
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,471
Ping.

769
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:42,270
You're finally released.

770
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,031
How did I end up asleep?

771
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:47,511
It's fine.

772
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,471
Ping.

773
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:58,110
It's all in the past now.

774
00:34:58,871 --> 00:34:59,590
It's all in the past now.

775
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,951
Let's return to Guizhou.

776
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:11,590
Let's return to Guizhou.

777
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,351
Let's go.

778
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,471
Xiang Zhong?

779
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,630
What are you doing here?

780
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,351
I came here to collect my food delivery.

781
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,871
What did you make for me today?

782
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:02,071
Shrimp spring rolls,

783
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,071
crystal dumplings,

784
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,951
and vegetarian porridge.

785
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,551
Since when were you

786
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:08,991
this good at cooking?

787
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,511
I've always been good at cooking.

788
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,630
You don't know me at all.

789
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,031
Do you think

790
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:17,071
I have no idea what
Dad's cooking tastes like

791
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,110
after having it

792
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,790
for over 30 years?

793
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,991
In the morning, they instruct you

794
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:28,110
to deliver meals to me from Kunshan.

795
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,150
In the afternoon,
they arrange for Xiang Nan

796
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,911
to travel here from Suzhou
just to pick up the children.

797
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:33,951
Only Mr. Xiang Zhijun

798
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:35,190
is capable of

799
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,230
making such an arrangement.

800
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:37,951
I told him

801
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:39,230
that we wouldn't be able to dupe you.

802
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,750
But that old man was stubborn.

803
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:42,031
He insisted on making me
deliver the meals to you.

804
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:44,630
They wish to visit you,

805
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,351
but they're afraid
that it might stress you out.

806
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:53,230
Did Dad and Mom tell you guys anything?

807
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,230
Although they didn't,

808
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,551
they felt like

809
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,911
they'd let you down.

810
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,991
They felt like
they couldn't help you out

811
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:02,190
when you were at your lowest points.

812
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,351
Alright. Hand them to me.

813
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,790
I haven't had breakfast yet, you know?

814
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,871
You do have a point.

815
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,150
Once you're done,

816
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,670
wash the lunch boxes
and deliver them back.

817
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,790
Fine.

818
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,310
I'm a professional
delivery rider anyway.

819
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:17,071
(Cheng Yuanyuan: Xiang Qian,)

820
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,991
(have you read)

821
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,911
(the group announcement?)

822
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,911
(They criticized our team
for slacking off.)

823
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,110
(And, we didn't hit our KPI.)

824
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:29,630
(They will send someone here
to reorganize the company.)

825
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:30,511
(We're in danger.)

826
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:42,871
(Xiang Qian: Who will be here
to reorganize our company?)

827
00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:43,750
(Is it Sun Ying?)

828
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:45,951
(Chai Jin: Who else can it be?)

829
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:47,710
(I assume she'll arrive by tomorrow.)

830
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:50,911
(Xiang Qian: That fast?)

831
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:53,031
(Chai Jin: Hasn't she)

832
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,351
(always been this decisive
and efficient?)

833
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,511
(She's just here)

834
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,031
(to show off her authority.)

835
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,630
(Let's take it one step at a time.)

836
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,200
(Daming Smart Home Pvt. Ltd. Announcement
Regarding The Issues of Huadong Branch)

837
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,351
(Aunty: Xiang Qian,)

838
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:20,630
(I'll be going on a trip.)

839
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,431
(Take care of the unit for me
when you're free.)

840
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:24,870
(Video Call)

841
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,991
Aunty,

842
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:34,551
where are you right now?

843
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:36,911
I'm in the car.

844
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:38,991
My friends and I

845
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,391
will be going on a trip.

846
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,031
Where are you going?

847
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,190
We're traveling the world.

848
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:49,670
We'll travel to anywhere we like.

849
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,391
This trip will last

850
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,790
until we want it to be over.

851
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,431
Don't you think
that's too random of you?

852
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,511
What do you mean?

853
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:57,511
Are you going to be a wanderer?

854
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,270
You see, the main point

855
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,750
is the partner
you're taking with you for the trip.

856
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:04,471
If everything goes well,

857
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,150
we can head somewhere far away.

858
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,871
If it doesn't work out,

859
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:08,871
I'll head back immediately.

860
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,431
What does that mean? What's going on?

861
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,391
You see,

862
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,110
it does feel great to have
a companion when you're old.

863
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,190
Your mother is a blissful woman.

864
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:22,991
Hey.

865
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:26,150
Qian, this is my niece, Xiang Qian.

866
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,351
Say hello to her.

867
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:29,071
Hello.

868
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,431
Hello.

869
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:32,031
Hello.

870
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:33,991
Aunty,

871
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:35,710
don't you think
you've changed your mind too quickly?

872
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:37,190
That's not it.

873
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,270
I've finally come to my senses.

874
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:39,391
Now,

875
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,391
I've decided

876
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:41,471
to get myself a companion.

877
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,790
Xiang Qian,

878
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,991
you should

879
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,630
remember what I told you before.

880
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,871
When we do things,

881
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:52,230
we must do it for our sake.

882
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:53,110
Understood?

883
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:55,590
We need to consider ourselves

884
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:57,590
and treat ourselves well.

885
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,071
Understood?

886
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,551
Understood.

887
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,431
Remember to text me

888
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,750
and send me pictures

889
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,031
no matter where you go, okay?

890
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:06,230
Don't worry.

891
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:09,110
Come. Say goodbye to her.

892
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,351
He's driving.

893
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:11,790
Goodbye.

894
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:13,991
I'll hang up now.

895
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,590
Stay safe, okay?

896
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:26,871
Your second aunt

897
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:28,310
is truly

898
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,150
carefree

899
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,630
and honest in expressing her feelings.

900
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,951
She's the role model of our generation.

901
00:41:36,071 --> 00:41:37,150
We have to learn from her.

902
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:40,351
After the video call,

903
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,351
I thought to myself

904
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:43,630
that

905
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:46,951
it's time for me to make a change.

906
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:49,790
I've worked in this company for 12 years

907
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,831
after my graduation.

908
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,150
In these 12 years,

909
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:55,670
I've gone from having no clients

910
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:57,071
to now having

911
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,270
all these stable clients.

912
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,551
I discuss deals, contracts,

913
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,150
and proposals with my clients every day.

914
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:03,790
As for myself,

915
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,790
I got married, got divorced,

916
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:06,871
and had two children.

917
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:08,590
After that, I got remarried.

918
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:09,871
I got another divorce after that.

919
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:12,590
I was just like a machine

920
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,750
that had never stopped operating.

921
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,590
I never stopped.

922
00:42:18,391 --> 00:42:19,511
It's time for me to take a break.

923
00:42:26,471 --> 00:42:27,831
Firstly,

924
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:29,551
our company

925
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:31,710
is getting more and more conservative.

926
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:34,471
For the past few years,
I've been constantly negotiating

927
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,150
with the headquarters

928
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:38,871
about the ridiculous regulation
on product formulation.

929
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,991
It consumed a lot of my time and energy.

930
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,790
Secondly,

931
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,391
after the incident with Gao Ping,

932
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,391
I think I should take a break,

933
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:53,831
keep my parents company,

934
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:55,750
and soothe

935
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,071
my children's emotions.

936
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,991
So, are you planning
to take a long leave?

937
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,951
Or are you planning to resign?

938
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:25,690
