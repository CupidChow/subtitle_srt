00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 5=

4
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,996
Good morning, boss.

5
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:50,036
You've met Jiang Hongbin.

6
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:53,396
How was it?

7
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,196
Why do you care?

8
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:59,476
I'm just curious.

9
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,356
How should I put it? Nothing unusual.

10
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,196
He even thought of asking us

11
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,556
what we like to eat

12
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:10,715
and remember my Dad's favorite drink.

13
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,836
I'd say he's attentive.

14
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,075
It's good that he's attentive.

15
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,596
Not really.

16
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,415
I still feel insecure.

17
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,094
We were supposed to dine
at my house that day.

18
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:27,075
But he changed his mind
because it was already too late.

19
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:30,515
We finally ended up dining
at a restaurant instead.

20
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:34,395
Have a look.

21
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:36,795
What is it?

22
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:41,075
This woman's name is Ming Wei.

23
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,895
She's been by his side for many years.

24
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:46,756
Last Saturday, someone even saw them
having supper together.

25
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:49,636
I feel like,

26
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:53,196
no matter how many stories
he tries to cook up,

27
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,055
the fact that Xiang Nan

28
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:56,636
is willing to marry him

29
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:59,316
is undeniably a great achievement.

30
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:02,476
Whose achievement?

31
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,415
Do we have to thank the heavens

32
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,156
for letting him marry Xiang Nan?

33
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,036
That depends on what you expect.

34
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:11,476
I have to go.

35
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:13,795
Thank you.

36
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:24,995
Xiang Nan.

37
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:25,895
Where are you?

38
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:26,916
What are you doing?

39
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:28,335
I'm in Shanghai now.

40
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:29,275
Is there anything?

41
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:30,995
You're in Shanghai?

42
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:32,395
What are you doing there?

43
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,395
Hi, Sis.

44
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,494
Why would you suddenly arrange

45
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,356
for a premarital medical test?

46
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,115
Jiang did.

47
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:50,855
He told me

48
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,455
he's arranged for a
premarital medical test

49
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:53,615
and wants me to get checked

50
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,955
thoroughly.

51
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,455
Take a look at the never-ending list

52
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:59,316
of items to be checked.

53
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,374
Besides,

54
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,675
the ones back here

55
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:05,196
are genetically-related tests.

56
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,036
Have you arranged for one?

57
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,356
No.

58
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,675
Let me ask them

59
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:12,415
how long does it take
to complete these tests.

60
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,955
Don't worry about it first.

61
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,876
We have just

62
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,596
met Jiang Hongbin once

63
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,476
over a meal.

64
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:24,156
Xiang Nan, don't you think
that this relationship is too rushed?

65
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:25,934
It's only been 6 months.

66
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,995
Even if you've been together
for one, two,

67
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:29,975
or even five years,

68
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,276
it won't be enough
to fully understand a person.

69
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:35,036
Sis.

70
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:37,315
Although it's only been 6 months,

71
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,036
I am confident that I know him well.

72
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,875
He tells me everything.

73
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,555
All I have to do is believe in him.

74
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,596
Isn't that enough?

75
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:53,615
Do you have something else

76
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:54,836
you want to tell me?

77
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:57,374
No.

78
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,454
If that's the case,

79
00:04:58,455 --> 00:04:59,795
why the grim face?

80
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:02,875
Xiang Nan.

81
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:05,916
Jiang.

82
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:06,995
Sis.

83
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:08,435
What brings you here?

84
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:09,975
I happen to call Xiang Nan just now

85
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,254
and she told me she's in Shanghai.

86
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,235
So I came.

87
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,334
Jiang.

88
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:15,356
I've read through the handbook.

89
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:16,775
Why are there so many tests?

90
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:17,415
Even my genes

91
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,615
have to be tested.

92
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:19,494
Don't you think

93
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:21,276
it's too comprehensive and exhaustive?

94
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:22,975
Look at me,

95
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,175
I have two handbooks.

96
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:25,995
I have a lot more tests than you.

97
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:28,235
Drop the act, Jiang.

98
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,055
Something's not right here.

99
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,235
I just had a sudden realization.

100
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,095
Do you suspect

101
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:34,254
anything wrong

102
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:35,795
with my family's genes?

103
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:37,716
What are you talking about?

104
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,334
All I wanted was for us

105
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:40,716
to have a healthy baby

106
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:42,574
after we get married.

107
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,855
What's wrong with that?

108
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:44,855
I don't want to

109
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:46,014
have a baby so soon.

110
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:47,235
Xiang Nan.

111
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,454
I surely will have
more health problems than you.

112
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:52,716
Don't give me the cold shoulder
after my report is out.

113
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,494
I can't guarantee that.

114
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,995
It depends
on the specific problems you have.

115
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,276
How realistic you are.

116
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:00,735
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang.

117
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,014
We're ready to serve you.

118
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:02,694
Please follow me.

119
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,555
- Okay.
- Okay.

120
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:04,334
Let's go.

121
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:06,254
Xiang Nan. You go in first.

122
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:07,476
Take your things.

123
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:10,156
Let me speak to Mr. Jiang for a while.

124
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,694
All right. I go in first.

125
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:12,295
Okay.

126
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:12,574
Go on.

127
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:13,675
Bye, Sis.

128
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:16,295
Mr. Jiang.

129
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,276
Hold on.

130
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,076
Just call me Hongbin.

131
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,435
Sure.

132
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,315
Hongbin.

133
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,295
Sis...

134
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:31,396
do you

135
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:33,356
have something to say to me?

136
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:35,916
I'll...

137
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,574
just cut to the chase.

138
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:38,516
Go ahead.

139
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:43,036
Is it true that you have a girlfriend

140
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,596
who's been with you for many years

141
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:50,476
before you met Xiang Nan?

142
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:54,795
Are you referring to Ming Wei?

143
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:57,276
Right, I think that's her name.

144
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:00,675
I'll be honest with you.

145
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,095
Ming Wei is indeed my ex-girlfriend.

146
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:05,635
Of course, she's also my business partner.

147
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,875
Are you guys still working together?

148
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,156
Sometimes.

149
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,995
Is Xiang Nan aware of it?

150
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:14,635
Yes.

151
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,795
Does she mind?

152
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:24,795
Are you worried

153
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,755
that we might reach out
to each other constantly?

154
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,596
Yes.

155
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:31,956
Put it this way.

156
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,276
Since I've decided

157
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,716
to marry Xiang Nan,

158
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,055
I'll make sure to

159
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,115
sort out my past accordingly

160
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:40,956
and be fully accountable to Xiang Nan.

161
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,755
Don't you worry.

162
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,555
Yes, right.

163
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:48,655
You'll sort it out. Okay.

164
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,215
I feel less worried now.

165
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:52,076
Whatever happens between you two,

166
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,574
just explain it to Xiang Nan will do.

167
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:57,014
- Right.
- Xiang Nan is still very young.

168
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:58,435
Since you're older than her,

169
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,076
you should be more understanding.

170
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:01,814
Clear the air before your marriage

171
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,574
to avoid

172
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,014
getting into a conflict later

173
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:05,596
due to some hearsay.

174
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,836
Especially my old man,

175
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,315
he can't bear to hear such news

176
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,396
or he will explode with anger.

177
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:14,315
Thank you for your consideration.

178
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,315
I totally get it.

179
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,356
Don't worry.

180
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,374
Well then, you may go.

181
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,134
- Sure, I'll head in now. Have a sit.
- I will.

182
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:20,535
Bye-bye.

183
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:21,315
Okay.

184
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:46,796
Did you just return home?

185
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:50,155
It's been two weeks.

186
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:51,574
Have you

187
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:52,995
forgotten about me?

188
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:55,055
Let me take a look.

189
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:55,814
Does it hurt?

190
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:56,655
No. It doesn't hurt.

191
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,535
I told you everything
on the phone, I'm okay.

192
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,155
You don't have to come all the way here.

193
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:02,135
No use inspecting my wound,
you're not a doctor.

194
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:03,115
So what did the doctor say?

195
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,235
What did the doctor say?

196
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:05,574
I'll put your things here.

197
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:06,515
I have to go to work.

198
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,515
Xiang Zhong.

199
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:09,875
Can you go later?

200
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,556
I have something to tell you both.

201
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,334
Your great-aunt

202
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:17,574
said she saw you at the hospital.

203
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:19,135
That's how I know you got injured.

204
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:20,155
Have some milk.

205
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:21,535
Look at you,

206
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:22,775
your bones are so brittle.

207
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:23,836
You lack calcium.

208
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,255
Why didn't you tell me

209
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:27,915
when Haiyang got injured?

210
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:29,934
There's no need to.

211
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,094
I'm doing fine.

212
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:32,135
Fine?

213
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,655
What if you were blinded?

214
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,155
What actually happened to you?

215
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,814
Well,

216
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:39,814
I just had too much to drink

217
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:40,854
and got drunk.

218
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,135
And then,

219
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,734
I had an accident.

220
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:44,734
Yeah, go on.

221
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,635
Make up a better story, will you?

222
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:47,535
Old habits die hard.

223
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,076
So how much did you drink?

224
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:52,895
Why didn't you look after him, Xiang Zhong?
You shouldn't let him drink too much.

225
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:53,854
What if he gets into

226
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,574
a more serious accident?

227
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,495
I was the one who drank too much.

228
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,094
Why are you blaming her?
She has nothing to do with it.

229
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,556
You're always like this.

230
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,275
Too protective of her.

231
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,175
One day, if you were really

232
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:06,956
blinded or injured your head,

233
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,436
will she still remain by your side?

234
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:11,076
No.

235
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:16,115
Did you hear that?

236
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:18,235
I want a divorce.

237
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:34,356
Deng Haiyang.

238
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,596
Have you cheated on her?

239
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:37,836
No.

240
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,436
Did he domestically abuse you?

241
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:41,596
That's impossible.

242
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,015
So you cheated on him?

243
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,334
Mom, what are you saying?

244
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,895
Please stop talking nonsense.

245
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,055
We can't live together

246
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,476
peacefully at all.

247
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:49,956
Every day is suffering.

248
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:50,734
Don't you want to know

249
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,115
how he got injured?

250
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,235
I'll tell you now.

251
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,556
We live in separate rooms
since the beginning.

252
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,974
He got very drunk that night

253
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:57,895
and climbed on my bed,

254
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,415
so I kicked him off.

255
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,094
And that's how he got injured.

256
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,295
Why do you have to say that?

257
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,676
Why not?

258
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:05,875
Well...

259
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:08,734
You were the one

260
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,375
who always wanted us

261
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:11,574
to have a child of our own.

262
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:12,295
A child?

263
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,716
What are you talking about?

264
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,275
You're daydreaming.

265
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:16,775
I've warned you before.

266
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,214
She'll never

267
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:18,495
have a child with you

268
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,796
because she had no plans
on building a family with you.

269
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,135
- Where are you going?
- To work.

270
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:24,035
Wait.

271
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:25,476
Xiang Zhong.

272
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,796
Guess what, I can tell.

273
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:30,275
You've planned this for a long time.

274
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:31,375
Now you want a divorce?

275
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:32,716
It's not that easy.

276
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,734
You kicked him off the bed

277
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,854
and almost blinded him.

278
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,535
It is a form of intentional assault.

279
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:41,316
You'll be held criminally liable
for your actions, do you know that?

280
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,995
Fine. Let me ask you this.

281
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:44,734
Is it considered sexual assault

282
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:46,415
if I was forced to live a married life

283
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,676
despite my disapproval?

284
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,596
Do you know
that your daughter wants a divorce?

285
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:21,214
Why?

286
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:21,655
How am I

287
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:22,694
supposed to know why?

288
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:23,814
Go and ask her yourself!

289
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,535
She almost blinded my son

290
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,734
just because

291
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:27,854
he doesn't want

292
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,734
a divorce.

293
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:29,694
What does she want?

294
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,015
Why is she so cruel?

295
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:31,655
No way.

296
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:32,775
It's true.

297
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:33,814
One of his eye is bandaged.

298
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,395
No, no, no, Bai.

299
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:36,775
Don't get angry just yet.

300
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,775
I'll look for Xiang Zhong
and ask her face to face, okay?

301
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:39,895
No need.

302
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:40,974
I called her team leader.

303
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:41,956
She'll be back soon.

304
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:43,895
What...

305
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,076
She still has work.

306
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,055
What time is it now?

307
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,556
Hold on, Bai.

308
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:50,055
I totally understand

309
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:50,854
how you feel.

310
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:51,694
But can we

311
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:52,535
at least try

312
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:54,035
not to disturb their work?

313
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:55,094
Don't you have any idea

314
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:56,334
how she got her job?

315
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:57,316
Listen.

316
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,614
I'm not trying to scare you.

317
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:00,655
With her attitude,

318
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,214
she'll lose her job sooner or later.

319
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,255
Don't... you...

320
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:06,094
If you dare, call my team leader
and fire me then.

321
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:07,974
Right, you're just in time.

322
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:09,535
Let's all put our cards on the table.

323
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,155
Xiang Zhijun, ask her.

324
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:12,356
Deng Haiyang

325
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,175
has neither cheated nor abused her.

326
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,895
So why does she want a divorce?

327
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:16,214
Right.

328
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:17,655
Since Deng Haiyang is so outstanding,

329
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,316
then why should I marry him?

330
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:20,454
Exactly.

331
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,436
Why did you want to marry him?

332
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:25,255
You never wanted to give birth
or fulfill a wife's conjugal obligations.

333
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,214
So, why bother getting married?

334
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:27,614
Yep.

335
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:28,454
I understand it now.

336
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:31,214
You married Deng Haiyang's dad
just to have his children.

337
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:31,614
Right?

338
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:32,775
Xiang Zhong, please keep quiet.

339
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,076
How could you say that?

340
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:36,255
Xiang...

341
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,655
Xiang Zhijun.

342
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:39,235
Look at your daughter's behavior.

343
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,175
She's always

344
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:41,495
waiting to talk back at you.

345
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,574
Is this how you talk to elders?

346
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:43,934
No.

347
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:46,115
Let's talk about you
being a mother-in-law.

348
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,175
I've been married to Deng Haiyang
for five years,

349
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:49,694
but you still come to our house

350
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,614
at your own convenience

351
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:51,854
without even greeting me.

352
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:54,415
Also, we have to ask
for your permission before we go shopping.

353
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,635
Why is that?

354
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,574
We also need your permission
to go travel.

355
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:58,094
Guess what,

356
00:13:58,095 --> 00:13:59,895
just let Deng Haiyang stay single.

357
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,175
Xiang Zhong, be quiet.

358
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,015
If you performed well

359
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:02,814
as my daughter-in-law,

360
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,375
do I have to be so paranoid?

361
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,415
You don't feel bad for my son, but I do.

362
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,135
Yes. No one is worthy to marry your son.

363
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:08,734
Okay?

364
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:09,775
Shut up!

365
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:10,875
Stop talking!

366
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:15,476
Bai.

367
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:16,974
I can't breathe.

368
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:18,094
Mom, don't bother. She's acting.

369
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,175
Quick, Lanzhi!

370
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:20,796
Go and get some cardio reliever pills.

371
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:21,775
Bai.

372
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,476
Who is this act for?

373
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:24,755
That's enough!

374
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,094
Don't be angry.

375
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,775
Calm down, Bai.

376
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:28,415
I know now.

377
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,734
I totally understand you.

378
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,094
Don't you want your children
to respect you?

379
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,734
But as parents, shouldn't we
respect our children first?

380
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:35,495
Am I right?

381
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,755
Calm down, would you?

382
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,515
Don't get angry.

383
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,115
It's so infuriating.

384
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:41,814
Wait.

385
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,854
How come your family
has such low qualities?

386
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,295
Is this how you educate your children?

387
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:46,495
All right.

388
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:47,694
- It's our fault.
- I'm so angry.

389
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:48,476
Lanzhi.

390
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,974
Hurry up, hurry up.

391
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,415
Lanzhi, leave it.

392
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,655
I'm not taking any medicine.

393
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,214
Just let me die out of anger.

394
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:54,934
It's not worth dying

395
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,094
over such a small matter.

396
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:56,775
She's right.

397
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,454
I have some patchouli vital qi pills

398
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:00,175
and vitality nourishing pills.

399
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:01,275
Enough!

400
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:03,796
This is not a TCM shop.

401
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:05,734
Listen up, Xiang Zhijun.

402
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:07,055
I've made everything

403
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,334
clear to you at this point.

404
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:09,214
It's up to you

405
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:09,934
now

406
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,214
to solve this problem on your own.

407
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,436
If she wants a divorce,
I'll give my full support.

408
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:15,436
After all, someone is

409
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:17,334
going to regret it one day.

410
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,240
No, no, Bai.

411
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,934
Xiang Zhong, send
your mother-in-law off.

412
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:20,734
But your heart...

413
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:23,115
I'm fine.
My heart stopped beating long ago.

414
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:36,076
Go talk to her.

415
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:38,515
I don't know what to talk about.

416
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,035
Ask her why she wanted a divorce.

417
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,295
I'm afraid I'll mess things up.

418
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,275
That's impossible.

419
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,275
Be straightforward.

420
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:46,635
Don't mince words.

421
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:47,734
Okay?

422
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,295
Just go to her yourself.

423
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,015
Why me?

424
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,295
Don't get me involved in this.

425
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:52,135
You're her mother.

426
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:52,854
It's your job.

427
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:54,135
You're also her father.

428
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,235
Hurry up.

429
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,255
Can't I count on you

430
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,214
at this critical moment?

431
00:15:58,215 --> 00:15:59,716
Do you think she'll listen to me?

432
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:03,035
- She won't listen to me either.
- Just go already!

433
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,515
You...

434
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:06,596
Xiang Zhong.

435
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,515
Your dad wants to talk to you.

436
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:10,035
No way.

437
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:19,214
Xiang Zhong.

438
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:21,635
Why do you want a divorce
all of a sudden?

439
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:22,775
It's not sudden.

440
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:23,875
I've wanted it long ago.

441
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,796
But why?

442
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:29,956
Deng Haiyang is sloppy and lacks ambition.

443
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:32,775
Besides playing computer games all day,

444
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:34,275
he's also glued to his phone.

445
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,175
We don't even communicate at all.

446
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:37,755
Even if we do, he won't listen.

447
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:39,015
He also stinks,

448
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:40,360
like that piece of table cloth.

449
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,915
I don't want to live with a table cloth.

450
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,175
There are only a handful of men

451
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:48,716
who practices good hygiene
like your dad.

452
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:50,436
Whatever. You won't understand.

453
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:52,535
What about his good qualities?

454
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:53,836
What qualities can he have?

455
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:55,775
Either way,

456
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:56,655
I think he is

457
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:58,676
quite filial and kind-hearted.

458
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:02,436
He often buys crabs for your dad too.

459
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:04,035
I am also filial,

460
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:05,556
I also buys things for Dad.

461
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:06,796
No matter what you say,

462
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,316
you are still at fault.

463
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,796
How could you not want a child

464
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,356
after being married for so long?

465
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:13,535
Look at how you treat

466
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,236
your mother-in-law just now.

467
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,374
Didn't you see

468
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,836
how she treated me first?

469
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:18,495
Deng Haiyang

470
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,334
is such a sloppy person.

471
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:20,975
Why should I have his child?

472
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,015
If I gave birth, the child will become
my responsibility.

473
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:25,036
I might die of exhaustion
doing everything by myself.

474
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:27,614
Even if he has
no sense of responsibility,

475
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,036
you guys are still a married couple.

476
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,596
What does it mean?

477
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:32,255
Shouldn't you

478
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:32,935
care for each other

479
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:34,036
like me and your mother?

480
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,195
Instead,

481
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:36,695
you injured him.

482
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:37,796
Is that appropriate?

483
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:40,115
If I didn't resist,
should I let him assault me?

484
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:41,516
What did you say?

485
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:42,134
I'm off to work.

486
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:43,015
This kid...

487
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,195
Aren't you eating?

488
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:45,316
No.

489
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:48,414
Did you see that?

490
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,356
This kid.

491
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,475
What's it with you?

492
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,356
Can't you wait
until she finishes eating?

493
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,236
I...

494
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,055
I had no idea

495
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:00,155
she would quarrel with me so quickly.

496
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:02,915
But you raised your voice first.

497
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,596
Fine, fine.

498
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,955
Let's just eat.

499
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,915
Are you hungry?

500
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,516
Give Xiang Nan a call.

501
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:29,255
Yiyi.

502
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:30,174
Xu Miao.

503
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,356
What brings you here?

504
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:32,854
Someone is waiting for you at home.

505
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:33,614
Who is it?

506
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,015
She claimed to be Mr. Jiang's friend

507
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:36,756
and even brought lots of gifts.

508
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,614
Here.

509
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:45,574
Help me carry my things up first.

510
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,076
I'll find you later.

511
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,115
Let's go.

512
00:18:58,696 --> 00:18:59,675
Xiang Nan.

513
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:01,775
Jiang.

514
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,255
There's a woman at my office

515
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:05,115
claiming to be your friend.

516
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:06,720
Apologies, Xiang Nan.

517
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,316
I have some last minute
arrangements here.

518
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,556
I've asked Ming Wei
to go talk to you first.

519
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:12,675
Ming Wei?

520
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,195
What's wrong with you?

521
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:17,356
What are we gonna talk about?

522
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,715
Just get in touch with her first.

523
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:22,036
I have business to take care of.

524
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:23,596
I'll find you later.

525
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:26,955
Wait.

526
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:39,955
Hello.

527
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,094
Hi, Xiang Nan.

528
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,356
I'm Ming Wei.

529
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:51,675
I heard about you.

530
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:54,894
The glass bottles you made

531
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,435
are really beautiful.

532
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,395
Thank you.

533
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,455
If you're interested,

534
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,875
I can sell them to you.

535
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,134
Actually,

536
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:05,875
I've always wanted
to come and visit you.

537
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,854
I'm curious to find out

538
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,556
what kind of person it takes

539
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,675
to let Jiang Hongbin feel reassured.

540
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:13,775
Did you come all the way here

541
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,635
just to visit me?

542
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:19,495
Fine.

543
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:21,516
I'll be straightforward with you.

544
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,076
We're adults.

545
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,455
There are plenty of things

546
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,215
that

547
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:27,356
needs to be made clear.

548
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:29,635
Jiang Hongbin and I have known
each other for many years.

549
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:32,076
And we've had plenty of business dealings.

550
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:35,015
At first, we were only good friends.

551
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,374
But then,

552
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,036
a small incident happened between us.

553
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:40,455
As humans,

554
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,535
it's normal to have

555
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:43,115
the urge for emotional comfort.

556
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:45,316
However,

557
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:46,414
they are now

558
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:47,875
a thing of the past.

559
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,435
So?

560
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:52,374
So I don't want my presence

561
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,414
to affect the relationship

562
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:54,756
between the both of you.

563
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:57,996
What makes you think that

564
00:20:58,296 --> 00:20:59,215
your presence

565
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,756
will affect our relationship?

566
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,756
This is Mr. Qian's circle of friends.

567
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:09,996
Mr. Qian is Jiang Hongbin's
biggest client.

568
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:13,635
That night while he was eating,
he's already had a round of drinks.

569
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,715
So he had me drink on his behalf
during the karaoke session.

570
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:19,695
Perhaps I drank too much,

571
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,955
my stomach felt a little uncomfortable.

572
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:24,796
After that, he shared a bowl
of soup with me.

573
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,435
And that's it.

574
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:27,735
If you don't believe me,

575
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,236
feel free to call Mr. Qian.

576
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:30,875
I can give you his contact.

577
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:32,715
No need.

578
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:35,435
I understand it now.

579
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,155
Is there anything else?

580
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,435
Xiang Nan.

581
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,455
Since Jiang Hongbin
has chosen to be with you,

582
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:46,155
you should learn to trust him.

583
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,295
It's better to avoid
conducting background checks

584
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:50,535
on him in the future.

585
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:51,556
It's hurtful.

586
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:53,796
Also,

587
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:57,236
if you wish to keep him by your side,

588
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:01,996
I'd suggest that you learn
how to compromise.

589
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:06,395
There's no need to investigate
every moment of having fun.

590
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,316
Firstly,

591
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:11,915
I trust Jiang very much.

592
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:14,756
I would never
conduct background checks on him.

593
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:16,875
Secondly,

594
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,996
sending you here to explain things to me

595
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:22,675
shows that he is afraid
that I might misunderstand him.

596
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,036
He's the one who wants me to stay.

597
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:27,775
So I think you should give him

598
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:29,155
some suggestions also.

599
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:31,295
In that case,

600
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,475
go talk to him yourself.

601
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:33,955
My task is done here.

602
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:34,915
I should go.

603
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,374
I really don't understand

604
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,715
how can people
still be friends after breaking up.

605
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:48,236
Do you remember my childhood sweetheart?

606
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,854
We have been together for ten years.

607
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:50,495
When we broke up,

608
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,414
I blocked all his contacts

609
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,036
because I don't want to see him again.

610
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:55,814
After that,
I have never once participated

611
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:57,635
in our high school classmates' reunion.

612
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,556
Remain friends after breaking up?

613
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,495
There are only two possibilities.

614
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:03,654
They can remain friends

615
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,356
because they don't have strong feelings.

616
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:07,255
Another situation would be,

617
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:08,955
they have a high EQ.

618
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:09,814
Ex-lovers

619
00:23:09,815 --> 00:23:11,236
could also be a form of resource.

620
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,596
Am I right?

621
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,596
Mr. Wang, what brings you here?

622
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:18,635
Miss Xiang.

623
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,635
Mr. Jiang asked me to pick you up.

624
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:23,334
Mr. Jiang just told me

625
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,276
that he's coming over.

626
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:27,695
Never mind.

627
00:23:27,696 --> 00:23:29,155
I'll call and ask him.

628
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:33,735
Jiang.

629
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:34,654
What's going on?

630
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:35,614
Mr. Wang is here.

631
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:38,076
He came to pick me up.
Where are we going?

632
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:39,955
Jiaqiao will be back soon.

633
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,556
I sent Mr. Wang to pick you up

634
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,036
so that we can have a meal together.

635
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,414
Jiang, I need some free time

636
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:47,915
to have a talk with you.

637
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:49,854
We can

638
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,236
talk after dinner.

639
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:52,796
Take your time.

640
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:55,556
Sure.

641
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:57,076
Got it, bye.

642
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:00,915
Let me pack up before we go.

643
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:20,195
Mom.

644
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,516
Why did you come back?

645
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,395
Pack your things and follow me home.

646
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:25,334
I'm talking to you.

647
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:26,475
Did you hear me?

648
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:27,654
She's divorcing you.

649
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:28,955
What's the point of staying here?

650
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,715
I won't leave.

651
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:33,195
Do you want to get injured again?

652
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:45,635
My only hope for you

653
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,316
is to live happily ever after.

654
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:50,854
I must never let anyone

655
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:51,735
bully you

656
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:53,155
or make you feel wronged.

657
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:54,915
If she wants a divorce, so be it.

658
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,155
She's not good enough for you anyway.

659
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:02,276
I really don't understand.

660
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,996
What is she so smug about?

661
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:07,756
I mean,

662
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:09,115
she's not that pretty.

663
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,115
She's pleasing to the eye at most.

664
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,036
And she's almost thirty.

665
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,996
She won't stay that way for long.

666
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:16,055
Furthermore,

667
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,614
she doesn't have good education either.

668
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:19,215
You went to first,
second-tier universities.

669
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:20,495
But she only went

670
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:21,596
to a private university.

671
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:22,935
If not for me,

672
00:25:22,936 --> 00:25:24,996
she won't even have a full-time job.

673
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:30,316
Don't be afraid of her leaving you.

674
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,695
There are a lot of younger
and prettier girls

675
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,174
out there with way better education

676
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:35,596
for you to pick and choose.

677
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:37,596
Men like you can definitely

678
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:39,675
attract lots of attention
on the Internet.

679
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,255
You're tall and handsome

680
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:43,735
with a perfect physique,

681
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:46,996
a handsome face and silky white skin.

682
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:50,236
You also have an undergraduate degree

683
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:51,574
and a successful career.

684
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:52,836
You also have

685
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,836
a kind mother who teaches you
to be dutiful.

686
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:56,675
I'm not exaggerating.

687
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,516
Based on these conditions alone,

688
00:25:59,575 --> 00:26:02,395
you could easily be the benchmark
for the marriage market.

689
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:06,076
Sure.

690
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:07,715
But I still won't leave her.

691
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:10,695
She doesn't want
to have children with you.

692
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,955
Why do you want to keep her?

693
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:14,543
Stop wasting time.

694
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:17,996
Listen, you must continue
the family's bloodline.

695
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,134
My gosh.

696
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:25,134
Did you hear me?

697
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:26,316
Yes.

698
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:28,316
I won't leave her.

699
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:31,635
Fine.

700
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:32,756
You won't leave.

701
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:34,455
You won't leave her, right?

702
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:35,435
Yes.

703
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,535
You're on your own then.

704
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:55,395
Hello, Miss Xiang.

705
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:57,055
Hello.

706
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:57,775
This way, please.

707
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:58,796
Thank you.

708
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:00,356
This way.

709
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:10,475
Right here.

710
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:13,094
Hello, Miss Xiang.

711
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:14,236
Hi.

712
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:17,695
It's okay, I can do it myself.

713
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:18,836
Thank you.

714
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:24,556
I'll leave it here.

715
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:32,635
Hello.

716
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:34,915
You must be Jiaqiao.

717
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:36,215
You look

718
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:37,796
so much better in person.

719
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,356
You're here at last.

720
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:41,935
My brother has never

721
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:43,715
brought other girls home before.

722
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,556
He once said

723
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:47,614
that the girl he decides to bring home

724
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:49,516
will be the one he's going to marry.

725
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:52,036
It seems he really likes you.

726
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:04,915
What's wrong?

727
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,635
Your skin is pretty white.

728
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:11,756
Let me show you around.

729
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:15,015
The overall layout of this house,

730
00:28:15,016 --> 00:28:15,894
style,

731
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:16,975
and all the furniture

732
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:18,414
have been discussed

733
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:19,796
between the designer and I.

734
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:23,475
I personally hate fancy
and flashy designs the most.

735
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:25,276
This table, for example.

736
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:29,356
I had it made to order
from the Milan furniture fair.

737
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:31,836
I was attracted by its simplicity.

738
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:34,276
Less is more.

739
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,775
There's the kitchen.

740
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:39,875
I don't care.

741
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:41,915
Here.

742
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:43,975
How can I forget this?

743
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:45,414
It's my favorite.

744
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:46,556
Look at the lights.

745
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:52,276
They blend in so well with this
7.5-meter-tall ceiling, don't you think so?

746
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:54,975
My favorite designer,

747
00:28:54,976 --> 00:28:56,836
Antonio Citt...

748
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:59,475
Antonio Citt...

749
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:07,115
Antonio Citterichie designed it.

750
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,796
It took him ten months to finish it.

751
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:13,675
Next.

752
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,334
Citterichie.

753
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:18,174
Jiang Jiaqiao, you're absent-minded.

754
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,356
I can't believe I forget his name.

755
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:22,334
We do have an elevator,

756
00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:24,635
but I prefer taking the stairs,

757
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,174
because these lights were also

758
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:29,796
designed by Antonio Citterichie himself.

759
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:35,236
Have you not heard about him?

760
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:42,276
This is my brother's room.

761
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:43,996
I designed it as well.

762
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,715
Next time...

763
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:48,475
There's the bathroom.

764
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,635
This is the bedroom.

765
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,076
And this bed.

766
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,295
The bed and mattress were

767
00:29:54,296 --> 00:29:56,756
custom-ordered by me
at the Milan furniture fair.

768
00:29:57,575 --> 00:29:59,015
When it comes to bed,

769
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,875
I don't mind spending more money
in exchange of comfort.

770
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:08,276
Excuse me, I'm speaking to you.

771
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:13,356
Moving on.

772
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:15,055
My bedroom is just opposite.

773
00:30:15,056 --> 00:30:16,675
Keep your voice down at night.

774
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:20,414
This is the gym.

775
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:21,975
Every equipment here were ordered

776
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:23,556
from the Italian furniture fair.

777
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:24,374
Starry sky ceiling,

778
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,134
hardwood flooring.

779
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:26,915
An elliptical trainer and this...

780
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:32,115
You won't be using it anyway.

781
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:34,475
All right.

782
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:36,115
Next.

783
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:41,635
Come on.

784
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:43,614
This is my brother's study room.

785
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:45,395
This is the reception area.

786
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:47,574
Well,

787
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:50,036
most of the furniture here
were ordered from the furniture fair.

788
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,316
All these?

789
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,374
Yes, yes.

790
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,295
Let me tell you.

791
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:55,996
Finished furniture have fallen
out of fashion.

792
00:30:56,135 --> 00:30:58,836
Custom-made furniture
are now trending upwards.

793
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:00,115
It's amazing.

794
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,134
So awesome.

795
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:02,796
Miss, Mr. Jiang is back.

796
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:03,854
My brother is back.

797
00:31:03,855 --> 00:31:04,915
That's great.

798
00:31:07,175 --> 00:31:09,395
Did Jiaqiao show off some
of her designs to you?

799
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:10,894
Do you like them?

800
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:11,695
Guess what,

801
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:13,015
I have also put in a lot of effort

802
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:14,055
into this outdoor garden.

803
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:16,475
Jiaqiao, please go back inside.

804
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:18,134
I'm not finished yet. Look...

805
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,115
Get inside.

806
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,915
Go on.

807
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:23,276
All right.

808
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,316
Do you like it here?

809
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:34,036
You'll live here

810
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:35,756
after we get married.

811
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,475
I never said I wanted to marry you.

812
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:41,495
Come on.

813
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:43,155
You've met Ming Wei already.

814
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,475
You also know about our relationship.

815
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,955
There's no need for me
to explain anymore

816
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:49,935
Why didn't you

817
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:52,115
come over and explain to me personally?

818
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:54,535
Would you believe me

819
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:55,334
if I explain

820
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:56,675
to you unilaterally?

821
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,174
Besides, it's too trivial

822
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:00,915
to explain repeatedly over

823
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:02,556
such a minor incident.

824
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:07,435
To be honest with you,

825
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,356
there's another reason

826
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,115
why I asked her to meet you.

827
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:15,356
We are actually more than friends,

828
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,715
we are business partners as well.

829
00:32:18,575 --> 00:32:19,875
She is very capable.

830
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:22,036
She's also the one maintaining

831
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,395
most of my social relationships.

832
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:26,556
I may have

833
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:31,036
to interact with her more
in the future due to work.

834
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:35,435
Does that mean I must
accept her presence?

835
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,036
If you really can't accept it,

836
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,715
I have no choice but to block her.

837
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:44,255
All right.

838
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,635
Block her then.

839
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,276
Do you have to go so far?

840
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:51,854
I didn't suggest it.

841
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:54,015
You suggested it yourself.

842
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,715
You must keep your word.

843
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:00,955
Fine.

844
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:03,236
I'll block her now.

845
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:11,076
Okay, okay.

846
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:12,756
I'm not that petty.

847
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,654
If you were to block her,

848
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,556
who's gonna drink on your behalf?

849
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:22,756
Xiang Nan.

850
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:25,955
I really want to build
a family with you.

851
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,574
I hope you'll believe me

852
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,475
in our relationship.

853
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,236
Even if you were to

854
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:33,875
encounter any hearsay in the future,

855
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:35,875
just ignore them.

856
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:41,996
I still hope there won't be any hearsay.

857
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,675
All right. I promise you.

858
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:00,635
Dad.

859
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,414
What brings you here?

860
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:04,094
Haiyang.

861
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,155
You...

862
00:34:05,415 --> 00:34:06,334
I went online

863
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,654
to search for information.

864
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:09,316
Eye injuries needs to be

865
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:11,735
supplemented with high-quality protein.

866
00:34:11,736 --> 00:34:13,495
So I went and bought some milk,

867
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:14,495
fish, and eggs

868
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:15,535
for you.

869
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:16,335
How's your injury?

870
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:17,294
I'm fine. It's not serious.

871
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:17,975
I'm fine, look.

872
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:18,574
Does it hurt?

873
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:21,214
No. I just felt dizzy
when I'm staring at things.

874
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:22,375
Don't go out all the time.

875
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,015
Take a good rest and recuperate.

876
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:24,815
Will do, will do.

877
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:25,875
Here.

878
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:26,614
Let me help you.

879
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:27,495
Allow me.

880
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:28,614
- Slow down.
- I got it. I got it.

881
00:34:28,615 --> 00:34:29,134
Slow down.

882
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:29,855
Okay.

883
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:31,134
All right, come on.

884
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,116
Come on.

885
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,515
Okay.

886
00:34:58,816 --> 00:34:59,694
Dad.

887
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:00,895
We ran out of tea

888
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:02,335
at home.

889
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:04,676
I only have a can of coke.

890
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:08,094
You know I can't drink sweet drinks?

891
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:09,395
There's beer.

892
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:11,915
Are you trying to kill me?

893
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:14,196
Whatever, leave it here.

894
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,395
You leave me no choice.

895
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:25,395
Your mom's looking for us.

896
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:28,716
Haiyang.

897
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:32,796
I want to know what's on your mind.

898
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:39,316
Well, I...

899
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:40,955
Of course I don't want a divorce.

900
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:46,395
You are as close to your parents

901
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,836
the same way you are with your spouse.

902
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:51,035
A married couple

903
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:52,915
will always think of each other.

904
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:54,276
Both of you,

905
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:56,075
instead of communicating,

906
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:58,875
you use brute force.

907
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:00,836
Will it solve your problem?

908
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,595
I was really drunk last night.

909
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,116
I've acted carelessly.

910
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,335
In that case,

911
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:07,716
what do you expect?

912
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:15,515
Xiang Zhong is a stubborn person.

913
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:17,734
Listen to me, Haiyang,

914
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:19,375
if you carry on like this,

915
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:21,356
none of us can help you anymore.

916
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,035
Look.

917
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:30,676
Have you ever thought of changing

918
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:32,356
your living habits?

919
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,276
Haiyang.

920
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:38,716
You're still young.

921
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:41,475
Don't miss out on your career.

922
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:43,836
Xiang Zhong is self-motivated.

923
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:45,734
So why can't you just

924
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,156
be like her?

925
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,316
What brings you here?

926
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:53,475
Well,

927
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:55,254
Haiyang is injured.

928
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,796
So I came to visit him.

929
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,435
Why are you drinking coke?

930
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,276
Don't you know you have three highs?

931
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:04,895
There's nothing else to drink at home.

932
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,214
I requested it myself.

933
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:07,254
He didn't give it to me.

934
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,515
Stop protecting him.

935
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:09,836
Let's go.

936
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,574
What are you doing here?
I'll send you home.

937
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:12,975
Go back? Where?

938
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,196
Home.

939
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:16,294
I want to talk to Haiyang.

940
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:17,455
Go and cook.

941
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:18,955
I'll join you guys for dinner.

942
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:20,055
We don't cook dinner.

943
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:22,134
We have no food to eat.
If you want to eat, go home.

944
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:22,855
Let's go.

945
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:23,796
Xiang Zhong.

946
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:25,935
I have to say this about you.

947
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:27,734
Why are you two always arguing?

948
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:29,595
You'll get hungry at night too, right?

949
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:34,676
It's okay, Dad.

950
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:37,335
I'm used to ordering takeout.

951
00:37:37,336 --> 00:37:38,094
It doesn't matter.

952
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:39,116
Used to?

953
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,676
Why are you ordering takeout?

954
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:43,375
You're injured,
you need nutritional supplements.

955
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:44,316
Get it?

956
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:45,654
Not really.

957
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:47,035
Why not?

958
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:49,875
Fine.

959
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:52,134
Luckily, I brought some
vegetables and fish.

960
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:53,236
I'll cook.

961
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,815
Don't cook.

962
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,955
Then what?

963
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:57,515
Want us to live on air?

964
00:37:57,695 --> 00:37:58,375
Haiyang.

965
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,855
Go inside and rest.

966
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:01,134
No, but my eyes...

967
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:02,134
Listen to me.

968
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:03,836
Your eyes need more rest.

969
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:04,574
Be obedient.

970
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,276
Go lie down on your bed and rest.

971
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:08,654
But my eyes...

972
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,636
How do I rest my eyes while lying down?

973
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:12,196
Can't you just close your eyes?

974
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:13,415
Oh my god.

975
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,515
Hurry up.

976
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:15,395
Okay.

977
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:16,676
How shameless.

978
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,294
Don't follow me.

979
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,535
Quit talking.

980
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:21,196
Go home now.

981
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:22,654
Can you

982
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:24,116
stay out of our affair?

983
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,134
Go home and rest, will you?

984
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:27,535
- Just leave it. What are you doing?
- Leave it.

985
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:28,574
Let go, let go.

986
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:29,214
Go home.

987
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:30,335
Give it to me.

988
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:32,196
Let go.

989
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:35,756
Are you okay?

990
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:37,116
Don't worry about me.

991
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,116
Stop playing.

992
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:42,116
Why are you so disobedient?

993
00:38:51,536 --> 00:38:53,196
Can you please be gentle?

994
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:54,774
I'm not a furniture.

995
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:56,236
Why are you hitting so hard?

996
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,214
Didn't you say I was too soft?

997
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:58,975
You...

998
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:00,555
You're hitting too hard.

999
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:02,075
All right.

1000
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:03,055
Oh, god.

1001
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:05,316
I just realized you are
becoming more pretentious.

1002
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:07,515
My goodness.

1003
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:09,614
You should be more careful.

1004
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,294
Lower, lower.

1005
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:12,895
I have to massage from top to bottom.

1006
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,774
My waist.

1007
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:14,335
I know.

1008
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:15,734
It's the same.

1009
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:16,415
Okay.

1010
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,035
Just do whatever you want.

1011
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:21,276
Don't blame me
for your own carelessness.

1012
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:26,395
I just wanted to cook them a meal.

1013
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:29,055
How can it cause so much trouble?

1014
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:30,276
Gosh.

1015
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:31,855
Why are you meddling in their business?

1016
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:32,535
They're adults,

1017
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,475
let them think for themselves.

1018
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:36,694
Remember when Xiang Qian
was getting divorced

1019
00:39:36,695 --> 00:39:38,174
and you were opposing it?

1020
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,815
No one listened to you either.

1021
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:43,156
After that, Xiang Qian
is still living her best life.

1022
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:49,836
Tell me.

1023
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:53,236
If Xiang Zhong insists on divorcing,

1024
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:56,075
can she still find someone like Haiyang?

1025
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,515
Can she?

1026
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:00,294
Haiyang is a good boy.

1027
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:01,356
Enough, enough.

1028
00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:03,995
Come on, answer me.

1029
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:06,395
Package delivery, Mr. Xiang.

1030
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:07,875
Package delivery?

1031
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:09,875
Did you buy anything?

1032
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:11,236
No.

1033
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:12,915
Me neither.

1034
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:14,475
Coming.

1035
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:19,875
Okay, thank you.

1036
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:23,535
What is it?

1037
00:40:23,536 --> 00:40:24,935
I think Xiang Zhong bought

1038
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,254
some medicine for you.

1039
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:26,995
Here.

1040
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:27,955
Take a look.

1041
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:33,595
Why didn't she bring it to me?

1042
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,294
Why are you so demanding?

1043
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:36,836
You got your medicine.

1044
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:38,774
This kid.

1045
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:40,574
She's so dutiful already.

1046
00:40:40,575 --> 00:40:41,975
She has to work every day

1047
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,796
and also take care of you.

1048
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:45,955
Stop massaging.

1049
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:51,515
Don't stop.

1050
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:53,614
Didn't you ask me to stop massaging?

1051
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:55,475
Since when are you so obedient?

1052
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:58,075
Don't move around.

1053
00:40:58,376 --> 00:40:59,636
Really.

1054
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:01,995
This kid.

1055
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,694
(Daming's Smart Home System)

1056
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:07,515
Thanks.

1057
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:18,035
Hello, Dad.

1058
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:19,475
Xiang Qian.

1059
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:21,836
Listen up.

1060
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:23,815
Xiang Zhong is

1061
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,796
divorcing Haiyang.

1062
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:28,395
Why?

1063
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:29,716
Why?

1064
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:31,796
It has nothing to do
with their principles.

1065
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:32,774
Guess what,

1066
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:34,716
it was all because of Xiang Zhong.

1067
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:37,156
She is now all high and mighty.

1068
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:38,676
Xiang Qian.

1069
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:40,796
If you have time, help us

1070
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,356
advise Xiang Zhong.

1071
00:41:42,615 --> 00:41:44,636
Offer her some criticism.

1072
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:47,636
Sure, I got it.

1073
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,015
Gao Ping.

1074
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,855
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

1075
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:03,614
I got to visit Xiang Zhong.

1076
00:42:03,615 --> 00:42:04,935
Come home early.

1077
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:05,815
The kindergarten

1078
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:07,455
is having a parent-child
sports day tomorrow.

1079
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:08,254
We still got to

1080
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,836
practice kangaroo jumps with the kids.

1081
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:11,995
All right.

1082
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:13,156
Drive safe.

1083
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:15,435
Okay, bye.

1084
00:42:21,215 --> 00:42:22,395
Leaving?

1085
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:25,676
I have good news.

1086
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:27,515
Let's talk about it as we go.

1087
00:42:35,655 --> 00:42:36,756
Mr. Yu and I

1088
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:38,075
just had a meeting.

1089
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,716
Should I congratulate you in advance?

1090
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:47,995
Then what was the meeting about?

1091
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:50,254
HQ's marketing department team lead

1092
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:51,895
has been poached recently.

1093
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:53,716
Someone else has to fill that position.

1094
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:55,774
You are the most qualified candidate

1095
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:57,716
among all the others
from different regions.

1096
00:42:58,976 --> 00:42:59,734
HQ is planning

1097
00:42:59,735 --> 00:43:01,676
to promote talented people
from the front-end.

1098
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:04,075
I recommended you.

1099
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:04,960
