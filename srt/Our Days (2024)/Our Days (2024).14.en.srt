=Our Days=

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 14=

4
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,568
How are you getting along

5
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:50,819
with Gao Ping's aunt?

6
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,860
She just came not long ago.

7
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,500
I guess it's okay.

8
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,620
Your father keeps wanting to visit her.

9
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,249
He thought
that she was Gao Ping's relative.

10
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,420
She was her elder too.

11
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,299
But he's afraid

12
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,889
that Gao Ping might be too prideful.

13
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,460
He's afraid
that he might feel embarrassed.

14
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,580
He wants to ask you

15
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,500
when's a good time to visit you two.

16
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,859
You guys can wait a little longer, then.

17
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,329
She just arrived
at our house not long ago.

18
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,369
Both parties need to
get used to each other's presence.

19
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,300
Hurry.

20
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:23,769
Lend me a hand.

21
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,659
You came from a long way.

22
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,620
You didn't need to buy anything for us.

23
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,568
Jiang bought them.

24
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,819
He told me to deliver them to you all.

25
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,419
Where are

26
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,539
the two little brats?

27
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,168
I told Aunty to trim

28
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,180
Qi's bangs.

29
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,180
Is no one keeping an eye on her?

30
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,740
What if Aunty
does what she likes on a whim?

31
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,209
I told her
that I would ignore her forever

32
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,419
if she did that.

33
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:47,939
I don't think she can be trusted.

34
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,939
What about this?
I'll go and take a look.

35
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,649
You can bring them back.

36
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,408
Dad, I'll be leaving now.

37
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:53,939
Where are you going?
Are you not having dinner?

38
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,659
Where is Xiang Nan going?

39
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,379
She's going to Aunt's hair saloon.

40
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,859
She...

41
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,900
She's going there
to pick up Cong and Qi.

42
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,259
Why is Gao Ping absent again?

43
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,809
Gao Ping has to prepare for

44
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,568
the postdoctoral program.

45
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:25,249
Just let him

46
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,539
do his revisions at home.

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,688
He has to prepare for his exam.

48
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,288
It's fine for him to be absent.

49
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,539
Look at how petty you are.

50
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:41,939
Did I say anything?

51
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,379
Why were you sighing, then?

52
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,809
What? You expect me to smile

53
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,419
when he's absent?

54
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,740
But you don't need to feel dejected.

55
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,220
Leave.

56
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,740
Your father is such a good actor.

57
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,259
I have something to tell Xiang Qian.

58
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,859
Leave.

59
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,300
We have something to discuss.

60
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,688
Is this how you guys

61
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,300
communicate now?

62
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,969
He's so pretentious.

63
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,780
Leave.

64
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,369
You can prepare the vegetables.

65
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,180
You can prepare them in the yard.

66
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:17,728
I can prepare them

67
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:18,619
anywhere I like.

68
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,220
I'll prepare them at the back.

69
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,020
You're something else, aren't you?

70
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,419
Go now.

71
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,940
Mom, I'll lend you a hand later.

72
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,179
No need for that.

73
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,419
Xiang Qian,

74
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,140
have you met

75
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,460
Xiang Zhong for the past few days?

76
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,340
What's wrong?

77
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,220
Did something major crop up again?

78
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,739
Listen.

79
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,859
Gu told me

80
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,048
that Xiang Zhong

81
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:49,020
is having a blurry affair
with someone else.

82
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:50,449
What do you mean

83
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,449
by a blurry affair?

84
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,539
How could you believe
Gu's words blindly?

85
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,689
Gu is telling us

86
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,769
about this

87
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,499
because he's concerned about our family.

88
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm back.

89
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,299
Zhong.

90
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,059
Mom, I bought you some apples.

91
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,179
What's with the frown?

92
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:11,859
You're back.

93
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,260
Why are you staring at me?

94
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,460
What's wrong?

95
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,969
Dad is exhausted. Let's...

96
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,808
Let's help Mom out in the kitchen.

97
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:20,539
No need for that.

98
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,220
You two can have a chat.

99
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,220
I'll help her out.

100
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,728
You saw that, right?

101
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:29,329
I just arrived home.

102
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,380
I didn't provoke him.

103
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,820
What's with the long face?

104
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,209
He said something

105
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,248
about you

106
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:36,449
right before you came back.

107
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,460
What did he say?

108
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:39,299
Dad told me this just now.

109
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,728
He said Gu told him

110
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:43,979
that Xiang Zhong had a blurry affair
with someone else.

111
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:46,979
That's not true.

112
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,769
I don't know anything.

113
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,529
That's the only thing he said

114
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,900
before you came back.

115
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm utterly speechless.

116
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,288
I hate this place

117
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,580
so much.

118
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,129
What's wrong with them?

119
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,168
Do they have nothing else to do

120
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,099
but gossip about other people?

121
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,649
They always jump to conclusions
based on rumors, huh?

122
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,979
Can't they keep their mouth
in check for once?

123
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,209
Wait, you...

124
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,940
What are you saying?

125
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,859
Jump to conclusions based on rumors?

126
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:12,220
Xiang Zhong,

127
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,089
do you think people would
jump to conclusions

128
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,460
if you weren't involved
in any rumors in the first place?

129
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,499
Tell us.

130
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,288
About what?

131
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,140
The person who accompanied you

132
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,728
to the hospital two days ago,

133
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:20,499
who is he?

134
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,419
It was a guy.

135
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:25,940
Tell us.

136
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,168
Why aren't you concerned about

137
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,580
the reason
I went to the hospital instead?

138
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,059
Fine.

139
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,499
I'll pay attention to you now.

140
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:32,539
Tell me, then.

141
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:33,900
Why did you head to the hospital?

142
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,739
Fine. I'll tell you about it.

143
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,689
I was

144
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,769
scratched by my neighbor's cat.

145
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,808
My neighbor accompanied me
to the hospital

146
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:41,969
for a vaccine shot.

147
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,969
Are you happy now?

148
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,659
You were scratched by a cat?

149
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,009
I can never get through to you.

150
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,099
Where are you going?

151
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:48,649
Xiang Zhong!

152
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,419
Xiang Zhong!

153
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,380
Xiang Zhong!

154
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:51,689
- Zhong!
- Look at her.

155
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,099
It's none of my business.

156
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,168
Mom.

157
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,168
How many times have I told you guys?

158
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,048
I'm over 30 years old now.

159
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:56,529
I know my limits.

160
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,329
Dou's mother,

161
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,689
we cannot apologize to you.

162
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,220
Yesterday's dispute
hasn't been resolved yet.

163
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,940
(Gao Ping: She posted the video
in the homeowners' group chat.)

164
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,048
(Now, everyone is talking about it.)

165
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:04,928
Even if I'm not divorced yet,

166
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,340
can't I even have some male friends?

167
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,248
Enough already.

168
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:08,089
Don't say that in public.

169
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,449
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

170
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,449
That's right.
I'm going to say this in public.

171
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,368
All of you, listen up!

172
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,248
Mind your own business!

173
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,969
(Dou's Mom's messages)
Stay out of other people's business!

174
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,380
(This kid has propensity for violence obviously)
You can think whatever you like!

175
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,460
Where are you going?

176
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:17,529
That's none of your business!

177
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,780
Aren't you going to have dinner with us?

178
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,460
Look at her.

179
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,260
- Listen...
- Dad.

180
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,368
Can you tell Gu

181
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,569
this?

182
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,649
Tell him to go about with his life

183
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,569
instead of meddling
with our family affairs.

184
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,449
Xiang Zhong is over 30 years old now.

185
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,529
Do you have to go so far as to find out

186
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,099
who she went to the hospital with?

187
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,340
You're making her upset on purpose.

188
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,940
Where are you going, then?

189
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,848
Mom,

190
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,129
I need to handle some affairs
in the neighborhood.

191
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,969
I'll pick up Cong and Qi

192
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,808
and head home.

193
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,340
You should leave after dinner!

194
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:47,220
Enough. We'll have dinner together.

195
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:49,340
I'm not having dinner.

196
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,499
What's wrong?

197
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,580
I'm not having dinner.

198
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:53,009
Where are you going?

199
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,859
I don't know.

200
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,659
Fine.

201
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,529
Lanzhi, listen up!

202
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,220
You...

203
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,179
You better don't come back if you leave!

204
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,659
Will you stop or not?

205
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,659
Ms. Ma,

206
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:29,449
I wish to retrieve

207
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,089
the camera footage
on Wednesday afternoon...

208
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,848
Yeah. Wednesday afternoon.

209
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,139
I wish to retrieve

210
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,248
the camera footage

211
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,619
near the sandbox
located in the central garden.

212
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,728
I'm sorry.

213
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,899
The surveillance camera footage
cannot be retrieved without permission.

214
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,409
I'm one of the homeowners.

215
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,859
Why can't I retrieve it?

216
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,809
There are rules we have to follow.

217
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,248
It's not like every house owner

218
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:48,528
can retrieve the camera footage
when they feel like it.

219
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,569
We have to consider

220
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,340
the privacy of other homeowners as well.

221
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:53,409
You can't expect me to ask

222
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,259
the other homeowners
for their permission, right?

223
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,008
At least you have to obtain

224
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,779
more than half of their permission.

225
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,768
You can also use legal means

226
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:01,809
to involve the police.

227
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,619
We'll definitely give you
our full cooperation.

228
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,060
Fine.

229
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,379
(Greetings, fellow homeowners.)

230
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:13,608
(I'm the mother of the child)

231
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,049
(who refused to apologize
to the other mother)

232
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,899
(after my child injured her child.)

233
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,420
(My name is Xiang Qian.)

234
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:22,580
(We live in Phase 2, Unit 2, 301.)

235
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:24,969
(Today, I'm writing this letter)

236
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,089
(not only to prove my innocence and resolve)

237
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,499
(the dispute between our children,)

238
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:35,008
(but it also concerns the discrimination I felt)

239
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,820
(due to the spatial distinction)

240
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,580
(between apartments and townhouses.)

241
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,580
(Due to that, we weren't treated fairly.)

242
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:44,728
(I don't know why you guys)

243
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,008
(chose this neighborhood)

244
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,540
(in the first place.)

245
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,499
(Chatgroup of House-owners)
(Xiang Qian: To me,)

246
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,779
(in addition to the surrounding
facilities and resources,)

247
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,809
(I value the developer's advertised)

248
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,099
(floor area ratio of 0.6 the most.)

249
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,528
(I hope that my children)

250
00:09:58,529 --> 00:09:59,089
(can grow up)

251
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,820
(in an environment)

252
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,259
(with larger outdoor space
and more greenery.)

253
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,739
(But in reality,)

254
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,449
(the public area)

255
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,779
(in our condo area has been
significantly compressed.)

256
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,409
(We sacrificed)

257
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,569
(our public area)

258
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,899
(and public interest.)

259
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,019
(What did we get in the end?)

260
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,888
(In the end,)

261
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,169
(we were treated differently)

262
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,248
(even though we were living)

263
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:21,528
(in the same community.)

264
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,049
(Mr. Li: I support you.)
(We were rudely categorized as)

265
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,580
(Mrs. Yang: I support you.)
(the condo owners and the villa owners.)

266
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:28,368
(Mrs. Huang: I support you.)
(Our children)

267
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,008
(were even bullied)

268
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:30,888
(and ostracized even when)

269
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,169
(I support you.)
(they were playing in the public area)

270
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,479
(near the townhouse area.)

271
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,488
(Mr. Ge: I support you.)

272
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:37,409
(Our children)

273
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,488
(Madam Wang: I support you.)
(have to grow up)

274
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,209
(in an unfair environment)

275
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,608
(filled with injustice)

276
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,820
(Mrs. Wen: I support you.)
(and inequality.)

277
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,329
(I hope the management team
can provide me)

278
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,139
(with the full camera footage.)

279
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,060
(If my child)

280
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,859
(was in the wrong,)

281
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,528
(I will make a public apology)

282
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,580
(in front of you all.)

283
00:10:54,729 --> 00:10:56,289
(But if my child)

284
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,460
(was ostracized,)

285
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,768
(I hope to receive)

286
00:10:58,769 --> 00:10:59,951
(Madam Zhang: Agreed.)
(a fair treatment.)

287
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,289
(Mr. Li: I support you.)
(Zhu's Mother: You can come and play with us.)

288
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,300
(I'm sorry)

289
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,008
(Professor Ma: I strongly oppose discrimination.)
(for taking up your time.)

290
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,449
(I just want to share my experience)

291
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,099
(Xiang Qian: Thank you for all the support.)
(with you all. I can't help but to speak out.)

292
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,368
(Consent Form with Signatures)
These are the signatures

293
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:13,700
of more than half of the homeowners.

294
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,660
This is a screenshot
of the homeowners' group chat.

295
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,608
Most of them

296
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,859
live in the condo area.

297
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,608
The surveillance camera is pointing at

298
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,460
the villa area.

299
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,209
You at least have to

300
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,488
obtain more than half

301
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:26,859
of the villa owners' permission.

302
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,940
Firstly,

303
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:29,248
yesterday, you told me

304
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:30,488
that you required
the homeowners' signatures.

305
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,008
But you didn't tell me which area.

306
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,139
You said it was fine as long as
it was more than half of them.

307
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,259
Have you read
the homeowners' group chat?

308
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,128
You guys always treat

309
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,099
the condo owners
and villa owners differently.

310
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,648
It's already causing a huge dispute.

311
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,689
And, when we first moved into

312
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,049
this neighborhood,

313
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,689
you guys didn't designate

314
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,888
specific children's areas

315
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:48,809
for villas

316
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,888
and condos.

317
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,979
That means everyone
can play in the same area.

318
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:54,008
The villa owners spend more money

319
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,248
on their units compared to you all.

320
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,289
And, they pay us

321
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,329
a higher management fee.

322
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,220
Why can't we treat you guys differently?

323
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,899
Not only is your management team

324
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,929
not helping us to resolve our issues,

325
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,248
but you guys are also trying
to intensify the conflict.

326
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,820
What's the point
of putting you guys in charge?

327
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,329
We pay you guys a management fee

328
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,139
so that you guys can
provide services to us.

329
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,848
We didn't pay you guys

330
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,169
to suppress us.

331
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,979
I cannot go against the rules.

332
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,169
If you have any opinions,

333
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,008
you can tell

334
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,499
our GM about it.

335
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,488
Tell your GM to come, then.

336
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,259
He's away on a business trip.

337
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,259
Qian.

338
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,969
What are you two doing here?

339
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,929
Gao Ping told us about it.

340
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,340
He told us to lend you a hand.

341
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,728
What can you guys do about it?

342
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:48,728
Don't you guys need to work?

343
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:49,368
Forget about me.

344
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,619
What's the situation?

345
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,648
It's like this.

346
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,660
I want to retrieve the camera footage
of a certain area.

347
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:54,728
The management team told me

348
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,940
to obtain the signatures of the homeowners
before I could retrieve it.

349
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,089
Now, more than half of them

350
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,969
have given me their signatures.

351
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,329
Even so, she wasn't willing
to let me retrieve it.

352
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,289
She told me

353
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,660
to get them from
the villa owners as well.

354
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:03,848
What kind of lousy management is this?

355
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,289
How could they look down
on people like this?

356
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,940
What should we do now?

357
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:07,848
What should we do?

358
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,768
She said I could look for their GM.

359
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:10,779
That's what I'm doing right now.

360
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,209
One of the mothers in the neighborhood

361
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,180
recorded a video of the incident.

362
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,259
Let's take a look.

363
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,180
Is no one keeping an eye
on the children?

364
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,768
Is this fat boy

365
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,619
Dou?

366
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,220
Let me reply to a text message.

367
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,559
(Zhu's mom live in villa area.)
(Thank you.)

368
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,340
(She asked me to send you this.)
(Please thank Zhu's mother for me.)

369
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,128
So, her child started the dispute.

370
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,248
That's right. How dare
she say that it was Qi's fault?

371
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,139
That's not it.

372
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,848
He pushed Cong to the ground.

373
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:40,648
After that,

374
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:41,608
her mother told Cong

375
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:42,768
to apologize to Dou.

376
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,409
Gao Ping's aunt was too timid.

377
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,888
She said she was in a hurry
to go back and cook.

378
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,449
And, Dou's aunt

379
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,580
was quite fierce.

380
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,888
She even apologized to her.

381
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,660
What gives?

382
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,368
After that,

383
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:53,689
Qi wondered why

384
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,409
she should apologize to them

385
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,929
when he was the one

386
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,969
who pushed her brother to the ground.

387
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,569
On the second day,

388
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,139
she pushed Dou to the ground.

389
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,660
That's the entire incident.

390
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,008
We can't instill such negative values

391
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,700
in the children.

392
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:04,248
Since we have this video now,

393
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:05,420
let's go and confront Dou's mother.

394
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:06,379
Let's go.

395
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,420
Dou's mother.

396
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,008
Are you free to talk

397
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,099
right now?

398
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,139
Do you need anything?

399
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:26,979
You should watch the video first.

400
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,139
What's wrong?

401
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:35,619
What's the matter?

402
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,049
Do you still have nothing to say

403
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,060
after finishing the video?

404
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:40,888
You guys were the ones
who were looking for me.

405
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,209
I have nothing to say.

406
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,139
Don't go.

407
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,689
Stop filming! Who said you could do so?
Go and stop her.

408
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,569
Don't touch me!

409
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,209
This is my personal item!

410
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,099
Try and touch it if you dare!

411
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,969
What are you filming?

412
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,528
Who said you could film me?

413
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:50,499
Stop filming!

414
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:52,300
Didn't you also post a video of me

415
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:52,809
in

416
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,460
the homeowners' group chat?

417
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,340
Hello, is this the management team?

418
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,259
I'm from Villa No. 007.

419
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,728
Someone is recording a video

420
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:03,820
in front of my property.

421
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:05,569
They've invaded my privacy.

422
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,660
Come here immediately.

423
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,368
Dou's mother,

424
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:09,169
this is

425
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,940
the neighborhood's common area.

426
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,768
Many people pass by this area every day.

427
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:15,460
How is this your area now?

428
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm too lazy to argue with you.

429
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,648
I'll tell you one thing.

430
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:19,528
If you dare to upload the video

431
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:20,580
for people to see,

432
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:21,768
that means you're invading my privacy.

433
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:22,779
I can sue you guys for that.

434
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:23,848
You were the one

435
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:24,888
who posted a video of my sister

436
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,008
in a public group chat first.

437
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,820
We should sue you instead.

438
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:31,969
Dou's mother,

439
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,099
this is actually a small deal.

440
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,569
Our children are living in
the same neighborhood.

441
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,499
It's common for them to play together
and have some disputes.

442
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,648
On the first day,

443
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,368
your child was the one
who committed a mistake.

444
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,768
If so, just apologize to my child

445
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:42,329
and everything will be fine.

446
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,248
On the second day,

447
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:44,248
my child will apologize to Dou

448
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:45,768
for what she did wrongly.

449
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:46,409
Am I right?

450
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,289
It's common for children their age

451
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,580
to act based on their emotions.

452
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,019
It's normal for them to act impulsively.

453
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,329
As mothers,

454
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,049
shouldn't we

455
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,019
provide them with positive guidance?

456
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,809
We shouldn't teach them

457
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,728
how to discriminate against other people

458
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,689
based on their family status
or where they stay.

459
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,739
What do you think?

460
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,809
You aren't young anymore,

461
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,089
yet you don't dare
to own up to your mistakes.

462
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,648
So what

463
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:07,619
if you're living in a villa?

464
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,660
That's right.

465
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,929
You have to set an example

466
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,608
for your child.

467
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:11,169
If not, how can you

468
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,368
educate your child in the future?

469
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:13,528
How I educate my child

470
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:14,049
is my business.

471
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,300
That's none of your darned business!

472
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,089
How old are you?

473
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,128
Have you given birth before?

474
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,608
What gives you the right
to criticize me?

475
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,128
I don't have the right to tell you

476
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,289
how to educate your child.

477
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,848
However, this incident involves

478
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,888
my sister's children.

479
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,209
That means we have
the right to interfere.

480
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,569
We're here to demand
an account from you.

481
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,809
How you wish to educate your child

482
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,728
is your own business.

483
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:30,289
But I have to let my children know

484
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,379
the difference between right and wrong.

485
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,300
We have our own standards.

486
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,488
You posted my video

487
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:36,608
in the homeowners' group chat.

488
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:37,689
Now, you have to apologize to me

489
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,259
for implicating me.

490
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,259
Apologize to you?

491
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,420
Are you kidding me?

492
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,848
You don't want to apologize to us?

493
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:44,329
Fine.

494
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,409
We'll hire an attorney now.

495
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,569
See you in court.

496
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,409
Go ahead.

497
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,409
You think I'm scared?

498
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,049
Of course you aren't scared.

499
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,169
You love to film videos, don't you?

500
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,809
If so, let's post the videos

501
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,689
we recorded

502
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,248
on social media, okay?

503
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:55,689
Social media is very advanced nowadays,

504
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,368
am I right?

505
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,660
Everyone else can be our judge.

506
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,089
If I'm not mistaken,

507
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,248
I think your husband

508
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,499
is a public figure as well.

509
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,888
How dare you threaten me?

510
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,248
What are you doing?

511
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,209
How dare you push her?

512
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,328
What are you doing?

513
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,700
Stop pushing my sister!

514
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,460
Why did she push my sister?

515
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,299
Why did you push my sister?

516
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:16,689
Stop it!

517
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,460
Stop it!

518
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:18,248
Stop it!

519
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:18,969
Stop it!

520
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,728
Stop fighting!

521
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:20,528
Stop fighting!

522
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:21,929
I'll call the cops
if you guys keep this up!

523
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,969
She started it first!

524
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,048
She did it first!

525
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:24,768
We recorded everything!

526
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:25,849
What's wrong?

527
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,008
Calm down!

528
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:27,768
Calm down!

529
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:28,889
What kind of people are they?

530
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,969
Speak for yourself!

531
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,969
Enough already!

532
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,940
Stop arguing.

533
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,779
I'm back/

534
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,579
You're back.

535
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,900
How was today's interview?

536
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,579
It's not too bad.

537
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,449
How did the incident
with the children go?

538
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,088
Why didn't you

539
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,380
send me a text message?

540
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,259
I was afraid
that it might affect your interview.

541
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,339
It wasn't a huge deal.

542
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:54,808
If so, I'll take a bath first.

543
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:55,739
You can tell me when I'm done.

544
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:05,819
Hello, Boss?

545
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,979
You didn't come to work today.

546
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,700
What major business were you up to
in your neighborhood?

547
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,739
How did you find out?

548
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,328
I don't know what you've done

549
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,620
in your neighborhood.

550
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,889
Anyway,

551
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,059
that neighbor of yours

552
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:20,900
is quite influential.

553
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,808
I don't know.

554
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,649
I just know

555
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,180
that her husband is a soccer player.

556
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,220
Her brother is Mr. Tang, you know?

557
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:27,979
Which Mr. Tang?

558
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:29,849
The wealthy client

559
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,929
that's on our radar

560
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,059
right now.

561
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,900
He just called me.

562
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,620
This can't be.

563
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,940
This is too much of a coincidence.

564
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:41,819
What should we do, then?

565
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,460
Come.

566
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,420
This circle is pretty small, huh?

567
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:57,499
Ms. Xiang, I didn't expect you

568
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:58,929
to live in the same neighborhood

569
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,299
as my sister.

570
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,860
The world is small indeed.

571
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,299
Fate must've led us to each other.

572
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,420
Mr. Tang,

573
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,409
you're a huge client of ours.

574
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,088
Don't say that.

575
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,900
I truly wish to continue

576
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,259
working together with you.

577
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,689
But I did have a dispute

578
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,059
with your sister in the neighborhood

579
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,140
just a few days ago.

580
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,019
I'm worried that this issue

581
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,700
might affect our collaboration.

582
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,180
If so, Ms. Xiang,

583
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,259
I'll quit beating around the bush.

584
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,768
You see,

585
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,979
I'm easy to talk to.

586
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,380
However,

587
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,059
I only have one sister.

588
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,539
I only have one nephew as well.

589
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:38,369
Actually, my sister

590
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,579
isn't asking for much.

591
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,248
She just hopes

592
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,059
that you can delete the video
that you recorded.

593
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,019
After that, you two
can apologize to each other.

594
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,889
The issue will be resolved by then.

595
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,728
Yes.

596
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,380
This is actually very simple.

597
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:52,969
I'll definitely apologize to her.

598
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,019
However,

599
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,649
shouldn't we sort

600
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,940
the issue out first?

601
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,689
The one who committed the mistake first

602
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,299
should apologize first.

603
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,539
This...

604
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,488
You see, sometimes,

605
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:06,059
we shouldn't be too calculative.

606
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:13,460
Mr. Tang,

607
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,808
actually, I've discussed this

608
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:16,860
with Ms. Xiang beforehand.

609
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,140
Regarding the quotation

610
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,088
for our collaboration project,

611
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,180
we can

612
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,819
reduce an extra one percent.

613
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,900
And, the one percent will come from

614
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,059
Ms. Xiang's personal commission.

615
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,140
I don't think that's appropriate.

616
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,689
Mr. Tang,

617
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,900
I wish to abide by my principles.

618
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,328
But by doing so,

619
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:39,328
your sister will definitely

620
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:40,420
hold it against me.

621
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:42,488
Luckily, we have
a collaboration project going on.

622
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:43,969
It gave me an opportunity

623
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,248
to express my sincerity

624
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:46,700
with regards

625
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,019
to the quotation.

626
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:51,819
Come, let's have a toast.

627
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,499
Alright.

628
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,979
Please go ahead.

629
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,380
Come.

630
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:51,568
I reek of alcohol.

631
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:52,288
If I go home

632
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,008
and kiss my children now,

633
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,900
they'll get alcohol poisoning.

634
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,819
You're exaggerating things.

635
00:21:58,529 --> 00:21:59,460
But I think

636
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,140
they'll get drunk from it.

637
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,059
Here.

638
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,979
Wait for the smell to dissipate.

639
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,088
Stay here for now.

640
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,299
You can go upstairs later.

641
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,700
Alright.

642
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:18,728
Mister,

643
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:19,808
please wait a moment.

644
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:20,499
Okay.

645
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:26,380
Thank you.

646
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,380
What are you laughing at?

647
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,660
I never expected
the ignorant youth back then

648
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,259
to become so sly now.

649
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,979
Firstly,

650
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,700
I wasn't an ignorant youth back then.

651
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,059
Secondly,

652
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:50,339
I'm not sly or devious.

653
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,700
How could you stage this act

654
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:54,900
if you weren't sly in the first place?

655
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:56,620
First, you gave him one percent.

656
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,979
After that, you gave him
an extra 0.5 percent.

657
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:01,499
You planned for everything.

658
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,539
Sir, thank you for your compliment.

659
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,929
It's because
I've inherited your mindset.

660
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,860
You flatter me too much.

661
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,008
But I feel bad

662
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,449
for reducing your commission
because of this.

663
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,339
Yeah, right?

664
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:16,140
Now, you have a guilty conscience.

665
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,048
Don't you think you're paying
too high of a price

666
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:18,728
for

667
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,180
a mere apology?

668
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,568
But Cong and Qi

669
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,420
have to learn how to differentiate

670
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,008
between right and wrong at this age,

671
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:26,900
am I right?

672
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,288
And,

673
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:30,209
we need to provide

674
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,259
the children with a sense of
balance and fairness.

675
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,900
He apologized to the culprit
even though he did nothing wrong.

676
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,689
The balance needs to be restored.

677
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,499
I think paying such a price

678
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,579
is worth it.

679
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:41,180
Fine, then.

680
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,768
I'll take this loss

681
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:45,259
as an education investment fund

682
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,380
for the children

683
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,059
since I'm their godfather.

684
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,779
Sir, thank you for supporting

685
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,220
and nurturing me.

686
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,460
Thank you for looking after

687
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,620
Cong and Qi as well.

688
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,860
Don't worry.

689
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,488
We aren't

690
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:03,979
ingrates.

691
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,768
If, one day,

692
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:07,649
you end up old and lonely,

693
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,248
I'll definitely tell Cong and Qi

694
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:10,620
to inherit your inheritance.

695
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,328
Who said I would end up old and lonely?

696
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:14,768
You'll end up old and lonely.

697
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,019
Who are you trying to jinx here?

698
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,088
Old and lonely?

699
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,700
I already have two children, you know?

700
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,209
If I have one more child,

701
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,299
I'll definitely have plenty
of grandchildren in the future.

702
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,088
If you drink a little more,

703
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,248
I suppose you'll show off

704
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:28,180
in front of the entire world, huh?

705
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,059
Thank you, Aunty. You can leave it here.

706
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,140
What's wrong?

707
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,339
Ping,

708
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,220
when I was drying the clothes,

709
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,180
I saw Xiang Qian

710
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,979
together with a man downstairs.

711
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,299
They looked pretty close.

712
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,779
You're overthinking it.

713
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:00,460
She's not someone like that.

714
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,008
They've spent a lot of time

715
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:39,100
downstairs, you know?

716
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,369
That's her colleague.

717
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,739
They've known each other for many years.

718
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,929
No matter what,

719
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,940
it's inappropriate for them
to spend time alone like that.

720
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:49,689
Why can't they chat

721
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,259
after they reach home?

722
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,210
(Deng Haiyang)

723
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:08,819
We've arrived.

724
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,140
Are you troubled by something?

725
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,140
No, not at all.

726
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:18,940
Let's go.

727
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:44,700
Hand me the tissue.

728
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,259
Thank you.

729
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,728
Which one?

730
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:05,460
This one.

731
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:08,860
The environment here is pretty nice.

732
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:10,460
It's quite beautiful.

733
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,100
Yeah. We frequent this place.

734
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:16,808
They're here.

735
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:17,609
Wang Yuxi!

736
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,209
He's here.

737
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,328
Hurry, have a seat.

738
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:20,449
Come, please have a seat.

739
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,940
- We were waiting for you.
- Be careful.

740
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,339
Let me introduce them.

741
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,819
This is my ex-colleague, Qing.

742
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,849
Nice to meet you.

743
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,620
Nice to meet you.

744
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,140
You guys are here!

745
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,889
Sorry about that.

746
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,849
I went to the restroom just now.

747
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,369
This is Linda, Qing's friend.

748
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,169
Nice to meet you.

749
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,248
They rented

750
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:35,369
an old house together in the alley.

751
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,420
It's beautifully decorated.

752
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,660
You'll definitely like it.

753
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,209
Let me introduce him.

754
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:39,768
This is Joe,

755
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:40,808
my boyfriend.

756
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,019
Nice to meet you.

757
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,008
This is Li Yi,

758
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,019
her boyfriend.

759
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,539
What was that?

760
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,129
What's the matter, my buddy?

761
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,088
What's wrong?

762
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:52,649
What are you guys doing?

763
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,808
We're buddies.

764
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:54,979
Nice to meet you all.

765
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,008
That was just a joke.

766
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:56,488
You see,

767
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:57,900
Linda loves to spout nonsense.

768
00:27:58,089 --> 00:27:59,169
This is my boyfriend,

769
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,129
Li Yi.

770
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,768
Nice to meet you.

771
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:01,328
Nice to meet you.

772
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:02,100
Yuxi,

773
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:03,660
why aren't you introducing her to us?

774
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,339
This is Xiang Zhong.

775
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:06,700
I'm Xiang Zhong.

776
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,100
So, you guys are...

777
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,609
I knew it.

778
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,499
You weren't available when
I asked you to join us lately.

779
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:22,259
So, you had a girlfriend all along, huh?

780
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,460
We're neighbors.

781
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,048
We're real neighbors.

782
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:27,728
Neighbors?

783
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:28,728
We're neighbors too.

784
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:29,649
We're neighbors too.

785
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,409
All of us are neighbors.

786
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,700
- Hello, neighbor.
- Hello, neighbor.

787
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:32,649
Hello, neighbor.

788
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,209
We're neighbors.

789
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,539
All of us are neighbors.

790
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:36,528
Just ignore them.

791
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:38,180
They'll only make things worse.

792
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,420
It was just a joke.

793
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,248
Xiang Zhong, welcome.

794
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:41,969
It's a pleasure to meet you.

795
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,728
I hope you'll enjoy yourself here.

796
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,380
It's just a joke. Please don't mind us.

797
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:49,649
Cong, Qi.

798
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,808
Time to eat.

799
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,700
Come.

800
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,088
Alright. Go now.

801
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:55,169
Wipe your hands dry.

802
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,100
Wipe them dry.

803
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,019
Go now. Be careful.

804
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,539
How is it?

805
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:10,940
Do you feel better now?

806
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:14,259
Have you guys washed your hands?

807
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:14,808
Yeah.

808
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:16,209
They're clean.

809
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,059
Let's eat.

810
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:17,808
I won't peel them for you.

811
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:19,380
I'll peel them for Cong.

812
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,339
Aunty,

813
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,449
didn't I tell you yesterday

814
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,369
that I might need some soup

815
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,660
this morning?

816
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,220
I was too busy to prepare it today.

817
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:30,579
Let's make do for now.

818
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,129
I'll make you

819
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,568
some seaweed soup with egg.

820
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:36,499
It's okay.

821
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,579
I'll make it myself.

822
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:39,860
You can continue.

823
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,339
I'll make it for her.

824
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,819
You should eat.

825
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,779
Let me do it.

826
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,900
Aunty,

827
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,248
do you see

828
00:29:57,249 --> 00:29:58,889
the food containers in the refrigerator?

829
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,728
That means you should

830
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,649
categorize the groceries you buy.

831
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,180
You should categorize them

832
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,409
according to their categories.

833
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,620
It's easier for us to find too,
don't you agree?

834
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:07,929
And, the plastic bags you pack

835
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,969
these ingredients with

836
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,700
might not be sanitary.

837
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,860
I think this is
pretty convenient for me.

838
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,328
Why did you buy

839
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:23,620
so few mushrooms?

840
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,700
Mushroom prices have gone up now.

841
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,860
They're too expensive now.

842
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,339
Even with the price increase,
it won't be that expensive.

843
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,369
It's not like

844
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,019
we can't afford mushrooms.

845
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,129
Don't you know this?

846
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,369
Mushrooms are high in purines.

847
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,779
We shouldn't consume too many of them.

848
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:42,660
I've just reached my thirties.

849
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,220
And, I don't have gout either.

850
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,129
You'll turn 40 in the blink of an eye.

851
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,739
You should take care of your diet.

852
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:51,008
Aunty, you should eat.

853
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,100
I'll make it myself.

854
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:53,539
Okay.

855
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,660
She insists on making it herself.

856
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:03,539
Dad, is Mom upset now?

857
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:04,328
That's not it.

858
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,449
Mom just took

859
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,129
some alcohol last night.

860
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,620
Her tummy is uncomfortable.

861
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,169
Is Mom uncomfortable?

862
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,860
She's fine. Eat up.

863
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,248
One shouldn't drink that much

864
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:14,620
when she knew that she would
be uncomfortable after it.

865
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:16,380
Can't she control her alcohol intake?

866
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:17,940
Gao Ping.

867
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,499
Here.

868
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,420
What does she mean by that?

869
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:40,929
Can't I even have some soup

870
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,689
and mushrooms

871
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,328
in my own house now?

872
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:44,860
That's not it.

873
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,528
Aunty was just concerned about you.

874
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,100
Are you sure about that?

875
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:49,900
It feels like
she's disciplining me instead.

876
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,929
I already told her

877
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,220
that I needed some soup this morning

878
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,620
because I took alcohol yesterday.

879
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,660
What does she mean by
she was too busy to prepare it?

880
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:57,889
How is she busy?

881
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,180
Today's Sunday, you know?

882
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:00,568
I just wanted some mushrooms.

883
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,339
How expensive can mushrooms be?

884
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:05,328
You're hilarious too.

885
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,808
Why did you tell our children

886
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:07,609
that I took alcohol

887
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,900
and so on?

888
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,048
Even if I didn't tell them,

889
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:11,929
they already found out.

890
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,808
You came back

891
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:13,819
very drunk last night.

892
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,728
You reeked of alcohol,

893
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,129
yet you still wanted
to hug and kiss them.

894
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,819
Of course the children
knew that you drank.

895
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,649
Enough.

896
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,048
You shouldn't take too much alcohol.

897
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,299
It's bad for your health.

898
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,460
You think I'm taking alcohol
of my own accord?

899
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,048
Dou, the one who started the dispute

900
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:26,929
with our children,

901
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:27,860
his uncle

902
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,209
is actually a huge client

903
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,900
that my company is trying
to clinch a deal with.

904
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,660
The world is that small.

905
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,169
Don't you think I should

906
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,048
treat him to a meal, drink with him,

907
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:36,779
and explain the situation to him?

908
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,488
Don't you think

909
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,900
it's necessary to entertain him?

910
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:41,488
Yes.

911
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:42,328
Even so,

912
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,779
you didn't tell me about it in advance.

913
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,169
What's the point
of telling you about it?

914
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,220
Can you drink on my behalf, then?

915
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:56,768
Yeah.

916
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:58,100
It's useless
even if you tell me about it.

917
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,979
I'm useless in the first place.

918
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:02,220
That's not what I mean.

919
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,620
You're overthinking it.

920
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,048
It's fine. You're right.

921
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,460
I know my own worth.

922
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:08,819
Hello, Dad?

923
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:16,499
What?

924
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:17,929
There are six of us in total.

925
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,299
Each of us will draw a card.

926
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,499
The one who draws the Joker

927
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,609
is the loser.

928
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,209
Okay?

929
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,380
We're playing Truth or Dare here.

930
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,609
This is a gentleman's game.

931
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,328
A gentleman's game.

932
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:27,169
Let me lose.

933
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,048
I want to choose Dare.

934
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,048
I want to choose Dare.

935
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,129
You're pretty brave, huh?

936
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:30,940
I'm unlucky.

937
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,140
Show us your cards.

938
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:35,929
Safe.

939
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,700
Safe.

940
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:40,019
I'm lucky.

941
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,528
Dare!

942
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:42,849
Dare!

943
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,768
Dare!

944
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:45,420
I'll choose Truth.

945
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:46,979
If so, you have to tell us the truth.

946
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:48,488
Be honest, okay?

947
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:49,539
Three questions.

948
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,129
Isn't it supposed to be one question?

949
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,889
- This is our rule.
- There are three of us here.

950
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,259
We usually ask three questions.

951
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:55,940
Neighbor, go ahead.

952
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:56,849
Three questions.

953
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,288
Me?

954
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:57,969
That's right.

955
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,449
I can't think of anything.

956
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,328
We know each other too well.

957
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,488
I can't think of anything.

958
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:02,169
This is tough.

959
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,008
We're not interested

960
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,220
in him either.

961
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,449
What do you want to know about him?

962
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,288
This is difficult.

963
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:06,889
This is exciting.

964
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,979
- She's shy.
- Just ask him.

965
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,339
Let me think.

966
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,739
Give us something exciting.

967
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,128
What's the most embarrassing thing

968
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,020
you've done before?

969
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,660
The most embarrassing thing I've done?

970
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,128
This question is too simple.

971
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:21,889
I got drunk last time.

972
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,688
After that...

973
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:23,608
After that?

974
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:24,289
I threw up

975
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,819
in Qing's washing machine.

976
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:26,889
That's right.

977
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,620
You threw up in my washing machine.

978
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,060
Why did you throw up?

979
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,339
What was the reason?

980
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:33,980
His ex-girlfriend got married.

981
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,969
I suppose

982
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,419
he was heartbroken, then.

983
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:38,379
Understood.

984
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,140
Dad, Mom.

985
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,739
Since you two called me here,

986
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,459
you two didn't need to come.

987
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,660
She already ran away with another man.

988
00:34:57,689 --> 00:34:58,889
How could we not find her ourselves?

989
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,980
Lower your volume.

990
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:00,809
Right now, nobody knows

991
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,020
what the situation is.

992
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:03,568
The situation

993
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:04,729
is that I saw our car

994
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,528
at the parking lot.

995
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:06,409
But she wasn't at West Wharf.

996
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,608
I'm sure she's over there.

997
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:08,620
Don't raise your voice here.

998
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:09,809
You could've

999
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,168
just called me regarding this matter.

1000
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:12,729
You didn't need to call my parents here.

1001
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,889
Why should I call you?

1002
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,648
She didn't pick up

1003
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:15,859
even when I called her.

1004
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,128
You brought so many people here

1005
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:17,809
just

1006
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,729
to search for her.

1007
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,688
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

1008
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:20,648
Since she doesn't care
about her dignity,

1009
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:21,889
I don't need to care about mine either.

1010
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,849
Say that again?

1011
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,329
Do you want everyone to hear you?

1012
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,379
You're being louder than him.

1013
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:27,969
Dad, Mom,

1014
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,849
you guys should find a shop

1015
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,528
and rest there.

1016
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:30,929
Deng Haiyang and I will search for her.

1017
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,969
He's too loud.

1018
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,608
My goodness.

1019
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:33,088
That's right.

1020
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,819
You two should take a break.

1021
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,459

Why didn't you answer my calls?)

1048
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,729
(Dad: Are you in Tongli?)

1049
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,048
(All of us are looking for you.)

1050
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:44,769
(Xiang Qian: Xiang Zhong,)

1051
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,889
(why didn't you answer my call?)

1052
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,729
(Xiang Zhong, what happened?)

1053
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,180
(Why didn't you answer my calls?)

1054
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,890
(Dad: Where are you? Contact us immediately!
Are you in Tongli? All of us are looking for you.)

1055
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,739
Xiang Zhong!

1056
00:39:09,169 --> 00:39:10,060
Xiang Zhong!

1057
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:11,660
Stop right there!

1058
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:13,459
Xiang Zhong!

1059
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:14,739
Don't move!

1060
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,020
I'm sorry. I...

1061
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:19,648
Hurry and head back.

1062
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:20,008
What's wrong?

1063
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:20,688
Don't just stand there!

1064
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:21,008
Don't move!

1065
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:21,540
What's the matter?

1066
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:22,929
Stop right there!

1067
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,568
Don't move!

1068
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,208
What are you doing?

1069
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,060
Let go of her!

1070
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,088
Let go of her!

1071
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:26,700
Let go of her!

1072
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,329
What are you doing?

1073
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,369
What were you two doing in the room?

1074
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,128
What were you two doing?

1075
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:30,140
Let go of her!

1076
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:30,849
What have you two

1077
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,648
- done in this place?
- What are you doing?

1078
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:32,500
Enough already.

1079
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:33,259
Dad.

1080
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,249
What's going on?

1081
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,500
Look at them!

1082
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,819
Why did they head there?

1083
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,299
Who are you?

1084
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:41,449
I'm a friend of Xiang Zhong's.

1085
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,339
What friend?

1086
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,379
Just head back.

1087
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:44,449
Who said he could leave?

1088
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:44,849
Where are you going?

1089
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,899
Where are you telling him to go?

1090
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:46,769
What kind of friend is he?

1091
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,729
Dad, stop shouting.

1092
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,899
Xiang Zhong, who is he?

1093
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:49,939
Tell me!

1094
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:51,769
Come here!

1095
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,488
Dad, listen.

1096
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:52,929
Dad.

1097
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,048
Now, you can stay out of this.

1098
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:55,409
Look at them. Both of them

1099
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,528
are wet.

1100
00:39:56,529 --> 00:39:57,568
And, they were in the same room.

1101
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:58,249
What else were they up to?

1102
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,409
We're already divorced!
Stay out of my affairs!

1103
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,339
Say that again?

1104
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:10,500
What?

1105
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:11,449
Why did you evade it?

1106
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,409
Why are you hitting me instead?

1107
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,289
She evaded my blow!

1108
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:13,929
He was mistaken.

1109
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,688
What do you mean by that?

1110
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:15,249
Did you think I would hit you

1111
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,459
had she not avoided my blow?

1112
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:18,259
Look at you! What are you doing?

1113
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,488
Why are you hitting me?

1114
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:20,528
Stop shouting, okay?

1115
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:21,849
Deng Haiyang, take Mom and Dad with you.

1116
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,980
I'll take Xiang Zhong with me.

1117
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,249
Wait. Don't go!

1118
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:24,849
This...

1119
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,289
I have to report this to the cops.

1120
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,339
I have to do it immediately.

1121
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,168
You want to call the cops?

1122
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:29,568
What will you tell them?

1123
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:31,220
I'll report him for abducting women!

1124
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:33,249
How is that valid?

1125
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,128
Both parties are willing.

1126
00:40:34,129 --> 00:40:35,809
At most, they're just in a relationship.

1127
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:36,899
What relationship?

1128
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:38,369
How could she be in a relationship
without getting a divorce first?

1129
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,008
That's right.

1130
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:39,889
You're spouting nonsense.

1131
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,528
Come with me.

1132
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:41,528
- We aren't divorced yet.
- Come.

1133
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:42,369
Stop dragging me.

1134
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,329
What are you doing?

1135
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,100
Come here!

1136
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,339
Get out of my way!

1137
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:50,929
Why did you evade me?

1138
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,208
I would've been

1139
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:52,379
kicked if I didn't.

1140
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,819
You did the right thing.

1141
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,449
I've told you this many times.

1142
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,008
I told you to stay away
from Xiang Zhong.

1143
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:07,409
You...

1144
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,608
Why do you keep pestering her?

1145
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:09,700
Just let her off.

1146
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,100
You're the one pestering her here.

1147
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:15,329
Do you understand what it means

1148
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,299
for both parties to be willing?

1149
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:17,849
Say that again?

1150
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,769
Now, I'll tell you

1151
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,568
this.

1152
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:21,739
I won't part ways with Xiang Zhong.

1153
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,289
I won't get a divorce with her.

1154
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,168
Understood?

1155
00:41:24,169 --> 00:41:25,528
Can you provide her
with happiness, then?

1156
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:26,500
Can you?

1157
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,980
I don't want to explain myself to you.

1158
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:31,208
You're utterly shameless.

1159
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:32,289
Come here. I'm talking to you!

1160
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,339
Did you hear me?

1161
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,060
Come back!

1162
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:36,419
Stop right there!

1163
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,769
Someone fell into the river!

1164
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,809
Is there a lifebuoy nearby?

1165
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,008
Hurry and rescue him!

1166
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,168
Is there a lifebuoy nearby?

1167
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:51,500
Hurry and rescue him!

1168
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:52,528
Hurry and rescue him!

1169
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:53,729
Someone fell into the river!

1170
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,769
Someone fell into the river!

1171
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,488
Can he swim?

1172
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:56,500
Hurry and rescue him!

1173
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:58,100
Hurry!

1174
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:09,220
It's Haiyang!

1175
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,540
It's Haiyang! Hurry!

1176
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,620
Haiyang!

1177
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,608
What happened?

1178
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:13,540
What happened to you?

1179
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,180
How did you end up in the river?

1180
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,100
Haiyang?

1181
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:18,299
This...

1182
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:19,608
Haiyang?

1183
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:20,819
Did you push him into the river?

1184
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,688
Did you

1185
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:23,889
push him into the river?

1186
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,289
Do you know

1187
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,540
what you're doing?

1188
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:26,608
You're killing him!

1189
00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:28,419
You're a murderer!

1190
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:29,488
You're a murderer

1191
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,140
for pushing him into the river.

1192
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:33,220
- I!
- Call 112!

1193
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:34,779
He fell into the river by himself.

1194
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,620
By himself?

1195
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:38,329
You can ask him if you don't believe me.

1196
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,220
Haiyang?

1197
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,540
Haiyang?

1198
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:41,329
You didn't need to do this.

1199
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,660
Haiyang, you didn't need to go this far.

1200
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:44,249
Haiyang, look at her.

1201
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:44,969
Who is she?

1202
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,259
Haiyang, who is she?

1203
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:52,140
Look at me. Who am I?

1204
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:53,369
Haiyang,

1205
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,540
stop scaring me.

1206
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:56,819
Haiyang, don't scare me.

1207
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,779
