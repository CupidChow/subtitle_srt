=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 33=

4
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:40,162
If we sleep vertically,

5
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,881
I don't think we'll fit.

6
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:43,121
It'll be too crowded.

7
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:45,002
Let's sleep horizontally then.

8
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,761
Yeah, horizontally.

9
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,002
We'll sleep in a row.

10
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:47,802
Alright.

11
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,562
It's been a long time
since we slept together.

12
00:01:58,082 --> 00:01:58,601
Qian.

13
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:00,362
Are we sleeping horizontally?

14
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:01,041
Yes, horizontally.

15
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:02,521
The bed can't fit us if we sleep
vertically. It'll be crowded too.

16
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:08,002
I'll sleep inside.

17
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:09,002
I'm turning off the light.

18
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:12,121
Lie down.

19
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,402
This makes me feel
like childhood again.

20
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,481
It's always you
who turned off the light.

21
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:23,761
Are you squeezed over there?

22
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:25,562
No, there's plenty of space here.

23
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:27,842
Back then, we only had two rooms.

24
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:28,722
Once the light is switched off,

25
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,402
both of you lose track of the bed.

26
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:33,442
It's like, with the light off,

27
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:34,601
it was impossible to find the bed.

28
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:36,282
We just wanted to rely on you.

29
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,201
I feel like

30
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,761
my feet are outside the bed.

31
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:43,962
Mine too.

32
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:45,601
Is this bed a bit short?

33
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:46,962
I...

34
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,081
It fits me just fine.

35
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,242
I'm short.

36
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:52,881
I'm short.

37
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:54,722
This seems perfect for you.

38
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:56,442
You're right.

39
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,761
This bed seems like it was
designed just for me.

40
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:00,842
I'm sorry, Zhong.

41
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:01,921
What's up?

42
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,282
It seems you didn't drink
enough milk growing up.

43
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:05,641
Hey you!

44
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,002
You're mocking me.

45
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,682
Your sister, Zhong

46
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,321
ate all organic food,

47
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:11,801
all the nutrition went to her brain.

48
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,921
Concentrated is the essence.

49
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,361
All the growth went to the brain.

50
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:18,881
I grow up becoming hot-tempered.

51
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,081
Thank you to both of you.

52
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:26,201
What are you saying?

53
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:29,321
I mean, I'm tired.

54
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:30,682
I'm going to sleep.

55
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,682
Let's sleep. I'm tired too.

56
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:27,882
Hello, Mum.

57
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:28,722
What's up?

58
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,082
Xiang Qian, Xiang Qian!

59
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,322
The kitchen knife
in our home is missing.

60
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:34,282
The kitchen knife is missing?

61
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:35,361
What do you mean?

62
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:37,162
Your dad is missing.

63
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:38,921
I've looked for him everywhere,

64
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:41,522
and the kitchen knife has gone too.

65
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,121
Do you mean my dad left
with the kitchen knife?

66
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:46,681
Could he be going after Jiang Hongbin?

67
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:49,522
Don't panic.

68
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:50,882
I'll look for him.

69
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:25,162
Dad, have some tea.

70
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:26,962
Don't call me Dad.

71
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,962
But, in terms of the relationship,
you are my dad.

72
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:33,882
Do you still see me as your dad?

73
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,842
Do you still see Xiang Nan as your wife?

74
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:41,001
Jiang Hongbin,

75
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,241
I entrusted my daughter to you,

76
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,041
but you bullied her!

77
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:48,322
Dad.

78
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,282
Don't call me Dad.

79
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,801
It's just a minor marital issue

80
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,921
between Xiang Nan and me.

81
00:05:58,322 --> 00:05:59,402
This is very normal.

82
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,481
There's no need to blow it
out of proportion.

83
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,762
Blow it out of proportion?

84
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:05,322
Do you think
the relationship between you two

85
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:06,082
is normal?

86
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:07,441
Before Xiang Nan married,

87
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:08,282
I've never laid a finger

88
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,202
on her.

89
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,322
I can't bear to do that.

90
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:11,522
But you?

91
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,361
How dare you treat her

92
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:14,481
such badly!

93
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,601
Are you even human?

94
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:20,681
Dad, that's not fair.

95
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:22,842
It was reported to the police,

96
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:24,681
and I went to the police station.

97
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:25,921
Even the police said

98
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:27,322
it's just a common family dispute.

99
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,601
What more do you want?

100
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,681
Why do you have
to keep holding on to that?

101
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:33,481
Not to be rude,

102
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:34,801
but Xiang Nan's

103
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,361
bad habits

104
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:38,082
are all because you spoiled her.

105
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:43,041
You animal!

106
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:45,082
Fine,

107
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,522
you vented.

108
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:48,842
We're even now.

109
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:50,601
I call you Dad

110
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,041
because you are an elder to me.

111
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:53,642
But, don't go overboard.

112
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:55,762
Listen up!

113
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:56,842
Jiang Hongbin!

114
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,722
I'm here today

115
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,561
for two reasons.

116
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:02,681
First,

117
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,601
divorce Xiang Nan immediately!

118
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:06,041
Second,

119
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:07,722
for your violence against her,

120
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:09,402
you must turn yourself in.

121
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:11,921
Sorry to disappoint you.

122
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:13,322
First,

123
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:15,121
I won't divorce her.

124
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,082
Second,

125
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,282
this is normal married life,

126
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,522
not a crime.

127
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,402
So, I don't need to turn myself in.

128
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:22,962
Don't make a joke with me.

129
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,322
Do you think I'm joking with you?

130
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,762
Jiang Hongbin,

131
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,361
I know you're powerful.

132
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,041
Let's settle this between us then.

133
00:07:59,202 --> 00:07:59,921
Come on!

134
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,522
You die or I live?

135
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,202
Come on!

136
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:20,921
Come on!

137
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:21,681
Miss Xiang!

138
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:22,801
Miss Xiang, you can't go in!

139
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:23,722
Dad!

140
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:25,921
What are you doing?

141
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:28,082
This is a company.

142
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:28,921
There are

143
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,842
surveillance cameras everywhere.

144
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,121
Calm down.

145
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,041
I'll settle this myself.

146
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:36,402
Let me settle this.

147
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:37,762
Go down.

148
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:39,162
Go downstairs and wait for me.

149
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:54,321
You're always good at
handling things, my sister-in-law.

150
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,242
Dad is just too aggressive!

151
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:03,041
Jiang Hongbin,

152
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,561
your family is big and prosperous.

153
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:08,002
You have power, wealth, and influence.

154
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,282
Finding a suitable woman

155
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:12,041
to keep at home

156
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:12,762
as your wife

157
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:13,801
shouldn't be difficult.

158
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:15,841
Why won't you just

159
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:16,961
let Xiang Nan go leniently?

160
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:18,841
Why do you escalate this

161
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:20,122
to legal action?

162
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,162
My dear sister-in-law,

163
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,402
let's leave the topic
about Xiang Nan aside for now.

164
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:25,801
I need to discuss
something else with you.

165
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:27,561
Does Chai Jin know

166
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,201
you're here?

167
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,242
Why does he need to know

168
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:33,721
that I come here?

169
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:36,441
Apparently, there are some things

170
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:37,921
you're unaware of.

171
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:40,402
Maybe

172
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,681
you should ask Chai Jin

173
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,242
if he has done anything

174
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:45,242
that cannot be told

175
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:46,402
behind your back.

176
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:48,441
We're family.

177
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:50,041
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

178
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:51,841
If anything happens

179
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,961
to Chai Jin,

180
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,441
your loss could be massive.

181
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:02,362
I'm not a businessperson.

182
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:04,522
Business matters

183
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,801
are not important to me now.

184
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:07,762
As for our family,

185
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:08,762
the top priority

186
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:10,362
is Xiang Nan's matter.

187
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:15,162
Take care, my sister-in-law.

188
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:24,921
Xiang Qian. Xiang Qian.

189
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,122
How did it go?

190
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:27,642
Dad, you go home first.

191
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,122
I'm asking you how your
conversation with him went.

192
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:30,002
When will they divorce?

193
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:31,321
When will he turn himself in?

194
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,561
Dad, please go home first.

195
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:33,681
I have to get to the office now.

196
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:34,441
Why do you go to the office

197
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:36,321
at a crucial time like this?

198
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,242
I'm going...

199
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:38,441
I'm going to meet
Chai Jin in the office.

200
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,441
Why do you have

201
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:40,482
to meet Chai Jin now?

202
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:42,362
Oh, I got it.

203
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:43,961
Chai Jin might have some ideas.

204
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:44,681
This is great.

205
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:45,921
He'll have a solution.

206
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:46,921
Dad,

207
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:49,282
just head home and wait for me

208
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:51,441
to settle this matter, okay?

209
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:52,081
Mum is waiting for you at home.

210
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:52,762
I've called a car for you.

211
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,122
Don't let me leave.

212
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:55,201
I...

213
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:58,362
Morning, Ms. Xiang.

214
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,201
Come in.

215
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:14,321
What's wrong?

216
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:15,402
Is there anything happened?

217
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,482
Why do you look so serious?

218
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:18,201
Do you want some coffee?

219
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:19,201
No.

220
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:22,602
Do you have any secret deal

221
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:23,882
with Jiang Hongbin?

222
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,482
What did he say?

223
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:32,402
He let me ask you.

224
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:40,522
Does he have any leverage

225
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:41,441
on you?

226
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,681
What have you two done?

227
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,122
What did he say to you?

228
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:49,282
He let me ask you.

229
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,402
You're making me anxious.

230
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:01,081
Why are you keeping silent?

231
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,242
Is it something very serious?

232
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:10,522
He...

233
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:12,762
He has

234
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,402
a stake in a company

235
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:15,642
that aims to obtain

236
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:17,602
the gas pipeline

237
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:18,721
renovation contract.

238
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,242
He asked me to pull some strings

239
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,242
at the Housing and
Urban Development Bureau.

240
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,242
And did you?

241
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:25,721
I did.

242
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:28,041
Everything has settled?

243
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:30,242
I gave out 200,000 yuan.

244
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:33,441
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

245
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,402
Time was a constraint.

246
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:36,201
I haven't had time

247
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,242
to report to you yet.

248
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:38,762
You've really

249
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:41,282
put me in a difficult position.

250
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:42,801
Hold on. What happened?

251
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:44,242
Why would he

252
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,561
suddenly bring this up to you?

253
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,201
Nothing has even started yet.

254
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:48,841
He wanted to withdraw himself?

255
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,362
Can we pause the collaboration

256
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:51,522
with Jiang Hongbin for now?

257
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,801
Is that possible?

258
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:57,602
But, you have to tell me

259
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,841
what is going on.

260
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:02,002
I need to check on a few things first,

261
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:03,961
and settle something

262
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,642
before I explain everything to you.

263
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:20,362
Sorry.

264
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,242
The person you call is unavailable.

265
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,162
Xiang Zhong,

266
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:31,242
is there anything

267
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:32,801
happens in your family?

268
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:44,961
Please have your seat first.

269
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:48,162
Please wait a moment.

270
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:49,642
I'll get back to you in half an hour.

271
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:53,482
(Law Firm)
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:54,602
A client came in unexpectedly.

273
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:56,041
I apologize

274
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,321
for bothering you lately.

275
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:58,162
It's my job.

276
00:13:58,282 --> 00:13:58,921
What can I help you with?

277
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,841
I want to consult you.

278
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:04,441
If someone bribes

279
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:05,961
a government official,

280
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:07,081
how will the sentence be determined?

281
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:08,841
How much was involved?

282
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,321
Around 200,000 yuan.

283
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,841
If there's clear evidence,

284
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,162
the sentence should be
no more than three years.

285
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:16,081
However,

286
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,321
with a good confession,

287
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,041
the sentence

288
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:20,122
may be reduced accordingly.

289
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:37,041
Dad!

290
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:39,721
Why didn't you go home?

291
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:41,162
Oh!

292
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:42,482
I made this

293
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:43,561
for you.

294
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:46,041
Your favorite stir-fried eels

295
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:47,201
and water-shield soup.

296
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:48,841
That's great

297
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:49,642
that you're back!

298
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:53,282
Where's Xiang Nan?

299
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:54,402
Xiang Nan?

300
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,841
Xiang Zhong took her downstairs

301
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,602
to the convenience store.

302
00:14:59,201 --> 00:14:59,921
Great.

303
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:00,721
After

304
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:01,882
having the meal,

305
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:03,201
you should go get some rest too.

306
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:08,321
You must be tired.

307
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:11,681
Eat more.

308
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:17,081
Look,

309
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:19,882
back then,

310
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:21,841
this amount of rice

311
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:23,482
was just enough

312
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:24,441
for Xiang Nan.

313
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,242
But now,

314
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,482
she's barely touched it.

315
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:31,561
Xiang Qian,

316
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,201
we can't keep leaving

317
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:35,602
Xiang Nan's matter unresolved.

318
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:37,561
As long as this is not settled,

319
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,242
I can't be at ease.

320
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,402
Xiang Nan will suffer too.

321
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,041
She was always thin,

322
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,282
and she's getting even thinner.

323
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:49,522
I know.

324
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:52,921
As the eldest daughter

325
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,201
and the eldest sister,

326
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,762
you have to protect your sister.

327
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,441
I need to clear

328
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,002
some things up first for now.

329
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:10,961
Only then

330
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,882
I can figure out the best way

331
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,321
to help Xiang Nan

332
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,002
with her divorce.

333
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:19,242
Okay?

334
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:20,681
I'll do it as soon as possible.

335
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:30,882
Sorry for making you trouble.

336
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:33,961
Eat well.

337
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:09,081
(Xiang Zhong: How's it going?)

338
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:11,882
(Xiang Qian: It's complicated
as it involves Chai Jin now.)

339
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,842
(Give me some time to figure it out.)

340
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,042
(Xiang Zhong: Contact me
anytime if needed.)

341
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:30,882
Qian Feng!

342
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:33,481
Mrs. Deng.

343
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,241
Xiang...

344
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,362
Why are you here?

345
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,602
I wanted to tell you over the phone,

346
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:40,082
but after thinking it over,

347
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,402
I think it would be better
to tell you in person.

348
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:44,162
What's going on? Come over here.

349
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,281
Haiyang's mother's condition
hasn't improved.

350
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,521
She's in a wheelchair now,

351
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:55,241
and she doesn't really
recognize people now.

352
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:57,441
Her personality became a bit

353
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:58,721
weird.

354
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:01,201
Mrs. Deng,

355
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:04,162
Haiyang

356
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:06,602
is ready

357
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:09,241
to start over a new life with you.

358
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:10,956
He's reviewed

359
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:12,157
the messages you sent

360
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,236
multiple times.

361
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:14,761
He even found a job

362
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,481
in Shanghai

363
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:16,961
with a 500,000 yuan annual salary.

364
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,322
He knows you love Shanghai.

365
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:21,042
So, he tried his best

366
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,241
to make a home for you

367
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:23,362
in Shanghai.

368
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,362
Even though he couldn't
afford a home by now,

369
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:27,082
he said he would

370
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:28,642
rent a decent home for you.

371
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:30,162
But then,

372
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,322
no one expects

373
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:36,001
that his mother falls ill
at this very moment.

374
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:37,481
Hold on, Qian Feng.

375
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:38,721
None of this means

376
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:39,721
anything to me anymore.

377
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:40,562
Can you understand?

378
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,241
I have to let you know.

379
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:46,921
Haiyang made you angry deliberately

380
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,001
to make you leave.

381
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,602
He didn't want you

382
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:52,201
to take care of his mother with him.

383
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:54,042
He also didn't want

384
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:56,042
to let you bear such a heavy burden.

385
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:58,082
He said this is just

386
00:18:58,162 --> 00:18:59,201
too unfair to you.

387
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:01,602
He is sincere

388
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,201
and wanted to make up with you.

389
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:05,921
But, things didn't go as planned.

390
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:08,402
Seeing my brother like that

391
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:12,082
all these while

392
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:14,521
really upsets me.

393
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:17,241
Mrs. Deng,

394
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:19,961
he must be

395
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:21,882
in great distress now.

396
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:26,001
He forced you away

397
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,441
out of his love for you.

398
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,802
What are you doing here?

399
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:50,921
I'm waiting for you.

400
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:53,642
Didn't you say yesterday

401
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,241
you'd explain why

402
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:58,642
we should pause the collaboration

403
00:19:58,681 --> 00:19:59,362
with Jiang Hongbin?

404
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,162
Xiang Nan wants a divorce from him.

405
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:06,281
What happened?

406
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,001
Does Jiang Hongbin have

407
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:11,042
an affair outside?

408
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:15,802
Then, that's domestic violence.

409
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,082
A form of it,

410
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:20,921
but worse.

411
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:23,721
There's a term for it nowadays,

412
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:24,842
marital rape.

413
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,402
Even without that,

414
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:29,562
Xiang Nan won't

415
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,681
stay with him until the end.

416
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:32,602
The initial purpose of Jiang Hongbin

417
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:33,761
marrying Xiang Nan

418
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,681
was to keep her

419
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:37,122
at home

420
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,681
as his obedient wife,

421
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,642
playing the role of Mrs. Jiang,

422
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,281
accompanying him to events,

423
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:43,802
and doing whatever he requested.

424
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:45,921
But, how could it be possible?

425
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:47,241
Xiang Nan is an artistic person

426
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,281
who pursues freedom.

427
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:52,481
At the beginning

428
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:53,481
of their marriage,

429
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,082
he was subtle,

430
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:56,721
and even supportive of Xiang Nan

431
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:57,842
going out to work.

432
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:58,882
But, behind her back,

433
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:00,082
he plays a lot of tricks

434
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,521
to force Xiang Nan home.

435
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:04,201
He's been shady.

436
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,001
Maybe he couldn't tolerate it anymore.

437
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:09,402
So, he revealed his true colors

438
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:10,882
and started getting physical.

439
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:12,521
I understand now.

440
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:15,642
So, what did he say?

441
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,001
I went to his company yesterday

442
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,122
because of Xiang Nan's matter.

443
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:21,602
It ended up that he asked me

444
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:23,882
to come back asking you about that.

445
00:21:24,882 --> 00:21:26,281
It comes to my senses later.

446
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:28,281
If Xiang Nan insists

447
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:29,602
on a divorce,

448
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:32,642
he's going to report you.

449
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,681
Let him go ahead.

450
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:40,909
Boss,

451
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,001
the person you bribed

452
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,481
is a government official.

453
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:46,162
I consulted

454
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:46,882
Attorney Wu regarding this already.

455
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:48,802
If the evidence is solid,

456
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,322
the sentence will be no more than
three years for a 200,000 yuan bribe.

457
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:52,481
With a good attitude,

458
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:54,761
it may be less.

459
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:58,082
Even without Xiang Nan's matter,

460
00:21:58,481 --> 00:21:59,921
there's something amiss about our
collaboration with Jiang Hongbin.

461
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,082
He has plenty of social resources,

462
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:04,362
but why did he
make you manage the things?

463
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:05,842
Isn't it obvious

464
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:07,082
he's setting you up?

465
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:08,721
Even a fool knows this.

466
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:10,761
Then, why did you still do that?

467
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:12,602
If I don't, how is that possible for us

468
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:14,042
to obtain those two big projects?

469
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:16,562
You know that the two projects

470
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:17,961
are crucial

471
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:18,882
for our new company.

472
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:19,362
Am I right?

473
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:20,001
Besides, this includes

474
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:21,082
your favorite

475
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:22,402
elderly care sector.

476
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,042
So I thought,

477
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:25,721
even if it's risky,

478
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,162
it's worth the shot.

479
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:28,842
Plus,

480
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,642
Jiang Hongbin is your brother-in-law.

481
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,001
I thought it would be fine

482
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:34,802
as you're a family.

483
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,562
Who would've thought
that he'd be this wicked?

484
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,201
Alright.

485
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,642
Since it's come to this,

486
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:49,441
there's no point dwelling on it.

487
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:50,521
You

488
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:53,001
should relax for now,

489
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:54,122
and don't think too much of it.

490
00:22:58,201 --> 00:22:58,921
Relax.

491
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:01,761
If Jiang Hongbin

492
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,402
takes this

493
00:23:04,402 --> 00:23:05,441
to blackmail us,

494
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:07,681
we won't back down.

495
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:09,241
Let's go against him.

496
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:11,402
After all, he's a wise businessperson.

497
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:12,122
Right?

498
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,402
For this matter,

499
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:15,082
he'll weigh his options,

500
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:16,602
and if he goes through with it,

501
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:18,402
he stands to lose much more than we do.

502
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:20,042
Am I right?

503
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,162
How can there not be any pressure?

504
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:02,521
Here.

505
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:04,562
Okay.

506
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,441
Deng Haiyang.

507
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:07,882
What happened?

508
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,602
My mum won't let me touch her now.

509
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:11,882
She throws things if I do.

510
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:16,201
Why is her clothes...

511
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,281
You

512
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:18,521
are usually messy enough,

513
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:20,042
but couldn't you put some
clean clothes on her?

514
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:24,042
I...

515
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,642
I wanted to clean for her, but...

516
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,842
Fine, get a basin of warm water

517
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,842
and bring her some clean clothes.

518
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:35,481
Alright.

519
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:44,322
Do you recognize me?

520
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:49,322
Don't be afraid.

521
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:50,201
Later,

522
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,201
let's wipe you down

523
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,122
and change into clean clothes,

524
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:54,241
so you'll feel more comfortable.

525
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:57,362
Keep your feet covered,

526
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:58,281
so you don't catch a cold.

527
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:06,402
Be good. Everything will be fine.

528
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:08,402
Give it to me.

529
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,281
Here you go.

530
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:14,602
Stay aside

531
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:15,921
and wait me out there.

532
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:16,521
Alright.

533
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:17,322
I'll call you when I'm done.

534
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:27,802
Deng Haiyang,

535
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:28,602
this towel

536
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:29,521
is too rough.

537
00:25:30,122 --> 00:25:31,362
I'll bring a couple from home next time.

538
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:38,122
Let's clean you up, okay?

539
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:40,441
Don't be afraid.

540
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:42,921
You're such a neat lady.

541
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:44,642
You should keep

542
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:45,921
clean and neat

543
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:47,562
to look presentable, right?

544
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:08,761
Is she your wife?

545
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:09,961
She's so nice.

546
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:14,322
Ex-wife.

547
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:15,562
Ex-wife.

548
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:17,921
She's such a great woman.

549
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,122
Hurry up and win her back.

550
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,201
It's not appropriate
to discuss others like this!

551
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:32,562
Here,

552
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:34,761
arm up.

553
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:37,322
Let's get you into

554
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:41,761
clean clothes

555
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,322
and you'll feel better.

556
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:45,201
Here, put your arm in.

557
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:46,681
That's right. This arm.

558
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,122
The sleeve is here.

559
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:49,882
Yeah, put your arm in.

560
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:52,241
That's great!

561
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:53,921
You'll feel better now.

562
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:54,642
Right?

563
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:57,481
She's done changing the clothes.

564
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:02,162
(Outpatient Clinic)
Since it's gotten to this point,

565
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:03,842
why don't you hire a nurse?

566
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:05,001
I did.

567
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:07,961
She can't stop my mum

568
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:09,162
from smashing things every day.

569
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,322
- That's true.
- Then, she can't handle this.

570
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:14,162
She's had a strong
personality all her life.

571
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:15,447
Anyone would find this hard.

572
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:18,842
And, next time,

573
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,042
you can just tell me the real situation.

574
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:21,122
I'll decide on my own

575
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:21,842
whether I want to come or not.

576
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:27,281
I'm here today

577
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,521
helping your mum change her clothes

578
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:29,281
doesn't mean I'm here

579
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:30,122
to be a saint,

580
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:31,201
nor does it mean

581
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:32,921
I forgive her for everything before.

582
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,441
I just think

583
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,122
that everyone

584
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:38,402
deserves dignity,

585
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:39,322
especially when they're old and sick.

586
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:42,241
I understand.

587
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,921
Also,

588
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:46,681
don't go to Shanghai

589
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:48,042
just for me.

590
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:49,721
Make sure you love that job.

591
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:51,921
I know.

592
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:54,322
Going to Shanghai

593
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:56,042
isn't entirely about you.

594
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:57,521
You know?

595
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,241
This is

596
00:28:58,521 --> 00:28:59,602
my first official job

597
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:01,082
as a smell specialist.

598
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:02,602
At the interview the other day,

599
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:03,642
there were dozens of people.

600
00:29:04,082 --> 00:29:05,761
But, I was the only one

601
00:29:05,802 --> 00:29:07,042
who could identify
over 20 different scents.

602
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:08,281
I was...

603
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:09,681
I felt very proud of myself

604
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:11,761
that day.

605
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:15,402
Another reason for having the job

606
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:18,122
is that it pays well.

607
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:20,481
So, I thought

608
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:23,042
I'd save up a bit,

609
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,322
to get my mum

610
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:26,362
into a

611
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:27,362
better

612
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:29,281
rehabilitation hospital.

613
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:30,961
I hope

614
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:35,842
everything will get better gradually.

615
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,521
Everything will get better.

616
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:40,602
It will.

617
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:41,842
Everything will get better.

618
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:45,322
And also,

619
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:47,642
I have to thank you.

620
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:50,362
For what?

621
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,921
Thank you for helping me

622
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:54,241
become someone

623
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,761
I admire too.

624
00:29:58,602 --> 00:29:59,761
By the way,

625
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:01,761
if there's something you need,

626
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,602
don't let Qian Feng

627
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:04,721
to pass the message.

628
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:05,802
This is so tiring,

629
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:06,921
and he couldn't keep the secrets.

630
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:08,241
Absolutely. He can't keep things.

631
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:09,322
I tell you,

632
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:10,281
next time,

633
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,642
if he wants to say something,

634
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:12,721
don't let him say it.

635
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:14,402
He'll burst from holding it in.

636
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,001
Alright, I get to go.

637
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:17,921
Take food care of your mum.

638
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:18,521
Alright.

639
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:26,882
It's our dad.

640
00:30:27,562 --> 00:30:29,281
He insisted on asking me
what you're eating.

641
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:33,681
There are so many dishes.

642
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:34,921
How could I finish it all?

643
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:36,362
Eat up.

644
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,402
Have some fish.

645
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:51,122
Madam,

646
00:30:52,082 --> 00:30:53,201
could you come to the hospital?

647
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,602
Miss... she's in a bad state.

648
00:30:55,642 --> 00:30:56,241
What happened to her?

649
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,441
She cut her wrist,

650
00:30:58,721 --> 00:30:59,642
and lost a lot of blood.

651
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:02,681
Alright.

652
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,201
I understand.

653
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:07,481
What's wrong?

654
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:08,721
Ms. He called and said

655
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:10,241
Jiaqiao cut her wrist

656
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,402
and lost a lot of blood.

657
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,721
She's in the hospital.

658
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:17,241
I... I have to go.

659
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:19,562
Xiang Nan!

660
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:22,241
Are you sure you want to go?

661
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,120
(Emergency Treatment)

662
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:30,642
Ms. He.

663
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:32,481
Madam.

664
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:33,602
How is she?

665
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:35,001
She's stable now.

666
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,001
Is Jiang Hongbin here?

667
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,001
No, he's not.

668
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,441
He's in a meeting.

669
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:45,122
Qian, I'll go see her.

670
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:45,642
Alright.

671
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:56,842
Did I wake you up?

672
00:31:58,441 --> 00:31:59,562
You're here.

673
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:02,481
Why would you do this to yourself?

674
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:07,721
Xiang Nan,

675
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:12,322
Lv Liang

676
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:16,001
doesn't want me anymore.

677
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:20,761
He broke up with me.

678
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:28,241
But, you can't

679
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:29,921
hurt yourself because of this.

680
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,241
Then,

681
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:40,842
who can I hurt?

682
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:44,241
My brother went out of his way

683
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:45,441
to force him away.

684
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,042
I can't blame him.

685
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:48,842
I'm the one who ruined him.

686
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:55,882
I've never realized

687
00:32:57,281 --> 00:32:58,082
that my brother...

688
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:02,042
My brother knew about

689
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,201
Lv Liang and I

690
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:09,562
were dating each other secretly.

691
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:16,802
Why do I have

692
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:19,402
a brother like him?

693
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:22,441
I...

694
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:24,241
I...

695
00:33:24,642 --> 00:33:26,001
Why can't my brother

696
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:29,802
be like everyone else's?

697
00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:41,402
I know.

698
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,001
I can't blame anyone.

699
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:47,882
This is just my punishment,

700
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:48,721
Xiang Nan.

701
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,082
A punishment for me.

702
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,322
Stop talking about that.

703
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:52,961
You're talking nonsense.

704
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:55,842
This isn't your fault.

705
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,402
I'm sorry.

706
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:12,681
No one will ever love me again.

707
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:17,841
No one.

708
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,162
With or without someone's love,

709
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,562
you need to love yourself first.

710
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:27,721
Do you know that?

711
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:34,361
Xiang Nan.

712
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:40,681
Xiang Nan.

713
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:41,401
Alright.

714
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,642
Don't think about anything for now.

715
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,002
Focus on getting better.

716
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:57,801
Let me wipe your tears.

717
00:35:12,962 --> 00:35:13,681
How is she?

718
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:15,962
She broke up with Lv Liang,

719
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:18,721
and it's forced by Jiang Hongbin too.

720
00:35:20,122 --> 00:35:21,281
When I was with her just now,

721
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:22,201
she's not in a good state

722
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,201
and very pale.

723
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:25,201
She's finally managed to fall asleep.

724
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:26,401
Alright.

725
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,442
I'll call Lv Liang now

726
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:28,241
and ask him about this.

727
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:29,082
Alright.

728
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:36,401
Lv Liang,

729
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:38,281
did you hear

730
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:39,122
about Jiaqiao?

731
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,442
How is she now?

732
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:44,002
Not good.

733
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:45,122
She's very weak.

734
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:47,401
Could you come by and see her?

735
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:50,321
I...

736
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,162
I can't make it right now.

737
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,122
I'm sorry.

738
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:56,002
Lv Liang, you're going too far!

739
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,042
Even if you broke up,

740
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:58,562
you could at least visit her now.

741
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:00,522
I'm sorry, I...

742
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:01,401
I still have

743
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:02,361
some things to settle now.

744
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:04,522
Listen to me.

745
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,602
You can't just abandon her like this.

746
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:07,962
Just come by and see her,

747
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,042
is that so difficult for you?

748
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,522
No matter how,

749
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:11,881
she's been sincere to you.

750
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:14,482
Xiang Nan,

751
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:16,002
I really can't make it right now.

752
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,042
My property

753
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:20,962
is about to be auctioned.

754
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:22,602
What do you mean?

755
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:24,562
I used my house as collateral

756
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,281
to start a business with Jiaqiao.

757
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:28,881
Everything was fine at first,

758
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:30,681
but then the funds were cut off,

759
00:36:30,962 --> 00:36:32,562
and clients started canceling orders.

760
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,642
Jiang Hongbin ruined me badly.

761
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,162
Xiang Nan,

762
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:41,922
please tell Jiaqiao

763
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,281
to forget about me.

764
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:48,281
I have nothing left now

765
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:50,482
and am not worth waiting for.

766
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:03,922
What did Lv Liang say?

767
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,042
He's in a miserable state now.

768
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:11,401
His company went bankrupt,

769
00:37:12,002 --> 00:37:13,482
and now he's selling his house.

770
00:37:14,642 --> 00:37:16,321
It's all because of Jiang Hongbin.

771
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,201
Let's go home.

772
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:22,361
Otherwise, we'll run
into Jiang Hongbin here.

773
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:22,841
Let's go.

774
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:37,721
Dad.

775
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:40,562
I made some

776
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:41,841
of Xiang Nan's favorite food.

777
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:42,962
Where's Xiang Nan?

778
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:44,922
She's taking a bath.

779
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,801
How is she feeling?

780
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:53,602
She's quite okay.

781
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:56,241
Xiang Qian,

782
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:57,642
why is there no progress

783
00:37:57,681 --> 00:37:59,321
with Xiang Nan's matter?

784
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:01,122
When will you send

785
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,122
Jiang Hongbin the legal letter?

786
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:03,602
Haven't you

787
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:04,522
and Chai Jin

788
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:05,642
figured this out yet?

789
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,042
It's not that simple.

790
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:10,721
I understand

791
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:12,562
this puts you in
a very difficult position.

792
00:38:12,801 --> 00:38:14,241
When you're just starting
out in the workplace,

793
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,401
Chai Jin has been
well taken care of you.

794
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,442
He treats Cong, Qi,

795
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:19,241
and our family

796
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:20,881
very nicely.

797
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:22,602
I'm not ungrateful,

798
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:23,922
but Xiang Qian,

799
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:26,201
Xiang Nan is your sister.

800
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:28,122
What's the issue

801
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:29,321
with Chai Jin now?

802
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:30,922
Is this matter really hard to handle?

803
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:33,002
This matter can't be delayed any longer.

804
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:34,401
I've already told you,

805
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:35,602
it's not that easy.

806
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,442
Divorce is hard enough for anyone,

807
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,281
let alone Xiang Nan

808
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:39,841
dealing with Jiang Hongbin.

809
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:44,721
We have some business dealings

810
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,562
with Jiang Hongbin right now.

811
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:48,042
Chai Jin has a vulnerability

812
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,082
in his hands.

813
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,841
If Xiang Nan files

814
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:51,922
for a divorce now,

815
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:53,401
he's definitely going

816
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:54,522
to report Chai Jin.

817
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:57,442
I understand now.

818
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:00,082
So, to protect Chai Jin,

819
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:01,881
you're abandoning Xiang Nan?

820
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:03,881
I never meant to abandon her,

821
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:05,841
but don't force me into this, okay?

822
00:39:06,002 --> 00:39:06,881
I have Xiang Nan on one side,

823
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:07,681
and Chai Jin on the other.

824
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,122
How am I supposed to choose?

825
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:11,321
Fine, fine.

826
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:13,442
I won't make you the bad guy.

827
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,602
I'll go talk to Chai Jin,

828
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:15,241
okay?

829
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:16,562
And what would you say to him?

830
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,201
I...

831
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:18,281
For the sake of your sister,

832
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,962
I'll do whatever he wants me to do.

833
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:20,642
Is that good?

834
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:22,681
It's not such a simple matter.

835
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:24,201
I know how to handle it.

836
00:39:25,522 --> 00:39:27,082
You know how to handle it?

837
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:28,761
We can't keep putting

838
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,082
this off any longer.

839
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,002
Xiang Qian,

840
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:31,962
you see

841
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:34,002
Jiang Hongbin isn't
facing any consequences,

842
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,281
and your sister can't get a divorce.

843
00:39:35,482 --> 00:39:36,241
Are we just going

844
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:37,401
to stand aside

845
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:38,522
and watch her suffer?

846
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:41,401
Could you keep your voice down?

847
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:44,201
Are you worried
that Xiang Nan can't hear you?

848
00:39:47,962 --> 00:39:49,281
None of you need to worry about this.

849
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,122
I've figured out how to handle it.

850
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:54,801
I'll settle this tomorrow.

851
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:55,881
Is that okay?

852
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:01,801
I can't bear

853
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:04,761
to see your sister being mistreated.

854
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:10,162
Don't sit in that chair.

855
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:12,642
It's a kid's chair.

856
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:14,042
You'll end up falling.

857
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:29,562
How's the food?

858
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:32,642
Wait and eat with your sister.

859
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:33,642
I'm hungry!

860
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:36,562
Eat then.

861
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:39,881
How scary!

862
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:02,881
(Qianjin Internet of Things)
For the breakthrough point

863
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:03,841
of Qianjin Internet of Things,

864
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:05,162
I thought it over,
and it's actually simple.

865
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:06,801
It depends on how we

866
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,841
offer proactive services

867
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:11,082
in the future.

868
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:12,522
So,

869
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:13,962
growth opportunities and challenges

870
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:15,602
are the outcome

871
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:16,241
of everyone's joint efforts.

872
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:48,241
Okay?

873
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:49,042
I'll hand it over to Liu now.

874
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:50,082
Come here

875
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,761
and present this to everyone.

876
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:52,361
Alright.

877
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:54,562
As Mr. Chai mentioned,

878
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:56,162
in Qianjin

879
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:57,642
Internet of Things,

880
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,401
our smart home networking

881
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:00,761
is divided into two parts.

882
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,442
One involves
artificial intelligence technology,

883
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:04,082
which gives the system
independent decision-making ability,

884
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,241
and the other

885
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,602
involves implementing technical devices.

886
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:16,841
(Chai Jin: What's wrong?)

887
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:19,482
(Why are you looking
at me so affectionately?)

888
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:25,401
(Xiang Qian: Why? Can't I look at you?)

889
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:29,602
(Chai Jin: Enjoy all you want.)

890
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:48,642
(Xiang Qian: Have you eaten?)

891
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:50,522
(Let's go and have something together.)

892
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:53,642
