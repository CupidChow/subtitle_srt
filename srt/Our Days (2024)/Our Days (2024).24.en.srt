00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 24=

4
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,202
Please come out with me.

5
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:50,643
Ms. Xiang Qian,

6
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:53,482
please come outside with me.

7
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:15,842
What do you mean by that?

8
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:18,122
You are bullying her.

9
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,923
I bully her?

10
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:22,232
She came to my office suddenly

11
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,763
and scolded me,

12
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,151
and last night

13
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,483
you criticized me too.

14
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,803
I didn't write any anonymous letter.

15
00:02:28,912 --> 00:02:29,552
I didn't do it,

16
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:30,952
so I have to get to the bottom of this.

17
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:31,952
Is this your attitude

18
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:32,751
of clarifying things?

19
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,363
You're just trying
to set a trap for her.

20
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:37,243
Alright.

21
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,352
If you have any proof

22
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:42,282
that I wrote the anonymous letter,

23
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,803
I'll take full responsibility.

24
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,203
But, what if it was not me?

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,471
Under the condition

26
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:48,352
of you not having any proof,

27
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:49,803
you randomly

28
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:51,352
accused me, slandered me,

29
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:52,151
and hurt me.

30
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:53,923
Don't you have to take responsibility?

31
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:55,722
Fine.

32
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,043
So, what do you plan to do?

33
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,803
Sue her?

34
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,643
She's lost everything.

35
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,162
Do you have to kick her when she's down?

36
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,751
Don't you have

37
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,043
any basic kindness left?

38
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:14,191
What unkind thing

39
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,882
did I do?

40
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:19,523
Do I deserve this slander and harm?

41
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:23,471
At least...

42
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:24,552
At least you haven't suffered

43
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:25,952
any big losses, right?

44
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,043
What do you want me to lose then?

45
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:31,323
Fine,

46
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,043
you want to sue, right?

47
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,162
Sue me too.

48
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,363
If you feel I've accused you,

49
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,083
or I've slandered you,

50
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,431
take your phone out now, record my words,

51
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,083
and use this recording to sue me.

52
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:59,203
Record it now.

53
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:00,631
Gao Ping,

54
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,323
I'm still your wife.

55
00:04:03,673 --> 00:04:04,631
Something like this happens,

56
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:07,002
instead of supporting me,

57
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,122
you're defending an outsider.

58
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:10,363
Do you think it's appropriate?

59
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:12,363
I'm not defending anyone.

60
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,043
I just care about right and wrong.

61
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:18,002
Go ahead with the recording.

62
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,002
I, Gao Ping,

63
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,391
last night, when I didn't
have any evidence,

64
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:50,112
I asked Ms. Xiang Qian

65
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:51,871
why she'd write an anonymous letter

66
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:53,442
to frame Li Shu.

67
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,483
Are you satisfied?

68
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:25,442
Get ready for the meeting.

69
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:27,603
What's wrong with you?

70
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:28,923
My stomach hurts.

71
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:30,562
Are you okay?

72
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,122
I'll take some medicine for now.

73
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,552
Why does it hurt so much?

74
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:36,603
Are you okay?

75
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,483
Should we go to the hospital?

76
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,322
No, I'll take some medicine first.

77
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:43,723
Yuanyuan!

78
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:44,472
Yuanyuan!

79
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:45,163
Come.

80
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:45,951
What's up?

81
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:46,631
Later, you help

82
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:47,871
to present the project to the clients.

83
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:49,043
I'll take Xiang Qian to the hospital.

84
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:50,442
Alright.

85
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,923
Don't be stubborn. Let's go.

86
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:54,723
Let's go.

87
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,243
Why are you wearing the high heels?

88
00:06:58,432 --> 00:06:59,511
What is the purpose?

89
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:00,442
Did you go on a date?

90
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:01,511
No,

91
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:03,112
I was just trying
to scare someone this morning.

92
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:04,442
Scare someone?

93
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:20,483
So, do you feel upset for me?

94
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:21,762
Of course, I do.

95
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:23,032
Let's go get some good food.

96
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:23,923
Alright, we go now.

97
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,803
I don't want to go now.
My head still hurts.

98
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:28,951
Let's go home then.

99
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:30,043
I'll cook for you later.

100
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,682
How are you feeling?

101
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:43,283
Much better now.

102
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:45,603
It was a stomach spasm.

103
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:56,352
If you're sick and need to go
to the hospital,

104
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:57,923
you can just tell me directly.

105
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,122
You don't have to let Chai Jin call me.

106
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:05,152
My own wife is sick,

107
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,843
and I had to hear it from another man.

108
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,363
What do you think
people would say about me?

109
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,112
Why do you care so much

110
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,963
about what others think?

111
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,552
Yes, I care a lot.

112
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:22,511
I told you before,

113
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:25,442
I don't like people
gossiping behind my back.

114
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:27,631
And, I don't like you

115
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,232
using others to put pressure on me.

116
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:30,032
You come to the hospital,

117
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:30,792
I come to see you.

118
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,682
Isn't that normal?

119
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:35,202
So, you think

120
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:38,992
I asked Chai Jin to call you

121
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,683
and force you to come here?

122
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:45,002
Stop it there.

123
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,042
I didn't come here to argue.

124
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,402
If you are willing,

125
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:55,963
you can stay here as my family

126
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:57,882
and keep me company,

127
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,323
or go pick up the kids.

128
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:03,723
If you're not willing,

129
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,963
you can leave right now.

130
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,122
You don't have to stay here.

131
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,802
I go pick up the kids.

132
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,282
You have such a serious stomach pain.

133
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:07,352
Who's giving you

134
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:08,843
so much mental pressure?

135
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:12,083
Could it be Dr. Gao again?

136
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:18,802
What's going on
with you and Gao Ping?

137
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,112
A few days ago, a lady

138
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:22,483
came looking for you at the office.

139
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:24,603
Does she have something to do with him?

140
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,443
Are they having an affair?

141
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:33,922
Xiang Qian,

142
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:36,112
we've been friends for so many years.

143
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,443
There's no need for you
to hide this from me.

144
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,402
I

145
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:44,642
haven't found any solid proof.

146
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:45,832
I asked Gao Ping,

147
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,952
but he won't admit it.

148
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:49,563
He says I'm overly suspicious, sensitive,

149
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:51,882
and giving him too much pressure.

150
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:54,563
Overly suspicious?

151
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,483
Do you seem like a resentful wife?

152
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:57,723
Am I?

153
00:10:58,672 --> 00:10:59,922
Maybe.

154
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:02,203
Don't worry.

155
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,002
I'll find someone
to help you check it out.

156
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,323
No need.

157
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,963
Let him finish his thesis defense first.

158
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:12,151
Don't bring this up with me now.

159
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:14,203
Speaking of this makes my stomach hurt.

160
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,712
At this moment, Rainbow Dove's dad

161
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:24,751
seemed to suddenly lose his temper,

162
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,151
charging towards Rainbow Dove

163
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,522
and pressing his entire body
against his son.

164
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:30,271
Rainbow Dove was startled

165
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,791
by the sudden attack,

166
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,911
and accidentally

167
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:34,271
slipped off the wall.

168
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:35,751
But, at the very moment of his fall,

169
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:36,911
Rainbow Dove's wings

170
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,511
spread out, and he flew up.

171
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,791
He flew up!

172
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,042
Amazing!

173
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:43,882
He flew up!

174
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,112
Cong, Qi.

175
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:48,352
Mum, mum.

176
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,671
You're back!

177
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:52,832
Dad is telling us a story.

178
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,352
Yeah,

179
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:55,522
dad's storytelling is great!

180
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:56,882
You're back.

181
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:02,271
You probably can't imagine

182
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:05,671
how excited and thrilled I was,

183
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:06,551
watching all of this from the side.

184
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:08,282
Li Shu has done her abortion,

185
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,232
and I took the opportunity

186
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,723
to do a paternity test.

187
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:13,751
That child has no

188
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:15,122
biological connection to me.

189
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,042
Regarding this matter
between me and Li Shu,

190
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:21,443
this is the last time I'm explaining this.

191
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,002
What is your intention?

192
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:31,631
Are we going to stay separated

193
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:32,603
like this forever?

194
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:37,922
It's pointless

195
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:40,802
to keep dragging things out between us.

196
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:44,402
What do you mean by that?

197
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,642
Are you suggesting a divorce?

198
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:03,282
So, you are...

199
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:06,083
You're waiting for me to say it?

200
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,203
Yes,

201
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,882
because I'm not in a position to say it.

202
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:10,352
Still scrolling on your phone.

203
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:11,751
Here's some milk for you.
Drink it and go to sleep.

204
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:12,762
Alright.

205
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,603
Stop scrolling on it.

206
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,232
What are you reading?

207
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,323
Read this.

208
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,312
(A commuting woman found dead after going missing
post-work, rideshare driver now under suspicion.)

209
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:23,363
Lost contact.

210
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:25,843
This is terrifying.

211
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:27,203
Why are you reading this?

212
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:33,122
Call Xiang Zhong now.

213
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:34,992
Don't overreact to it, and scare her.

214
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:35,791
I'm not overreacting.

215
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,323
She works late.

216
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:39,282
Call her now.

217
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,232
Don't simply believe the rumors.

218
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:41,192
What does this have
to do with Xiang Zhong?

219
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:42,802
Are you going to call her or not?

220
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:43,432
You...

221
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,083
If you make a call, Xiang Zhong...

222
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,031
I dialed Xiang Qian by mistake.

223
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,162
Don't say anything.

224
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:58,603
Hello, the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

225
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:00,323
Something's wrong.

226
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,432
What's wrong?

227
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:03,483
Why...

228
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,551
Why can't we reach her?

229
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:05,922
You try to listen to it.

230
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:10,802
Hello, the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

231
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:13,031
What's going on?

232
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:13,843
I have no idea.

233
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:18,122
This...

234
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,551
Let's stop guessing. We should hurry up.

235
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:21,592
We need to go check on her.

236
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:22,192
My shoes.

237
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:23,031
I'll get them for you.

238
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:23,751
My shoes.

239
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:25,402
Don't rush.

240
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:30,083
Xiang!

241
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:30,751
It's late now.

242
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:31,791
Where are you going?

243
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,402
I'll explain when I get back later.

244
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:46,271
Xiang Zhong.

245
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,203
Xiang Zhong.

246
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:51,642
Xiang Zhong.

247
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:53,911
Stop knocking.

248
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,002
Call her again.

249
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:56,511
Try calling Xiang Zhong again.

250
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:57,282
I tell you,

251
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:59,042
we need to make a police report now.

252
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,112
Make a police report?

253
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:00,671
She's missing.

254
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,042
Other than making a report,
what else can we do?

255
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,042
Make...

256
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,791
But it hasn't been 24 hours yet.

257
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,551
They...

258
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:07,363
They might not even file a report.

259
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,282
Oh yeah!

260
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:09,432
Doesn't Haiyang have a childhood friend

261
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:10,562
who's a cop?

262
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,672
Call him.

263
00:17:11,673 --> 00:17:12,762
Haiyang...

264
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,842
But they're already divorced,
does it matter?

265
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:16,472
She's already missing!

266
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:17,791
Nothing else matters right now!

267
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,432
Just call him.

268
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,282
This...

269
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:21,683
You...

270
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,203
We're disturbing him.

271
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,192
That's fine.

272
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,203
He's here.

273
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:34,802
That's Haiyang's car.

274
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,443
Hurry up!

275
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:40,163
Haiyang.

276
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:43,791
Stay calm.

277
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:44,723
Here,

278
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,443
listen to me.

279
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:48,632
Here's the situation.

280
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,351
I had a friend

281
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:50,362
check the surveillance footage.

282
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:51,831
Xiang Zhong left

283
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,883
Huaqiao Subway Station at 10:10 PM,

284
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,602
but then she went back in.

285
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:57,351
We haven't seen her since.

286
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:58,802
That's all the information I obtained.

287
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:00,351
She went back in?

288
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:01,031
But...

289
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,192
The subway doesn't operate
anymore at this hour.

290
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:03,192
Where could she have gone?

291
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,152
Alright. No need for change.

292
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:05,392
Will anything happen to her?

293
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:06,152
You...

294
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,472
- What could happen?
- Don't worry.

295
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,192
Nothing will happen.

296
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:08,952
Both of you go back first.

297
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,031
I'll go check again.

298
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:11,152
No, Haiyang,

299
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:12,311
I'll go with you.

300
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:13,522
Dad, Mum!

301
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,123
You...

302
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,712
Why are you here?

303
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:17,672
What's going on?

304
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:18,672
Why aren't you answering your phone?

305
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,271
We were so worried!

306
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:21,282
Where have you been?

307
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,123
Why couldn't we reach you?

308
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,511
Oh, I...

309
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,511
I realized I lost my phone

310
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:26,912
after leaving the subway,

311
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:28,282
so I went back to look for it.

312
00:18:28,312 --> 00:18:29,311
Where's your phone then?

313
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:32,071
I was too tired
and fell asleep on the way.

314
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:32,952
I don't know where I lost it.

315
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:34,082
So you lost your phone?

316
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,111
If it's lost, just let it go. You are...

317
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:37,551
If it's lost,
just ignore it.

318
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:37,992
You...

319
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,802
I have to find it if it's lost.

320
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,872
Dad, Mum, don't worry.

321
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:43,912
As long as she's back safely,
that's what matters,

322
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:44,511
right?

323
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:45,243
Hold on.

324
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:46,562
Why are you still
calling them Dad and Mum?

325
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,511
We're divorced.

326
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,802
It's not appropriate.

327
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:49,872
But

328
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,111
Haiyang has been calling us
that way for so long.

329
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:51,831
He's used to it.

330
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:52,432
It takes time for him...

331
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,751
That's not the case.

332
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,031
We're already divorced.
He shouldn't call you that way.

333
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:55,632
He's used to it already.

334
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:56,483
It's been a very long time.

335
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,751
There are no outsiders here.

336
00:18:57,752 --> 00:18:58,472
He should change it.

337
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:00,152
But, you should give
him time to change it.

338
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:01,031
I can't tolerate it.

339
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:02,031
- Yeah, you're right.
- Let him change.

340
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:02,751
Yeah, you're right.

341
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:03,551
What makes you uncomfortable?

342
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:04,071
She's right.

343
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:06,311
Mum, don't worry. Oops...

344
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,163
It's fine.

345
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,163
My god.

346
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,082
Uncle, Auntie,

347
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,963
it's late now.

348
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,522
Let me take you home.

349
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:18,163
It's too dangerous to take a tricycle.

350
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:18,872
No, no need.

351
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:20,232
My dad and mum will stay here tonight.

352
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:20,791
No.

353
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,511
Wait, your mum and I

354
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,712
can go back by our tricycle.

355
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,392
It's late now. Let's go inside.

356
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:25,511
Deng Haiyang, what's wrong with you?

357
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,111
You overreacted,

358
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:26,923
and called my parents here.

359
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,672
It's us who called him.

360
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:30,511
We called him.

361
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,152
Haiyang, you take a good rest.

362
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:33,311
No problem. I will.

363
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:34,031
Be careful on the road.

364
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:34,632
Don't worry.

365
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,672
Sorry for the trouble.

366
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:36,511
No trouble at all.

367
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:37,992
You just watched too many dramas.

368
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:40,163
Stop watching all those things online.

369
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:41,152
What do you mean by that?

370
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:42,152
You should stop reading

371
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:43,392
all that nonsense online.

372
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:44,632
I can't go missing.

373
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:45,791
Take care.

374
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:46,562
Haiyang,

375
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:47,712
be safe on your way home.

376
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:48,392
Alright.

377
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:48,992
Alright, go in.

378
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,071
Why are you like this?

379
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,912
Why did you come out late at night?

380
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:52,511
If you come out at this late hour,

381
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:53,762
I couldn't relax as well.

382
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:56,683
Alright.

383
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,031
Listen, from now on,

384
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,802
don't involve Deng Haiyang
in my matters.

385
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:10,791
We...

386
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,712
We just

387
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:12,472
had no choice.

388
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:13,511
We were worried.

389
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,751
Well, no matter what,
don't call him again.

390
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:15,232
What's the matter?

391
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:15,831
I'm an adult.

392
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:16,831
I'm not going to go missing.

393
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:17,643
You see...

394
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:20,762
You come home too late.

395
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,351
It's very dangerous.

396
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,232
Didn't you come across the news?

397
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,392
These days, young women

398
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:27,203
go missing after work.

399
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:29,551
By the time they're found,

400
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:30,912
it's often too late.

401
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:31,551
Alright, stop it.

402
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:32,831
Don't say things like that.

403
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:33,472
It's too grim.

404
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:34,632
Don't tell her that.

405
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,952
I'm just warning her to be cautious.

406
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:37,071
It will scare her,

407
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:38,082
and she'll be even more worried.

408
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,602
She'll be more vigilant then.

409
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:41,351
Alright, stop it!

410
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:42,392
I got it!

411
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:43,762
I'll be careful.

412
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:46,483
She thinks we're being too controlling.

413
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:48,511
It's just that we called Deng Haiyang,

414
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:49,643
and she wasn't happy.

415
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,163
That's right,
you shouldn't find Deng Haiyang.

416
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:52,672
Why are you just standing there?

417
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:53,591
Wash up and go to bed.

418
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:54,643
It’s late.

419
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:56,111
We’re not staying.

420
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:56,632
We're heading back.

421
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:57,271
We’re not staying here.

422
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:57,912
We just wanted to check on you

423
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:58,511
and make sure you’re safe.

424
00:20:58,512 --> 00:20:58,952
That's right.

425
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,602
Why leave? It’s already so late.

426
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:01,723
Alright.

427
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,842
Listen, after this,

428
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:04,192
you have to come home early after work,

429
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,723
and don't go out at night.

430
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:06,791
When you're at home,

431
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,762
make sure you lock the door properly.

432
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:10,042
Alright.

433
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,111
She was having an overtime.

434
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:11,872
She was busy,

435
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:12,923
and not going out to have fun.

436
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:14,632
Don't work overtime after this.

437
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:15,351
Alright, I won't do it anymore.

438
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:16,872
It's fine to let them cut the bonus.

439
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:18,192
Do you think she has a choice

440
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,591
to say no to working overtime?

441
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:20,351
I let her come home earlier.

442
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:20,831
Stop it.

443
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:21,672
I get it. Stop nagging me.

444
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:22,362
We're leaving.

445
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,031
Alright.

446
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:23,992
You two be safe on the way home.

447
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:24,392
Call me

448
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:25,232
when you get home.

449
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,111
We'll be fine.

450
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:26,831
Lock the door properly.

451
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:27,511
Lock the door properly.

452
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,282
Your phone was lost, wasn't it?

453
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:31,031
Oh yeah.

454
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:31,672
You're right.

455
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:33,042
We'll be fine, don't worry.

456
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:34,282
Be careful

457
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,591
Lock the door properly.

458
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:37,042
I'll listen outside
if you lock it properly or not.

459
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:39,362
Lock it.

460
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:46,923
Why can't you sleep again?

461
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,042
You haven't slept too?

462
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,723
I was thinking...

463
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,042
Maybe Xiang Zhong

464
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:56,643
should live in Shanghai.

465
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,002
What do you think?

466
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:02,002
Living at Xiang Qian's place
isn't appropriate.

467
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:05,322
Can't you think a little?

468
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,712
If Xiang Zhong moves to Shanghai,

469
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:10,443
she can stay alone too.

470
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,602
But, we can't afford

471
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:15,403
to buy a house in Shanghai.

472
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:16,831
Well.

473
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:17,672
It's difficult discussing
anything with you

474
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,672
when you're half-asleep.

475
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:20,723
You're really...

476
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:23,282
Sleep faster.

477
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:26,362
Fine, I sleep.

478
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:41,123
If only our three daughters

479
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,643
could be like you...

480
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,163
Zhong.

481
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:38,883
Good morning.

482
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,322
Here,

483
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:43,042
you should keep the car for yourself.

484
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:44,802
I parked it at the lot over there.

485
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:46,562
I...

486
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,163
Forget it. I'm not good at driving.

487
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:49,632
You have a driver's license.

488
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,271
You just have to get used to it,

489
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:51,392
and driving yourself

490
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:53,163
would ease your parents' minds.

491
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:55,403
Alright.

492
00:24:58,193 --> 00:24:59,952
Aren't you going to the training class?

493
00:24:59,953 --> 00:25:00,723
Not leaving?

494
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:02,282
I'm fine, no rush.

495
00:25:02,592 --> 00:25:03,522
Otherwise,

496
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:05,472
we'd be caught
in the same subway carriage.

497
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:07,042
I wouldn't know what to talk about.

498
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:10,123
You could just not talk.

499
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,750
(Divorce Matters)

500
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:44,243
Hello, dad.

501
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:49,712
Alright.

502
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:51,403
Come meet me at noon.

503
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,680
(Divorce Matters
1. Confirm the babysitter )

504
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,200
(2. Confirm required documents
with Attorney Wu for child's surname change.)

505
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,723
Xiang Qian always listens to you.

506
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:18,071
You should...

507
00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:19,403
What should I say?

508
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:21,042
When you bring it up,

509
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:22,883
she would agree with you.

510
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:24,632
Xiang Qian.

511
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,963
Why is mum here too?

512
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:29,071
Your dad said this is important.

513
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:30,282
Very important.

514
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:32,243
What's so important?

515
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:34,403
Go ahead and tell her.

516
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:35,723
Alright, let me start.

517
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:37,751
Xiang Zhong has been

518
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:39,923
going back and forth
between Shanghai and Kunshan,

519
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,123
Sometimes, she has to work overtime

520
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:43,591
and go home late.

521
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:45,802
Your dad worries about her safety.

522
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,963
Your mum, too, feels worried
about her safety.

523
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,791
What does this mean?

524
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:51,952
We thought about renting a place

525
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:53,443
near her company.

526
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:54,071
Oh my god!

527
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:55,311
The housing near her company

528
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:57,243
isn't cheap.

529
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:58,562
Let her have a look.

530
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:01,791
- Take a look.
- We already found one.

531
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:02,923
- This place.
- You see.

532
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:04,723
The window faces the sun.

533
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,723
This is great, right?

534
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,591
This place

535
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,952
is two subway stops

536
00:27:07,953 --> 00:27:09,042
from Xiang Zhong's office

537
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,602
and has 24-hour security.

538
00:27:12,552 --> 00:27:13,723
How much is it?

539
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,082
3,500 yuan.

540
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:17,923
3,500 yuan?

541
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:19,311
No way.

542
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:20,643
You both must have been swindled.

543
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:21,392
You see.

544
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:22,672
The housing near her company

545
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:24,432
starts at 5,000 yuan minimum.

546
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,042
No, it's 3,500 yuan.

547
00:27:26,072 --> 00:27:26,751
The owner

548
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:28,282
lives abroad

549
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:29,723
and doesn't know the market,

550
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:31,111
so they don't raise the rent

551
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:32,723
and have been renting at this rate.

552
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,123
This room just became available.

553
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:37,002
We're so lucky.

554
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:41,712
Whether it's 3,500 yuan

555
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:42,831
or 5,000 yuan,

556
00:27:42,832 --> 00:27:44,511
it's up to Xiang Zhong's will.

557
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,282
Am I right?

558
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,232
You should

559
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,511
ask her

560
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:48,672
if she's willing

561
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:50,403
to pay for the rent each month.

562
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,031
Of course, we can't let Xiang Zhong

563
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:54,203
pay for it.

564
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:55,322
We'll cover it.

565
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:56,403
Yes, exactly.

566
00:27:59,072 --> 00:27:59,883
Fine.

567
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,192
Which agency is this?

568
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:02,723
I'll talk to them this afternoon.

569
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,443
No need.

570
00:28:05,512 --> 00:28:07,082
Deposit and three month's rent paid.

571
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:09,002
We've already signed for it.

572
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:11,163
You already signed?

573
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,842
So why are you discussing it with me?

574
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:18,002
I was worried

575
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,562
if we didn't sign instantly,

576
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:20,192
others would have

577
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:21,591
snapped it up

578
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:22,992
immediately.

579
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,591
This has just become available.

580
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:25,723
I told you earlier.

581
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:26,551
Every agency

582
00:28:26,552 --> 00:28:27,591
promoted using the same way.

583
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:28,232
If you don't sign,

584
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:29,551
I'll lease it to someone else.

585
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:30,351
Are you signing or not?

586
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:31,791
If you don't, there are others

587
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,762
waiting to proceed with the payment.

588
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,522
This is a proper agency,

589
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:37,831
with full documentation

590
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:39,163
for the house,

591
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:41,082
and we even video-chatted
with the owner.

592
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:42,082
Xiang Qian,

593
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:44,762
don't think we're too old

594
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:46,362
to be tricked.

595
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:48,163
Not that easy.

596
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:53,992
Do you think

597
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,672
paying for the rent with your pension

598
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:57,362
for Xiang Zhong

599
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:58,802
will make her live there?

600
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,602
You should tell her

601
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:03,111
that we already paid,

602
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:04,432
and it's non-refundable.

603
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,602
If she doesn't want to live there,

604
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:07,362
it'll just be left empty.

605
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:09,963
No,

606
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:12,562
just don't tell her will do.

607
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:15,042
Do you think Xiang Zhong
is that oblivious?

608
00:29:15,272 --> 00:29:17,322
She'll find out in a few days.

609
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:19,443
Then, just tell her the truth.

610
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:20,883
Why don't you go yourself?

611
00:29:20,913 --> 00:29:21,723
I...

612
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:23,232
You're her sister, you should say it.

613
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:24,551
Why is it always my job

614
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:25,952
to say everything?

615
00:29:25,953 --> 00:29:26,591
Aren't you just creating

616
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,163
more conflict between us?

617
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:30,802
Fine, fine.

618
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:32,403
You won't say it, right?

619
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:34,282
We'll tell her.

620
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,403
Go ahead.

621
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:40,243
Why are you so stubborn
with your daughter?

622
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:41,591
Can you do that?

623
00:29:41,592 --> 00:29:43,362
You'll just end up arguing with her.

624
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,762
Let's argue then.

625
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:47,963
We're not done talking.

626
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:49,842
Where are you going?

627
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:51,311
Where are you going?

628
00:29:51,312 --> 00:29:52,403
Where am I going?

629
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:53,923
You...

630
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:56,322
I'm going to the washroom.

631
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:57,723
My little tag-along.

632
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:06,071
Hey, mum,

633
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:07,111
doing things like this

634
00:30:07,112 --> 00:30:08,723
is definitely my dad's idea.

635
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:09,831
You're just making

636
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:11,831
her feel pressured.

637
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:13,842
How could she live in the apartment?

638
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,432
We're just worried about her safety

639
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:20,483
and also her condition.

640
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:23,522
Have some water.

641
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:26,632
Alright, I get it.

642
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,712
I'll go talk to her later.

643
00:30:27,713 --> 00:30:28,842
I'll go act.

644
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,042
You went to the washroom so fast, huh?

645
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:47,123
Have you changed your mind?

646
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:50,762
No.

647
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:53,842
Well.

648
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:00,791
There's just a little left.

649
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,282
Don't want it anymore.

650
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,672
Don't waste it.

651
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:04,952
Why do you...

652
00:31:04,953 --> 00:31:05,632
Mum, mum...

653
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:06,271
Let me hail a car

654
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:07,831
to take you to the subway station.

655
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:08,791
No need.

656
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:09,831
The...

657
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:11,232
The bus is convenient.

658
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,432
Don't waste the money.

659
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:13,883
We're not in a hurry.

660
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:15,472
Let's go.

661
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,163
Let's go.

662
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:17,952
Send me a message when you get home.

663
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:18,683
Alright.

664
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:21,511
Xiang Qian.

665
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,403
Xiang Qian.

666
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:24,751
I almost forget something important.

667
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:27,322
Gao Ping's defense
is this Saturday, right?

668
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:30,472
That's great!

669
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:31,243
So,

670
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:32,483
on Sunday,

671
00:31:32,512 --> 00:31:33,883
let's have everyone over.

672
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:34,831
Ask Xiang Zhong and Xiang Nan

673
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:35,912
back home too.

674
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:37,152
Let's have

675
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:39,762
a family celebration for Gao Ping.

676
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:41,192
It's just an oral defense,

677
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,192
not graduation.

678
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,322
What's there to celebrate?

679
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:45,311
Even without

680
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:46,432
Gao Ping's oral defense,

681
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:47,392
you all haven't visited

682
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:48,963
in weeks.

683
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,562
Fine,

684
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,362
we'll all come.

685
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:55,203
Alright, we get to go.

686
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:56,192
Be careful.

687
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:57,362
Have a good time at work.

688
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:03,791
Xiang Qian.

689
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:04,432
What happens?

690
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,992
I almost forgot.

691
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,602
Here's the loquat syrup
your dad made for Cong!

692
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:09,923
I'm so forgetful.

693
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:11,551
Before he goes to bed,

694
00:32:11,552 --> 00:32:12,751
dissolve it in warm water

695
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:13,762
for Cong.

696
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,842
So, he doesn't get a cough
with the changing seasons.

697
00:32:17,752 --> 00:32:18,432
Alright.

698
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:19,912
Can we really leave now?

699
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:20,963
Yes, yes.

700
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:23,152
Have a good time at work.

701
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,483
- Be careful.
- You really...

702
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:26,311
Luckily I reminded you.

703
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:27,432
You have such a short memory.

704
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:28,443
You always forget things.

705
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:30,152
But, I still remember following you.

706
00:32:30,153 --> 00:32:30,551
My little tag-along,

707
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,551
if I didn't remind you,

708
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:32,963
you'd probably forget me, too.

709
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:34,403
You're really forgetful.

710
00:32:35,272 --> 00:32:36,042
You...

711
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,643
Still not here?

712
00:32:55,832 --> 00:32:56,683
Welcome!

713
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,123
Jiaqiao!

714
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:04,551
Why are you so late?

715
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:05,683
There's a traffic congestion.

716
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:07,071
Why are you suddenly

717
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,082
interested in an exhibition?

718
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,002
I helped

719
00:33:09,193 --> 00:33:10,322
organize this exhibition.

720
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:14,362
You're organizing an art exhibition?

721
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:15,551
Why? Can't I?

722
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:16,751
Do I seem that unrefined

723
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:17,351
to you?

724
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:17,831
No, I don't mean that.

725
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:18,672
Let me tell you, Xiang Nan,

726
00:33:18,673 --> 00:33:20,723
I'm very passionate about art now.

727
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:21,802
Here.

728
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:23,111
This is

729
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:25,071
my business partner,

730
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:25,923
Lv Liang,

731
00:33:26,312 --> 00:33:28,271
and also my dear

732
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,643
boyfriend.

733
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:33,883
Xiang Nan, it's been
a long time since we met.

734
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:38,243
Should we go inside and talk?

735
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:39,483
Wait a minute.

736
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:40,632
Jiaqiao,

737
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,522
can I talk to you alone for a second?

738
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:43,762
Sure.

739
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,362
You go in first.

740
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,123
I'll come in a while.

741
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:51,842
Jiaqiao,

742
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:54,683
do you know he's my ex?

743
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:56,002
Of course, I know.

744
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,123
You...

745
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,802
So, does he know I'm your sister-in-law?

746
00:34:01,112 --> 00:34:02,963
Of course, he knows.

747
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:05,042
Oh no, what's going on here?

748
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:06,842
This is just too dramatic.

749
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,751
Don't you think our relationship

750
00:34:08,752 --> 00:34:09,992
is a bit complicated now?

751
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:11,643
Alright, calm down.

752
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:12,271
Wait,

753
00:34:12,272 --> 00:34:13,203
let me ask you,

754
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,643
do you still have feelings for him?

755
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:17,723
I'm married, my dear sister.

756
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:19,362
Exactly!

757
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:20,312
You don't like him anymore,

758
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:21,151
and he doesn't like you too,

759
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:24,563
so you're practically strangers now.

760
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:26,362
What's complicated about that?

761
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:27,482
But...

762
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:31,362
I...

763
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:33,922
I have nothing more to talk to you.

764
00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:34,802
Xiang Nan,

765
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:36,003
where are you going?

766
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,163
Lv Liang is still waiting for us.

767
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:39,282
Xiang Nan.

768
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,643
Xiang Nan.

769
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,031
Xiang Nan, I was wrong.

770
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:42,882
What's up?

771
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,723
Are you mad at me, Xiang Nan?

772
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:46,882
I meant to surprise you.

773
00:34:47,032 --> 00:34:47,872
Surprise?

774
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:48,872
This is more like a shock.

775
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:49,591
You're right.

776
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:51,282
I know I oversimplified it.

777
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:53,322
Don't be mad, okay?

778
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,962
Can I continue then?

779
00:34:58,273 --> 00:34:59,362
Fine, say it.

780
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:00,643
I'm listening.

781
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:04,922
I want to get married

782
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,523
with Lv Liang.

783
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,643
Married?

784
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:11,511
Jiang Jiaqiao,

785
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:12,511
are you serious?

786
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,322
Do you think your brother would agree?

787
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:16,203
That's why I'm asking for your help.

788
00:35:16,232 --> 00:35:17,962
You want me to help
convince your brother?

789
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,432
No one can do that.

790
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:20,203
Hold on.

791
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,151
I meant,

792
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,882
could you...

793
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:26,203
Could you pretend

794
00:35:26,232 --> 00:35:27,551
that you don't know Lv Liang?

795
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:28,832
Like you've never met him

796
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,802
and never had any relationship with him?

797
00:35:30,873 --> 00:35:31,352
Hold on.

798
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:33,151
You're planning to get married,

799
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:33,992
which means we'd be

800
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:35,362
living under one roof.

801
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:36,792
We'll meet each other very often.

802
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:37,511
How to pretend?

803
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:38,472
Pretend forever?

804
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:39,151
Then, let's wait

805
00:35:39,152 --> 00:35:41,163
until everything is settled down.

806
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:42,643
Okay?

807
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:44,922
Okay?

808
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:46,111
Jiang Jiaqiao,

809
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:47,402
are you serious?

810
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:49,071
Do you know him well?

811
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:50,551
Are you sure you want to marry him,

812
00:35:50,552 --> 00:35:52,243
and it's not just a whim?

813
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:54,511
He's different

814
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:56,083
from anyone I've ever met.

815
00:35:57,552 --> 00:35:58,962
I'm very certain.

816
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:07,031
I feel like you've lost

817
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,711
all your sense and intelligence now.

818
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:09,511
Do you realize that?

819
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:11,352
Your mind is complete mush.

820
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:12,322
Do you realize that?

821
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:15,203
This is the so-called 'lovestruck', right?

822
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:17,352
I give up on you!

823
00:36:17,353 --> 00:36:18,392
Oh my goodness!

824
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:19,952
I can't handle this.

825
00:36:19,953 --> 00:36:21,083
I can't help you with this too.

826
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:22,882
Do whatever you want.

827
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:23,802
Xiang Nan,

828
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:25,442
so you agree now?

829
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:27,322
Thank you.

830
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:28,962
Love you.

831
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:45,922
Hello?

832
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:51,402
Anyone here?

833
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:01,603
Hello?

834
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:05,402
Lv Liang!

835
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,762
Didn't you say you wouldn't meet me?

836
00:37:13,112 --> 00:37:15,362
I wanted to ask,
what exactly is your intention?

837
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:19,362
I'm in my thirties.

838
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:21,402
I want to date and get married.

839
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,043
Is that a problem?

840
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:24,603
Lv Liang, do you love her?

841
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:25,962
Do you love her brother?

842
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:29,203
Of course.

843
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:30,402
You hesitated.

844
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:31,922
Why?

845
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:34,442
I don't need to explain myself to you.

846
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:36,083
Sorry then.

847
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:37,802
Regarding Jiaqiao,

848
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:39,591
I have nothing else
to explain to you too.

849
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,832
Jiaqiao is a very naive person,

850
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,312
and she's a lovestruck girl.

851
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:44,802
You can't take advantage of her.

852
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:51,312
Why do you think

853
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,472
I'm taking advantage of her?

854
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:54,071
Most of your clients

855
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,752
were introduced by her,

856
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,272
including this studio

857
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:59,203
and your exhibitions.

858
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:00,711
You're all using her resources.

859
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:03,922
Are you speaking as her family?

860
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:06,711
Or did we make things
difficult for you,

861
00:38:06,712 --> 00:38:09,432
letting you feel awkward

862
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,802
in front of your wealthy husband?

863
00:38:15,112 --> 00:38:17,043
I just don't want you to hurt her.

864
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:19,111
What makes you think I'll hurt her?

865
00:38:19,112 --> 00:38:21,071
Do I need to remind you who you are?

866
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:21,711
Back at that time,

867
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:23,432
I just borrowed ideas from Xu Miao

868
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:24,631
for my own graduation project.

869
00:38:24,632 --> 00:38:26,243
How can you make it sound so pleasant?

870
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:27,671
That's plagiarism.

871
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,151
Fine.

872
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:29,312
Even if it's plagiarism,

873
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:32,442
there's no need
to judge me forever over it.

874
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:57,402
Drinking so much coffee.

875
00:38:57,953 --> 00:38:59,402
Can your heart take it?

876
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:00,912
Have some of this instead,

877
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:02,123
for the vitamin C.

878
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:03,922
I'm tired.

879
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:07,922
Didn't sleep well again last night?

880
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:11,402
It seems that I have reached the age

881
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:14,603
that the sleep quality becomes terrible.

882
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:20,362
I remember you saying

883
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:22,282
you'd take time off

884
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:24,203
after Dr. Gao graduates.

885
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,043
Will you still take it?

886
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:28,282
Yeah, I am.

887
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:32,723
Then, submit your leave request
to me today.

888
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:35,003
Alright.

889
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,390
(Leave Application)

890
00:40:56,552 --> 00:40:57,442
Xiang Nan,

891
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:02,083
no matter what you thought of me before,

892
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:05,442
I would never use love as a transaction.

893
00:41:06,953 --> 00:41:08,243
Maybe you don't know,

894
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,282
but my career in Japan wasn't smooth.

895
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:12,832
Returning here, things weren't

896
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,563
going well either.

897
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:18,003
I was extremely depressed.

898
00:41:19,032 --> 00:41:20,591
When I was at a gathering,

899
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:21,962
I met Jiaqiao.

900
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,312
She's someone full of enthusiasm.

901
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:26,563
She is just so contagious,

902
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:29,882
and also very proactive,

903
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:32,123
always pushing people forward.

904
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,442
She motivated me a lot.

905
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:40,312
Being able to have

906
00:41:40,313 --> 00:41:41,191
someone who's incredibly selfless

907
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:44,442
like her is indeed difficult.

908
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:47,243
I really cherish her.

909
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:52,191
But, Jiang Hongbin

910
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:53,882
will never approve.

911
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:55,723
If I never try,

912
00:41:56,152 --> 00:41:57,882
how do I know the outcome?

913
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:02,442
I can only say that you don't know him.

914
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:04,842
Lv Liang!

915
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,922
Lv Liang, lend me a hand.

916
00:42:09,712 --> 00:42:11,282
Xiang Nan, why are you here?

917
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:12,243
Jiaqiao.

918
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:14,243
What did you buy?

919
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,992
Mops, dustpans,

920
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:17,151
just all the necessary stuff.

921
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,962
I bought all the necessary items.

922
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:21,472
Didn't I tell you I'd order these online?

923
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:22,591
You order it?

924
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:23,551
You've been saying that
for a very long time.

925
00:42:23,552 --> 00:42:24,952
You always procrastinate.

926
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:25,752
Anyway, it's no trouble.

927
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:27,643
I bought them all on the way here.

928
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:29,482
Let me check it.

929
00:42:30,473 --> 00:42:31,442
Let me see.

930
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:32,523
Are you okay?

931
00:42:33,993 --> 00:42:35,523
I'm just kidding. Don't worry.

932
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:36,643
Oh yeah!

933
00:42:36,672 --> 00:42:38,123
You can just put this over there.

934
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,442
I'll tidy them up later.

935
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:43,111
How strong you are!

936
00:42:43,112 --> 00:42:43,792
Be careful.

937
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:44,523
Alright.

938
00:42:49,592 --> 00:42:51,523
Ms. Xiang.

939
00:42:51,632 --> 00:42:53,191
Did you come here
to assess him secretly?

940
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:53,992
What do you think?

941
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:55,322
Has he passed?

942
00:42:57,512 --> 00:42:59,683
Jiaqiao, tell me the truth.

943
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:01,832
Did he tell you

944
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,282
the reason I broke up with him?

945
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:25,690
