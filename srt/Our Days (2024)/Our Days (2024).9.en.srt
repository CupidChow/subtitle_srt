=Our Days=

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 9=

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,899
Mom? What are you doing here?

5
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,020
I told your dad
to make some vegetarian food for you.

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,518
Why?

7
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,598
I won't eat any of his cooking.

8
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,500
Come inside.

9
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,419
You can't keep starving yourself.
You'll ruin your stomach.

10
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,979
I won't.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,339
I'm an adult now.

12
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,660
I can take care of myself.

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,979
Come.

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,860
Why did you come all the way here?

15
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,420
I couldn't sleep well either.

16
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,619
I was wondering if you...

17
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,119
If you wish to get a divorce,

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,300
you can go ahead.

19
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,219
Why didn't you say that in front of Dad?

20
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,899
Your father is very old-fashioned.

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,519
It's fine. Our neighbors can say

22
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,020
whatever they want.

23
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,820
It's fine as long as you like it.

24
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,059
I just don't want you
to swallow any grievances.

25
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,719
Dad,

26
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,540
do you want me to charge your battery?

27
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,279
Yes.

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,758
Me too.

29
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,700
Come.

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,899
Come here.

31
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,279
Alright now.

32
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,439
Alright now.

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,580
That's enough.

34
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,159
Let Dad finish his meal.

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,740
Dad has something important to do today.

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,659
I'll get my bag now.

37
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,798
Cong, Qi, Dad will be leaving now.

38
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:42,598
Listen to Mom, okay?

39
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,300
Goodbye.

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,099
I'll be going now.

41
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,260
You can do it.

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,999
Don't worry.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,719
Good luck.

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,020
I did my preparations.

45
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,219
You can do it.

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,519
Don't worry.

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,619
I'll be going now. Goodbye.

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,300
Drive slowly.

49
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,140
Why didn't you do it?

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,020
Okay.

51
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,739
That's not it.

52
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,539
What?

53
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,099
Have you watched the video or not?

54
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,419
I'm watching it right now.

55
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,519
Isn't it nice?

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,879
Of course.

57
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,820
Why didn't you press "Like", then?

58
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,399
I thought you wanted me

59
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,539
to eat the grapes.

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,918
Hurry up.

61
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:45,899
My goodness.

62
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,060
Hurry and press "Like".

63
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,558
I'm just asking you to press "Like".

64
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,519
Why are you sighing?

65
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,979
What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,659
Regarding Xiang Nan's marriage,

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,478
he has already prepared

68
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,299
the dowries for us.

69
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,380
If Xiang Nan marries into their family,

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,839
she won't be able

71
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,380
to establish a foothold in his family.

72
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,339
We've already done our best.

73
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,079
That's the best we can afford.

74
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,620
How else do you want her
to be married, then?

75
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,099
Why are you overthinking it?

76
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:29,260
The child has been pitiful since young.

77
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,399
She lost her parents when she was three.

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,620
We've been raising her all these years.

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,558
Now, I'm attached to her.

80
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:39,500
You see,

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,820
this child

82
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,099
has been kind and righteous since young.

83
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,899
Don't you agree?

84
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,500
Even when she sprained her ankle,

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,279
she never cried

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,620
when she took jabs and medicine.

87
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,859
When she was in school,

88
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,419
she sprained her ankle once.

89
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,219
She didn't tell us about it

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,979
so that she wouldn't trouble us.

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,940
When we found out,

92
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,079
she had already ended up like this.

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,720
One of her legs ended up
longer than the other leg.

94
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,839
Didn't the doctor
already explain it to us?

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,079
There was an issue with her pelvic bone.

96
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,639
It's not directly related
to her sprained ankle.

97
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,060
How could it not be related?

98
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,120
It takes 100 days to recover
from sprains and fractures.

99
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,700
She was growing back then.

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,998
How could her pelvic bone
not be affected?

101
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,279
How are we not responsible for that?

102
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,678
Don't take all the responsibility

103
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,159
upon yourself.

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,020
That's not true.

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,998
I'm not taking all the responsibility
on myself.

106
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:33,598
That's not it.

107
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,979
Enough already.

108
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,339
I know you love her and
wish to watch over her.

109
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,998
Even so, you can't just look after her
for the rest of your life.

110
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,899
She has to get married somehow.

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,180
Yeah, yeah. You're right.

112
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,899
I just can't bear to part with her.

113
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:50,839
But time...

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,820
Time does fly, you know?

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,859
Dad, Mom.

116
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,759
- Xiang Nan.
- Xiang Nan, you're back.

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,478
Xiang Nan.

118
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:01,839
I'm back.

119
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,339
Be careful.

120
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:04,558
Look at her.

121
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,719
Your mother is angry at me.

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,539
What is this?

123
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:07,739
Look.

124
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,199
He didn't do anything about it.

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,759
He didn't press "Like" either.

126
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,038
She told me to press "Like".
I didn't do it. Now, she's angry at me.

127
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,639
Hurry and show me some appreciation.

128
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,438
Send some emojis and praise her.

129
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,199
Show your appreciation.

130
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,180
Just look at your mother.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,339
What's wrong?

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,700
It looks nice on you.

133
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,020
Ever since she heard

134
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,319
that you were getting married,

135
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,159
she started showing off
by wearing this earring every day.

136
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,460
I'll buy her a bigger pair of earrings.

137
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,140
Alright now.

138
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,079
The invitation cards are ready.

139
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,399
Dad, your handwriting is great.

140
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,700
Please write them for me.

141
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,598
This is great.

142
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,279
Your father was practicing
his handwriting every day

143
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,238
just so he could write them for you.

144
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:36,519
You...

145
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,079
Really?

146
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,719
You think my handwriting will
look terrible if I don't practice?

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,038
Your handwriting is great
even if you don't practice.

148
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:40,798
Take a look.

149
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,959
Come. Let's go inside.

150
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,820
Come.

151
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,419
Hurry.

152
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:46,998
Just leave it here.

153
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,580
This is great.

154
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,299
Get me the paper, ink, and ink grind.

155
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,998
Hurry.

156
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,260
Take a look.
These are the invitation cards.

157
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:56,238
They look so exquisite.

158
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,558
Look at how exquisite they are.

159
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,859
There's the red packet as well.

160
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,140
- And this.
- These are the envelopes.

161
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,739
Xiang Nan,

162
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,339
are you stressed out

163
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,739
because of me?

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,180
Not at all.

165
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,238
Dad, why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

166
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,118
Mom criticized me as well.

167
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:18,899
Actually, it doesn't matter
where you hold

168
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,940
the wedding ceremony.

169
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,759
It's fine as long as you and Jiang

170
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,639
are happy with it.

171
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,478
That's better than everything else.

172
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,918
Dad, I understand. I'm fine.

173
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:27,678
Don't blame me, okay?

174
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,279
Why would I blame you for this?

175
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,839
It's my fault.

176
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,500
Come.

177
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,700
Hurry, take a look.

178
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,460
Look at how exquisite they are. See.

179
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,859
They're so exquisite.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,700
Alright.

181
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,139
Dad, Mom.

182
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,798
Actually, I overheard

183
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,259
a part of your conversation just now.

184
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:45,558
I always thought

185
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,660
that I was a lucky girl.

186
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,318
I'm serious. When I was in school,

187
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,479
my classmates always said
they were envious of me.

188
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,038
They thought we had a merry family

189
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,099
with plenty of family members.

190
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,999
And, Dad always delivered my meals to me.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,479
I grew up together
with two sisters as well.

192
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,139
I...

193
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,099
I'm very content.

194
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,099
Everyone in the family was nice to me.

195
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:10,159
You two always provided me

196
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,780
with the most things
compared to my sisters.

197
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,139
I always thought

198
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,940
that I was the most blissful girl
in the world.

199
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,139
We were just fulfilling
our duties as parents.

200
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,660
Stop it.

201
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,580
Give me a hug.

202
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,438
We just can't get enough of you.

203
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,780
Alright now.

204
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,798
This is a happy occasion.

205
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,780
We should be happy.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,019
It's fine, Mom. Don't cry.

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,078
Although I'm married,

208
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,180
I'll come back every week.

209
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,700
Good girl.

210
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,918
We live nearby anyway,

211
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,739
am I right?

212
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,460
Okay.

213
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,460
Where are you going?

214
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:55,599
Xiang Nan is having
a heartfelt conversation with them.

215
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,820
We shouldn't interrupt them.

216
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,259
Is it delicious?

217
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,420
The boba is pretty good.

218
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,259
You must attend

219
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,780
Xiang Nan's wedding, okay?

220
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,139
Who said I wasn't attending it?

221
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,859
I'm just worried that you might
get emotional.

222
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,900
Xiang Nan is smarter than you.

223
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,678
She wants me to record
the cash gifts for her wedding.

224
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,558
That's an important mission.

225
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,540
Of course I have to attend it.

226
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,139
That's great.

227
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,438
Xiang Nan has been witty since young.

228
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,780
She's very clever.

229
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,359
All the good food at home

230
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,119
was given to her first.

231
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,300
How can she not be clever?

232
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,180
You ate a lot too, you know?

233
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,259
Enough already. You're doing this again.

234
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,900
What do you want?
I'll make it up to you right now.

235
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,099
If so, I'll make my order, then.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,859
Let me think about it. I want BBQ.

237
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,979
I want seafood.

238
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,739
- Will you treat me to them?
- Let's go, then.

239
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,180
You and your tiny little thoughts.

240
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,359
Cheers.

241
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,180
Cheers.

242
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,780
This is to celebrate your marriage too.

243
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,700
Xiang Nan.

244
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,838
You listened to me

245
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,859
when you were young.

246
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,119
You told me everything

247
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,219
that happened in your life.

248
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,180
But now?

249
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,859
You're surprising me
with a sudden marriage.

250
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,499
You see,

251
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,119
since young, you've handled

252
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,180
and decided everything for me.

253
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,379
I was thinking that I'm an adult now.

254
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,119
I can deal with my own affairs now.

255
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,660
I can make my own decisions now.

256
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,700
No matter how old you are,

257
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,580
I'll always be your eldest sister.

258
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:19,239
Xiang Zhong will always
be your second sister.

259
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,879
Dad and Mom will still be Dad and Mom.

260
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,759
It's impossible for us

261
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,599
not to worry about you, you know?

262
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,639
But I don't want you guys

263
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,820
to worry about me.

264
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,379
You guys?

265
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,139
Are you drawing the line now?

266
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,718
You're differentiating between us.

267
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,219
Even when you aren't married yet, huh?

268
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:37,838
That's not it.

269
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,580
That's not what I mean.

270
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,139
Actually,

271
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,219
I feel like you guys
were very protective of me

272
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,660
since young.

273
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,119
You guys didn't want me

274
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,900
to get hurt at all.

275
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,678
Actually, it made me feel like

276
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,139
I wasn't a part of the family.

277
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,820
It'd remind me of the fact

278
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,700
that you guys were
loving me unconditionally

279
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,300
all because

280
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,940
I wasn't Dad and Mom's biological child.

281
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:13,798
That made me

282
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,499
feel uncomfortable.

283
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,580
When we were young,

284
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:19,438
Dad always threw a tantrum

285
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,499
and told you guys off whenever you guys
did something wrong.

286
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,940
But when it was my turn,

287
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,499
he would tolerate me
and spoil me unconditionally.

288
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,999
Actually, I wanted to tell them

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,820
that they could tell me off too.

290
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,580
I just wanted to be like you two.

291
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,399
I just wanted to be closer to you two.

292
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,139
I wanted us to be like a family.

293
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,619
Why are you crying?
Try to put yourself in my shoes.

294
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,820
The old man dotes on you the most.

295
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,900
Did you forget
how he told me off back then?

296
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,700
He couldn't tolerate me at all.

297
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,379
So, you hate us
for being too nice to you, huh?

298
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,139
Go.

299
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,339
Get me some vegetarian skewers.

300
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,678
Get me some mushrooms.

301
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,399
No garlic for me.
Go and make the order. Go on.

302
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,420
What does that mean?

303
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,399
Can't you see that there's only corn here?

304
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,359
Yeah, get me some mushrooms.

305
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,958
What?

306
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,460
Why are you guys ordering me around?

307
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,838
Why are you still sitting here?

308
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,359
Have we raised you for nothing?

309
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,759
Can't you even run an errand for us?

310
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,798
Didn't you complain
that we were too nice to you?

311
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,678
Go and run our errand, then.

312
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,979
Get us a pack of tissues. Hurry.

313
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,900
You want me to do it?

314
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,339
Isn't it obvious?

315
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,379
Go now.

316
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,759
Fine. What else
do you guys need besides tissue?

317
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,499
Vegetarian skewers?

318
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,918
Do you guys want mushrooms?

319
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,420
Yeah, Zhong wants them.

320
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,460
No garlic for me.

321
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,780
You guys are so annoying.

322
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,678
So, some mushrooms, tissue paper,

323
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,580
and what else?

324
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,940
That's enough for now.

325
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,460
I already forgot what you guys wanted.

326
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,979
Madam,

327
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,139
Young Lady,

328
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:57,139
here's your tissue.

329
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,420
Enough. Use it to wipe your tears.

330
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,780
You guys are so annoying.

331
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,499
What about my wage?

332
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,339
You still dare to demand a wage?

333
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,859
I'll include it in your dowry.

334
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,259
Do you feel better
after we ordered you around?

335
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,460
It feels great.

336
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,259
It should've been like this.

337
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,660
Xiang Nan,

338
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,499
we didn't dote on you

339
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,739
not because you're not
our parents' flesh and blood.

340
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,379
It's because you're the youngest.

341
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,879
So,

342
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,820
what do you want?

343
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,460
You want to share our burdens?
Come and share mine, then.

344
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,359
I'm just like

345
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,718
Dad's secretary.

346
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,940
He assigns me 800 tasks per day.

347
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,019
Which of you wants to be
the eldest sister for one day? Come.

348
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,060
Enough. Stop crying.

349
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,339
So, you guys didn't treat me
like an outsider?

350
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,540
My goodness.

351
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,540
Are you a drama queen now?

352
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,180
Xiang Nan,

353
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,259
getting married is different from
falling in love.

354
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,460
You'll begin

355
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:19,019
your married life soon.

356
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,399
If something happens,

357
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,180
you still have to come back
and tell us about it.

358
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:24,460
I know.

359
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,379
Come back more often when you're free.

360
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,979
Dad and Mom can't bear
to part with you the most.

361
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,318
You should remember this.

362
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,339
Only we can bully you.
Don't let anyone else bully you.

363
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,219
Cheers.

364
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,180
In the future, you should tell us immediately
when someone bullies you.

365
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,599
If someone bullies you,
you can find Zhong.

366
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,780
She knows Wushu.

367
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,499
I can both fight and evade.

368
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,759
What indecent content were you watching?

369
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,239
How many times have I told you?
This is the public area.

370
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,460
You can watch that in your own room.

371
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,379
I wasn't watching anything indecent.

372
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,059
Look.

373
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,918
I'll be wearing this.

374
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,259
Why are you trying to wear a suit?

375
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,100
Just tell me if I look okay.

376
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,700
What exactly are you up to?

377
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm going to attend Xiang Nan's wedding.

378
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,159
Who said you could attend it?

379
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,940
Wait.

380
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,700
Why can't I attend it?

381
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:36,559
You think your previous visit
to Jiang Hongbin's house

382
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,238
wasn't embarrassing enough?

383
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,539
That's not it. Listen to me.

384
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,799
We aren't divorced yet.

385
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,238
Am I right?

386
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:41,958
As her brother-in-law,

387
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,758
of course I can attend her wedding.

388
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,718
Regarding last time,

389
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,399
why would I smash the vase to pieces

390
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,359
if you didn't kick me
out of the car in the first place.

391
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,198
You're ridiculous.

392
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,539
Why are you blaming me for this?

393
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,238
Firstly...

394
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,940
Think about it. Firstly,

395
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,259
I can't just pay someone
a visit empty-handed, right?

396
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:59,039
Don't you think it's embarrassing

397
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,159
for me to drive our subpar car

398
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,478
to someone else's villa?

399
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:04,998
And, why would the vase
be smashed into pieces

400
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,319
had I not suffered a cramp

401
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,620
after carrying it for too long?

402
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,340
So, is this my fault now?

403
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:14,420
It can't just be
my fault entirely, right?

404
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,599
Fine. It's all my fault.

405
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
Are you happy now? What do you want?

406
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,299
I just hope

407
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,599
that you won't humiliate me

408
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,779
when you talk to me again.

409
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,340
I have my own dignity, you know?

410
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,238
If so, please let me pass, then.

411
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,660
Okay? Thank you.

412
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,140
Be honest with me.

413
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,340
Have you given the watch away?

414
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,940
You haven't, have you?

415
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,779
They confiscated it
as there was a high-voltage line nearby.

416
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,460
One of Dayuan's friends

417
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,779
went there to give
a trial lecture as well.

418
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,499
He told Dayuan that no one else wanted me

419
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,600
because my first educational
qualification was terrible.

420
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,278
They wanted me to give a trial lecture
to show me some respect

421
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,700
and go through the procedure.

422
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,259
They did mention

423
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,599
their requirement for the
first educational qualification before.

424
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,758
But they also sent you a normal invitation
for the trial lecture.

425
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,278
You knew that long ago.

426
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,340
Why didn't you tell me about it?

427
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,079
I...

428
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,879
I spent so much time to prepare for it.

429
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,238
I was filled with passion

430
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,639
when I went there
to give the trial lecture.

431
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,198
But it turned out

432
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,819
that they took me for a fool!

433
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,180
Where are you going?

434
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,180
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,660
It's my fault.

436
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,819
I should've told you about it earlier.

437
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,700
It's not your fault.

438
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,940
I couldn't control my emotions just now.

439
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,140
It was my fault in the first place.

440
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,499
I've overestimated myself.

441
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,100
If so, should we still apply for

442
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,739
the postdoctoral research station?

443
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,499
Do you think I have a choice?

444
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,900
Are you heading out?

445
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,460
One of my friends is going abroad.
I need to see him off.

446
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,900
Xiang Nan is getting married today.

447
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,259
I know.

448
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,819
I'll rush over there once this is over.

449
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,140
You can continue sleeping.

450
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,739
Gu.

451
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,518
Xiang!

452
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,319
Look who's here.

453
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,499
Congratulations.

454
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:00,660
Zhi.

455
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,438
Thank you.

456
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,700
Do I look nice?

457
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:05,758
You do.

458
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,039
This is the outfit you gave me.

459
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,039
It's comfortable, right?

460
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,359
Look at how excellent the fabric is.

461
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,958
Hello.

462
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:10,639
Thank you.

463
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,499
Xiang Zhong.

464
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,860
Please have some tea later.

465
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,340
She's finally getting married.

466
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,159
Aunt, you're so pretty today.

467
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm pretty, right?

468
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:21,799
This is great.

469
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,998
Your father was so stingy.

470
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,119
He can finally get rich now.

471
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,620
We did receive
a lot of cash gifts today.

472
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,599
Thank you.

473
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,559
Thank you.

474
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,460
Thank you, mister.

475
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,620
Thank you, mister.
Please have some tea over there.

476
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,819
How long do we have to wait?

477
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,620
How's the preparation?

478
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,879
She's trying on
the wedding gown upstairs.

479
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,779
She'll be done soon.

480
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,539
Okay.

481
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:43,718
She's coming.

482
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,839
She'll be here in a second.

483
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,579
Mr. Jiang.

484
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:46,940
She'll be here in a second.

485
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,860
Mr. Jiang,

486
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,739
I'm sure you'll be satisfied today.

487
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,539
Xiang Nan.

488
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,900
She's so beautiful.

489
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,620
She's so pretty.

490
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,380
Isn't her outfit too simple?

491
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,499
Won't she wear any accessories?

492
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,420
It's not simple at all.
Prepare the accessories.

493
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,059
Give me a second.

494
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,059
I'll refine your style for you.

495
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,019
Come.

496
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,299
Be careful. This is very expensive.

497
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,958
The wedding gown I chose

498
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,539
look much better than this.

499
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,819
It's not that bad.

500
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,059
Don't you think her makeup is too plain?

501
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,539
Look at her wedding gown.

502
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,238
Shouldn't her bust

503
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,119
be slightly padded as well?

504
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,019
Mr. Jiang.

505
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,159
Jiaqiao, that's enough.

506
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,159
Her makeup is too plain.

507
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,718
- Stop giving orders.
- I'm doing this for her sake.

508
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,299
Alright now. You should check out
the reception desk.

509
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,579
I thought someone
was already tending to it.

510
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,359
They don't know most of the guests.

511
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,620
You should help them out.

512
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,119
I...

513
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,518
Go now.

514
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,758
- I wish to keep you company.
- Enough already.

515
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,639
I don't feel like going. Go now.

516
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,380
I don't...

517
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,238
I don't feel like going.

518
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,019
Just go.

519
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,900
Got it.

520
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,420
Do I look nice? Tell me.

521
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,278
You look great.

522
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:38,879
Come here, then.

523
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,219
Groom, come here.

524
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,100
What was that?

525
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,900
What is she doing here?

526
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,299
Thank you.

527
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:54,700
Shen, what's going on?

528
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,758
Move the tables a little apart.

529
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,478
Are the cash gifts that hard to record?

530
00:24:58,479 --> 00:24:59,559
Of course not.

531
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,438
We're a family now.

532
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,059
Stop talking in such a sarcastic tone.

533
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,420
But what if someone complains

534
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,219
that her jade bangle is missing again?

535
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,779
Jiang Jiaqiao,

536
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,180
you better shut up.

537
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:10,918
Listen up.

538
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,839
Today's Xiang Nan's big day.

539
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,319
If anyone says the word "separate" again,
I won't let him or her off.

540
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,019
I'm separating the tables.

541
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,559
I'm separating the tables now!
What can you do to me?

542
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,559
Jiang Jiaqiao,
if you want to make a scene,

543
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,718
you can go home
and cry to your brother all you like.

544
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,918
There's no one here to spoil you.

545
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:23,198
Scram!

546
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,839
Why are you mentioning my brother
for no reason?

547
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,900
You shrew! Get lost!

548
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,599
- Who are you telling to get lost?
- Say that...

549
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,860
- Look at all the people here.
- Why are you stopping me?

550
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,779
Everyone is staring at us.

551
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,159
What are you guys staring at?

552
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,678
Everything's fine.
It's just a misunderstanding.

553
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,819
Who does she think she is?

554
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,660
Why is everyone bullying me?

555
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,739
Are you guys enjoying the food?

556
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,599
Greet your godfather.

557
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,438
- Godfather.
- Godfather.

558
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,319
What are you guys having?

559
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,278
Let me take a bite.

560
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,159
No.

561
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,140
No?

562
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,198
Can't I even take a bite?

563
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,180
No.

564
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,198
Qi, let me take a bite.

565
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:53,979
Qi.

566
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,799
Great timing.

567
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,420
Look after her for me, won't you?

568
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,860
Where's Gao Ping?

569
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,998
Gao Ping said he had to see
his classmate off at the airport.

570
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,758
He would be here later.
I'll go and check on Xiang Nan.

571
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:03,860
Alright. Sure.

572
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,299
- Just leave them to me.
- Be obedient, okay?

573
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,518
You can take them to Aunt as well.

574
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,340
Alright.

575
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,478
Is this delicious?

576
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,438
It's delicious.

577
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,079
It's this, right?

578
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,860
Is this the one?

579
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,940
I'll take one as well.
Alright. Let's go.

580
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,100
Where's Aunty?

581
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,140
Let's go and find Aunty.

582
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:27,079
I think my bangs can be puffier.

583
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,819
Okay.

584
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:28,718
As for the curl,

585
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,180
make it more curly.

586
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,478
I'm looking for
that French laid-back vibe.

587
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,219
Okay.

588
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,900
Xiang Nan.

589
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,259
Where's the cheongsam?

590
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,299
I thought you guys kept it.

591
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,579
Did you lose it?

592
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:44,819
That's not it.

593
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,579
You can put on your makeup first.
I'll look for it.

594
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,559
I hung it here just now.

595
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,860
Where did it go?

596
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,180
Yiyi,

597
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,539
go and check it out.

598
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:57,438
Tiange, stop sleeping.

599
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,918
Have you seen Xiang Nan's cheongsam?

600
00:26:58,919 --> 00:26:59,940
Cheongsam?

601
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,518
What cheongsam?

602
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,739
Her cheongsam.

603
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,839
Have you found it?

604
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,539
No.

605
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,499
No.

606
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,180
Don't panic.

607
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,660
Let's try to recall it.

608
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,660
Was anyone here just now?

609
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,039
I think Xiang Nan's sister-in-law
was here just now.

610
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,100
Sister-in-law?

611
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,100
Come.

612
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,460
Who did you give the cheongsam to?

613
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,219
Sam, didn't I hand it to you?

614
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,478
I...

615
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,998
I kept it in that room.

616
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:38,518
And,

617
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,059
I wanted to add a brooch to it.

618
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,739
It vanished all of a sudden.

619
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,039
It's pointless to find me

620
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,340
when you guys lost it.

621
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,380
Jiaqiao.

622
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,299
I'm sure this room

623
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,678
has surveillance cameras.

624
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:50,499
This is a huge hotel.

625
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,839
Why would there be

626
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,420
a surveillance camera here?

627
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,340
Who are you trying to threaten?

628
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:01,839
Yeah.

629
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,800
I suppose there's no surveillance camera
in a room like this.

630
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,299
Jiaqiao,

631
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,539
stop messing around.

632
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,620
Where's the cheongsam?

633
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,579
If you keep messing around,

634
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:18,539
I'll suspend all of your bank cards.

635
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,039
Hongbin, have you lost your mind?

636
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,059
You're the one who has lost your mind.

637
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,460
I'm getting married today, you know?

638
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,839
Look at what you're wearing.

639
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,238
I'm already showing you respect
by not telling you off.

640
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,559
What's wrong with my outfit?

641
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,460
Shut up.

642
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,420
Come.

643
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,420
I'll ask you one last time.

644
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,819
Where's the cheongsam?

645
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,779
I don't know.

646
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,900
Shen, tell Zhang

647
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,478
to suspend all of

648
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,059
Jiang Jiaqiao's bank cards.

649
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,460
- Hongbin...
- It's fine.

650
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,620
You like this cheongsam, don't you?

651
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,979
That's the cheongsam.

652
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,839
Uncle said she would grow tall

653
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,059
and have a good figure in the future.

654
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:49,438
She has to wear a cheongsam
when she gets married.

655
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,180
She'll look beautiful.

656
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,340
Go ahead, then.

657
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,478
Wear it like this.

658
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,039
Wear it like this if you dare.

659
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,380
Go ahead.

660
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,739
Go ahead!

661
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:03,460
Hongbin?

662
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,019
Did you just hit me?

663
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,100
Scram!

664
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,180
Why did you do that?

665
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,579
Why?

666
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,819
Yes, I do!

667
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,860
This...

668
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:18,420
This...

669
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,380
The cheongsam is all torn up.

670
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,819
Xiang Nan, your cheongsam is...

671
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:27,739
Sam, take a look.

672
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,399
See if there's any way

673
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,758
to patch it up.

674
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:32,460
This...

675
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,539
How can I do anything about this?

676
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,460
Let's go.

677
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,499
Xiang Nan, I respect your opinion.

678
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,438
If you insist on wearing cheongsam

679
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,019
for the wedding,

680
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,559
I'll head outside and tell everyone

681
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,559
that the wedding is canceled.

682
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,958
We can hold the wedding again

683
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:57,460
once the cheongsam is ready, okay?

684
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,860
How could you cancel the wedding
just like that?

685
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,958
Look at all the guests out there.

686
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,600
Today was a special date
that we had selected as well.

687
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,399
But Xiang Nan wearing cheongsam

688
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,340
for her wedding was her parents' last wish.

689
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:08,940
How can we be at ease

690
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,219
when Xiang Nan's wedding is in jeopardy?

691
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,219
Dad, stop.

692
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,278
Dad, Mom, don't be angry.

693
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,219
Don't panic.

694
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,879
Xiang Nan's cheongsam

695
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,299
was custom-made, right?

696
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,399
The old tailor

697
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,860
made an inferior version by accident.

698
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,819
I've already asked him about it.
It's still available.

699
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,478
There's just a small imperfection.

700
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,340
Nobody can tell.

701
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,340
I'll head back and take it.

702
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
I'll rush back after that.

703
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,920
She'll only wear it
for the toasting session.

704
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,319
We have to hold the wedding first, right?

705
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,340
Don't you agree?

706
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:43,819
Jiang Hongbin,

707
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,579
all of us doted on Xiang Nan since young.

708
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,700
Yes, I know that.

709
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,779
How can Xiang Nan live with you

710
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,940
if you don't keep your sister in check?

711
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,380
You're right.

712
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,019
Qian, I'm sorry.

713
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,100
Are you okay?

714
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,219
I'm fine.

715
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,539
It's not your fault.

716
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,900
I'll go and touch on my makeup.

717
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,739
Dad, Mom, I'm sorry.

718
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,739
Why are you apologizing to us?

719
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,259
You didn't commit the deed.

720
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:27,940
It's all because I've spoiled my sister.

721
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:28,860
I...

722
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,238
Don't be angry.

723
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,380
Let's leave it at this.

724
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,900
If news of this gets out,

725
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,140
it'll be terrible for our reputation.

726
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,100
Forget it.

727
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,620
What about this? I'll greet the guests first.

728
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,819
You guys should rest first.

729
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:56,019
Enough. Don't be angry.

730
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,380
Please be appeased.

731
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,819
Do it for our child's sake, okay?

732
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,620
Xiang Nan,

733
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,380
are your heels padded?

734
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,900
I didn't bring them with me.
What's the matter?

735
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,039
Sam, it's like this.

736
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,039
Do you guys have insoles

737
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,639
for her high heels?

738
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,799
Why don't we pad it with cotton pads?

739
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,019
That won't do.

740
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,180
She'll get a cramp
if she stands for too long.

741
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,579
What about this?

742
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,579
I'll think of a solution.

743
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll go outside for a while.

744
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,779
I'll head outside now.

745
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,219
Where are you going?

746
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,119
Wait, you...

747
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,399
You can keep our girl company.

748
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,019
Why are you following me?

749
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,460
Wait here. Be a good girl.

750
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,559
Why the rush? Are you blind?

751
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,940
I'm sorry.

752
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:53,958
Miss,

753
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,380
excuse me.

754
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,198
Do you sell any insoles here?

755
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:59,140
No. We only sell clothes here.

756
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:04,819
Madam,

757
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,259
do you sell any insoles here?

758
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,438
Do you sell any insoles here?

759
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:11,340
No.

760
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,398
Hello.

761
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,260
Hello.

762
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,579
I'm here to buy an insole.

763
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,999
Okay. Thank you.

764
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,860
Don't welcome it.

765
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,559
Take care.

766
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,179
Okay.

767
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,099
It's through. But he didn't pick up.

768
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,119
I'm here.

769
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,278
I knew you guys were calling me.

770
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,139
Look at you...

771
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,398
Hurry up.

772
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,959
There weren't any shoe stores nearby.

773
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,460
I had no choice.

774
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,499
Hurry.

775
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,820
What's wrong with her high heels?

776
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,539
Here. Quickly.

777
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:00,179
Okay.

778
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,220
This one.

779
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:03,878
Don't trip yourself.

780
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:04,619
How is it?

781
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,420
Is it more comfortable now?

782
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,678
Here.

783
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,659
Dad.

784
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,639
You ran again, didn't you?

785
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,979
You're sweating profusely.

786
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,619
You shouldn't cry on your big day.

787
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,119
Okay now. Come.

788
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,659
Stand up and give it a try. Come.

789
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,539
All done.

790
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,220
Do you feel better now?

791
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,499
They're the same height now.

792
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:24,059
Alright now. It's almost time. Let's go.

793
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,260
This...

794
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,900
Look at you.

795
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:29,919
I'm fine.

796
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,579
Okay.

797
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,699
I'm fine.

798
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,119
You look great.

799
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,940
Let's depart.

800
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,780
Be happier.

801
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,780
Why isn't Qian back yet?

802
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,559
Let's not wait for her.

803
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,499
Let's go.

804
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,420
Qi, remember to pull her gown.

805
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,059
Come on. Let's go.

806
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,499
Hongbin.

807
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,619
I'll entrust Xiang Nan to you now.

808
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,539
Take care of her

809
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,619
on my behalf, okay?

810
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,019
Dad, don't worry.

811
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,159
Firstly, I would like to thank

812
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,159
everyone

813
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,659
for attending our wedding.

814
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,159
I would also like to thank everyone

815
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,740
for witnessing this moment of joy
together with us.

816
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,900
Now,

817
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,659
please take your seat.

818
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,179
You guys might think it's strange.

819
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,099
We didn't hire a host for our wedding.

820
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,979
She likes the ceremony to be free.

821
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,220
I like it to be simple and natural.

822
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:58,599
Therefore,

823
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,780
we're holding an unconventional wedding.

824
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,639
Once, a friend of mine

825
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,619
asked me this,

826
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,900
"Why are you in a hurry

827
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,059
to marry this girl?"

828
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,820
It's because

829
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,139
I fell in love with her.

830
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,380
To me,

831
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,699
everything about her is perfect.

832
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,340
Today,

833
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,079
I would like everyone

834
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,380
to witness this moment of joy

835
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:26,740
together with me.

836
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,659
I wish to tell Xiang Nan

837
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,820
in a serious tone.

838
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,699
Thank you for saying yes to me.

839
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,740
I want to thank you

840
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,460
for giving me the chance

841
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,940
to look after you
for the rest of my life.

842
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,940
You see,

843
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,519
Dad, Mom, Qian,

844
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,599
why don't you all come up here?

845
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,639
Let's take a family photo.

846
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,619
Okay?

847
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:56,758
Dad, Mom.

848
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,159
Aunt, Zhong, come.
Let's take a picture.

849
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,780
Okay.

850
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,340
Let's go and take a picture.

851
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,659
Come. Get ready.

852
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,099
I'll say "Cheese"!

853
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,559
Three.

854
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,878
Deng Haiyang, call him here.

855
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:15,820
Haiyang!

856
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,820
Haiyang!

857
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,099
Come up here!

858
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:19,919
Come up here!

859
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,940
Hurry!

860
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,499
Haiyang, hurry!

861
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,358
Hurry!

862
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,300
Hurry!

863
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:30,639
Stand over there.

864
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,238
Three, two, one.

865
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,460
Cheese!

866
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,358
Come back on Sunday.

867
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:41,940
Tell me what you want to eat.

868
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,699
We'll see each other again
in a few more days.

869
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,860
Mom.

870
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:48,238
Qian, Zhong, I'll be going now.

871
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,559
Goodbye, Aunt, Uncle.

872
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,238
Goodbye.

873
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:51,979
Goodbye.

874
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,659
We'll be going now.

875
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:57,139
Take care.

876
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,220
Are you being upset now?

877
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:50,179
(Qian,)

878
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,198
(thank you for taking care of me)

879
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,340
(all this while.)

880
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,619
(This is a token of my appreciation.)

881
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,380
