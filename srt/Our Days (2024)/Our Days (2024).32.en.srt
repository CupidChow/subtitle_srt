(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 32=

4
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:39,247
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,047
This is all we can do now

6
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,088
for this case.

7
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:43,728
Don't worry.

8
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,047
Since we have received your report,

9
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:45,607
we will

10
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:47,127
follow up anytime.

11
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,047
However, if you have new

12
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:50,247
or stronger evidence

13
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:51,008
for us,

14
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:52,327
that would be better.

15
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,440
(Police)

16
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:18,008
Come on.

17
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:19,168
Let go!

18
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:20,487
Let go of me!

19
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,168
I'm calling...

20
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,047
Listen to me, go home!

21
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:23,688
Someone, help!

22
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:39,688
Nan.

23
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:43,728
You know how much my pride means to me.

24
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:45,767
If you keep

25
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:46,968
coming to the police station,

26
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:50,008
nasty rumors would spread around.

27
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:51,848
You think this is nasty?

28
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,647
Jiang Hongbin, I'm telling you.

29
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:56,767
I'm sure the law
will put you in your place.

30
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:58,207
Sure.

31
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:00,927
Get the cops to arrest me now.

32
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:02,688
Go!

33
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:07,927
I'm telling you, Xiang Nan.

34
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:09,408
Never have I ever seen

35
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:10,927
an ignorant woman like you.

36
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:14,848
I'm warning you.

37
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,087
My patience has its limits.

38
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:20,568
If you keep this up,

39
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,887
I won't show you any mercy.

40
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:23,807
What will you do?

41
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:26,528
Let me also remind you

42
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:27,887
that we're at the police station.

43
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,047
Try laying a finger on me if you dare.

44
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,920
(Ming Wei)

45
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:17,688
Ming Wei?

46
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,008
Where are you?

47
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:22,888
I need to see you now.

48
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,047
Stop asking so much.

49
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:46,848
Xiang Zhong.

50
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:51,528
Where is Haiyang?

51
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:53,888
I don't know.

52
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:54,367
I haven't

53
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:55,328
contacted him for days.

54
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,528
For days?

55
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:58,088
That means

56
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:59,528
you've been in touch before that?

57
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:00,768
Looks like you two

58
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:01,848
are still pretty close.

59
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,288
We may have gotten a divorce,

60
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,528
but why can't we keep in touch?

61
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,607
Have you had enough, Zhong?

62
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,088
Both of you are divorced.

63
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,528
Why are you still

64
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:11,447
clinging to Haiyang?

65
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,968
Since when did I cling to him?

66
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:14,127
Drop the act.

67
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:15,607
It must have been you

68
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,328
who made Haiyang quit his job!

69
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,328
So many people are
taking the civil servant exams,

70
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:23,927
hoping to secure a well-paid

71
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:24,807
and stable job.

72
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,648
Instead,

73
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,208
he gave up on his job

74
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:28,208
just to pursue you

75
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,247
all the way to Shanghai!

76
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,247
I wonder what you did

77
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:33,728
to bewitch him

78
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,888
so you could manipulate him

79
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,408
again and again.

80
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:38,927
I didn't know

81
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:39,927
that Haiyang quit his job.

82
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:40,567
Also,

83
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,487
no matter what happens to your son,

84
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:42,047
stop looking for me.

85
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:43,288
Wait, don't go!

86
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:44,528
Tell me,

87
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:46,047
where is Haiyang now?

88
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,607
I told you, I don't know.

89
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,367
You're his mother, and you don't know,

90
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:50,288
let alone me,

91
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:51,208
his ex-wife.

92
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,367
You do know you're divorced, after all.

93
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:54,447
While you're looking
for other men outside,

94
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,328
you still have your ex-husband
wrapped around your finger.

95
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:57,288
You cheating,

96
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:58,247
dirty two-timer!

97
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,447
How shameless of you!

98
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:01,367
What are you saying?

99
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:04,927
Fine, I'll cling to him

100
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:05,728
for the rest of my life

101
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:06,848
so he'll never forget me!

102
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:08,528
You shameless woman!

103
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,007
Are you okay?

104
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:37,208
Why get angry for nothing?

105
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,768
This is how you treat an old lady.

106
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,247
I deserve this.

107
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:11,328
I deserve this!

108
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:15,247
What the...

109
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:20,487
I know

110
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,168
you hate me.

111
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,607
Even I hate myself.

112
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:25,127
I...

113
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:27,047
I hate looking at

114
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,408
how I am now.

115
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:33,768
You think I'm doing this

116
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:34,888
for myself?

117
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,528
I'm so tired.

118
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,168
You're not a mother.

119
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:55,567
You

120
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:56,968
can never understand

121
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,088
how it feels to be a mother.

122
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:02,487
Xiang Zhong.

123
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:05,328
Fate brought the both of you together.

124
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:06,968
Since you were once

125
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:08,807
married to Haiyang,

126
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:10,968
I'm begging you

127
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,088
to help me

128
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,127
talk Haiyang out of quitting his job.

129
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,288
He can't survive without it.

130
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:18,728
He'll listen to you.

131
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,247
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

132
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,728
Haiyang is already in his thirties.

133
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:35,447
It's time for you to let go.

134
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:44,687
No matter what he chooses to do,

135
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:46,727
I can't interfere.

136
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:22,888
Hello?

137
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:24,288
Hello?

138
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,528
Your mother is crying
at the apartment's entrance.

139
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:27,847
You should come and talk to her.

140
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,567
What?

141
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,720
(Qianjin Internet of Things)

142
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:49,408
You're about

143
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:50,927
to begin

144
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:51,927
your marriage life.

145
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:53,567
If anything happens,

146
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,168
you have to tell us.

147
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:56,447
Remember this.

148
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:57,608
Only we can bully you.

149
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:58,248
No one else can.

150
00:09:58,488 --> 00:09:59,087
If anyone bullies you,

151
00:09:59,087 --> 00:09:59,768
tell Zhong.

152
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:00,927
She knows wushu.

153
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,768
She can hit and dodge.

154
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:11,927
Miss, who are you looking for?

155
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:13,447
Hello, I'm looking for Xiang Qian.

156
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,207
Come in.

157
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:18,488
Ms. Xiang.

158
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:19,528
Qian.

159
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,047
Nan.

160
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:23,288
What brings you here?

161
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:24,847
I happened to pass by,

162
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:25,567
and I was missing you,

163
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:26,488
so I came to see you.

164
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,687
You glib-tongued girl.

165
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:29,888
Have a seat.

166
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:35,927
Hello?

167
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:37,567
I called you

168
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:38,327
to tell you

169
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:40,008
that the two people
I interviewed today were okay.

170
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,327
Do you have time tomorrow?

171
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:42,408
Let me arrange a time

172
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:43,528
for you to interview them.

173
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:44,727
Okay.

174
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:45,447
Sure.

175
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,047
I'll set up the interview, then.

176
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:51,567
You've just set up your office,

177
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:52,888
and you're already so busy.

178
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,128
Not really.

179
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:58,927
You came at the right time.

180
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:01,888
Recently, we're negotiating a deal

181
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,008
with Jiang Hongbin.

182
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:03,727
Did you know this?

183
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:07,008
He didn't tell you?

184
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,047
There's an urban redevelopment project

185
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,008
in Kunshan,

186
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,687
and there are two segments

187
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,047
that Chai Jin and I are interested in.

188
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:22,528
I...

189
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,047
I didn't expect

190
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:26,608
that you two would work together.

191
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,207
He's in real estate,

192
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:29,567
and I'm in the smart home industry.

193
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:30,727
Of course we could work together.

194
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,168
Of course,
we made it clear that we'll keep

195
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:34,128
work and family separate.

196
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,768
We'll only collaborate

197
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:36,727
if there's a suitable plan.

198
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,327
I won't put you in an awkward spot.

199
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,047
I need to go through

200
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,687
this final document,

201
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:47,248
and after this,

202
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:48,447
we can grab lunch.

203
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:52,047
No need.

204
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:54,207
I just happened to pass by,

205
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:54,768
and I just remembered

206
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:56,248
that I'm meeting a client.

207
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:57,888
I'd better not make them wait.

208
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,567
Nan.

209
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,008
You seem to have lost some weight.

210
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:06,967
What's going on?

211
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,528
Working on a creative project?

212
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,087
Diets are not for you.

213
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,047
You need to eat healthily.

214
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:11,888
You're getting skinny.

215
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:14,447
Okay.

216
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,368
I need to go.

217
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:17,447
I'll let you get back to work.

218
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:18,047
Remember to eat regularly.

219
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:18,727
Don't worry.

220
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:20,008
Oh, right.

221
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:21,687
I just remembered.

222
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,888
I just set up my own business,

223
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,488
so shouldn't you give me a present?

224
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,927
What can I give you?

225
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:30,488
I...

226
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:32,567
I can make you

227
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,687
a golden toad, then.

228
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,447
What toad?

229
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,368
I don't want that.

230
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,207
That sounds so tacky.

231
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,327
How could my sister make that for me?

232
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:41,408
To me, you are

233
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:43,207
a true artist.

234
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,807
Let me think.

235
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,807
Just get me your proudest

236
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,087
and favorite

237
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:51,168
piece of work.

238
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:52,528
I'll put it in my office.

239
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,128
Okay.

240
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,368
I'll keep that in mind.

241
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:56,927
Someone's calling me.

242
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:57,967
I need to go.

243
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:00,768
This girl

244
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:02,207
is acting weird.

245
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:18,807
Yi Yi.

246
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,408
You're already leaving?

247
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:26,128
It's time for me to go home.

248
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,168
Xu Miao already went back this morning.

249
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:29,927
She said she called you,
but you didn't pick up.

250
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:32,888
I didn't check my phone.

251
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:37,927
I didn't even get to say

252
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,768
goodbye to her.

253
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,207
The three of us

254
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:42,648
haven't had

255
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,047
a proper meal

256
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:45,687
to bid each other farewell.

257
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,327
We're going to meet again.

258
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:48,847
We're just going home,

259
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:49,967
not bidding farewell forever.

260
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:51,687
You can visit us anytime.

261
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,648
It's all my fault.

262
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:56,528
I was planning

263
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,447
to work with you girls

264
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:00,087
and set up

265
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,128
our own business together,

266
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,087
but I got you involved in this mess.

267
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:06,967
Miao almost got...

268
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:09,687
It's all over.

269
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,087
Miao will be fine after some time.

270
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:13,608
You too.

271
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:15,608
Get a divorce soon

272
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,807
and visit us.

273
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:18,327
We'll start over.

274
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:26,567
Yi Yi.

275
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:28,687
Take care.

276
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:31,248
Send me a message if anything happens.

277
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,520
(Dad)

278
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:17,967
Hello, Dad?

279
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:18,687
What is it?

280
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:19,888
Nan,

281
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,807
you secretive girl.

282
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:24,727
Why didn't you tell me

283
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:26,327
something this huge?

284
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:28,608
What is it?

285
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,087
What is it, you ask me?

286
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,288
There's an urban redevelopment
project slated here,

287
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,687
and I heard from Gu

288
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,488
that everything from demolition,

289
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:36,368
relocation, and rebuilding

290
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:37,447
will be handled by

291
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:38,567
Jiang Hongbin's company.

292
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:44,768
I don't know much

293
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:45,807
about his company's work.

294
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:46,927
Nan.

295
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:49,288
You should bring Hongbin

296
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:50,248
back home this weekend

297
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:52,888
for lunch.

298
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,168
I can also

299
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:55,327
ask him

300
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,567
about his plans,

301
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,567
the compensation,

302
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:01,207
and also

303
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:02,087
the relocation details.

304
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,608
What are the conditions

305
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:05,288
that he'll put on the table?

306
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:06,447
Let me get the details

307
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:07,447
so I can share them

308
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:08,368
to our neighbors.

309
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:16,008
Nan.

310
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:17,528
Hello, Nan?

311
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,207
Are you listening?

312
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:22,648
Dad, I'm listening.

313
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:24,567
Jiang

314
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:25,927
is pretty busy.

315
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,087
Even so,

316
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:29,567
he can make some time

317
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:30,648
for lunch, right?

318
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:32,488
Nan.

319
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,408
Your mother misses you.

320
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:39,567
Okay.

321
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:40,368
I'll talk to him.

322
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:41,447
Sure.

323
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:43,008
I'll let you get back to work.

324
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:56,727
I'm begging you.

325
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,408
Put a lid on your mouth

326
00:16:58,528 --> 00:16:59,408
and keep it tight.

327
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:00,648
Please. Cheers.

328
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:01,807
Since when have I blabbered?

329
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:04,567
Qian Feng.

330
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:07,368
Skinny.

331
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:08,047
Mrs. Deng.

332
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:09,767
Isn't Deng hanging out

333
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:10,408
with you today?

334
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,687
He hasn't got the time for that.

335
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:13,088
He's been

336
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:14,888
so busy...

337
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,088
What did I tell you?

338
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,408
He's had too much to drink.

339
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:19,727
Let's talk over here. What is it?

340
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:20,247
Here's the thing.

341
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:21,527
Why did Haiyang

342
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:22,168
quit his job?

343
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:23,527
I messaged him to ask,

344
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:24,328
but he didn't reply.

345
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,168
Mrs. Deng, I...

346
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:28,408
It's not that he's not replying you.

347
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:29,727
I guess...

348
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,128
He's busy making money.

349
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:33,447
Once he sees your message,

350
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:34,368
I'm sure he will

351
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:35,168
reply you right away.

352
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:36,648
Making money?

353
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:38,447
What money?

354
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,287
He hasn't even started working,

355
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:41,767
and his mom got a stroke.

356
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,007
What happened?

357
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:46,207
Why are you pointing at me?

358
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:47,048
You're the one

359
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:47,767
who's always

360
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:48,687
spouting nonsense.

361
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,168
Why can't I tell her?

362
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,048
Why can't I?

363
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:53,487
Besides, Haiyang

364
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:54,608
needs some help now.

365
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,767
Come on, we can talk.

366
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:57,368
No fighting.

367
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:58,207
Qian Feng!

368
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,328
You hit me?

369
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:00,328
You...

370
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,048
That's enough.

371
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:11,808
I was wrong.

372
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:12,888
I'll drink this as punishment.

373
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,487
Tell me now,

374
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,487
what's going on?

375
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:26,648
Mrs. Deng,

376
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:28,408
after I'm done telling you,

377
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:31,568
promise me that you won't get worked up.

378
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:34,487
Here's the thing.

379
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:36,967
A few days ago,

380
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:39,128
Haiyang's mother
went to the beauty salon.

381
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,648
For some unknown reason,

382
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:42,608
she got into an argument,

383
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:46,368
and for some other reason,

384
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:47,487
she suddenly

385
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:50,888
fell to the ground.

386
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:53,767
Haiyang

387
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:56,687
kept telling me

388
00:18:58,568 --> 00:18:59,927
not to tell you,

389
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:02,888
or else you'd get really,

390
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:04,328
really worried.

391
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:18,727
Why did I say that?

392
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:20,487
Hit me.

393
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:24,287
I'll have another mug as punishment.

394
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,088
You've been gorging on the crabs.

395
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:07,727
Nan.

396
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:18,927
It's only me.

397
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:38,687
Nan,

398
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,088
are you closing your workshop?

399
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:43,888
Everyone has left,

400
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,687
so what's the point of keeping it open?

401
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:46,888
It's shutting down for good.

402
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,687
Have you told your family?

403
00:20:58,727 --> 00:20:59,888
I haven't told them.

404
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:02,168
Where are you going, then?

405
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,487
I'll just crash at a friend's place.

406
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:06,328
Did he tell you to come?

407
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:07,168
No.

408
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,128
I wanted to see you.

409
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:13,088
Thank you.

410
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:14,487
Nan.

411
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:16,368
On behalf of my brother...

412
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,727
On behalf of Jiang Hongbin,

413
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:18,808
I'd like to apologize.

414
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:20,527
I know sorry

415
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:21,527
doesn't mean a thing now,

416
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,128
but

417
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,608
I'm saying it anyway.

418
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:28,207
He's been drunk for the past few days.

419
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:29,727
I've never seen him

420
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:30,808
bawling like that.

421
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:31,608
So?

422
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:32,608
Just because he's been drinking,

423
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:33,848
and I have to go back?

424
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,287
That doesn't work on me.

425
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:38,007
Even if he drinks himself to death,

426
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,128
I'll never go back.

427
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:40,447
I'll never forgive him.

428
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:41,368
No, that's not it.

429
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,287
That's not what I meant.

430
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:43,568
I just wanted to tell you

431
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:45,207
that he still loves you,

432
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:46,247
and that he cares about you.

433
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,808
Jiaqiao, that's not love.

434
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:51,487
To me,

435
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,247
love is, first of all, respect.

436
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:57,408
I understand.

437
00:21:58,927 --> 00:21:59,727
I understand.

438
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
I'm so sorry, Nan.

439
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,408
Jiaqiao, it's not your fault.

440
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:09,888
Why do you keep

441
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:10,967
saying sorry to me?

442
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:12,608
No, I did something wrong!

443
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,168
I should have gone upstairs that night!

444
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,328
I should have gone upstairs that night!

445
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:22,888
Ms. He!

446
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,128
I'll make you do

447
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:25,048
what you don't want to do!

448
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:26,128
Jiaqiao!

449
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:27,648
Ms. He!

450
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:30,967
Help! Let go of me!

451
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,048
Help!

452
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:34,608
Jiaqiao!

453
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:35,687
Jiaqiao!

454
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:44,687
But I didn't.

455
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:46,368
I was on my way upstairs,

456
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,767
but I simply froze in place.

457
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:48,287
I...

458
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:50,328
I...

459
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:52,048
I'm so sorry.

460
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:53,927
I was...

461
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:56,967
I was so scared, too.

462
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:00,447
I'm so sorry, Nan.

463
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:01,568
I'm really sorry.

464
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:04,767
I accept your apology.

465
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:08,447
I do.

466
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:13,767
Nan.

467
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:16,128
If you find yourself

468
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:17,328
in any trouble next time,

469
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:18,168
tell me,

470
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:18,808
okay?

471
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:21,487
I hope you can still trust me.

472
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:24,408
You really mean a lot to me.

473
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:24,848
I...

474
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,487
I don't want to lose

475
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:27,487
a friend in you.

476
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:31,848
Okay?

477
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,168
Thank you, Jiaqiao.

478
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:42,048
I wish you all the best.

479
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,247
I hope that your relationship

480
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,527
will be fruitful in the end.

481
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:53,608
I'm off.

482
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:56,168
Nan...

483
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,527
Nan.

484
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:03,088
Nan...

485
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:05,447
Nan.

486
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:06,687
Nan, I...

487
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,328
I'm sorry, Nan.

488
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:15,568
I'm sorry.

489
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:24,888
I'm sorry, Nan.

490
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,080
(Outpatient)

491
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:46,687
The operation

492
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,048
was successful,

493
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:48,888
but she didn't wake up.

494
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:50,168
Did the doctor say

495
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:51,007
when she'll wake up?

496
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:52,687
We don't know for sure.

497
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:55,007
Maybe in a few days,

498
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:57,247
maybe in a few weeks.

499
00:24:58,487 --> 00:24:59,648
It's that serious?

500
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:05,767
Are you happy now?

501
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:09,447
My mother just
wanted to ask you something.

502
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:11,168
Why did you argue with her?

503
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:13,048
Hey, what do you mean?

504
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:14,447
You're blaming your mom's stroke

505
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:15,128
on me?

506
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:15,848
Who else?

507
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:17,328
Who else, then?

508
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,447
Me?

509
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:19,767
You know

510
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:20,608
her temper.

511
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:22,568
She can be hot-headed.

512
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,007
Couldn't you have just
let her ramble for a while?

513
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:25,247
There you go now.

514
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:26,608
She's lying motionless on bed.

515
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,128
Happy now?

516
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:28,328
That's a weird thing to say,

517
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:29,168
Haiyang.

518
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,247
You think I don't know

519
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,328
that your mother fainted

520
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:32,168
in the beauty salon?

521
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:33,128
How could you blame me?

522
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:34,007
What's wrong with you?

523
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,287
Does that matter?

524
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:38,328
She's in there now.

525
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:39,527
Get out of here.

526
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:40,648
I don't want to see you.

527
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:42,048
Also,

528
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:43,247
stop coming to the hospital.

529
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,447
Your hypocritical

530
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:45,648
behavior

531
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:47,368
is not needed here.

532
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:52,888
Fine.

533
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:54,247
Sure.

534
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:08,808
I just got here,

535
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,128
and you made her stomp off?

536
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:12,408
I told you

537
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,487
not to tell her.

538
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:14,888
Why did you tell her?

539
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:22,608
What's the situation like now?

540
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:24,487
The doctor said that even if

541
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:27,128
my mother wakes up,

542
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,368
she may be partially paralyzed,

543
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:30,848
and there's a huge possibility

544
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:33,007
that she won't be
able to take care of herself.

545
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,888
That would be such a heavy burden,

546
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,287
why would I want her

547
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:39,527
to suffer with me?

548
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:46,848
I know you deliberately

549
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:49,927
made your ex-wife mad.

550
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,527
You did that

551
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,687
to make her loathe you.

552
00:26:58,247 --> 00:26:59,527
But, don't you think

553
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:02,527
this is hard on yourself?

554
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:10,207
Not at all.

555
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:13,207
Seeing her

556
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:14,287
being happy now

557
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:16,608
makes me glad.

558
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:19,687
After so many years,

559
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:26,287
Zhong has finally found

560
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:27,967
the kind of lifestyle she wants.

561
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:32,967
How nice.

562
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:40,287
Grandma!

563
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:41,368
Grandma!

564
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:42,247
Sweetie.

565
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,048
Grandma.

566
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:45,287
From now on, my name is not Gao Sicong,

567
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:46,767
but Xiang Sicong.

568
00:27:46,888 --> 00:27:47,568
Mom said

569
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:48,927
that by doing so,

570
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:50,967
we'll be together forever.

571
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,128
How nice.

572
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:54,287
Let me massage your back.

573
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:55,808
Qian, here.

574
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:57,007
Look.

575
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:58,408
What...

576
00:27:59,408 --> 00:28:00,527
Are we expecting a guest?

577
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:03,128
Jiang Hongbin is coming today,

578
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:04,207
probably to talk to us

579
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:05,767
about the relocation.

580
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:06,368
Besides,

581
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:07,767
he loves my cooking, right?

582
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,048
I'm waiting for the fish

583
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,848
and pork to cook.

584
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:10,608
We've got everything.

585
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:12,088
There's more?

586
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,727
We already have crabs, prawns,

587
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:16,287
chicken, beef,

588
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:17,287
and pork ribs on the table.

589
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:18,687
This is obviously

590
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,048
preferential treatment.

591
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:22,368
Don't sound so salty.

592
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,888
I just realized that our table

593
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:31,408
still needs

594
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:33,207
a vegetable dish.

595
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:34,967
What should I do?

596
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:37,568
Guess who's going to help me?

597
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:38,967
Well?

598
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,287
You always forget buying the vegetables.

599
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:41,247
All the time.

600
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:43,848
I didn't do that on purpose...

601
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:47,648
This isn't the first time.

602
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:48,888
Dad.

603
00:28:50,888 --> 00:28:51,767
By the way,

604
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:54,247
I've changed the kids' surnames.

605
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:56,767
There's beef here.

606
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:05,727
Qian.

607
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:10,048
Why are you here on a bike?

608
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,048
My work requires me to sit every day,

609
00:29:12,128 --> 00:29:12,888
so I'm exercising.

610
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:15,568
What are you doing?

611
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,568
Dad is acting suspiciously.

612
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:19,328
Every time he calls us back for lunch,

613
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:21,447
he'd make all sorts of dishes,

614
00:29:21,848 --> 00:29:23,767
but would always
forget about the vegetables.

615
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:24,487
Do you think

616
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:25,408
he was actually

617
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,568
asking our spouses

618
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,007
about our married lives?

619
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:32,408
He can do as he likes.

620
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:33,247
The only son-in-law

621
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,168
he has now is Jiang Hongbin.

622
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:39,088
Has Deng Haiyang

623
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,048
replied you yet?

624
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:42,967
It doesn't matter.

625
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:46,848
Is that a yes or no?

626
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:49,767
I realized

627
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:50,687
that whenever his mother is around,

628
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:51,888
he'd become the mommy's boy he is.

629
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:55,168
His parents,

630
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:56,848
and ours, actually,

631
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:58,727
constantly worry

632
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,888
about their children.

633
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,207
All that worrying,

634
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:03,727
and they...

635
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:05,527
What can they change?

636
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:07,568
Whatever will be,

637
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:08,608
will be.

638
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,927
If I have a son-in-law

639
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:12,888
or a daughter-in-law in the future...

640
00:30:13,927 --> 00:30:14,727
I can have both of them.

641
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:17,368
I'll stay out completely

642
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:18,808
of my children's affairs.

643
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,088
They can take care of themselves.

644
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:23,727
Yes,

645
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:25,568
you'll grow to become

646
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:26,608
a cute old lady.

647
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:29,088
I'm not going to worry
about them constantly.

648
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,608
There's not much we can do.

649
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:46,287
Nan?

650
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:47,927
Qian, Zhong.

651
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:48,967
Why are you standing here?

652
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:50,287
Why aren't you going in?

653
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:51,608
I'm waiting for you.

654
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:54,168
Really?

655
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:56,048
Where's Jiang Hongbin?

656
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:00,247
He's probably busy.

657
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:04,128
You look like you're in low spirits.

658
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:06,487
Here.

659
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:08,927
Hongbin.

660
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,848
I guess our house

661
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:14,967
is bound to be redeveloped.

662
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:16,368
I can't help it, Dad.

663
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:17,927
It's all part of the government's plan.

664
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,088
We're just cooperating.

665
00:31:19,568 --> 00:31:20,207
Yes, yes.

666
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:21,967
It's best if everyone
gets compensated well.

667
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,128
We'll

668
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:25,447
miss this place.

669
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:29,648
Hongbin, you're already here?

670
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:31,368
Qian.

671
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:32,447
Come on.

672
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,487
You've brought the veggies.

673
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:34,207
Nan.

674
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,527
You're finally here.

675
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:44,848
What's wrong?

676
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,767
Did you bully my sister?

677
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:54,927
No.

678
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:56,967
Nan and I

679
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:57,808
had a little tiff,

680
00:31:58,048 --> 00:31:58,888
but we're okay now.

681
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:00,927
What's wrong?

682
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:11,328
I wanted to have a child,

683
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:12,808
and I got too worked up.

684
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:15,368
Nan, how about this?

685
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:17,408
Since your family is here,

686
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:18,808
I'll apologize again.

687
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:20,007
I was wrong.

688
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:20,767
Okay?

689
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:29,527
Nan.

690
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:31,328
It's time to have children.

691
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:33,368
Well, everyone's here.

692
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:34,767
I'll cook some veggies.

693
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,287
Let's go inside.

694
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:40,848
Where's Mom?

695
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:41,848
Mom?

696
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,207
She's looking after the kids inside.

697
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:53,608
Cut back on the alcohol.

698
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:54,568
Time to eat.

699
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:55,048
I'm happy today.

700
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:56,168
That calls for wine.

701
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,128
Mom, and you?

702
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:58,088
No, I cannot drink.

703
00:32:58,088 --> 00:32:58,568
We're here.

704
00:32:58,568 --> 00:32:59,687
Take your seats.

705
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:00,888
Nan, over here.

706
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,048
Come on, sit down.

707
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:02,888
Where's your seat?

708
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:03,648
Come on.

709
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:04,808
Sit down.

710
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:05,808
I...

711
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:07,368
I'll sit with Mom.

712
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:09,368
Here, Qian.

713
00:33:09,408 --> 00:33:10,848
I can keep an eye on the kids here.

714
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:11,808
Sit down, Nan.

715
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:12,848
Okay.

716
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:13,848
You're Mommy's daughter alright.

717
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:16,128
Qian, want some wine?

718
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:17,767
Just a little.

719
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,967
Just a little bit.

720
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:21,048
Dad.

721
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:23,048
I'll be working with Qian

722
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:23,927
very soon.

723
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:25,328
Working?

724
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:25,727
Yes.

725
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:27,247
What are you working on together?

726
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:28,527
Her company's operations

727
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,608
are what our current project needs.

728
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:33,007
That's great.

729
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:33,848
That's wonderful.

730
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:35,408
The family is working together.

731
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:36,048
Come on.

732
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,368
About the urban redevelopment project,

733
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:40,368
we're still working on bidding,

734
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:41,687
and we'll come up with a good proposal.

735
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:42,207
No problem.

736
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:42,568
Great.

737
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:43,048
Cheers.

738
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:44,328
This is worth celebrating.

739
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:45,767
Come on.

740
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:46,687
Come on, Nan.

741
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:48,007
Come on.

742
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:49,088
Come on.

743
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:49,648
Nice.

744
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:51,088
Cheers to all of you.

745
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,687
Okay.

746
00:33:53,168 --> 00:33:53,687
Okay.

747
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:56,767
Come on.

748
00:33:58,408 --> 00:33:58,848
Dad.

749
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:00,527
Do you like the wine?

750
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,088
It's fantastic.

751
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:04,408
I recently got

752
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:05,447
some vintage wine.

753
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:06,848
If you're interested,

754
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:07,888
I can bring them here.

755
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:09,408
Don't bring them all here.

756
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:10,368
Come on.

757
00:34:10,368 --> 00:34:11,408
Dig in.

758
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:12,608
Dad.

759
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:14,648
After this meal,

760
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:15,968
I will be quitting alcohol.

761
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:17,488
Quitting alcohol?

762
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:17,968
Yes.

763
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,008
We need to consider
for our future generation.

764
00:34:22,048 --> 00:34:23,048
Nan and I have decided

765
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:24,207
to have a baby.

766
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:29,528
You're already planning?

767
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:33,887
Mom,

768
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:35,528
Nan is still hesitating.

769
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:39,008
(I don't want to live
with someone like you.)

770
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:39,687
(Let alone have a child)

771
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,327
(with someone like you.)

772
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:42,008
(I'm telling you,)

773
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:43,407
(you are twisted!)

774
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:45,608
You are crazy.

775
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,568
Jiang Hongbin, let go of me!

776
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:49,687
You beast!

777
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:50,807
Jiaqiao!

778
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:52,648
Jiang Hongbin!

779
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:57,887
Jiang Hongbin, let go of me!

780
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,407
Jiang Hongbin, you beast!

781
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:01,048
(Me, crazy?)

782
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:02,687
I'll show you how crazy I am!

783
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:05,008
That's wonderful.

784
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:08,247
Nan.

785
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,048
What's wrong?

786
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,088
Hongbin, since
you've just gotten married,

787
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:45,407
I think you can enjoy for a year or two

788
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:46,448
before having children.

789
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:47,847
Nan is still young, right?

790
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:51,367
What era is it now?

791
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,207
Why rush to have kids?

792
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:53,048
Let me check on her.

793
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:55,968
Come on.

794
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:56,767
Here, Dad.

795
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:57,687
Enjoy.

796
00:35:57,687 --> 00:35:59,048
Grandma, where did they go?

797
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:08,247
What's wrong with you?

798
00:36:09,287 --> 00:36:09,807
Qian.

799
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:13,287
Are you pregnant or...

800
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:15,847
What's wrong?

801
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:20,807
I'm planning to get a divorce.

802
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:23,048
I...

803
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:25,448
I...

804
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:26,287
What's wrong?

805
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:28,367
Just seeing him makes me want to puke.

806
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:33,287
What did he...

807
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:34,287
Did he have an affair?

808
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:39,448
He hit me.

809
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:44,968
He even...

810
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:48,608
He raped me.

811
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:55,528
I really

812
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:57,048
don't know what else to do.

813
00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:58,648
He's driven everyone else

814
00:36:58,687 --> 00:36:59,727
away from me.

815
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,327
My workshop is closed for good.

816
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:01,887
I...

817
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,168
I don't know why,

818
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:05,247
but when I see him,

819
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:06,608
I just feel awful.

820
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:10,448
Qian, what should I do?

821
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,488
My phone is with me.

822
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:14,287
I can leave now.

823
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:14,767
I...

824
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:15,648
I can leave my stuff here.

825
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,528
I'm taking Nan away now.

826
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:17,168
Go ahead.

827
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:17,887
I...

828
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:23,648
Mom, have some pork ribs.

829
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:24,048
I'll take myself.

830
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:25,807
The three of them...

831
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:27,407
It's okay.

832
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:28,568
They've always been like this.

833
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:29,767
She's probably still upset,

834
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:31,327
but she'll be fine soon.

835
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:32,807
I had a tiff with Nan.

836
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:34,608
Do forgive her.

837
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:35,608
Don't worry.

838
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:41,448
Nan?

839
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:44,488
Nan?

840
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:46,128
Let's go.

841
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:47,168
I'll block him.

842
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:48,887
Nan?

843
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:53,687
You're crazy.

844
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:54,207
You beast!

845
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:01,367
Out of my way.

846
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,287
I'm warning you,

847
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:04,448
stay away from Nan!

848
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:05,287
This is between me and her.

849
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:05,767
Don't butt in!

850
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:07,528
Zhong!

851
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:07,887
Go away!

852
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:08,407
Zhong!

853
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,168
Zhong!

854
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:10,327
Give me that!

855
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:13,568
What's going on?

856
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:14,767
What's going on?

857
00:38:17,727 --> 00:38:18,207
Hongbin.

858
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:20,168
What's going on exactly?

859
00:38:28,887 --> 00:38:29,928
Where's Nan and Qian?

860
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:32,767
(Xiang Qian: We're in the car now.)

861
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:35,767
What's going on?

862
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:43,767
You'll get your retribution!

863
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:51,528
What happened?

864
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:52,327
Dad.

865
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:53,048
What happened?

866
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:53,968
Stop asking.

867
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:54,648
What's going on?

868
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:55,407
Stop asking.

869
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:56,367
How can I not ask?

870
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:57,488
Tell me!

871
00:38:57,847 --> 00:38:59,287
Tell me what's going on!

872
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:00,968
Speak!

873
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:09,088
Nan got raped.

874
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:13,608
What did you say?

875
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:26,448
Have you spoken to a lawyer

876
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,648
to file a divorce?

877
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:33,928
No.

878
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:39,648
If that's the case,

879
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:40,727
the law

880
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,488
would assume that their marriage

881
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:43,608
is still in force.

882
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:45,367
In such a situation,

883
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:46,887
this incident can be seen as

884
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:47,847
sexual intercourse within marriage,

885
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,448
and it is hard to define

886
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:51,807
whether it is marital rape.

887
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:54,048
It is also harder to procure evidence.

888
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:55,568
Do you have other evidence?

889
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:56,767
Perhaps something more direct?

890
00:39:57,207 --> 00:39:58,448
Like what?

891
00:39:58,767 --> 00:39:59,928
Video recordings, eye witnesses.

892
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:01,528
For example,

893
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:03,528
when Nan was assaulted,

894
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,687
was there someone else

895
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:05,528
or a witness,

896
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:07,807
or are there any

897
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:08,807
clear audio recordings

898
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:09,528
or videos

899
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:11,247
that can prove Jiang Hongbin

900
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:12,608
did resort to violence

901
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:14,088
to force her against her will?

902
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:15,568
How is that possible?

903
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:16,568
Who would get raped

904
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:17,367
and take videos at the same time?

905
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:26,847
Qian.

906
00:40:27,568 --> 00:40:28,807
I'll be straightforward here.

907
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:31,648
From a legal perspective,

908
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:33,407
it is extremely difficult

909
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:34,807
to prove that Jiang Hongbin

910
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:35,528
did commit marital rape.

911
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:37,407
To tell you the truth,

912
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:39,008
even if you make a police report,

913
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:40,968
the police can't file your case.

914
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:48,648
Well then, Mr. Wu,

915
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:50,847
what do you suggest?

916
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:53,088
Right now, you have

917
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:54,207
an injury assessment report.

918
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:56,448
If there's a clear chain

919
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:57,767
of evidence of domestic violence,

920
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,568
you can bargain for more rights

921
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:00,928
during your

922
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:03,648
divorce proceedings.

923
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:05,048
Just getting a divorce

924
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,168
is letting him off the hook.

925
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:07,448
I agree,

926
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:08,608
and I understand.

927
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,207
But as a lawyer,

928
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:12,088
I believe that

929
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:13,287
filing for divorce

930
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:15,407
is your best choice now,

931
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,568
and the best way to protect her.

932
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:33,128
Nan is feeling better now.

933
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:34,807
Don't worry, Mom.

934
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:35,448
Zhong and I

935
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:36,488
will keep her company tonight.

936
00:41:36,648 --> 00:41:37,727
They're staying with me.

937
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:38,968
Okay.

938
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:40,887
Keep her company, then.

939
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,407
The kids are asleep.

940
00:41:43,887 --> 00:41:45,088
Thank you, Mom.

941
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:46,168
I'm fine.

942
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:47,128
So,

943
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:49,727
how was your talk with the lawyer?

944
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:55,287
Right now, if we want

945
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:57,887
to sue him,

946
00:41:58,247 --> 00:41:59,767
we don't have enough evidence,

947
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,648
and we need to gather more.

948
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:06,968
You really can't
judge a book by its cover.

949
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,687
How could he do that?

950
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,287
Don't tell Dad

951
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:13,887
about all this yet.

952
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:15,088
We're still handling it.

953
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:16,528
Everything is uncertain now.

954
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,008
Dad's having some

955
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:19,128
heart problems, right?

956
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:21,568
If he hears about what happened to Nan,

957
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:22,727
he'd get all worked up,

958
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:25,128
so don't tell him yet, okay?

959
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:26,448
Sure, don't worry.

960
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:27,367
I won't tell him.

961
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,807
Your dad feels bad for Nan.

962
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:32,247
He's been having
chest pain the whole day.

963
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:34,247
I gave him some medicine earlier

964
