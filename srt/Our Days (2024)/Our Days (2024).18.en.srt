00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 18=

4
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:49,902
Zhong,

5
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:51,781
my mother,

6
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,182
do you think

7
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:55,581
she's gone overboard?

8
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,021
I'll head back and tell her about it.

9
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:00,301
I'll tell her to stop messing around.

10
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,941
If it doesn't work out,

11
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:06,501
you can also beat me up right now.

12
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,261
Most importantly,

13
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:14,422
you should be appeased,

14
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:15,981
okay?

15
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:16,661
It's pointless to beat you up.

16
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:18,862
That's not it. If so...

17
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:22,142
Think about it.

18
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:22,701
Actually,

19
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:23,622
if you think about it,

20
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:25,582
my mother is quite old now.

21
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,062
She has it quite rough, you know?

22
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:28,302
I'm having it rough too.

23
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,742
Where did the child go?

24
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,462
She's not answering our calls either.

25
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:17,981
Xiang Zhong.

26
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:20,462
Why didn't you answer my call?

27
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,302
Reply to me immediately.

28
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:25,582
Did you include everything
in the voice message?

29
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:28,821
Wasn't I clear enough?

30
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:32,261
Enough already.

31
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:33,501
What kind of child is this?

32
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,422
Our child.

33
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,622
All of them are just like you.

34
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,381
Alright now.

35
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,142
What are you guys doing here?

36
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,582
Xiang Zhong.

37
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:53,261
Where have you been?

38
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:54,422
Xiang Zhong.

39
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,062
I...

40
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:56,381
Why didn't you answer my calls?

41
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,501
I left my phone in the office.

42
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:00,742
Alright now.

43
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:01,862
Take her back home.

44
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,342
I'll retrieve her phone.

45
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:04,661
You don't need to head inside.

46
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:06,582
My colleague will deliver it to me.

47
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:07,582
If so...

48
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:08,981
If so, you...

49
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:10,062
You guys can head back.

50
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:11,582
I wish to be alone for now.

51
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:13,742
Alright, then.

52
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:15,261
You can have some time alone.

53
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,501
Just tell us anytime

54
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:19,182
if you wish to eat or drink something,

55
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:19,941
okay?

56
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,701
Got it. You guys should head back.

57
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,302
Be careful, okay?

58
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:32,381
Let's go.

59
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:33,821
Look at the child.

60
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:34,982
She's upset.

61
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,261
But she's not telling us about it.

62
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:37,501
Look at you.

63
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,381
Why are you upset as well?

64
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:41,862
Enough already.

65
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:43,662
Aren't you upset yourself?

66
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:44,222
I...

67
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,222
I'm just...

68
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:48,782
I...

69
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:49,501
What about this?

70
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,422
You can lay your hand on my shoulder.

71
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:51,742
Walk while holding my shoulder.

72
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:53,742
I'll be fine.

73
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:54,581
You can't exert any strength like this.

74
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:55,862
Hold my shoulder.

75
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,021
Luckily, I have you by my side.

76
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:20,941
Mom.

77
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:22,862
Son, why are you...

78
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:23,862
Don't exit the car.

79
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:24,782
You'll get yourself hurt again.

80
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,862
How can I not exit the car?

81
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:28,341
Look at the mess you've made.

82
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,862
How can I remain in the company
in the future?

83
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:31,742
You think I did this of my own accord?

84
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,341
You think it's not embarrassing for me?

85
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,222
I was a public figure once, you know?

86
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,141
I told you already.

87
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,381
She turned you into a cuckold,

88
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,102
yet you didn't dare to say anything.

89
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,302
To deal with a person like her,

90
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:44,782
you have to argue with her.

91
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,062
You have to let everyone know

92
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,381
the kind of person she is.

93
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,302
I'm speechless.

94
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:48,901
Why did you...

95
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:50,261
Why did you have to

96
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,021
go against her?

97
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,381
I'll go against anyone

98
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:53,302
who bullies my son.

99
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,701
You may be able to tolerate her actions,

100
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:56,782
but I cannot.

101
00:05:58,501 --> 00:05:59,381
Come, let's go home.

102
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,742
What are you saying?

103
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:01,261
Get in the car.

104
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:02,381
What car?

105
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:03,102
I rented this, you know?

106
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:04,102
I have to return it.

107
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,542
I'll pay it for you.

108
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:06,501
Get in the car.

109
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:07,501
It's embarrassing already.

110
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,141
Hurry up.

111
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:09,102
You're being generous, huh?

112
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:09,941
How much money do you have?

113
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:10,701
You want to pay it for me?

114
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,141
Hey, you're on
the wrong side of the road.

115
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,141
I'm trying to go against the odds here.

116
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,581
Dad told me to help you apply for leave.

117
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:27,862
Come with me.

118
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:30,461
I'm not leaving.

119
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:31,501
I'm not going anywhere.

120
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,102
Stop being stubborn, okay?

121
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:37,182
Kunshan

122
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:38,182
is a small place.

123
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:39,542
No matter if you or our parents

124
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,021
are leaving the house,

125
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:43,701
there's no need to listen

126
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:44,662
to those rumors.

127
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,542
They can say whatever they want to say.

128
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:47,622
I'm not afraid of them.

129
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:50,422
Is Deng Haiyang's mother

130
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:51,182
sick in the head?

131
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:52,302
Has she lost her mind?

132
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:57,581
Why am I so unlucky?

133
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:58,422
I got myself involved

134
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,261
with such an unreasonable family.

135
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:00,742
I think

136
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:01,422
this might be a good thing.

137
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:02,622
The timing is perfect.

138
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:04,102
Now, you have a reason

139
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,542
to press charges against him
and file for a divorce.

140
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,141
Who can tolerate
living in such a family?

141
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:10,501
You can also press charges against her
for slandering you.

142
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:13,501
Listen to me, okay? Come with me.

143
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,501
Let's calm down for a few days
and think about

144
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:18,461
how to resolve this issue.

145
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:19,821
We should stop making

146
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,182
Mom and Dad worried.

147
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:23,982
Alright.

148
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:24,982
Why are you taking the pickled osmanthus

149
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,542
to Shanghai?

150
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,261
Xiang Qian should
have them in her house.

151
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:29,662
What if she doesn't?

152
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,102
Xiang Zhong loves putting osmanthus

153
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,701
whenever she takes
glutinous rice dumplings.

154
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:33,901
You made so many bottles of them.

155
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:35,341
Even so, Xiang Zhong can't

156
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:36,862
just live in Shanghai all the time.

157
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,422
Where else can she stay?

158
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,901
In my opinion, if it doesn't work out,

159
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:41,862
we should just

160
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,542
transfer this house
to Haiyang and his mother.

161
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:45,782
We can't go on like this anymore.

162
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,141
What are you saying?

163
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:47,862
Where can Xiang Zhong stay

164
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,021
if we transfer the house to him?

165
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:51,701
Besides, we don't have the money

166
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:52,901
to buy her a house now.

167
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:57,341
We can't just keep doing this.

168
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:00,021
Dad, Mom.

169
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:01,742
I'm back.

170
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:02,662
Xiang Nan.

171
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:03,461
Xiang Nan.

172
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,941
I'm glad to see you back.

173
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:06,862
I'm exhausted.

174
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:07,901
Deliver this to Zhong

175
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:09,102
on my behalf.

176
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:11,182
Dad, aren't you heading there yourself?

177
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,782
I won't be heading there.

178
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:13,581
I need to rest.

179
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,062
You should keep me company.

180
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:16,622
Alright, then.

181
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:18,381
Both of you aren't heading there?

182
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:19,862
Sorry for the trouble.

183
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,182
Okay. It's fine.

184
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,102
I was heading there in the first place.

185
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:23,222
It's so cold.

186
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:24,381
Stay safe, okay?

187
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:24,982
Okay.

188
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,062
Don't put it on your tummy.

189
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:28,021
It's cold. You'll get a stomachache.

190
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,182
It's frozen food.

191
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:31,062
Alright. I'll go now.

192
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:38,782
Does it hurt that much?

193
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:40,701
You don't say?

194
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:41,821
Of course it hurts.

195
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:42,621
Does it hurt that much?

196
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,461
We should've called Xiang Qian just now.

197
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,221
Enough already.

198
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:46,182
She doesn't have time.

199
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,022
She needs to look after Xiang Zhong.

200
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:48,941
My goodness.

201
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,821
We could've told Xiang Nan about it.

202
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,262
She can give us a lift.

203
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:52,821
Enough.

204
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,262
That husband of hers,

205
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:55,662
he works in a major department

206
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,262
of an international company.

207
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,182
His expenditure is huge enough.

208
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:58,382
There's no need to call for him.

209
00:08:58,542 --> 00:08:59,302
My goodness.

210
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,981
Why don't we head to the therapist

211
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,701
at the entrance of the alley?

212
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:04,621
How could you believe that blind guy?

213
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:06,262
Wait.

214
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,621
What should we do about the pain, then?

215
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:08,662
I'll rest for a few days.

216
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,741
Don't tell our children about it.

217
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:25,142
Zhong,

218
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,341
Dad and Mom prepared these for you.

219
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:30,821
Dad said he was exhausted.

220
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:31,741
He won't be coming.

221
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:32,461
He's resting at home.

222
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,262
It's as if we don't have food
in the house.

223
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,142
All of these are
Xiang Zhong's favorites.

224
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,581
Xiang Zhong.

225
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:51,621
You...

226
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,022
You shouldn't overthink it.

227
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:54,621
Just stay in your sister's house

228
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:55,461
for a few days.

229
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:58,142
Tell me what you want to eat.

230
00:09:58,221 --> 00:09:59,022
I'll deliver it to you.

231
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:03,861
I'm talking. Can you please stop?

232
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:05,382
You're talking while I'm talking.

233
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,262
If so,

234
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:08,382
who should she listen to?

235
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,701
She can listen to both of us.

236
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:11,902
My goodness.

237
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:13,621
Xiang Zhong.

238
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:15,382
Just listen to me.

239
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,182
Where was I again?

240
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:19,341
I said she could tell me
what she wanted to eat.

241
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,302
I'd deliver it to her.

242
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:23,262
That's right.
You can tell us whatever...

243
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,461
That's not it, Xiang Zhong.

244
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:25,062
Xiang Zhong,

245
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,422
listen to me.

246
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,062
It's like this.

247
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,941
Everything will be easier to handle
if you take a step back.

248
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:30,782
That's right.

249
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:32,422
Listen to your father.

250
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,341
Everything will be easier to handle
if you take a step back.

251
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,861
I told her to listen to you, right?

252
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:40,101
Why are you staring at me now?

253
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,461
Why isn't she replying to us?

254
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,662
Isn't this a voice message?

255
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:48,542
It's not like you called her.

256
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:50,701
Xiang Zhong,

257
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:53,302
I need to give you a reminder too.

258
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:54,621
Even if we were to take a step back,

259
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:56,581
we still have
to maintain our bottom line.

260
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:04,581
Zhong,

261
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:06,341
pack your things.

262
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,662
Alright.

263
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:18,581
(Jiang Hongbin)
Keep this in the refrigerator.

264
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:20,461
Cook the glutinous rice dumplings
for me.

265
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:21,461
I love them.

266
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,662
Did you argue with Jiang Hongbin?

267
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:24,941
I didn't.

268
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:26,422
Why else

269
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,422
is he looking for me, then?

270
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,182
He's annoying.
It's just a minor argument.

271
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:33,502
You see,

272
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:35,581
he acts like a dictator.

273
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,022
I can't stand that.

274
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:37,701
I'm ignoring him.

275
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,022
We're ignoring each other officially.

276
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:40,941
Since you know

277
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:41,662
what the issue is,

278
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,062
you should communicate with him.

279
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:44,422
You guys just got married,

280
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,542
yet you're ignoring him already.

281
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:46,782
You have to communicate with him.

282
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,182
When you live together as a couple,

283
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,062
you guys need to

284
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:50,262
communicate and work things out.

285
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,182
You have to repeat this process
many times to lead a comfortable life.

286
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:53,422
Isn't that tiring?

287
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:55,461
You have to communicate with him
even if you're exhausted.

288
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:56,341
If you keep ignoring him,

289
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,502
your relationship will go cold.

290
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,941
It's not that serious.

291
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:02,902
Look. He's calling me again.

292
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:03,581
Answer it.

293
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,902
I'm not answering it.

294
00:12:05,062 --> 00:12:06,821
I haven't thought of a reply yet.

295
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,262
I'll answer it, then.

296
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:11,902
You shouldn't answer it either.

297
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:13,821
Hello, Hongbin?

298
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,782
The three of us are together.

299
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:21,262
Alright. We'll head there now.

300
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:22,382
Sorry for the trouble.

301
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:23,821
Please look after Dad for now.

302
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:26,701
What's wrong?

303
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:28,621
Jiang Hongbin went to our house
to look for you.

304
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,662
He saw that Dad couldn't move
because he sprained his waist.

305
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:31,941
He sent him to the hospital.

306
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:33,542
Xiang Zhong.

307
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:34,461
Hurry up. Are you done?

308
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:35,142
What happened?

309
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:36,182
He looked fine just now.

310
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:37,062
Let's go.

311
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:38,022
Let's head to the hospital.

312
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:38,902
What's going on?

313
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,422
There's no one here.

314
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:00,861
No one's here?

315
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:02,821
This is the ward. He said Ward 212.

316
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:03,941
Where is he, then?

317
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:18,821
Qian.

318
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:19,621
You're here.

319
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:20,182
Hongbin.

320
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,101
Where are Mom and Dad?

321
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:22,741
Weren't they in the ward?

322
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:23,741
No, they weren't.

323
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:25,821
Just now, they...

324
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:28,821
How did Dad sprain his waist?

325
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,022
The doctor said it was
a case of herniated disc.

326
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:33,542
Mainly, he pulled his muscles.

327
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:34,981
The specialists

328
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:36,022
will give him another diagnosis.

329
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:36,941
Please wait here.

330
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:37,662
Li,

331
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,262
where did the patient of Ward 212

332
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:39,981
go?

333
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:41,701
They left with their luggage.

334
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:42,581
They said they were being discharged.

335
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:44,062
Discharged?

336
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,382
He was just hospitalized.
How could he be discharged now?

337
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,662
Let's split up and search for them.

338
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:49,782
Okay.

339
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,662
Take smaller steps.

340
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,262
Smaller steps?

341
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,382
Isn't this small enough?

342
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:37,662
Don't go there! Come back!

343
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,422
What are you doing?
People will see us, you know?

344
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:46,101
Don't panic, understood?

345
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,182
We won't be able to escape

346
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:48,422
if they find us, you know?

347
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:51,701
You haven't gone through
the checkup yet.

348
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:52,902
I can go for a checkup anywhere.

349
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:53,941
Do you know how costly it is

350
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:54,902
to go for a checkup here?

351
00:14:54,902 --> 00:14:55,981
We have to spend a fortune, you know?

352
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:04,221
Alright.

353
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,221
They're gone.

354
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:07,022
- Alright, let's go.
- The luggage!

355
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:15,422
Slow down!

356
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,861
Slow down!

357
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,662
Why don't you hold my shoulder?

358
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:24,101
Dad, Mom.

359
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:29,701
Where are you guys going?

360
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:31,262
We...

361
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:33,341
We're heading back.

362
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,221
We have a lot of things to do at home.

363
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:36,341
Dad, don't do this.

364
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:37,821
You haven't gone for the checkup yet.

365
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:38,581
How can you return like this?

366
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:40,142
Jiang,

367
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,581
I'm fine now.

368
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:43,341
Dad.

369
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:45,341
If you're sick,

370
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:46,662
you need to seek treatment.

371
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,581
Why are you running away instead?

372
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,701
Are you scared?

373
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,221
Nonsense.

374
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:53,902
Why would I be scared?

375
00:15:54,022 --> 00:15:55,062
If you're not scared,

376
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:56,182
let's go for the checkup, then.

377
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:56,941
You're already here.

378
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,262
You...

379
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:00,542
You know nothing.

380
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:02,502
Dad, who said so?

381
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:03,701
I know what's going on.

382
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:04,941
Where are you going?

383
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:07,382
To complete
the hospitalization procedure.

384
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:08,782
Who's getting hospitalized?

385
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:09,821
You.

386
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,420
She...

387
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,101
That's right. Let's head there.

388
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:11,741
We'll head to the ward first.

389
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:12,502
I'll lend you a hand. Be careful.

390
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:12,861
That...

391
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,981
That old hag is something else.

392
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:16,701
Be careful.

393
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,262
Actually, I'm fine.

394
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:22,422
I'm just getting old.

395
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,782
Your father is afraid that he might
spend a lot of money here.

396
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:30,142
I know.

397
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,062
Alright. Let me walk by myself.

398
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,422
No. Let me help you out.

399
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:34,662
Please listen to me.

400
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:37,662
Mom.

401
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:39,581
When you're free, you should help Dad

402
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,902
to sort out his thoughts.

403
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,302
You guys don't need
to worry about the money.

404
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,581
Look at what you're saying.

405
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:45,662
We feel bad

406
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:47,302
for spending your money too, you know?

407
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:50,382
We're already married.

408
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:51,821
That makes us one family.

409
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,341
He's supposed to spend his money

410
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:54,502
on you guys.

411
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:56,302
Mom.

412
00:16:58,701 --> 00:16:59,782
Coming.

413
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:03,662
Relax.

414
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:04,702
Alright now.

415
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,661
Flip him to the side.

416
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,101
It's okay now.

417
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,181
Mom, where did you two go?

418
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,742
Dad was trying to run away.

419
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,341
We stopped him in time.

420
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:18,302
How did this happen?

421
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:19,341
What have you done?

422
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,502
It's because of Xiang Zhong.

423
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,581
We fought her mother-in-law
for the poster.

424
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:25,502
Just stop talking.

425
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:29,821
Dad,

426
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:31,661
since we're already here,

427
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:33,542
you should go for a full body checkup.

428
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,462
What do you guys think?

429
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:36,702
No need for that.

430
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:38,702
There's nothing wrong with my body.

431
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:39,942
We can skip the checkup.

432
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:41,262
Dad,

433
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:42,942
didn't we have a deal just now?

434
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:44,581
Just follow our arrangements.

435
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:46,022
No need for any arrangements.

436
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:47,821
I'll look after him in the hospital
for the next few days.

437
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:48,901
No need for that.

438
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:50,621
I've already hired caretakers
to look after him.

439
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:51,502
You guys can come here

440
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:52,542
and chat with Dad when you're free.

441
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:53,702
The caretakers will be unnecessary.

442
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,062
I'll be here.

443
00:17:58,502 --> 00:17:59,661
I just think that it's more convenient

444
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:00,302
if we have a caretaker here.

445
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,542
Besides, everyone is quite busy.

446
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:04,581
If so, you don't need to come.
Anyway, I'm not busy.

447
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,982
Stop arguing, okay?

448
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,901
No one should keep me company.

449
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:11,942
If you guys want to do it,

450
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,581
I'll get discharged right now.

451
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:14,821
Stop moving.

452
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:15,821
You'll sprain your waist again.

453
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:16,901
Stop arguing, okay?

454
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:18,302
We'll stop arguing.

455
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:19,062
Hurry and lie down.

456
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:20,022
We'll stop arguing.

457
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:20,861
We'll follow your instructions,

458
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:21,661
okay?

459
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:23,462
Alright. Mom,

460
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:25,022
I'll go and make arrangements

461
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:26,141
for the caretaker first.

462
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:27,621
Hongbin, sorry for the trouble.

463
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:29,022
Not at all. Qian, don't mention it.

464
00:18:30,982 --> 00:18:32,942
You should talk to him nicely.

465
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:35,421
You should rest here.

466
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:36,621
I'll be here.

467
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:37,462
All of you should leave.

468
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:38,661
I'm not leaving. I'll keep you company.

469
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,661
We'll leave after the arrangements
have been completed.

470
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,421
You must be exhausted.

471
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:47,141
I'm fine.

472
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,861
Don't sit on my nightstand.

473
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:13,462
We are still here.

474
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:14,861
Why are you guys standing there?

475
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:16,222
We're keeping you company.

476
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:17,542
I...

477
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:18,821
Look at them.

478
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,181
Look at these children. My goodness.

479
00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:23,101
They...

480
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,222
They're scaring me.

481
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,381
Why are you having
instant noodles today?

482
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,821
There's plenty of food
in the canteen today.

483
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:54,782
Why didn't you go to the canteen?

484
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:56,381
I wasn't hungry.

485
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,222
My goodness.

486
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:03,222
Let me see.

487
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:06,861
He bought you a ring, huh?

488
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,222
It's just a ring.

489
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:10,861
It doesn't mean anything.

490
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:12,581
It's an engagement ring.

491
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,101
Isn't it obvious enough?

492
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,101
Was it him?

493
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,341
Are you two that close already?

494
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,421
If so,

495
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:25,381
is he divorced?

496
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:27,782
Not yet.

497
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:30,141
But I think he'll get a divorce soon.

498
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:09,702
You do have plenty of parcels, huh?

499
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,022
Li Shu?

500
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:17,101
Who's that?

501
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:18,821
They must be mistaken.

502
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:20,302
Look.

503
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,502
Li Shu...

504
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:26,942
She's a Master student who's studying

505
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:27,821
at Gao Ping's research center.

506
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,222
She's also the home tutor of Cong and Qi

507
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:31,341
for the past few days.

508
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,101
Why did they deliver her parcel here?

509
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:33,901
Yeah.

510
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:35,381
Why did they deliver it to your house?

511
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:38,421
Be careful.

512
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:43,901
We're back.

513
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:45,022
- Cong, Qi.
- Second Aunt!

514
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:46,621
I missed you!

515
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:48,782
I missed you too.

516
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:50,821
- Xiang Zhong, you're here.
- Second Aunt.

517
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,782
Look at my new painting.

518
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:53,702
Okay.

519
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:54,421
I'll take a look later.

520
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:55,621
Wash your hands first, okay?

521
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:56,581
Head there first.

522
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:57,621
Let Second Aunt
change into her slippers.

523
00:21:58,062 --> 00:21:58,621
Xiang Zhong.

524
00:21:58,901 --> 00:21:59,742
This is my aunt.

525
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,542
This is Xiang Zhong,
Xiang Qian's sister.

526
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:02,901
Hello, Aunty.

527
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:03,581
Sorry.

528
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:05,542
I'll have to bother you
for the next few days.

529
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,262
It's fine.

530
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:07,222
I'll make something nice for you.

531
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:07,742
Alright.

532
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:08,742
This is Li Shu,

533
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:09,702
my junior.

534
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,101
She's here to help my children
with their homework.

535
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:12,502
Hello, Xiang Zhong.

536
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:14,621
Hello.

537
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:16,502
Li Shu,

538
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:17,901
one of your parcels

539
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:18,942
was delivered to our place.

540
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,141
Thank you, Xiang Qian.

541
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:26,901
What did you buy?

542
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,502
Some modeling clay.

543
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:31,302
For this semester's handicraft lesson,

544
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:32,462
I intend to let Cong and Qi

545
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:33,942
make a modeling clay family.

546
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:35,421
I'm sure their teacher
will praise them for it.

547
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,341
Thanks. I appreciate the effort.

548
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:45,381
All of them are here.

549
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:47,302
Where's Qi?

550
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,181
Qi didn't receive
the stamp of excellence

551
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:50,821
during today's handicraft lesson.

552
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:52,661
She's throwing a tantrum in the room now.

553
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:53,782
It's fine.

554
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:54,942
I'll console her later.

555
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:58,062
I'll go and take a look.

556
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:01,901
Come, Cong.

557
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:02,702
Let's pick

558
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:04,141
a nice color,

559
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:04,742
okay?

560
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:05,621
Which one do you like?

561
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:06,421
Take a look.

562
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:07,341
Come.

563
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:08,821
Let me hold it for you.

564
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:09,742
It's fine. I can do it myself.

565
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:11,661
Ms. Li, I like all of them.

566
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,462
You like all of them?

567
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:15,022
If so, we can let Qi choose

568
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:15,861
the color she likes, okay?

569
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:16,661
Okay.

570
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,821
Come. Let's go and find your sister.

571
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:19,942
We can show it to everyone

572
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:21,222
after we're done.

573
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:24,542
Come.

574
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:25,502
Let me help you out.

575
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:26,421
What are you talking about?

576
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:26,861
Sit down.

577
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:27,661
I need to talk to you.

578
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:32,262
Wait.

579
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:33,421
What's wrong with that woman?

580
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:35,502
What do you mean?

581
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,302
Isn't it obvious?

582
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:38,462
She's making herself

583
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,702
at home, you know?

584
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:41,901
She opened her parcel so casually.

585
00:23:42,702 --> 00:23:43,982
And, judging from the way
she was looking at Gao Ping,

586
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:45,782
I'm sure she has an ulterior motive.

587
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:48,141
I don't know.

588
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:50,661
I wonder if all these female students

589
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,821
who are good at studying

590
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:54,262
have no idea about
the most basic social etiquette.

591
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,222
How could she have no idea?

592
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:56,702
I'm sure she's pretending.

593
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:58,901
Qian, listen.

594
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:00,141
I'm not sure

595
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:01,101
what Gao Ping thinks about this,

596
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:02,262
but that woman

597
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:03,702
is no ordinary simpleton.

598
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:05,181
You have to be wary of her.

599
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:06,702
I know.

600
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,222
I feel uncomfortable

601
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,101
watching what she did today.

602
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:12,821
But she didn't do anything

603
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:14,062
substantial.

604
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:16,222
I can't just argue with Gao Ping

605
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,942
without any solid evidence, right?

606
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,581
You cannot put it that way.

607
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,302
Prevention is better than cure,
you know?

608
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:28,982
I need to get my book.

609
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:46,742
Regarding the sense of boundaries

610
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:47,942
that Li Shu has while she works here,

611
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:49,341
don't you think it's time

612
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,062
to tell her about it?

613
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:52,421
What do you mean?

614
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,262
Parcels with her name

615
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:55,821
are delivered to our house.

616
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:57,742
She bought them for
Cong and Qi, you know?

617
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,742
If that was the case, she could've

618
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:04,502
written your name

619
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:05,702
or my name on the parcel.

620
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:06,942
Why did she

621
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:08,181
insist on writing her own name on it?

622
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:11,062
She made the purchase herself.

623
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:12,181
I think it's logical to write down

624
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,462
her name and her phone number
on the parcel.

625
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,742
I feel uncomfortable when I see

626
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:16,621
other people's parcels

627
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:17,742
being delivered to my house.

628
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,901
Are you uncomfortable

629
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,341
with the incident itself?

630
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,181
Or are you uncomfortable

631
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,062
with the person?

632
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:30,141
Fine.

633
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:31,901
Let's drop the topic first.

634
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,502
Qi didn't receive
the stamp of excellence today.

635
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:35,302
Shouldn't she tell

636
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:36,821
her mother about it?

637
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:39,022
Why did she tell her about it?

638
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:40,982
And, she said she would
console her later.

639
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,502
What did she mean by that?

640
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,381
She took out the box cutter

641
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:46,742
and opened her parcel

642
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:47,861
after she received it.

643
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:49,861
How come she knows the placement

644
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:50,982
of every item

645
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:52,101
in the house?

646
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:54,542
So, Xiang Zhong

647
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:55,942
was discussing this topic
with you just now?

648
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:57,982
I don't need Xiang Zhong
to tell me that.

649
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:59,302
I already saw it myself.

650
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:02,381
Li Shu is the one who has

651
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:03,341
no sense of boundaries here.

652
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:04,141
Why are you

653
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,022
defending her?

654
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:08,982
Am I defending her?

655
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:10,181
Wait. I don't understand.

656
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:11,381
How am I defending her?

657
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:12,101
What exactly are you

658
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:13,062
trying to get at?

659
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:14,222
It's like this.

660
00:26:14,262 --> 00:26:15,901
I think there's no need for us

661
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:17,861
to argue constantly because of her.

662
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:19,302
That's right. This isn't an argument.

663
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:20,062
We're talking this over.

664
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:20,742
What do you mean?

665
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:21,942
You want to fire her,

666
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:22,421
am I right?

667
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:23,861
Firstly,

668
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:25,581
I don't intend to fire her.

669
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:27,262
Secondly,

670
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:29,581
even if I do want to fire her,

671
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:31,181
no one can stop me.

672
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,502
Yeah, you're right.

673
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,181
Didn't I tell you this
on the first day she came?

674
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:35,141
You can keep her here

675
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:35,782
if you like.

676
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:36,462
If not,

677
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:37,222
you can tell her to leave.

678
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,702
Do you even need my opinion on this?

679
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:46,821
I'm heading to the research center.

680
00:26:48,621 --> 00:26:49,982
Now, we'll put the color

681
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:51,022
here.

682
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:52,062
Here.

683
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:53,581
Li Shu.

684
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:55,502
I'm heading to the research center.
I'll fetch you back.

685
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:56,942
Right now?

686
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:57,661
That's right.

687
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,141
Qian, I'll make a move first.

688
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:12,861
Are you coming back for dinner?

689
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:14,302
I don't know yet.

690
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:21,022
Why did he take her with him?

691
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,381
He's returning to the research center.

692
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:26,462
She's returning to the college.

693
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:27,982
It's literally the same place.

694
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:29,821
I can't just tell them
to head there separately.

695
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:31,861
Fine, then.

696
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,101
Tell that woman not to come

697
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:34,101
while I'm here.

698
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:42,702
Aunty,

699
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,542
does Li Shu come to class

700
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:47,861
at a normal time every day?

701
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:49,421
That's right.

702
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:55,181
Aunty,

703
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:57,462
I think

704
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,101
we've been working things out
pretty well.

705
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:01,581
I hope that you can be in charge

706
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,381
of all the affairs in the house

707
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,661
when I'm not around.

708
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:08,661
Alright, I understand.

709
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:13,421
If Li Shu requires

710
00:28:13,462 --> 00:28:14,621
things like

711
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:15,661
craft knives,

712
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:17,141
scissors,

713
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,742
tissues, and so on

714
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:21,101
during her handicraft lesson
with Cong and Qi,

715
00:28:21,141 --> 00:28:22,022
you should

716
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:24,022
hand them to her.

717
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:46,181
Did you two argue just now?

718
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:52,421
Was it because of me?

719
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:00,101
You're sending me back
even after arguing with her?

720
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:01,502
It's clear that you're offending her.

721
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:06,181
What's her opinion?

722
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:08,901
She wants to fire you.

723
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,302
That means I did a good job, right?

724
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:26,222
But it won't be that easy

725
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:27,421
for her to fire me,

726
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:29,341
am I right?

727
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:43,581
Door unlocked.

728
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:46,141
Xiang Nan.

729
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:47,421
Door locked.

730
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:49,381
Just now, Mr. Wang from
the management team

731
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,022
told us

732
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:50,702
to pay the rent

733
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:51,821
for the next quarter.

734
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:52,661
Alright. Pay him, then.

735
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:54,581
It costs 140,000 yuan, you know?

736
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:56,702
140,000 yuan? That's a lot!

737
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:57,621
How is that possible?

738
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:58,581
Even if he's going to hike the price,

739
00:29:58,581 --> 00:29:59,661
he can't just double it like that.

740
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:00,861
He didn't hike the price.

741
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,022
The monthly rent costs

742
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:02,942
35,000 yuan.

743
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:04,742
Before this, we only paid
7,500 yuan per month.

744
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:05,861
Jiang was the one who forked out

745
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:07,821
the rest of our rent.

746
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:09,462
What?

747
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:10,942
I had no idea either.

748
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:13,581
He paid the rent on our behalf?

749
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,022
That's impossible.

750
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:18,302
He kept telling me

751
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:20,222
that the studio belonged to his friend

752
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,661
and that he could provide us
with the lowest rent possible.

753
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:24,181
I didn't know that he was paying
the rent on our behalf.

754
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:27,181
My goodness.

755
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:29,421
If so,

756
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:31,181
do we have enough money

757
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:32,222
in the studio's bank account?

758
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:35,141
We do have some money
in the bank account.

759
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:36,581
However, if we use them

760
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:37,901
to pay the rent,

761
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:38,861
we'll hit rock bottom.

762
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,101
We won't be able
to afford the utilities next month.

763
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,022
If so, we should hurry

764
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:46,621
and take more orders
so that we can make more money.

765
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:48,542
How many orders
do you think we can take?

766
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:51,462
Xiang Nan, to be honest,

767
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:53,421
it's quite impossible
for the three of us

768
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:55,101
to afford a monthly rent of 100,000 yuan

769
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:56,661
by ourselves.

770
00:31:01,502 --> 00:31:02,661
If it doesn't work out,

771
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:03,621
we can find somewhere cheaper.

772
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:04,421
Let's move our studio elsewhere.

773
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:06,581
Did you two have an argument?

774
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:08,702
I suppose

775
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:09,861
he's giving me

776
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:12,101
a financial sanction now.

777
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:13,621
Wait.

778
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:15,022
What's going on between you two?

779
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,542
To put it simply,

780
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:21,581
he thinks that I'm not showing him
enough respect.

781
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:24,661
And I thought it was a huge deal.

782
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,782
If so, you can just
show him respect, then.

783
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:28,101
That'll resolve everything.

784
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:29,462
Just show him some respect,

785
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,302
and we can save
hundreds of thousands of yuan.

786
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,421
It's not that simple.

787
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:49,062
Why are you back?

788
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,062
I need to speak with you.

789
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:56,861
Great timing.

790
00:31:57,661 --> 00:31:58,542
I need to speak with you as well.

791
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,341
Regarding your father...

792
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:08,702
This is what I think.

793
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,821
I intend to buy a new house
for Mom and Dad

794
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:14,661
since the old house
will be demolished anyway.

795
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,101
Do they have to do so?

796
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:19,702
Anyway, the higher-ups

797
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:20,621
are quite determined to do so.

798
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:25,341
They've been living

799
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,101
in the old house for a long time.

800
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:28,262
Now that they have to move,

801
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:29,302
I'm sure they can't
bear to part with it.

802
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,141
Even so, there's no choice.

803
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:33,942
No one can escape their fate
if the government wants to demolish it.

804
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,181
Don't you wish for your parents

805
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:37,581
to lead better lives?

806
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:38,782
Of course I wish for them

807
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,141
to lead better lives.

808
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:41,942
However...

809
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:48,502
I don't understand something.

810
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:49,942
Why are you giving me

811
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:51,542
a financial sanction

812
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,101
while being nice

813
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:53,621
to my parents?

814
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:55,942
What exactly do you want me to do?

815
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:05,222
Xiang Nan,

816
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:08,181
I stopped paying

817
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:09,742
your studio's rent for you

818
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:11,302
because I wanted you to feel

819
00:33:11,302 --> 00:33:12,782
how it's like to be in my shoes.

820
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:14,222
I wanted you to know

821
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:15,982
that a tiny studio like yours

822
00:33:16,022 --> 00:33:16,661
was already troublesome

823
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:17,661
to manage.

824
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:19,661
You see, I have to deal with issues

825
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:21,022
that are way larger
than what you're dealing with.

826
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:24,861
If so, why did you

827
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:26,181
pay my rent for me in the first place?

828
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:27,621
I wouldn't have chosen that place

829
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:28,502
had I known

830
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,181
that the rent there

831
00:33:29,222 --> 00:33:30,942
would cost this much.

832
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:32,942
Why didn't you tell me about it?

833
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:34,341
I just didn't want you

834
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:35,542
to be stressed out.

835
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,861
I hope that you can do what you like

836
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:40,702
without any pressure.

837
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,782
I can handle the pressure for you.

838
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:47,181
But Xiang Nan,

839
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:49,421
sometimes,

840
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:50,861
you're too willful.

841
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:54,942
So, are you saying

842
00:33:55,621 --> 00:33:57,141
that I have to heed your every will

843
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:58,742
and follow all of your instructions?

844
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:00,502
It's not that you need
to heed my every will.

845
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:02,062
But at least

846
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,062
you shouldn't hang up on me.

847
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,782
But you shouldn't have

848
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:05,462
lost your temper like that

849
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,022
in front of me.

850
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,141
You even threw the cup onto the ground.

851
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:10,462
You scared me,

852
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:11,261
you know?

853
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:12,581
Alright, alright.

854
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:13,701
It was my fault.

855
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:15,062
I was too impulsive.

856
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:17,101
It was my fault.

857
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,301
I'll apologize to you, okay?

858
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:23,781
If so, you have to promise me this.

859
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,581
Don't be fierce to me again.

860
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:26,862
Okay.

861
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:28,221
I promise.

862
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:29,621
In the future,

863
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:32,542
let's take good care of Mom and Dad

864
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,982
and make sure our family is happy.

865
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:37,181
Let's forget about
everything else, okay?

866
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,221
Qian.

867
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,181
You're still awake?

868
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:00,422
Why are you still awake too?

869
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,462
I knew that you couldn't sleep.

870
00:35:12,221 --> 00:35:13,062
If you're worried about them,

871
00:35:13,062 --> 00:35:14,101
we can find them together.

872
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:16,581
Why should we find them?

873
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:19,422
I don't know how to do research.

874
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,022
Stop pretending.

875
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:23,701
I've never seen you

876
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:24,822
this frustrated before.

877
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:26,422
Since when

878
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:27,701
did you become this hesitant?

879
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:29,422
Just look at what they're doing.

880
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:30,621
What are you doing?

881
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:32,181
Why are you

882
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:33,062
letting them off the hook?

883
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:37,181
I...

884
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:39,822
We're a blended family.

885
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:41,542
Does that mean you should compromise?

886
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:56,902
Did you drink?

887
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:02,101
Who did you drink with
to end up like this?

888
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:15,661
Didn't you go to the research center?

889
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:18,902
Who did you drink with
to end up like this?

890
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:21,422
Hey, I'm talking to you.

891
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:31,062
Dayuan treated us to a meal.

892
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:33,141
The girl

893
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:34,542
sitting beside me

894
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:35,982
is his girlfriend.

895
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:37,822
Li Shu isn't around.

896
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:44,542
I didn't ask you whether
Li Shu was around or not.

897
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,342
Can we stop

898
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:48,301
talking about

899
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:49,221
Li Shu?

900
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:50,342
Can we stop arguing

901
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,101
because of her?

902
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:52,661
Just tell her not to come again.

903
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,261
All these years,

904
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,062
you've always been close to Chai Jin.

905
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:00,342
Have I ever made a single remark?

906
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:03,822
You said you two were friends.

907
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:05,822
I believed you unconditionally.

908
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:07,942
Why can't you apply the same logic

909
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:08,822
to Li Shu?

910
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,422
How could these two cases be the same?

911
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:12,822
How are they not the same?

912
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:14,462
Chai Jin

913
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:16,902
is more mature than Li Shu, huh?

914
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:18,342
He's more sensible

915
00:37:18,382 --> 00:37:19,462
and he knows his boundaries, right?

916
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:26,621
I've told you many times.

917
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,862
Chai Jin is the mentor
who introduced me to the industry.

918
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:32,062
We had known each other for a decade.

919
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,261
We've been working together
for a decade.

920
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:35,741
I said that he was
a good friend of mine.

921
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:36,701
Is there anything wrong with that?

922
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,621
How many years have you been
colleagues with Li Shu?

923
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:41,502
What have you two

924
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:42,701
been through together

925
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:44,701
for you to defend her

926
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:45,581
and argue with me

927
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:46,661
every day?

928
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:49,422
Yeah, yeah.

929
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:51,261
Everyone is a good friend of yours.

930
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:53,301
I'm jealous.

931
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:53,982
Your friends look after you

932
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,141
during work.

933
00:37:55,862 --> 00:37:57,621
Your sister looks after you

934
00:37:57,661 --> 00:37:59,062
when you feel sick after getting home.

935
00:38:00,502 --> 00:38:01,422
I'm just an outsider.

936
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,462
I'll clear out a space for you guys.

937
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,221
You and your family can enjoy your chat.

938
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:09,942
Where are you going?

939
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:37,382
Morning.

940
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:39,221
Morning.

941
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:43,221
That was a loud yawn.

942
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:46,261
Did you not sleep well again?

943
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:47,942
A little.

944
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:49,502
What's with the unstable
sleeping schedule?

945
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:50,502
Are you experiencing menopause?

946
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:51,822
It's too early for that.

947
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:52,862
Scram.

948
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:54,301
Here.

949
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:55,701
Hurry and get revitalized.

950
00:38:56,462 --> 00:38:56,982
Thanks.

951
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:02,221
Boss,

952
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:04,382
do you think

953
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:05,462
I'm paranoid?

954
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:08,621
I don't think so.

955
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:10,822
Is Dr. Gao up to something?

956
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:12,862
That's not it.

957
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:14,022
You see,

958
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:15,661
whenever I ask him something,

959
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:17,621
he keeps saying that I don't trust him.

960
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:21,621
Dr. Gao

961
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:22,661
is well-groomed

962
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:23,661
handsome, yet hypocritical.

963
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,261
I understand why you're worried.

964
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:28,581
I appreciate you calling him
well-groomed and handsome.

965
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,741
But what do you mean by hypocritical?

966
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:31,342
Let me give you a suggestion.

967
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,062
Stop sulking and letting
your imagination run wild.

968
00:39:33,502 --> 00:39:34,781
If you're worried,

969
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:36,621
you can confront him directly,

970
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,701
catch him red-handed,

971
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:38,542
and sever your ties with him.

972
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:40,621
But...

973
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:42,982
But what if there's nothing wrong

974
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:43,902
with him?

975
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:45,982
That means there's an issue

976
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:47,902
with your basic judgment.

977
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:50,261
I suggest you visit

978
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:50,982
a psychiatrist.

979
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,301
Do you need me

980
00:39:58,462 --> 00:39:59,181
to conduct an undercover visit?

981
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:00,022
No need for that.

982
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:02,781
Let me make adjustments

983
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:03,621
to my basic judgment first.

984
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:10,661
Hello, Dad? What's wrong?

985
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:13,141
Xiang Zhong isn't answering my calls.

986
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:15,181
Why are you looking for me

987
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:16,261
for a trivial issue as such?

988
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:18,301
Is Xiang Zhong home?

989
00:40:18,422 --> 00:40:19,822
Yeah, she's home.

990
00:40:20,062 --> 00:40:20,422
I'm working right now.

991
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:21,342
Please throw it for me. Thank you.

992
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:30,661
Hello?

993
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:33,902
Why didn't you answer Dad's call?

994
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,022
It was inconvenient for me to do so.

995
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:37,502
You're home.

996
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:38,661
How is it inconvenient
for you to answer his call?

997
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:39,221
Here's the new proposal.

998
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:40,781
I've returned to Kunshan.

999
00:40:42,661 --> 00:40:43,382
Kunshan?

1000
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:44,621
Why didn't you notify me?

1001
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:47,141
I don't want to cause trouble

1002
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,101
for your family.

1003
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:50,942
That's not true.

1004
00:40:51,422 --> 00:40:52,621
That's just how you feel.

1005
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,022
Just stay at home, okay?

1006
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:56,822
Don't tell Mom and Dad

1007
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:57,542
about my family affair,

1008
00:40:57,701 --> 00:40:58,261
you hear me?

1009
00:40:59,141 --> 00:40:59,862
Alright, I understand.

1010
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:30,261
Xiang Zhong?

1011
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:31,781
Why are you back?

1012
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:33,661
Why can't I be back?

1013
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:34,982
All of our neighbors were

1014
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:36,422
gossiping about the poster.

1015
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:38,022
It was unpleasant to say the least.

1016
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:39,902
What's there to gossip about?

1017
00:41:41,261 --> 00:41:42,022
They said

1018
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:42,862
you fell for that young man.

1019
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:44,221
Rumor has it that he's quite dashing.

1020
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:45,462
I even heard that he was living in

1021
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:46,101
the same neighborhood as ours.

1022
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:47,542
Which unit is he living in?

1023
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:49,141
If you're that curious,

1024
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:49,781
you can treat

1025
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,101
the most dashing man in the neighborhood
as my target, then.

1026
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,422
Xiang Zhong!

1027
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:56,701
I suppose your mother-in-law

1028
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:57,621
has moved into your unit, right?

1029
00:41:57,822 --> 00:41:59,022
Introduce her to us next time.

1030
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:13,141
Bai Lifang, open the door.

1031
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:14,502
I know you're inside.

1032
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:16,382
Open the door.

1033
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:20,141
Bai Lifang, open the door!

1034
00:42:24,781 --> 00:42:26,141
Bai Lifang, just you wait!

1035
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:53,902
Bai Lifang, open the door!

1036
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:54,502
No, I won't.

1037
00:42:54,862 --> 00:42:56,101
Open the door! This is my house!

1038
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:57,022
I won't.

1039
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:57,621
Open the door!

1040
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:58,422
I won't.

1041
00:42:58,621 --> 00:42:59,862
Fine. Enjoy yourself while you can.

1042
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:00,822
Just you wait.

1043
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,181
