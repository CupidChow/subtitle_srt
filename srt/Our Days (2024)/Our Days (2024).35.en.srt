00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,000
=Our Days=

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:38,167
=Episode 35=

4
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:40,547
(Dad, Mom,)

5
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,627
(there are some things
that I can't say in person,)

6
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:44,187
(so I'll just say them
in this chat group.)

7
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:46,586
(I'm going to turn myself in.)

8
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:48,067
(Previously,)

9
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,466
(to partner up with Hongjiang Group,)

10
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,627
(we had no choice
but to follow Jiang Hongbin's orders)

11
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:52,946
(and walked into the gray zone.)

12
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:54,827
(He's now using that)

13
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,427
(as leverage to threaten us,)

14
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:58,267
(preventing Xiang Nan
from divorcing him.)

15
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:00,827
(There's only one way out now.)

16
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:02,987
(Which is, for me to bear the mistake)

17
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:04,506
(and undergo investigation)

18
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:06,466
(as well as accept
the subsequent punishment.)

19
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:09,707
(Please look after Qi and Cong for me.)

20
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,067
(They will start
primary school next year.)

21
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:16,227
(I've already found a school
and will send you the details later.)

22
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:18,547
(Xiang Zhong and Xiang Nan,)

23
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:20,306
(when I'm gone,)

24
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,147
(do look after Mom and Dad,)

25
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:23,786
(as well as yourselves.)

26
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,466
(Take good care.)

27
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,547
Hello, Attorney Wu.

28
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,987
Chai Jin has turned himself in.

29
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,400
(Law Firm)

30
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,586
(You know that)

31
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:38,987
(I've grown)

32
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,227
(used to being carefree.)

33
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:43,586
(Whatever I do,)

34
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,346
(it's for my own happiness.)

35
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:47,586
(But this time,)

36
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:49,947
(I wondered what it is)

37
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:52,866
(I could do for you and your family.)

38
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:55,586
(Turns out,)

39
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,066
(it felt good to think for others.)

40
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:09,667
Can Chai Jin's case

41
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,346
be tied

42
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,387
to Jiang Hongbin?

43
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,026
According to my understanding,

44
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:19,866
Chai Jin has a voice recording

45
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:21,346
which can prove

46
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:22,947
that Jiang Hongbin

47
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:25,306
did indeed play a role in instigating

48
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:26,267
and influencing the matter.

49
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:28,066
But to use that as evidence

50
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:29,427
to indict Jiang Hongbin,

51
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,227
from the perspective of
an economic investigation,

52
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:32,626
it is unlikely to work.

53
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,586
Which means Jiang Hongbin

54
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,306
would not suffer any consequences.

55
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:41,746
Yes.

56
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:50,026
However,

57
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:50,866
if your sister

58
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,066
decides to file for a divorce,

59
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:53,147
there will be

60
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:54,227
less worry for you.

61
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:56,786
When can I go and see him?

62
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:58,906
After the court hearing.

63
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,586
Please let me know

64
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:07,786
if he has any requests.

65
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:09,346
Will do.

66
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:28,747
Qian.

67
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:31,747
Qian?

68
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:50,267
Xiang Nan.

69
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:52,906
Zhong.

70
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:53,426
Xiang Nan.

71
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:54,067
Dad.

72
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,067
Where's Xiang Qian?

73
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:55,906
Come inside, quick.

74
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:56,666
Where's your sister?

75
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:57,546
Where's Xiang Qian?

76
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,026
I don't know where she went.

77
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,067
She left a note.

78
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:03,387
It said,

79
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:05,747
she prepared a file containing

80
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,026
Qi and Cong's information.

81
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:08,507
She left a message

82
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:09,267
for us

83
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,867
and also left a USB drive for Chai Jin.

84
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:12,707
I... I'm a little worried.

85
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:13,627
Is she saying

86
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:14,666
her goodbye?

87
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:16,067
I felt she was acting weird

88
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:16,786
yesterday.

89
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:18,106
And she's not answering my calls.

90
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,106
That child.

91
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:20,026
What's going on?

92
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:21,067
Could something have happened?

93
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:21,786
Is that her?

94
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:23,627
Qian.

95
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:24,546
Xiang Qian.

96
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:25,106
Qian.

97
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:25,947
Why didn't you pick up

98
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:26,827
our calls?

99
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:28,666
I didn't hear it.

100
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:31,426
Don't tell me you're going
to take the blame

101
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:32,387
for Chai Jin?

102
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:33,947
Yes.

103
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:35,346
That's a serious matter.

104
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:36,586
You should've discussed with us first.

105
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:37,986
Discuss what?

106
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:39,387
So many things happened

107
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:40,546
within such a short time.

108
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:42,387
The longer it goes on,
the worse the situation becomes.

109
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,707
So what's the situation now?

110
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,627
Chai Jin has turned himself in.

111
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:06,627
It's my fault.

112
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:10,747
It's all because of me.

113
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:14,867
If I didn't...

114
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:16,586
If I hadn't married that man,

115
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,147
things wouldn't have come to this.

116
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,346
Hey, hey, it's not your fault.

117
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,507
Don't blame yourself.

118
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:22,827
Now everyone

119
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:24,106
is getting dragged into the mire.

120
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:28,786
There, there.

121
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:37,947
Who are you looking for?

122
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:39,226
I'm looking for your boss.

123
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:40,707
May I know who you are?

124
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,507
On paper, I'm still his father-in-law.

125
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:43,666
Mr. Jiang is not in.

126
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:44,906
He's not in?

127
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,106
You didn't even check,

128
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,346
how do you know he's not in?

129
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:48,147
I'm very sorry.

130
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:49,666
But I can't let you in.

131
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:50,827
Why is he so afraid?

132
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:52,507
Is he scared

133
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,426
that I'd reveal

134
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:54,747
all the dirty things he did?

135
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:55,586
Get out of my way!

136
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:57,106
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:57,906
We can't let you in.

138
00:06:57,906 --> 00:06:59,387
Sorry, Mr. Jiang is not in.

139
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,026
He's really not here.

140
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:10,786
Is he not here

141
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:15,627
or is he too scared to see me?

142
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:17,466
Please calm down, sir.

143
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:18,267
How about this?

144
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:19,666
If it's something urgent,

145
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,586
you could give him a call.

146
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:22,426
Is that so?

147
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:26,986
Go!

148
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:28,106
Tell your boss.

149
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:29,627
If he won't see me,

150
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:30,986
I'm going to destroy this place!

151
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:31,947
No, stop!

152
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:33,067
Don't do that!

153
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,786
Security!

154
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:37,947
What are you people doing?

155
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:39,307
Get Jiang Hongbin out to see me!

156
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:40,546
Call him here!

157
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,307
Tell him to come see me!

158
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:43,147
Step aside!

159
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:44,786
Tell him to come out!

160
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,026
Why are you apprehending me?

161
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:47,947
You should catch that goon named Jiang!

162
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,106
He's evil!

163
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:50,786
Let me go! Let me go!

164
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:54,627
What are you doing?

165
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:57,426
How could you treat an elder this way?

166
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:58,307
That's not right.

167
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:00,586
Leave us.

168
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:02,747
Sorry about that.

169
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:07,546
Mr. Xiang.

170
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,267
There's no use making a scene here.

171
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:11,147
Go home.

172
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,387
What if you injured yourself?

173
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,426
Think about

174
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,666
your daughters if not for yourself.

175
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:19,707
They'd be so worried for you.

176
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,426
Don't come to the office again.

177
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:48,507
Dad.

178
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:49,706
Why are you guys here?

179
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:50,267
Hang on,

180
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:51,826
why are you sitting here?

181
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,267
I'm asking why you guys are here?

182
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:54,387
What are you doing? Have some water.

183
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:55,786
No, no water.

184
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:56,786
Listen to me.

185
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:57,786
I'm not here to make a scene.

186
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,306
I just want to talk to him.

187
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,706
I'm willing to give up our house.

188
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:01,826
Go ahead and demolish it.

189
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:02,627
I don't care.

190
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:03,946
All I'm asking is to give Xiang Nan

191
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:04,826
back to us.

192
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,347
Give Chai Jin back to us.

193
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:07,666
Let our family...

194
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:08,906
He should let our family go.

195
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:09,906
Give us back our peace.

196
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:10,706
You think you can resolve this

197
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:12,026
by confronting him head on?

198
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:12,987
Hurry up and take him home.

199
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:14,026
Come on, let's go.

200
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:15,426
I didn't think... My only mistake was...

201
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:15,946
I didn't expect

202
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:16,867
him to be so evil!

203
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:17,826
Yes, he's shameless.

204
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:19,107
So there's no point
in reasoning with him.

205
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:20,467
You're just hurting yourself.

206
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,227
Careful.

207
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:32,867
You asked for me, Mr. Jiang?

208
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:34,906
Did my father-in-law

209
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:35,826
come and make noise

210
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:36,627
in the office again?

211
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:37,867
Go and find out,

212
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:39,546
who was it that let him in.

213
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:41,467
They're fired.

214
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:43,107
Understood.

215
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:44,867
Also, make sure

216
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:45,627
this doesn't happen again.

217
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,706
We're in a crucial point in time.

218
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,467
We must not create any bad press.

219
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:51,946
Attorney Su is here.

220
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:52,906
He's waiting for you outside.

221
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:53,747
Ask him to come in.

222
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:54,467
Okay.

223
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:03,267
Mr. Jiang.

224
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:04,906
Attorney Su.

225
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:06,906
Apologies, I've been quite busy lately.

226
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:08,587
What is it you wanted to say?

227
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:10,826
Chai Jin turned himself in.

228
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,546
He turned himself in?

229
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,107
Also,

230
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,147
your wife has filed for a divorce.

231
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,186
She has the injury report
from the hospital

232
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,066
and a video from that night.

233
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,347
Together with
the previous police report,

234
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:25,946
it's not

235
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,747
looking good for you.

236
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:38,227
Okay.

237
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:39,946
Thanks, Attorney Wu.

238
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:40,906
Thank you.

239
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:42,786
Got it.

240
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:43,747
Bye-bye.

241
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:46,826
Attorney Wu said

242
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:48,066
Jiang Hongbin has been informed

243
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:48,987
of Chai Jin's action.

244
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,587
He's agreed to the divorce.

245
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:53,627
That's great.

246
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:54,987
You're finally getting what you want.

247
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,826
But still, we have

248
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:58,747
to think of something.

249
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,306
Chai Jin is still in trouble.

250
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,306
There's nothing we can do

251
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:04,186
about Chai Jin.

252
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:05,467
When I first found out,

253
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,026
I went to consult a lawyer.

254
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:09,666
Maximum three years,

255
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:11,627
minimum one.

256
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,387
Since he turned himself in,

257
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:14,227
I reckon

258
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,507
he'd get the lightest sentence.

259
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:20,347
My thought on Chai Jin is,

260
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,227
on the surface,

261
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,186
he's helping Xiang Nan with the problem,

262
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:24,867
but in fact, he's helping you, Qian.

263
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,786
Listen, you two have known each other
a long time.

264
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,786
Have you never thought about

265
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:30,987
going further?

266
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:32,627
What...

267
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:33,906
No.

268
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,306
Boss Chai

269
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:37,906
changes girlfriends
like changing clothes.

270
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:39,786
When I met him,

271
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,706
I had the feeling
that he wasn't the type

272
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:42,987
who would get married

273
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,627
and start a family.

274
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,147
Let me tell you,

275
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,587
people who seem like a playboy

276
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,107
are actually the most loyal,

277
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,107
most devoted.

278
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,387
If he had

279
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:52,267
no feelings for you,

280
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:53,186
then why did he linger

281
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,147
at the hotel entrance

282
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:55,426
and not go in

283
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:56,147
when you

284
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,107
got married to Gao Ping?

285
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,066
That happened?

286
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:00,627
Now I feel

287
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:01,906
even more indebted to Boss Chai.

288
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,587
If not because of Jiang Hongbin,

289
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:06,587
he wouldn't be detained.

290
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:10,026
Speaking of that jerk.

291
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:12,107
If all we're getting is a divorce,

292
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,306
isn't that letting him off too easy?

293
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:14,826
That's just unacceptable.

294
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:16,387
He did so many bad things,

295
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:17,107
he should

296
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,347
bear legal repercussions,

297
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:19,066
no?

298
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:21,147
Yes, yes.

299
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:23,426
That's why we're looking for evidence.

300
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:23,906
Yeah.

301
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,666
I wonder if Jiang Xiaotong

302
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,786
could be the key.

303
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:30,026
If she's willing to help me

304
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:30,786
and testify,

305
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:32,026
we'll have one more eye witness.

306
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,066
I doubt it.

307
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,467
That's her father.

308
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:36,107
But at the time,

309
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:37,507
she had risked getting hurt

310
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,227
trying to save me
from her dad's clutches.

311
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:40,867
I think

312
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:41,706
she has a sense of justice.

313
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:43,546
Who knows she's willing to help us?

314
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,026
Okay, we could give it a try.

315
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:47,906
But where is she now?

316
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:48,987
Is she awake?

317
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:50,786
I called Jiang Jiaqiao

318
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:51,867
today.

319
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:53,666
She said Xiaotong is awake.

320
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:54,906
Despite just coming around,

321
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,627
Jiang Hongbin immediately transferred her
to another hospital.

322
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:58,107
As to where,

323
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,306
she didn't tell me.

324
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:00,946
I reckon Jiang Hongbin is afraid

325
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,587
that I'd meet with her.

326
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,666
I'll ask her again.

327
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,026
I think, after so many years
doing business,

328
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,227
Jiang Hongbin must have used

329
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:10,946
dubious methods

330
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,867
when handling relationships.

331
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:14,387
There has to be a slip.

332
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:16,387
That's what Chai Jin said too.

333
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,306
But now,

334
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,347
I can't see him.

335
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,426
I don't know

336
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,467
where to start investigating from.

337
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,147
When Jiang Hongbin's ex-wife came back

338
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:30,186
and you two had an altercation,

339
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,546
I went to see him, remember?

340
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,306
This is what he said.

341
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:36,946
When they got divorced,

342
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,186
he gave her everything
he was supposed to.

343
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:40,107
But his ex-wife

344
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,826
came back again

345
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,867
to ask for more money.

346
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:44,387
The reason why

347
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,426
he gave in to her demand was because

348
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:47,627
when he was just starting out

349
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:48,666
on his business,

350
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,347
he relied heavily on the ex-wife's

351
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:51,426
family background.

352
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:53,946
Judging from what we know now,

353
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:55,267
Jiang Hongbin isn't

354
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:56,747
such a nostalgic person,

355
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,387
but a ruthless one.

356
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:00,706
Perhaps his ex-wife

357
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,227
has some leverage on him.

358
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:09,227
Now that you mentioned,

359
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:10,347
thinking back,

360
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:12,666
when the ex-wife

361
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:13,706
first came home,

362
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:15,066
she was carrying

363
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,666
a brown Birkin bag.

364
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:18,026
Later one day,

365
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,347
I went to Jiang Hongbin's office.

366
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,587
I saw him stashing away

367
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:22,227
that bag in the cabinet.

368
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:23,627
So I wanted to take a peek

369
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:24,747
and saw

370
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,026
something like a document folder,

371
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,026
a notebook

372
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:27,946
or something similar inside.

373
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:29,026
But Jiang Hongbin came

374
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:30,507
and took the bag away,

375
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:31,706
refusing to let me see.

376
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:33,826
I also remembered something else.

377
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:36,267
The day Xu Sumin went and made a scene

378
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:37,186
at my studio,

379
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,387
she had said that

380
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:40,306
if I dared cross her,

381
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:41,107
she'd skewer him

382
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,107
alive too.

383
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:43,946
But when I asked Jiang Hongbin

384
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:44,987
about it later,

385
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,147
he said he's lost

386
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,387
the condition to negotiate.

387
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:51,186
How was he... going to win?

388
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,906
I thought it was odd then.

389
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:54,706
Maybe she does have

390
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:55,747
dirt on Jiang Hongbin.

391
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,747
Something that can incriminate him.

392
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:00,387
Yes, that's very possible.

393
00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:02,867
We have to find a way

394
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,066
to get in touch with her.

395
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,147
My guess is,

396
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,546
she doesn't even know

397
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:11,107
that Jiang Xiaotong is in the hospital.

398
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:12,627
I'll bet.

399
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:14,107
Otherwise,
she would've rushed back here.

400
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:29,107
Mr. Wang.

401
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:31,946
Madam.

402
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,107
Are you here to see Mr. Jiang?

403
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:34,227
No.

404
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:36,867
Well, Mr. Jiang is going out soon.

405
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:39,267
Mr. Wang,

406
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,227
I came to see you.

407
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,026
I wanted to ask you

408
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:45,387
if you know

409
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:46,507
how to contact Xu Sumin.

410
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:48,267
What...

411
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:51,467
How to contact Mr. Jiang's ex-wife?

412
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:55,147
I'm only a driver. I wouldn't know.

413
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:57,426
Mr. Wang,

414
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:59,147
you've worked for Jiang Hongbin
a long time.

415
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:00,747
Before Xiaotong came back to China,

416
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:02,587
I'm sure you helped
deliver things to her.

417
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:04,387
Maybe there's a record of the address?

418
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:06,387
Madam,

419
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:07,867
please don't put me
in a difficult position.

420
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:09,147
I'm just a driver.

421
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:10,826
I'm the sole breadwinner

422
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,306
for my family.

423
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,227
My child is going to university.

424
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,026
Yes, I get it.

425
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:18,467
I really do.

426
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,587
But I'm out of options too.

427
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,066
That's why I came to you.

428
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:24,066
It's not only me...

429
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,946
I'm not the only one
falling victim to Jiang Hongbin.

430
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,387
The people around me,

431
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,267
my family,

432
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:30,826
they've all been hurt.

433
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:33,267
My dad too.

434
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:36,426
I saw that.

435
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:38,387
It must be hard on Mr. Xiang.

436
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,747
So I'm really at my wit's end.

437
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:43,467
Please help me.

438
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:51,426
Madam.

439
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:53,426
Mr. Jiang is coming down.

440
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:54,987
You should leave.

441
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:57,267
Mr. Wang.

442
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:00,186
Please help me out.

443
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:02,426
I... I'm begging you.

444
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:04,387
The elevator is coming.

445
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:05,546
You should leave.

446
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:07,026
Don't make it hard for me.

447
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:36,547
Xiang Nan.

448
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:37,906
Jiaqiao.

449
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,226
Sit.

450
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,506
I ordered coffee for you.

451
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:41,787
Sorry I'm late.

452
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:42,426
It's okay.

453
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,946
Is your hand better?

454
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:47,027
Yeah.

455
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,226
It's not the first time anyway.

456
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,107
How are things with Lv Liang?

457
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:57,107
We didn't keep in touch.

458
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:03,587
Jiaqiao,

459
00:18:04,587 --> 00:18:07,107
I asked you out today

460
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:09,547
because I wanted to ask again

461
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,027
if you know where Mavis

462
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:11,906
was transferred to.

463
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:14,547
Could you help me find out?

464
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,867
I wanted to ask you.

465
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,466
Why do you want to see her?

466
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:26,226
I'm hoping

467
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:27,426
she'd agree to be my eye witness.

468
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:34,946
You want to leave my brother.

469
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,226
I get why.

470
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,746
And I support you.

471
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:40,107
If I were you,

472
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:41,867
I'd also leave him.

473
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,706
But he is my brother.

474
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:48,266
He's my only family

475
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:49,627
in this world.

476
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,147
Do you know?

477
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:53,986
How did we manage

478
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:55,107
to survive over the years?

479
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:55,827
He really suffered a lot

480
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:56,706
for my sake.

481
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:57,466
I know

482
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,787
he's done a lot of bad things.

483
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:02,226
Xiang Nan, I'm sorry.

484
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,426
I... I can't do it.

485
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,506
I just can't.

486
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:10,426
I'm sorry.

487
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:13,307
I'm sorry.

488
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,506
I really can't bring myself to.

489
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:15,307
I understand.

490
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,067
I really want to help you. But I...

491
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,426
I understand, Jiaqiao.

492
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,186
It's okay.

493
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,466
Don't feel too bad.

494
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,067
I'm already grateful

495
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,787
that you agreed to see me.

496
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,547
I mean it.

497
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:55,027
Jiaqiao.

498
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:01,147
I forgot to give you this.

499
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,067
Take these. It can help fade the scars.

500
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:08,986
Don't think too much.

501
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,746
When I ordered them, I wasn't planning

502
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,466
to ask you for help.

503
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:14,986
Xiang Nan.

504
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,186
It's fine.

505
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:18,827
Okay.

506
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:19,787
Go on then.

507
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:21,787
It's all good.

508
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:12,426
You're back.

509
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:12,986
Zhong.

510
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:13,906
Good news.

511
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:14,946
No idea who sent us

512
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:15,906
Xu Sumin's address.

513
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:21,787
Where's Qian?

514
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:23,186
She's packing inside.

515
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:27,706
Xiang Nan is back.

516
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:33,466
Qian,

517
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:34,706
are you really going to Canada?

518
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:35,906
Yes.

519
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:38,347
What I'm worried is that

520
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:39,627
even if Xu Sumin has proof,

521
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,946
she won't help us.

522
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:42,946
I don't want the trip to be for nothing.

523
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,986
We won't know unless we go.

524
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:47,986
Besides,

525
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:49,067
is there another way?

526
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:52,706
I'll go with you then.

527
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,666
You'll need a visa to go.

528
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,147
Thankfully,

529
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:57,347
my visa hasn't expired.

530
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:58,706
I can leave right away.

531
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:00,266
Okay.

532
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,107
I'll keep trying

533
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:03,787
and see if I can find Jiang Xiaotong.

534
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,027
If she's willing to be my eye witness,

535
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,107
we'll have a stronger case.

536
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:15,347
No matter who you go see,

537
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:17,027
make sure Xiang Zhong is with you.

538
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:18,506
You two do it together.

539
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:22,266
I'll look after

540
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:23,107
your kids and Mom and Dad.

541
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,226
Don't worry about us.

542
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,107
Be safe.

543
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,946
I know Xiang Nan's case is complicated.

544
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:38,827
I'll be counting on you, Attorney Wu.

545
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:39,706
Rest assured,

546
00:22:39,787 --> 00:22:41,027
I will do my best.

547
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:44,906
You'll meet with Chai Jin soon, right?

548
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:45,666
Yes.

549
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,347
Tell him

550
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:48,986
to take care for me.

551
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,147
Certainly.

552
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:52,186
Have a safe trip.

553
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:53,307
Thanks.

554
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:58,627
Xiang Qian helped prepare

555
00:22:58,706 --> 00:22:59,827
some clothes

556
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:01,547
and daily necessities

557
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,347
for you.

558
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:04,266
I've handed them to the guard.

559
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:10,627
Thank her for me.

560
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:13,266
So,

561
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,587
Xiang Nan is preparing

562
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:17,547
for the divorce lawsuit, right?

563
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:19,466
The materials and evidence

564
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,387
are pretty much there.

565
00:23:20,787 --> 00:23:22,307
We'll be filing the case
in the next few days.

566
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:25,226
Oh, right.

567
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,186
Xiang Qian wrote you a letter.

568
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:34,986
She asked me to pass it to you.

569
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:50,027
(Hi, Chai Jin.)

570
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,627
(When I picked up the pen
to write this letter,)

571
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:55,827
(I felt really overwhelmed.)

572
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,547
(In my head, I went over the moments)

573
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:00,426
(from when I first started working)

574
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,666
(to the past decade.)

575
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,347
(I realized that aside from knowing)

576
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:04,347
(you don't like spicy food,)

577
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:06,506
(what you like to eat,)

578
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:07,787
(what you don't like to eat,)

579
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:09,787
(I couldn't remember it.)

580
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:14,867
(It dawned on me that
over the past 10 years,)

581
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:19,266
(your care for me
greatly overshadowed my care for you.)

582
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:22,107
(I feel ashamed.)

583
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,226
(You've done so much for me.)

584
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:27,107
(Just saying thank you)

585
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:29,107
(is hardly enough to compensate.)

586
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,587
(After your sentencing,)

587
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,226
(I will go visit you soonest possible.)

588
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:43,867
(There are some things
that I must say to you face to face.)

589
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:45,986
(Take care.)

590
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:24,266
Qian.

591
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:25,547
Qian.

592
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,506
Why are you two here?

593
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:28,986
We came to see you off.

594
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,787
I told you there's no need.

595
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:31,706
Take this.

596
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:32,787
Bring it with you.

597
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:34,426
Yeah, we got it from Hangzhou for you.

598
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:35,107
It's really effective.

599
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,627
You guys went to Hangzhou?

600
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,787
She insisted to go.

601
00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:41,706
That's for ensuring safety.

602
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:43,666
Hangzhou isn't that far.

603
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,387
You're going to Canada.

604
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:46,387
Right,

605
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:47,547
this.

606
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:48,627
Take the melatonin.

607
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:49,946
You haven't been sleeping well, right?

608
00:25:50,387 --> 00:25:51,827
This can help with any jet lag.

609
00:25:52,627 --> 00:25:53,466
Oh, there's more.

610
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,387
This one.

611
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:55,787
Steam eye mask.

612
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:57,787
You can use it on the flight.

613
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:58,587
It's relaxing.

614
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:00,107
Take it.

615
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:02,466
I didn't know you were
so thoughtful, Xiang Zhong.

616
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,307
Of course I am.

617
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:05,506
Alright.

618
00:26:05,906 --> 00:26:06,547
I'll be off.

619
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:10,186
Qian, be safe.

620
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:11,827
Be safe, text us when you're there.

621
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:13,547
Hey.

622
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,107
Tell us when you've booked
the return flight.

623
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:16,307
We'll pick you up.

624
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:17,107
Will do.

625
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,827
Eat proper meals.

626
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:19,426
Eat your meals on time.

627
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:20,067
Okay.

628
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:20,706
I know, I've got it.

629
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:21,906
Do not open your door at night

630
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:22,666
for strangers.

631
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:34,266
Qian!

632
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:36,266
Thank you!

633
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,867
We didn't manage to give her a hug.

634
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:52,426
Right.

635
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,080

Do you know him?

642
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:02,666
He's very talented.

643
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:04,587

00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:55,027
Why isn't Mavis picking up the call?

731
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:56,867
Maybe she didn't hear it.

732
00:33:58,627 --> 00:34:00,027
She hasn't called me for some time.

733
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,067

is wrong with Mavis,

747
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:27,306

748
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,027
She is my daughter too.

749
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:30,666
I will look after her well.

750
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:34,027
You've decided to let her stay in China.

751
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,147
No use having afterthoughts,

752
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:36,987
is there?

753
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:38,627
You talk as if

754
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:39,866
you actually cared about her.

755
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:47,987
Call me back.

00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:04,587
(have you met with Xu Sumin?)

758
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:05,427
(How did it go?)

759
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:07,427
(Xiang Qian: If you're going
to look for Jiang Xiaotong,)

760
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:11,226
(set a time so she can
video call her mom.)

761
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,107
(Xiang Zhong: When's a good time
to do the video call?)

762
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:15,266
(Xiang Qian: It's up to you guys.)

763
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:17,107
(Xiang Zhong: We'll go there now.)

764
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,666
(Xiang Qian:
Don't do anything reckless.)

765
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:20,866
(Xiang Zhong: Don't worry.)

766
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,320
(People's Hospital Outpatient)

767
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:42,107
We have no choice.

768
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:42,987
We'll have to wait till he leaves

769
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:43,866
before we can go in.

770
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:45,627
Let's just wait.

771
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:11,346
Madam, she's still here.

772
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:13,226
She's still here?

773
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,467
She's been waiting in front of the gate.

774
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:28,587
Madam,

775
00:36:29,027 --> 00:36:30,467
should we call the police?

776
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:39,666
She's gone.

777
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,226
Has Mavis not called back?

778
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:45,027
Could what she said be true then?

779
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,266
Go, you call her.

780
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:52,627
Call that brat

781
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:53,627
until she picks up.

782
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:55,826
Mavis.

783
00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:00,107
Mavis.

784
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:02,547
Are you feeling better?

785
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,067
I'm sorry.

786
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:05,826
You got hurt

787
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:07,266
because of me.

788
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:09,306
Listen.

789
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,147
Your mom wants to video call you.

790
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:14,467
Can you do it now?

791
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:23,467
Why did she come back?

792
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:30,427
Hang on.

793
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:32,587
You refuse to leave, huh?

794
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:34,147
I'm going to call the police.

795
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:35,346
Your daughter's calling.

796
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:39,587
Mavis.

797
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:42,547
Mavis?

798
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:43,507
Mavis,

799
00:37:43,507 --> 00:37:44,746
how come you're injured?

800
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:46,346
Mom,

801
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:49,547
I really miss you.

802
00:37:50,027 --> 00:37:51,186
I'm right here, Mom's right here.

803
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:51,907
My baby.

804
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:53,627
Mavis, tell me.

805
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,427
How do you feel right now?

806
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:58,027
What happened?

807
00:37:58,467 --> 00:37:59,467
Did someone hit you?

808
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,067
Why won't you come and see me?

809
00:38:04,587 --> 00:38:05,107
Mavis,

810
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:06,587
I really want to go see you.

811
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:08,186
But I'm unable

812
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,627
to leave Canada right now.

813
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:25,306
Hurry, Xiang Nan.

814
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,987
Open the door. Open up!

815
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,107
Get out here!

816
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:28,826
Jiang Hongbin,

817
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:30,266
how did you let my daughter get hurt?

818
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:34,027
Jiang...

819
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:35,266
Jiang...

820
00:38:41,547 --> 00:38:42,186
Open the door.

821
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:43,826
Here's the thing, Xiaotong.

822
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:44,666
I have something to ask you.

823
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:46,706
Are you willing

824
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,266
to be my eye witness?

825
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:05,507
(Xiang Nan: Qian,
turn on the screen recording.)

826
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:10,240
(Xiang Nan: Qian,
turn on the screen recording.)

827
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:15,067
Got it.

828
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:19,467
Jiang Xiaotong.

829
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,186
You saw Jiang Hongbin

830
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:22,186
hitting me that day,

831
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:22,866
didn't you?

832
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:28,826
That day,

833
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,507
it was because you saw him beating me.

834
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,507
So you tried to save me

835
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:32,627
and that's how you got badly injured,

836
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:33,226
right?

837
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:36,907
Yes.

838
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,027
That jerk Jiang Hongbin.

839
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:49,186
Mavis, Mavis!

840
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,186
What are you two doing here?

841
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,147
Give me your phone.

842
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:05,547
What do you want, Jiang Hongbin?

843
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:06,547
Step aside.

844
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:07,987
What are you doing?

845
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:09,306
Don't you dare get physical.

846
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:10,826
Don't touch her, Jiang Hongbin!

847
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:11,507
Give me the phone!

848
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:12,306
Let go, Jiang Hongbin!

849
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:13,147
No!

850
00:40:13,507 --> 00:40:14,346
Let her go!

851
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,186
You're not having it.

852
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:17,987
There are CCTVs in the room.

853
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:21,107
Get off me!

854
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:22,067
Release her!

855
00:40:23,427 --> 00:40:24,746
Your child is watching you!

856
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:25,587
Jiang Hongbin,

857
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:26,866
I'm recording this whole thing.

858
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:28,147
The CCTVs are recording.

859
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:29,907
Do you want to add
more crimes to your list?

860
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:36,947
Turn it off.

861
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:39,987
Give me your phone.

862
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:41,746
I'm telling you now, Jiang Hongbin.

863
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:43,266
We now have sufficient evidence

864
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,186
on you.

865
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:45,866
We'll see you in court.

866
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:49,427
Xiang Nan.

867
00:40:50,706 --> 00:40:51,907
If you don't hand over your phone,

868
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,266
none of you

869
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:54,027
is leaving today.

870
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:55,907
I won't let you

871
00:40:56,027 --> 00:40:57,666
hurt me again and again.

872
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:04,706
I can give you my phone.

873
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,107
But my sister has everything on record.

874
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:08,866
Take it!

875
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:25,386
I'm only asking you one thing.

876
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:28,467
Let us leave.

877
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:47,346
You want to destroy me, don't you?

878
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:48,866
You listen up.

879
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:50,666
From this day on,

880
00:41:51,306 --> 00:41:52,826
you, and you,

881
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:54,547
I'll make sure every one of you

882
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:56,027
suffer forever!

883
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,107
How long is forever?

884
00:41:58,386 --> 00:41:59,147
We'll be waiting.

885
00:41:59,826 --> 00:42:00,467
Come on, Xiang Nan.

886
00:42:00,547 --> 00:42:01,427
Don't waste time

887
00:42:01,507 --> 00:42:02,266
on the jerk.

888
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:27,147
Mr. Jiang.

889
00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:31,067
What are you people good for?

890
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:32,067
You couldn't even

891
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:32,987
keep track of a grown person.

892
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:33,987
Get lost!

893
00:42:34,706 --> 00:42:35,226
Mr. Jiang...

894
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:35,987
Out!

895
00:43:01,226 --> 00:43:01,987
Hello, Xiang Nan?

896
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:02,866
Hey, Qian.

897
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:04,386
