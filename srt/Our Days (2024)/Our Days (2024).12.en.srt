=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 12=

4
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:41,407
Don't you think you were
a bit too mean to Weiwei today?

5
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:43,916
How could I possibly be mean

6
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:44,636
to Weiwei?

7
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,475
I just greeted her,

8
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:48,126
and didn't say anything.

9
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:50,846
The main character today is Weiwei.

10
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:51,716
But, you wore such

11
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:53,766
an extravagant necklace to the party.

12
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,687
Don't you think that's
stealing her spotlight?

13
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:56,687
Moreover,

14
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:59,315
this necklace was
the one Weiwei wanted initially.

15
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:00,807
She didn't buy it, but you did,

16
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:02,687
and now you're wearing it to her party.

17
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:04,595
If that's not targeting her,

18
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:05,807
then what do you mean?

19
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,726
I...

20
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:11,527
Why every things feel like
a palace drama now?

21
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:14,795
Each of you here today

22
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:16,315
are my beloved sisters.

23
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:17,716
Let me toast with tea instead of wine,

24
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:19,807
as an appreciation to all of you
for celebrating my birthday.

25
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:21,075
Happy birthday!

26
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:22,035
Thank you.

27
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:22,475
Weiwei,

28
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,687
Wishing you stay beautiful
and forever young.

29
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:28,807
I'm sorry to interrupt you all.

30
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,166
Mrs. Jiang,

31
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:31,836
I thought you'd already left.

32
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:32,475
How could that happen?

33
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:33,755
How could I leave

34
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:35,046
without saying goodbye.

35
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:38,606
Sorry, I didn't see you earlier.

36
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:41,006
The seat is already well-arranged now.

37
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:43,286
Please add one more chair now.

38
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:44,795
That's fine. You don't have to do that.

39
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:45,726
No need to bother.

40
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:46,595
I just remembered

41
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:47,436
I have something to attend to,

42
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:48,556
so I won't stay here eating.

43
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,875
I left my gift to you here.

44
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,207
Happy birthday!

45
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:53,286
Thank you.

46
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:55,927
By the way, Jiaqiao,

47
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:57,836
do you want me

48
00:02:57,837 --> 00:02:59,156
to return this jewelry set to you now

49
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:00,355
or later at home?

50
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:00,875
What?

51
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:01,716
I'll put it here.

52
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:02,836
I'm afraid that I might

53
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:03,875
accidentally scratch or ruin it.

54
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:04,635
What? This is not mine.

55
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:06,166
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,276
Isn't this yours?

57
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:08,075
For this necklace,

58
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,487
you insisted on buying it,

59
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,996
and let me wear it to show it off.

60
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,516
It makes my neck sore.

61
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:14,116
Xiang Nan,

62
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:15,635
I didn't buy this.

63
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:16,396
- And also the earrings.
- Hold on.

64
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,046
I really didn't buy this.

65
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:19,635
I'll leave it here to you.

66
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:20,676
I really didn't buy this.

67
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:21,396
Goodbye.

68
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:23,247
This was bought by my brother.

69
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:30,595
Weiwei.

70
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:31,726
Let's eat.

71
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:33,355
This vegetarian dish

72
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:34,807
has such vibrant colors,

73
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:37,166
and a sweet and sour taste.

74
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:38,075
There are a lot of tricks

75
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:39,286
and details hidden in it.

76
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:41,046
This one is even stuffed.

77
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,286
What is this?

78
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:46,006
So delicious.

79
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:03,247
Jiang.

80
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:05,927
Jiang.

81
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,846
Go to sleep if you're tired.

82
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:09,606
I specially waited up for you.

83
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:10,767
Come on.

84
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,606
Sit with me for a while.

85
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:17,355
Are you going to lecture me

86
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,487
and teach me a lesson?

87
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:24,046
Do you realize you were in the wrong?

88
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:29,647
I admit I acted a little impulsively today.

89
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:33,795
But, you didn't see how fake they were.

90
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:36,795
All that scheming disgusted me a lot.

91
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:38,567
I know them well enough.

92
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:41,567
But, you can't just leave like that.

93
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:44,366
It embarrasses Xu Weiwei so much.

94
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:45,716
Biao has already called

95
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:47,246
and complained about that to me.

96
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:48,956
That's perfect.

97
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:51,407
I'll never have to
attend their events again.

98
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:54,726
Xiang Nan,

99
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,435
Biao has

100
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:58,726
a big project on hand.

101
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:01,327
If I can secure the project,

102
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,046
we'll be set for retirement

103
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,767
after it's completed.

104
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,046
So exaggerating?

105
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:08,567
Yeah, it's that exaggerating.

106
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,087
I know

107
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:16,926
you are not in the
same boat as them,

108
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,207
but sometimes

109
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:20,286
you need to consider my position.

110
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:23,555
Putting up with them occasionally

111
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,486
isn't going to hurt you.

112
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:28,606
This way,

113
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:29,926
in a few days,

114
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,447
let's invite Weiwei and Biao for a dinner.

115
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:35,567
You make a small gift for Weiwei

116
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:38,046
as an apology, okay?

117
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:42,355
Why do I have to join

118
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:43,555
in their palace drama?

119
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:44,156
I tell you,

120
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:45,846
I won't be able to last an episode.

121
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:48,115
What palace drama?

122
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,007
It seems that you've been
watching too many period dramas.

123
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,286
Your Majesty,

124
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:53,046
spare your concubine.

125
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:33,846
(Wang Yuxi: Are you asleep?)

126
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:40,726
(Xiang Zhong: I can't sleep.)

127
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:47,967
(Wang Yuxi: Then head to the balcony.)

128
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,950
(Baby's Sleep Music,
White Noise- Sleep Aid. MP3)

129
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:23,967
(Good night.)

130
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:54,502
(Don't Let A Fox Kidnaps Kids)

131
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:02,596
For now,

132
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:03,675
the KPI assessment plan

133
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,727
isn't very favorable for you.

134
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:07,086
I think

135
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:08,566
you guys

136
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:10,996
should stop wasting energy

137
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,527
on that retirement plan.

138
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,396
It's a long-term goal

139
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:15,555
that doesn't align

140
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,396
with the company's product.

141
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:17,876
In the end, your income

142
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:19,127
won't improve.

143
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,350
(Dad)

144
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:39,926
Feeling better now?

145
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:41,367
How's your pulse?

146
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,195
What happened, dad and mum?

147
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,966
What is going on? Where are the kids?

148
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,686
Gao Ping is looking after them.

149
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:50,607
Xiang Qian,

150
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:52,566
such a serious thing happened,

151
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,487
why didn't you tell us?

152
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,636
Today, we read a storybook to the kids,

153
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:59,326
which is about not letting
a fox kidnap kids.

154
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:00,276
Then, only we found out that the kids

155
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,046
were nearly taken away.

156
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:06,607
But, it was fail.

157
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,915
It was just a scare.

158
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,046
We found them back.

159
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,675
The kids were already taken,

160
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,035
and even the police were involved.

161
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:14,966
How can you describe that only scare?

162
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,446
That's child trafficking!

163
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,195
Exactly.

164
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:19,315
What if something terrible

165
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:20,767
had happened?

166
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:23,636
But nothing did.

167
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:25,116
I was anxious too,

168
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:27,206
but nothing happened now.

169
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,156
Xiang Qian,

170
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:29,996
the children aren't just yours.

171
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,075
They call us Grandpa and Grandma too.

172
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:33,926
You...

173
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:37,636
Why didn't you tell us immediately

174
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,756
when it happened?

175
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:39,195
Hold on.

176
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:40,315
What would telling you have done?

177
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:40,996
I had to make a report

178
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:42,566
to the police first, didn't I?

179
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,075
You think hiding it from us

180
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,367
is doing us a favor?

181
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:46,847
That's wrong!

182
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:47,715
You're just

183
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:48,795
being disrespectful!

184
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,487
Keep your voice down!

185
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:57,607
Just like how you divorced Feng Yue.

186
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:59,276
You two were together for so many years

187
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:00,727
and divorced less than a year
after getting married.

188
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:01,795
You didn't even tell us.

189
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:03,007
We didn't know it happened.

190
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:04,675
Feng Yue's father and I

191
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:06,236
were old classmates
at the technical school.

192
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:06,955
Xiang Qian,

193
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:07,915
because of this,

194
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,007
I've been unable

195
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:10,835
to hold my head up

196
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,446
in front of my old classmates for years.

197
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:17,326
Come on, times have changed.

198
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:19,156
All I did was get a divorce.

199
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:20,806
What's there to be embarrassed about?

200
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,955
My daughter's divorce
was such a big deal,

201
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:25,086
and I didn't even know about it.

202
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:26,715
As a dad like this,

203
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:27,966
I have no face left.

204
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:29,516
In the past Mid-Autumn Festival,
I even brought crabs

205
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:30,955
as a gift to their family,

206
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,166
and I ended up being brushed off.

207
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:34,847
My reputation was all gone.

208
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,435
Enough.

209
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,367
Why do you bring this up again?

210
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:40,555
It's been five or six years already.

211
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:43,007
You still want to mention
this to provoke her.

212
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,926
Both of you were wrong.

213
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:56,795
Both of us have been together
for so many years.

214
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:57,596
Whether we're suited for marriage,

215
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:58,566
I know myself.

216
00:11:58,597 --> 00:11:59,555
If it weren't for your reputation,

217
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:00,767
would I have gotten married?

218
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:01,715
Look at what things have turned out now.

219
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:02,767
We're divorced,

220
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,166
and became enemies.

221
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,046
Do you hear that?

222
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,955
So, it ends up to be our mistakes.

223
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:08,966
It's my fault!

224
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:13,887
What's wrong, Dad?

225
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:15,206
What's wrong with you?

226
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,236
I told you!

227
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,315
Your air conditioner is too strong.

228
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:20,835
You are just too greedy,

229
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:21,966
and always stay
under the air conditioner.

230
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:23,116
He's strained.

231
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,675
Then, let's go find
a Chinese medicine clinic.

232
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:25,566
No need.

233
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:26,607
My little tag-along,

234
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,527
since we're not respected here,

235
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,247
let's just go back to Kunshan.

236
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,195
What about the kids?

237
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:33,035
I'm in this condition,

238
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,156
and you still care about the kids?

239
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:35,286
Can't you care about me?

240
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:36,566
I will.

241
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,915
Then, stay till I get off work,

242
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,286
and I'll drive you back.

243
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:41,166
No need.

244
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,247
That's unnecessary.

245
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,035
I'll go get the car now.

246
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:45,046
No need.

247
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:46,727
Let's go.

248
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,527
Lead me the way.

249
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:50,647
I can't remember the way.

250
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,847
Just keep walking
as long as there's a way.

251
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:03,727
(Xiang Qian: Why did my parents
come here out of a sudden?)

252
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,166
(Gao Ping: They came by
to bring the soup for the kids.)

253
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,596
(Xiang Qian: My dad found out
about Ms. Zhang)

254
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:12,326
(and came to the office to scold me.)

255
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:16,487
(Gao Ping: How did they find out?)

256
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:22,007
(Xiang Qian: The kids
must have let it slip.)

257
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:23,926
(Gao Ping: Oops.)

258
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:25,926
(I was going downstairs
to throw the garbage,)

259
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:27,476
(and I received a message from dad)

260
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,086
(to rush home and check on the kids.)

261
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,156
(Don't Let A Fox Kidnaps Kids)
(When I got back,)

262
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,396
(they were already gone.)

263
00:13:31,397 --> 00:13:33,007
(I never knew they went to find you.)

264
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:38,795
(Xiang Qian: Do you think your Aunty)

265
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,407
(can come to look after the kids?)

266
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:45,686
(Gao Ping: My Aunty is going
through tough times.)

267
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,566
(I'd like to help her,)

268
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:48,915
(but if I give her money only,)

269
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,286
(she won't accept it.)

270
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:52,636
(Xiang Qian: Then,
please ask your Aunty)

271
00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:53,966
(if she can come over to help out.)

272
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:59,007
(Gao Ping: Alright, I ask her right now.)

273
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:21,007
(Xiang Zhong: Why haven't I seen you
feeding the cats these past few days?)

274
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:28,247
(Wang Yuxi: Sorry, I've caught a cold.)

275
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,607
(Xiang Zhong: Are you home?)

276
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:33,806
I'm coming.

277
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,407
Why are you here?

278
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,727
I'm here to check on you.

279
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:51,046
I...

280
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:52,835
I brought you some juice

281
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:54,206
and light food.

282
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,356
My place hasn't been cleaned in days.

283
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:58,446
It's a bit messy now.

284
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:00,686
I'm not going in.

285
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:01,966
Take this.

286
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:03,647
Thank you.

287
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:04,887
You're welcome.

288
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,046
I get to go now.

289
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:07,647
Xiang Zhong,

290
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,326
are you free this weekend?

291
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:12,686
What happens?

292
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:15,206
Come and have a meal at my house.

293
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,487
Is it convenient for you?

294
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,326
You might haven't recovered
from the cold yet.

295
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,647
I think I'll be alright this weekend.

296
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,887
Then...

297
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:27,686
See you on the weekend?

298
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:32,446
Alright, see you on weekend.

299
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,396
A good dog never blocks the way.

300
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:50,487
Do you mean yourself?

301
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:53,887
I have no time to argue with you here.

302
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,715
It's solely for the
sake of your brother.

303
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:56,555
Otherwise, I'd never bother

304
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,127
going to meet Weiwei.

305
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:00,276
We're doing it for
your brother's benefit.

306
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:02,075
But, you tried to mess things around.

307
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:03,527
How silly you are!

308
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:04,476
Who are you calling silly?

309
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:05,075
I mean you!

310
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:06,236
It's just you and me here.

311
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:07,286
Who else could I mean?

312
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:09,516
I tell you, you better not get smug

313
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,835
just because my brother
favors you right now.

314
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,276
I tell you, after all,
I'm his biological sister.

315
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,315
When he doesn't dote on you anymore,

316
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:16,555
he would have abandoned you.

317
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:18,286
Let's see how you show off to me later.

318
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:20,527
Oh no, how terrible your brother is!

319
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:21,996
Aren't you his biological sister?

320
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,435
How can you describe him
so badly behind his back?

321
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:24,476
I can't bear to listen to it anymore.

322
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:25,276
I didn't mean that.

323
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,566
You shouldn't accuse me.

324
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:27,847
Alright.

325
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:29,127
A dog was barking.

326
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:30,356
Who are you indicating a dog?

327
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,966
You! No doubt, it's you.

328
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,487
You stupid!

329
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,206
What did you say?

330
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:36,767
I said you are stupid!

331
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,195
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

332
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,675
Why can't I say that to you?

333
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:41,046
Stupid!

334
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:43,715
I said you are stupid!

335
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:45,116
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

336
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:46,407
Why can't I say that to you?

337
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:47,847
Stupid!

338
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:49,756
If you want to argue
with me in the future,

339
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:50,876
I'd play this recording,

340
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,647
letting you quarrel with yourself.

341
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,367
You recorded this?

342
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:55,236
Delete it.

343
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:55,996
I want you to delete it.

344
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:57,156
I say you are stupid.

345
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:58,326
Delete the recording.

346
00:16:58,556 --> 00:16:59,607
Delete it now.

347
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:00,356
I ask you to delete it.

348
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,326
Give me your phone.

349
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:06,166
Miss!

350
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,887
Miss! Miss!

351
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:08,996
Miss!

352
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:09,726
Don't touch me.

353
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,206
Call me an ambulance.

354
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:12,235
Jiang Jiaqiao.

355
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:13,755
Hurry up! Call an ambulance.

356
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:14,766
Call now.

357
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:16,356
Where do you hurt?

358
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:17,686
You can tell me.

359
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:19,686
Go away!

360
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:21,287
Wait.

361
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,755
Where do you feel pain?

362
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:24,076
Where did you get hit?

363
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,116
Your arms? Or your legs?

364
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:26,926
My breast.

365
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:28,526
Breast?

366
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,110
(Operation Room)

367
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,287
Here you come.

368
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:47,726
How is she now?

369
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,407
She's had an X-ray taken.

370
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,195
The doctor said,

371
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,636
one of her breast implants
has moved out of place.

372
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,367
It has to be removed completely now.

373
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,246
How long has she been in surgery?

374
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:01,047
An hour and ten minutes.

375
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:15,367
Xiang Nan,

376
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:21,127
you're more patient

377
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:23,407
and knowledgeable than her.

378
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:26,206
Could you not
take things seriously with her?

379
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:29,367
It's not that I want to be petty.

380
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:31,116
She just can't stand the sight of me.

381
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,006
You can just let her do
whatever she wants.

382
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:34,036
She's unreasonable,

383
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:35,686
but you can just ignore her.

384
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,327
It's her who always stirs up trouble.

385
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,486
Hello, Shen, what's up?

386
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:49,246
Does it have to be this time?

387
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:51,966
I'm in the hospital now.

388
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,446
My sister is having an ongoing surgery.

389
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,486
Tell them I'm unavailable now.

390
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:59,087
Let me know after you arrange it.

391
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:16,926
Xiang Nan,

392
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:19,206
you know,

393
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:21,966
she's been bullied
by the others since childhood,

394
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,686
but she never told me.

395
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:32,327
Actually,

396
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:36,887
Jiaqiao has always lacked confidence.

397
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,887
She's different from you.

398
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,116
She's been afraid of people

399
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:43,166
looking down on her,

400
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:47,367
so she always feels the need to compete.

401
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,647
I'm responsible

402
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,047
for her character today.

403
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,686
It's my fault

404
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:05,407
for not protecting her.

405
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:11,526
Jiang, don't blame yourself.

406
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:13,636
For what happened today,

407
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:16,246
there's indeed my fault too.

408
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:18,446
I was too impulsive.

409
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:24,847
Xiang Nan,

410
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,966
I hope that when Jiaqiao comes out later,

411
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,607
you can apologize to her in person.

412
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:39,686
Come in.

413
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,087
Xiang Qian.

414
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,287
Aunty is here.

415
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:44,076
You can wear these slippers.

416
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:44,715
Alright.

417
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:45,275
Just leave it there.

418
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:45,995
You go in first.

419
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,287
Aunty, you're here.

420
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:47,915
Come here!

421
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,396
Cong, Qi, come over here.

422
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:50,647
Faster.

423
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:52,076
Greet Grandaunt.

424
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:53,836
Hi, Grandaunt.

425
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:54,966
Hello.

426
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:56,596
Aunty, why did you bring

427
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,926
a whole jar of pickles?

428
00:20:58,077 --> 00:20:59,596
Gao Ping said you love pickles,

429
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:00,847
so I brought it along.

430
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:03,446
Thank you for bringing it
from so far away.

431
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:04,796
Come on.

432
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,036
Grandaunt has prepared

433
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:07,327
something for you both.

434
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:08,876
Take it.

435
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:09,955
No, Aunty.

436
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:10,966
We can't take that.

437
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:12,796
After all, I'm an elder.

438
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:13,596
It's customary to give something

439
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,607
for the first meeting.

440
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:17,876
Cong, Qi, right?

441
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:18,435
Take it.

442
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:20,407
We accept your kindness, Aunty, but...

443
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:22,726
It's not much.

444
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,235
I can't afford to give much too.

445
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:25,396
It's just a little token.

446
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:26,766
If you don't accept it,

447
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:27,966
you're looking down on me.

448
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:28,876
No, not at all.

449
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:30,316
You've come all the way

450
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:31,396
to help us,

451
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:32,926
we're already very grateful.

452
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,246
Let's wait until the new year arrives.

453
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:36,926
Gao Ping,

454
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:38,006
what do you think?

455
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,275
Just accept it.

456
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:41,446
It's a little kindness from Aunty.

457
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:44,486
Dad said to take it, so take it.

458
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:46,435
Take it.

459
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:47,966
Dad has allowed you to take it.

460
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:49,486
Thank you, Grandaunt.

461
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,715
Thank you, Grandaunt.

462
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:51,926
Don't mention it.

463
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:01,367
Xiang Qian, let me do it.

464
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:02,246
Give it to me.

465
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:03,526
Give it to me.

466
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:04,915
You've been on the journey all day.

467
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,675
You must have been tired.

468
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:07,836
Let me and Gao Ping cook today.

469
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:09,206
Don't worry. I'm not tired.

470
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:10,515
Just let me know

471
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:11,607
if there's anything you'd like to eat.

472
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:13,475
Alright.

473
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:14,675
All the food you sent us before

474
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:15,766
are all delicious.

475
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:18,036
That's all because Gao Ping told me.

476
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,166
Otherwise, how would I know what you like.

477
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:24,995
Yeah, Aunty insisted on

478
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:25,995
sending us food.

479
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,036
I told her that we have children,

480
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:28,036
so she separated

481
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:29,246
the spicy and non-spicy food.

482
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:33,127
The separated ones,

483
00:22:33,196 --> 00:22:35,166
the kids loved to eat too.

484
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:36,486
Good to hear.

485
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:37,995
If they like anything,

486
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:39,166
I'll make more for them.

487
00:22:39,797 --> 00:22:41,076
Thank you so much, Aunty.

488
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:42,047
Don't mention it.

489
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:46,446
Hmm,

490
00:22:47,837 --> 00:22:48,836
I just wanted

491
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:50,246
to reduce her financial burden.

492
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:52,396
She comes mainly to be the babysitter,

493
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:53,726
and lighten the load for you.

494
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,116
If you find any inappropriate,
you can let me know.

495
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:57,327
I'll send her back.

496
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:08,036
Physical recovery takes time,

497
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:10,675
and without enough rest,

498
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:12,475
the risks of another surgery
could be high.

499
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,596
You should rest well for now,

500
00:23:13,597 --> 00:23:15,047
and don't get stressed.

501
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:16,887
Call me if you need anything.

502
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:17,726
Alright.

503
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:19,607
Hi.

504
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:30,206
Honestly,

505
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:31,807
I think

506
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:34,926
there's no need for another surgery.

507
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:37,195
You look great

508
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,726
just as you are naturally.

509
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:47,116
By the way,

510
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:49,966
your besties came looking
for you at home.

511
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:52,915
Don't move.

512
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:53,675
I didn't tell them

513
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:55,235
you're in the hospital.

514
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:56,166
Don't worry.

515
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:59,396
I've instructed Ms. He as well

516
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,515
to say you have acute gastroenteritis

517
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:02,966
if anyone else comes looking.

518
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:14,407
I'm sorry.

519
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:17,807
I did do something wrong.

520
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,526
I'll be more careful in the future.

521
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:22,915
If you need anything,

522
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,796
let me know.

523
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:24,195
And,

524
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,316
if you don't want to see me,

525
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:26,847
just tell Ms. He.

526
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:28,647
Get your rest.

527
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:30,567
I'll be outside.

528
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,407
I'm back.

529
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:42,367
You must be tired.

530
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,726
Take a rest inside.

531
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:44,926
Where are the kids?

532
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:47,486
Gao Ping took them to art class.

533
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:03,367
What's that smell in there?

534
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:09,486
It smells like something rotten.

535
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:11,926
I didn't notice anything.

536
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:14,246
Aunty,

537
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:17,327
you need to change
the garbage bags every day.

538
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:19,876
I thought it was just a bit of trash,

539
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,127
so I didn't want to waste another bag.

540
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:21,876
No.

541
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:22,915
It's summer now.

542
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:23,316
Look,

543
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:25,287
there are shrimp heads
and shells in there.

544
00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:26,396
The smell is too strong

545
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:27,955
that it spread into the living room.

546
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:28,847
Is that so?

547
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,287
I'll change it right away.

548
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,246
I'll go take out the clothes.

549
00:25:35,716 --> 00:25:36,755
Never mind, you just do this.

550
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:37,275
You just handle this.

551
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:37,995
I will go.

552
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:38,966
Alright.

553
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,486
We're back.

554
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:04,047
You're back?

555
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:06,995
It's the summer peak now.

556
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:07,995
Why did Aunty take out

557
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:09,847
my cashmere sweater to wash?

558
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:11,966
It's shrunk after drying.

559
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:13,486
My mistake.

560
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,766
Aunty offered to clean the house.

561
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,195
I thought she'd just tidy up.

562
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:18,876
I didn't expect

563
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:19,876
she'd take out all the clothes

564
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:20,836
and washed them.

565
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:22,246
I should've been cleared with her.

566
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:25,166
Can you explain to Aunty

567
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:26,116
that only clothes

568
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,887
in the laundry basket need washing?

569
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:29,356
The other clothes

570
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:30,515
for the seasons,

571
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:32,246
I'll do it myself.

572
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:33,246
Alright.

573
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:34,486
I'll tell her.

574
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:36,486
Aunty.

575
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:43,287
What are you talking?

576
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:45,647
Gao Ping,

577
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:47,686
did I do something wrong?

578
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:48,847
No, nothing.

579
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:50,116
We're just discussing

580
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:51,486
some home affairs.

581
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:53,006
Don't worry. You can do your things.

582
00:26:54,877 --> 00:26:55,887
It's time to eat soon.

583
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:57,966
Alright, we'll be there.

584
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:08,327
Let me think of...

585
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:10,556
I'll find a way to tell her.

586
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:11,515
This is quite expensive.

587
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:13,127
I'm worried if she feels guilty.

588
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:14,686
Let me think of
how to explain it to her.

589
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:15,995
Yes.

590
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:17,955
I only have a few expensive clothes.

591
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:19,766
I'm upset too.

592
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:24,475
And some of the clothes

593
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,675
have to send for dry-clean only.

594
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:27,287
It can't be washed at home.

595
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,636
I tell her? Or you?

596
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:31,047
I'll tell her.

597
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:48,607
Aunty.

598
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:50,596
Did I ruin your clothes

599
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:52,166
by washing them?

600
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,407
It's alright.

601
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,327
Was it expensive?

602
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:58,127
You can just deduce the cost from my pay.

603
00:27:58,357 --> 00:27:59,446
Don't worry about it.

604
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:00,887
You didn't do it deliberately.

605
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:03,556
I've written down

606
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,486
all the daily routines

607
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:07,647
you should do at home.

608
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:09,246
Actually,

609
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:10,356
there's laundry instruction

610
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,087
labelled on the clothes.

611
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:13,887
You can check on it
before doing the laundry.

612
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:15,726
The clothes that need to be dry-cleaned
can be sent to the laundry.

613
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,076
I've also listed

614
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:19,047
the schedule for changing
bedsheets and blanket covers,

615
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:23,235
and the routine of Cong and Qi for you.

616
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:24,887
You can read it when you have time.

617
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:36,876
And, if there are things

618
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:37,995
I don't need you to handle,

619
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:40,807
I've jotted down those on it too.

620
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,206
Alright, I'll take note of it.

621
00:28:43,877 --> 00:28:44,955
Anything you're unsure about,

622
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,567
feel free to ask me or Gao Ping.

623
00:28:47,597 --> 00:28:49,526
Alright, I understand.

624
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:55,567
Zhong, let's go eat together.

625
00:28:55,956 --> 00:28:57,887
There's a new restaurant
opening right outside.

626
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:58,755
I'm not eating.

627
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:00,047
I'm dieting.

628
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,367
Deng,

629
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:02,407
let's go eat together.

630
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:03,647
Haiyang,

631
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:04,607
do you want to join us?

632
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:05,435
No.

633
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:06,407
Thanks.

634
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:08,235
Alright, Xiang Zhong,

635
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:09,036
we're heading out then.

636
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:09,715
Go ahead.

637
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:11,087
Deng, we go together next time.

638
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,047
Still staying at Qian Feng's house?

639
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:19,367
No.

640
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,966
Do you have pharyngitis?

641
00:29:22,157 --> 00:29:23,647
Get yourself some medicine.

642
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,567
You need a shower.

643
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:31,766
You have a bad body odor.

644
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:32,887
Please mind that.

645
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:54,327
Gao Ping.

646
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:55,556
You're back.

647
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:56,287
Yes.

648
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,166
Did you send the kids
to the kindergarten?

649
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:00,966
Yes.

650
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:04,367
Do you fetch the kids every day?

651
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,486
My schedule is a bit more flexible.

652
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:18,327
Did Xiang Qian comment on something?

653
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,567
What happened?

654
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:20,876
If she found out

655
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:21,966
that it's you who asked me
to send the parcel,

656
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:24,006
what would she think?

657
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,087
That's fine. Don't worry.

658
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:32,847
Gao Ping,

659
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:35,486
I hope you don't mind me saying so,

660
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,475
but a man should still

661
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,127
have a bit of authority at home.

662
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:40,036
Otherwise, even the kids

663
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:41,407
won't respect you.

664
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:49,926
Aunty,

665
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:51,486
I think

666
00:30:51,597 --> 00:30:53,526
there's one thing I have to tell you,

667
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:56,836
Cong and Qi

668
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:58,726
are actually not my child.

669
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:01,755
They're Xiang Qian's kids
with her ex-husband.

670
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:02,915
When I married her,

671
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:04,127
the kids were almost one year old.

672
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:05,766
She's been divorced before?

673
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:11,526
So, why do the kids have
your last name Gao?

674
00:31:12,157 --> 00:31:12,836
I've always

675
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,407
treated them like my own kids.

676
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,166
But, that's still different.

677
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:22,006
For me, that's the same.

678
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:37,367
You're still at work?

679
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,515
The team is pushing for materials.

680
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:40,316
By the way, Deng,

681
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,127
Mrs. Deng brought you something.

682
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:58,607
Xiang Zhong.

683
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:05,567
Xiang Zhong.

684
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:16,647
Not sure if you like sparkling wine.

685
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:18,607
I like it.

686
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:23,726
Come in.

687
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:41,475
Oh my god!

688
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:43,607
This cat is so cute.

689
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:46,847
What is its name?

690
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:48,407
Its name is Goldie.

691
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:50,556
Goldie, nice to meet you.

692
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:51,766
Goldie.

693
00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:54,915
Your cousin lives
a passionate life, huh?

694
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,486
He has so many plants.

695
00:33:58,317 --> 00:33:59,807
He's a plant killer.

696
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,607
I brought all these from Shanghai.

697
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:03,596
I ended the lease on my place there.

698
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:05,246
Some of my friends adopted a few,

699
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:06,847
and these are what's left.

700
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,675
Is room temperature okay for you?

701
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:09,726
Sure, thanks.

702
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:11,435
If you go back to Shanghai,

703
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:13,446
will you take all of these with you?

704
00:34:15,157 --> 00:34:16,847
I haven't decided where to go yet.

705
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:19,407
I give myself a month to figure it out.

706
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,207
Maybe back to Shanghai,

707
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,086
or somewhere else.

708
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,327
I don't know yet

709
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:28,887
the exact place I will go.

710
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:30,606
The thing is,

711
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,847
I'm not sure who I'll meet.

712
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:53,086
So, the person you meet

713
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:56,367
will be your reason

714
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:57,847
for going somewhere?

715
00:34:58,676 --> 00:34:59,727
Maybe.

716
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,687
Do you have any cat treats?

717
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:15,675
Yes.

718
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:16,887
I'll feed them some.

719
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,167
Let me give you some snacks.

720
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:20,566
Don't run away.

721
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:21,956
Alright.

722
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:22,966
Thank you.

723
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,956
Look at you,

724
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:28,006
little glutton.

725
00:35:34,037 --> 00:35:35,367
Is it okay to sit on the floor?

726
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,727
Yes.

727
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:39,367
We just have this coffee table to eat at.

728
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:40,687
That's fine.

729
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:42,646
Stop cooking more.

730
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:44,367
Just one more dish.

731
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:46,887
Alright, all done.

732
00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:50,156
Wow, this looks amazing.

733
00:35:50,157 --> 00:35:51,446
Try it, taste if it's any good.

734
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:52,327
Wait a minute.

735
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:06,407
This speaker is pretty cute.

736
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:08,767
Would you like a drink or a soft drink?

737
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:10,207
A soft drink, please.

738
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,006
Nice to meet you.

739
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:18,926
You're funny.

740
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:21,795
A bit too formal?

741
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:23,086
Then let me rephrase.

742
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:26,167
Welcome to my place.

743
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:28,156
Thank you, chef.

744
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:29,086
You've worked hard.

745
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:37,247
Shall we dig in now?

746
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:38,207
Yes.

747
00:36:59,557 --> 00:37:00,847
This is really delicious.

748
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:03,715
Were you a professional chef before?

749
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:05,566
I'm a Le Cordon Bleu graduate.

750
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:07,606
Really?

751
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,006
I'm just kidding.

752
00:37:11,756 --> 00:37:13,086
But, these are easy.

753
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:15,167
You could try making them too.

754
00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:16,807
Just ask me if you're stuck.

755
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:18,727
Forget it.

756
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,036
Around here,

757
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,556
we hardly eat Western food.

758
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:22,795
If you order a salad,

759
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:23,516
people might think

760
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:24,767
you're being pretentious.

761
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:26,956
I think you should just
enjoy what you like.

762
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:29,807
No need to care what people think.

763
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:32,606
I think you're right.

764
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:33,916
Everyone around me

765
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:35,926
usually does three things for fun,

766
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:38,675
scroll through short videos,

767
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:40,526
go to karaoke, or have some barbecue.

768
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,596
If you live a different way,

769
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:44,006
they think you're being pretentious.

770
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:47,086
So,

771
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:48,315
do you think

772
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:49,767
you're a pretentious person?

773
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:51,327
What do you think?

774
00:37:56,037 --> 00:37:56,715
Like you said,

775
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:58,687
why do we have to live like others?

776
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:03,126
I think it's okay to live a little selfishly.

777
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:06,287
Happiness is what matters.

778
00:38:12,997 --> 00:38:13,847
Don't move.

779
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:40,767
You need to get a vaccine.

780
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,966
No, I don't.

781
00:38:43,437 --> 00:38:44,687
You have to get vaccinated.

782
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:46,167
It's not that bad.

783
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:47,606
Trust me.

784
00:38:57,957 --> 00:38:58,767
Xiang Zhong.

785
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:00,086
Xiang Zhong.

786
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,767
Xiang Zhong.

787
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:02,926
Xiang Zhong.

788
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,550
(Hubby)

789
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:34,156
Here are your car keys.

790
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:35,086
Thanks.

791
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:38,596
Sorry

792
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:40,036
you got scratched today

793
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:41,167
and even need to get vaccinated.

794
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:42,727
I'm fine.

795
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:46,156
It might hurt a bit for a few days,

796
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:47,086
maybe itch too.

797
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:48,327
Try not to scratch.

798
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:50,167
Alright.

799
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:53,355
You have to get the second vaccine
the day after tomorrow.

800
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,727
I'll come with you by the time.

801
00:39:58,117 --> 00:39:59,006
No need.

802
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,596
You can make your own plans.

803
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:01,566
I'll be fine.

804
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:03,486
That's okay.

805
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:05,167
I don't have much else going on.

806
00:40:06,597 --> 00:40:07,966
I'll go in first.

807
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:16,446
You can go back now.

808
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:18,167
You go in first.

809
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,807
Good night.

810
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:22,446
Good night.

811
00:40:23,276 --> 00:40:24,407
Go inside.

812
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:44,287
Where did you go?

813
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:46,646
Why are you here?

814
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:50,835
Who was that guy today?

815
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:52,407
The one sitting in the car with you.

816
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:55,767
Is that something I need to explain?

817
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,116
You're right.

818
00:40:57,117 --> 00:40:58,355
You don't have to explain to me.

819
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,167
But...

820
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:00,086
But...

821
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:02,556
Why didn't you answer my calls?

822
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:03,315
Stop calling me unless it's important.

823
00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:04,086
Wait.

824
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:06,476
So, why...

825
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:09,046
Why can't I call you anymore?

826
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:14,046
Is it because he's next to you,

827
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:17,207
and you're afraid to pick up my call?

828
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,167
What's wrong with you?

829
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:22,046
What's wrong with me?

830
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:23,275
Wait, you...

831
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:24,755
You bring me something during the day

832
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:26,355
and hang out with another guy at night.

833
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:27,195
And, you won't even

834
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:29,327
pick up my calls in front of him.

835
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:31,036
What's that about?

836
00:41:31,037 --> 00:41:32,556
Deng Haiyang, let me be clear,

837
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,355
giving you something

838
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:35,036
doesn't mean I still
have feelings for you.

839
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,956
I just didn't want you looking so messy.

840
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,207
Got it?

841
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:39,436
Got it.

842
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:40,956
Can you answer me one question?

843
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:41,436
Please get out of here.

844
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:41,956
I need to rest now.

845
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,596
Answer me.

846
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:43,675
Get out!

847
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:44,036
Wait.

848
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:44,436
You...

849
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,355
Just tell me...

850
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:47,355
It has nothing to do with you.

851
00:41:47,356 --> 00:41:48,275
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

852
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:48,956
Get out of here!

853
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:49,715
Who do you think you are?

854
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:50,315
Who am I?

855
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:50,675
Go away.

00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:51,367
