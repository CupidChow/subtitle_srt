=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 8=

4
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:45,011
I'm not.

5
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:46,501
It's fine, even if you are.

6
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:50,050
No, I'm not. Don't overthink.

7
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,610
I honestly am not.

8
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,371
Mom, stop talking about it.
That's not possible.

9
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:55,861
Well, Mr. Xiang and Mrs. Xiang.

10
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,301
In the second half of this year,
there are a few projects in my company,

11
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:01,410
and I'll be very busy,

12
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,931
so I discussed it with Xiang Nan
that we'd have the wedding earlier.

13
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:05,062
Right, Jiang's tied up.

14
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,811
But this is too rushed.

15
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,530
You should book a decent hotel

16
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:10,301
a few months in advance.

17
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,301
In Suzhou, as long as my brother needs

18
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,942
any place or time,

19
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,251
it won't be a problem.

20
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:19,141
Don't exaggerate.

21
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:21,102
I'm telling the truth.

22
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,131
I specifically hired

23
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:25,301
a wedding planner from the U.S.

24
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:28,451
This team comes up with great ideas.

25
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,490
They are also very productive.

26
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:31,741
Whether it's next month

27
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:32,851
or even next week,

28
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,461
their plan will also be very fabulous.

29
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:38,760
What is she talking about?

30
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,650
It means good, splendid.

31
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,341
Mrs. Xiang, you know what?

32
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:46,581
They've planned weddings
for American celebrities.

33
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:49,741
Paris Hilton's wedding
was planned by them.

34
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:50,461
Hi...

35
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,262
Hilton.

36
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,971
Enough, Jiaqiao.

37
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:57,262
Hilton Hotels, do you know that?

38
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:58,741
I don't know. I've never been there.

39
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:03,461
It's Xiang Nan's wedding.

40
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,422
As long as she likes it.

41
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,422
Right? Dad and Mom
also wish for the same thing.

42
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,411
Mr. Jiang, the management team
gave us a call.

43
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:12,782
Someone sent a bouquet over.

44
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:14,650
What bouquet?

45
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,822
We didn't order any.

46
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:18,502
It's sent by Mr. Deng Haiyang.

47
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:19,901
Deng Haiyang?

48
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:33,061
Did you deliver the bouquet here?

49
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,210
Yes, I did.

50
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:37,971
Where should I put it?

51
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:38,702
Inside.

52
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:42,330
Do you have a trolley
or a cart to carry the bouquet?

53
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,822
It's huge. It can be more convenient.

54
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:44,851
What's that? I don't have it.

55
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:47,222
Ma'am, please.

56
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:49,621
Ma'am?

57
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:50,982
Me?

58
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:53,301
No.

59
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,610
I only deliver it here.

60
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:10,102
- I won't help unload the goods.
- I know. Please do me a favor.

61
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:11,702
How about this?

62
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,090
You can pay another hundred yuan.

63
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:14,942
That's too much. Fifty.

64
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:15,782
One hundred.

65
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:16,741
Eighty.

66
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:17,782
One hundred and twenty.

67
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:20,502
Deal.

68
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,250
Where should we put it?

69
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:27,130
Be careful.

70
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:27,971
Where should we put it?

71
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:28,851
Put it

72
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,211
in the living room.

73
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:32,142
- Ma'am, you.
- Go.

74
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,450
- Stop calling me "ma'am"!
- You need to tell us the exact place.

75
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:35,501
We don't know where to put this.

76
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,570
What were you thinking?

77
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,662
Why are you so clumsy?

78
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:45,851
This place is big,

79
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,091
and the bouquet is huge.

80
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:49,050
Why did you break it?

81
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,102
You're unbelievable.

82
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:51,731
It's not that.

83
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,250
This is too heavy.

84
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,891
Can you tell me how much it is?
I'll pay you the money.

85
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:56,381
Can you even afford it?

86
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,490
I have to pay even if I can't.

87
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,731
Tell me the figure.
I'll transfer the money to you.

88
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,061
Four hundred...

89
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:00,891
Okay. I'll transfer the money to you.

90
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:01,662
Thousand.

91
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,531
It has nothing to do with me.

92
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:10,381
It's him.

93
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,902
Mister, you don't have
to give me the tip.

94
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,022
Don't go. Hey.

95
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:18,782
What are you doing to do now?

96
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:19,930
What has happened?

97
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:20,741
You'll compensate me.

98
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,381
Haiyang?

99
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:23,370
You know him?

100
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:24,640
You're already back
from your business trip?

101
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,411
I just got back.

102
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,130
I ordered a bouquet for you.

103
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,941
Wishing you happiness.

104
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:29,102
Thank you.

105
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:30,331
Let me introduce you.

106
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,570
This is Jiang Jiaqiao,

107
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:32,690
Hongbin's younger sister.

108
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,582
This is my second brother-in-law,
Deng Haiyang.

109
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:35,782
Second brother-in-law, I see.

110
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,810
The bouquet is heavy.

111
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:39,651
Why couldn't you

112
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:41,690
ask for help from another person?

113
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,741
It's only one hundred yuan.

114
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:45,902
You didn't have to skimp on that, did you?

115
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,261
Right. You're right.

116
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,050
What's going on here?

117
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:49,690
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:51,501
I broke a vase.

119
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,370
Never mind. It's just a vase.

120
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,381
Pieces for peace.

121
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,450
That's easy for you to say.

122
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:57,771
Do you know what vase this is?

123
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,250
- What is it?
- This is from Czech.

124
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,891
Aurora handmade vase.

125
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,741
This is the one and only vase
I bought from an expo in Shanghai.

126
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,142
Four hundred thousand.

127
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:06,490
How much?

128
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,741
Four hundred thousand.

129
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:08,490
Four...

130
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:09,902
What is the noise all about?

131
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:12,171
The vase is broken.

132
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:12,891
It's no big deal.

133
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:13,960
Get the maid to clean this up.

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,022
I'm so sorry.

135
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:16,171
It's fine.

136
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:16,930
Here's the thing,

137
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,061
Hongbin.

138
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:20,250
This is my second brother-in-law,
Deng Haiyang.

139
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,971
He came over to send us a bouquet.

140
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,370
He accidentally broke the vase.

141
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:25,982
He broke a vase.

142
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:28,331
This is too bad.

143
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:29,971
Welcome, Haiyang.

144
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,222
Sir, no. I mean...

145
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:32,211
Hello.

146
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:32,810
Hongbing.

147
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,902
Hongbing.

148
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:35,130
- I'm sorry.
- You got back from a business trip?

149
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:36,301
I'm truly sorry.

150
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,061
What has happened?

151
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,022
It's nothing, Qian.

152
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,061
The dinner is served. Let's eat.

153
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,462
- All right. Let's eat.
- Go and bring Dad and Mom.

154
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,061
Haiying, come.

155
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,651
- Sure.
- This way.

156
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:50,381
All right.

157
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,462
Dad, Mom, dinner's ready.

158
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,462
Coming.

159
00:06:57,732 --> 00:06:59,250
Hongbin, are you
just letting it go like this?

160
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,022
It's four hundred thousand.

161
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:01,010
Haiyang is here.

162
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:01,411
Right.

163
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:02,091
Dad, Mom.

164
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:03,010
Four hundred thousand!

165
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:03,651
Let's eat first.

166
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:04,291
Dad, Mom. Dinner's ready.

167
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,050
Everyone's here.

168
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,381
Let's go.

169
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,902
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:08,741
Let's go.

171
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,331
Come on. Why are you standing here?

172
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:11,181
What's wrong?

173
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:12,440
You can't just leave like this.

174
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,570
Why can't I?

175
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:14,891
He broke a four-hundred-thousand vase.

176
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,342
I didn't let him come, but he insisted.

177
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,690
He's here already.

178
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:18,450
If you leave now,

179
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:20,610
how am I going to explain it to them?

180
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:21,490
I'll tell Xiang Nan myself.

181
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:24,450
Don't go. Go and sit
until the dinner is over.

182
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:25,680
Just pretend you don't know him.

183
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:28,222
I really don't have the mood to eat.

184
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:36,501
Dad, Mom,

185
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:37,941
I'd like to give you this toast.

186
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,782
Thank you for accepting me
as part of the family.

187
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:44,861
Xiang Nan and I will treat you well.

188
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:46,102
May you enjoy good health.

189
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,010
Thank you.

190
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:47,782
Mom.

191
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:50,621
Stop drinking.

192
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:54,422
My second toast

193
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,741
is for Qian, Ping,

194
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,222
Zhong, and Haiyang.

195
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:02,531
Thank you for taking the time
out of your busy day

196
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,542
to come here.

197
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,102
This is my pleasure.

198
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:06,731
Soon,

199
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:07,941
we'll become a family.

200
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,102
If you need anything, please tell me.

201
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,301
I'll do as much as possible.

202
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:12,902
I'll drink to all of you.

203
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:13,982
I'll bottom up.

204
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,462
We just need you
to take care of Xiang Nan.

205
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,462
I will. Definitely.

206
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,171
Hongbin, if I may.

207
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,891
I wasn't there at the meal last time.

208
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,291
We understand

209
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:24,570
you're always busy with your work.

210
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,570
We hope you can go home and eat
with Xiang Nan when you find time.

211
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:29,211
Of course.

212
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:32,370
Good communication and spending
more time together are important.

213
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:33,102
All right.

214
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:37,061
Mr. Jiang, the fish maw is ready.

215
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,371
Mr. Xiang, Mrs. Xiang, would you prefer it

216
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:43,011
with clear soup or thick soup?

217
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:44,941
Anything will do.

218
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:47,022
I can't eat spicy food.

219
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:48,341
Me too.

220
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:51,810
Well, please give them a milder flavor.

221
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,011
Yes, milder.

222
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:53,782
All right.

223
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:57,742
Xiang Qian, your mom
can't handle spicy food.

224
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,902
No, it's not the Sichuan Peppercorn.
[*Fish maw and Sichuan Peppercorn are homophones]

225
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:01,771
Non-spicy Sichuan Peppercorn?

226
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:03,061
She said it's a different thing.

227
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,422
Why are you smiling?

228
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:08,542
I'm happy.

229
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,850
Less talking. Jeez.

230
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:14,701
Thank you.

231
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:17,611
Thank you.

232
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:18,371
Thank you.

233
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:19,382
Be good.

234
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:21,461
Thank you.

235
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,742
Isn't this the fish maw I cooked before?

236
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:26,862
Yeah.

237
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,491
Mom always braises it for me.

238
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:31,782
I love eating that.

239
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,422
Mom's is amazing.

240
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,810
This fish maw has a slight fishy smell.

241
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:38,050
Right.

242
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:38,611
Yes.

243
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,771
That can't be.

244
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,461
This is wild white fish maw.

245
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,440
It costs a few ten thousand
per half a kilogram.

246
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,502
It's more expensive, right?

247
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:48,181
A bit costly.

248
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:48,850
It's a high price.

249
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,171
Less talking.

250
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,810
I still think Mom's
braised fish maw is tastier.

251
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,251
Mom, please prepare it for us next time.

252
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,382
Sure, I'll prepare it for you.

253
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:58,240
Let's try Mom's cooking
if there's a chance.

254
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:00,542
I'll ask Mom to cook it for you.

255
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:02,142
By the way,

256
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:05,090
M12 and A5,

257
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:06,422
which one do you prefer?

258
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:09,782
M?

259
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:17,850
Dad, Mom,

260
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,131
Jiaqiao is asking

261
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,251
which kind of beef you prefer.

262
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:22,171
Marbled beef

263
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,422
has a tender texture.

264
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:25,371
M1 is from Australia,

265
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:26,690
while A5 is from Japan.

266
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,341
Which country do you prefer?

267
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:29,891
It's beef, I see.

268
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:30,291
Right.

269
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,011
They're fancy beef.

270
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,742
Do you want it from a closer place
or farther away?

271
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:34,142
Let's have a softer texture.

272
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,330
Soft?

273
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:35,771
Tender.

274
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:38,210
M12 is more tender.

275
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:38,491
What about you, Dad?

276
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:39,662
I'll go for beef closer to us.

277
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:40,251
Sure.

278
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:41,811
You're choosing
based on its geographic location.

279
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,210
- Japanese beef, right?
- Japan, sure.

280
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:44,622
We'll have one each.

281
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:45,611
You can try both.

282
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,902
What about the rest?

283
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,011
Anything will do.

284
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,022
We're fine with anything.

285
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:52,171
Right. You're great at deciding things,

286
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:52,930
you can decide for us.

287
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,341
All right.

288
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:55,930
We'll go half and half.

289
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:56,690
All right, Hongbin?

290
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:58,341
Yes, well done.

291
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,011
Come.

292
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:00,461
Let's drink to Haiyang.

293
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:01,341
Sure.

294
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:02,382
Haiyang.

295
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:06,930
Dad.

296
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:07,850
Let's drink to Haiyang.

297
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,701
Dad, Mom, it's Hongbin.

298
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:10,701
Oh, Hongbin.

299
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,810
Haiyang is over here.

300
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:13,662
Right.

301
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,131
It's fine.

302
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,730
We both are your sons-in-law.

303
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:18,581
He got their names mixed up.

304
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:19,930
Well, I have got used

305
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,221
to staying with Haiyang.

306
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,251
They always drink together.

307
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,461
They drink a lot.

308
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:27,981
I'd like to say something.

309
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:32,450
May I, Dad?

310
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,262
Go ahead.

311
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,221
Well, Dad, Mom,

312
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,262
Ma'am, and

313
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,301
brother-in-law.

314
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:43,902
Ma'am.

315
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:47,131
Ma'am, I...

316
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:48,422
I want to say

317
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:51,090
that I was late...

318
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,450
Don't drink so much.

319
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:53,090
No.

320
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:54,280
Don't worry. Don't stop me.

321
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:57,301
Hongbin and Xiang Nan,

322
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,531
I wish you happiness.

323
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:00,411
Thank you, Haiyang.

324
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,341
Wishing you a happy married life
and a lovely child soon.

325
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:03,821
Thank you.

326
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,251
Enough. Stop drinking.

327
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:07,382
I'm totally fine.

328
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:09,330
Enough. Can you stop drinking?

329
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:10,291
I can handle it.

330
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,210
Just one more shot.

331
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:11,611
Trust me.

332
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:12,450
Stop drinking already.

333
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:13,531
You've had plenty.

334
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,611
What's wrong with me speaking?

335
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:15,581
What do you want to say?

336
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,301
Is that a problem?

337
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:20,742
What are you doing?

338
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:21,491
Why?

339
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,022
Are you doing this on purpose?

340
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,131
Jiaqiao, it's all right.

341
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,382
Just go get cleaned up.

342
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:28,850
The napkin is all wet.

343
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,371
You.. You keep away from me!

344
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:32,022
- You...
- No, I...

345
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,821
You can leave now.

346
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:36,142
I need to clean this.

347
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:37,690
So sorry.

348
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,450
So sorry.

349
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:39,341
So sorry.

350
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,491
Jeez, I... This is unbelievable.

351
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,131
It's all right. Let's continue eating.
It's all right.

352
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:44,810
I'm truly sorry.

353
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:45,742
Sorry.

354
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,690
It's fine. Let's eat.

355
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:48,570
Haiyang, eat more.

356
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:50,221
You keep on drinking.

357
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:51,902
Jeez. You just wouldn't stop.

358
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,142
Thank you, mister.

359
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:55,101
Thank you, mister.

360
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:55,941
Don't be.

361
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:05,930
Why did you go there

362
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:07,502
without being asked?

363
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:08,810
Everyone in the family went.

364
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:09,941
Shouldn't I go, too?

365
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,050
You've embarrassed

366
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,011
our whole family.

367
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:12,902
Are you happy now?

368
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,542
I wouldn't have spilled water over her
if you didn't pull my arms.

369
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,570
Also, that vase costs 400,000.

370
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:19,160
Figure something out to compensate her.

371
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,131
As if. 400,000?

372
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,880
Do you think I haven't
seen a fancy thing like that?

373
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:23,330
Fine, whatever it costs,

374
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,570
you find a way to buy another vase
that looks the same for her.

375
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,251
And this suit, too.

376
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,341
Give it back to Jiang Hongbin.

377
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:28,902
Xiang Zhong.

378
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:33,301
Take this.

379
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:35,730
It's a cash gift from them.
Around 100,000.

380
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,622
I don't want it.

381
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,891
You don't have a share in this.

382
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:39,622
Xiang Zhong,

383
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:41,221
we haven't divorced yet.

384
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:42,981
I should have my share.

385
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,210
Deng Haiyang,

386
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:46,411
I'll officially inform you of this.

387
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:48,570
If you still refuse to divorce,
once Xiang Nan's wedding is over,

388
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:50,101
I'll get a lawyer to sue you.

389
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:52,821
No problem.

390
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:01,411
Go and change out

391
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:02,450
of that suit.

392
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,581
It's uncomfortable wearing it
the whole day.

393
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:09,411
Let's not visit them

394
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:10,941
so often later on.

395
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:13,181
We've embarrassed ourselves there.

396
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,570
More importantly, they put

397
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,382
such an expensive vase on display.
That's terrifying.

398
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:23,941
If we don't compensate for that vase,

399
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,862
will they give Xiang Nan
a hard time there in the future?

400
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,341
Can you afford to pay?

401
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:34,341
Look at his sister.

402
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:36,422
Such arrogance.

403
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,061
What's so big deal about being rich?

404
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,760
She didn't even pretend to be nice.

405
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,461
She's a tough nut to crack.

406
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,022
Where are you going?

407
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:03,941
Where am I going?

408
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:04,810
Little tail,

409
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:05,981
I won't shake you off.

410
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:07,862
Let's go.

411
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:12,981
(Your account balance)
Six hundred and ninety nine thousand.

412
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,701
Check it again.

413
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,382
Count it.

414
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,210
One, ten, hundred,
thousand, ten thousand,

415
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:23,941
hundred thousand, million.

416
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,301
Six million.

417
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,291
Let's leave.

418
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,181
What should we do?

419
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:35,862
Don't go yet. The card.

420
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:43,382
Take it.

421
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,301
You take it.

422
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:46,701
I'll cover you.

423
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,022
Are your parents happy today?

424
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,022
You know what, Xiang Nan?

425
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:24,930
It's been a while

426
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:26,422
since this house had a happy occasion.

427
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:29,450
Seeing

428
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:30,821
all of your family here,

429
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:31,690
you don't know

430
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:32,862
how happy I am.

431
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:34,970
This is what a family

432
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:36,341
should look like.

433
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:38,941
You like it?

434
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,930
My family has always had a tradition.

435
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,771
No matter how busy we are,

436
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:44,651
everyone must go home

437
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:45,902
for meals every weekend.

438
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:47,450
It's very lively.

439
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:48,210
Sometimes,

440
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:49,941
it's so noisy that my head hurts.

441
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:53,782
After we get married,

442
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,502
let's go home every weekend.

443
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:57,301
Of course, we have to.

444
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:59,581
We must go back every weekend.

445
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,171
My dad loves me so much

446
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:02,171
that he'll be mad

447
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:03,301
if he doesn't see me

448
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:04,821
for a week.

449
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:09,382
Hongbin.

450
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:14,142
Earlier today, Haiyang

451
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:18,582
accidentally broke the vase.

452
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:20,770
I feel really bad about it.

453
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:22,770
I'll apologize on his behalf.

454
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:23,781
Don't worry, Xiang Nan.

455
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:25,530
Luckily,

456
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:26,450
it isn't the authentic vase.

457
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:27,622
It doesn't cost much.

458
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:29,862
A fake vase?

459
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:33,981
Jiaqiao always thought
it was an original.

460
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,010
If the original vase
were put there and broken,

461
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,701
I'd be heartbroken.

462
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,851
It's a fake vase?

463
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,582
Yes.

464
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:42,811
You should've told me.

465
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,941
What a relief after hearing what you said.

466
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:48,290
I thought it was so expensive.

467
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,662
Tell Haiyang

468
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:52,221
not to mind it.

469
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:54,342
Luckily, it's a fake vase.

470
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:56,382
On the other hand,

471
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:59,142
Jiaqiao always makes a fuss
over small things.

472
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:00,582
She never went out to work.

473
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:01,981
Her mind is simple,

474
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,062
and she talks without a filter.

475
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:05,690
Tell your family

476
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:06,541
to pay no mind to her.

477
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:11,261
Jiang,

478
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,981
I come from

479
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:15,411
an ordinary family.

480
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:17,261
We can't compare to your family.

481
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:19,651
But I don't want

482
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:21,651
my parents to feel pressured

483
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,302
or uncomfortable.

484
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:28,062
I understand.

485
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,530
Stop looking for it.

486
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:41,851
It's either left in the car or their house.

487
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,261
You can ask them tomorrow.

488
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:49,382
Why did you suddenly wear that bracelet?

489
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:50,941
I haven't seen you wear it
for some time.

490
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:53,781
I have nothing more valuable than that.

491
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,382
Get lost now.

492
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:18,290
Madam, breakfast is ready.

493
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,062
You may eat now.

494
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:20,261
Ms. He,

495
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,051
have you found the thing I asked you?

496
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:23,941
I did.

497
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,490
I searched upstairs, downstairs,

498
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:27,690
in the dining room, garden,
and even the car.

499
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:29,941
I couldn't find
your second sister's bracelet.

500
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:31,181
Thank you.

501
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,411
Please keep looking for it.

502
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:33,142
All right.

503
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:38,221
Xiang Nan.

504
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:41,941
Zhong, did you go to buy cat food?

505
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:43,342
I was feeding cats.

506
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:49,142
Jiang Jiaqiao found
the bracelet you lost last time.

507
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:51,571
That's great. It's found.

508
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:52,701
I thought I wouldn't get it back.

509
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:00,450
What's wrong?

510
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:01,302
Take it back.

511
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,250
Tell Jiang Jiaqiao

512
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:04,611
that even though I'm not as rich as her,

513
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:06,582
I can still tell the difference
between a fake and a genuine bracelet.

514
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:07,941
She doesn't have to humiliate me.

515
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:09,781
This bracelet is fake?

516
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,302
What's wrong with her?

517
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:13,290
This is too much.

518
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,862
I must talk to her.

519
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:16,221
Forget it if you can't find it.

520
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:17,302
Well,

521
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:20,010
Jiaqiao isn't a kind person.

522
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,021
You have to be careful.

523
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:25,261
I won't let this slide.
I'll try to look for your bracelet.

524
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,171
I'll also talk to her about this.

525
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,160
Don't make things harder for yourself.

526
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,701
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

527
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:40,770
Who let you in here?

528
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:41,941
This is rude.

529
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,382
Why did you give me a fake bracelet?

530
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:48,701
Why?

531
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:51,181
Who knows whether your second sister's
bracelet is authentic?

532
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:54,331
It's a wedding gift from my eldest sister.

533
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,582
It can't be a fake bracelet.

534
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:57,701
Who knows?

535
00:20:57,812 --> 00:20:59,371
Yes, my family isn't as rich as yours.

536
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,320
But we wouldn't buy a fake bracelet.

537
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,701
I'm telling you, Jiang Jiaqiao,

538
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:05,930
I respect you,

539
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,930
and I hope you give my family

540
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,450
the same respect.

541
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:09,611
Xiang Nan,

542
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,221
just be honest.

543
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:13,411
She just wants my bracelet.

544
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:14,970
Why did she lie that she lost it?

545
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,221
What's that supposed to mean?

546
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:19,851
Your whole family was staring at my wrist

547
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:21,662
and wouldn't look away.

548
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:22,701
What did you all want?

549
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,371
I feel too pitiful for you

550
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:26,062
to expose your little scheme.

551
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:28,450
You saw my second sister
wearing that bracelet,

552
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,371
and you purposely got one

553
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,622
from the same series for yourself.

554
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:33,261
How funny.

555
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,902
Why can't I wear it when she can?

556
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:36,450
Don't take us for a fool.

557
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:38,051
You wore a bracelet
with diamonds all over on purpose.

558
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:38,851
What are you up to?

559
00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:40,730
It's merely because you want
to show off in front of my family.

560
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,382
Why do you have to do that?

561
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:46,102
So you all noticed it.

562
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,770
I thought you didn't.

563
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:48,690
Doesn't that just show

564
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:50,622
you actually care about this bracelet?

565
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:52,851
Get over yourself.

566
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:53,902
No one cares about you.

567
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:55,530
The bracelet is fake,

568
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:56,450
and the vase is also fake.

569
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:57,662
Do you think it's fun?

570
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:58,981
Ms. Jiang, Madam.

571
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:00,622
The wedding planner has arrived.

572
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:01,811
All right, Ms. He.

573
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:04,701
Bring him to the terrace of my room.

574
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:05,862
- All right.
- Wait, Ms. He.

575
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:09,382
Please bring him to the study.

576
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:10,930
This is my wedding wedding, after all.

577
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,382
I'll discuss it with him myself.

578
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:13,461
All right.

579
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:16,822
What's wrong with you?

580
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,062
I hired the wedding planner, you know?

581
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:20,770
Hello.

582
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:21,290
Are you out for a walk?

583
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,582
Yes, I'm taking a walk.

584
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:25,741
Jiang Hongbin gave us so much money.

585
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:27,010
Your mom and I

586
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,102
went to the bank to check it,

587
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:29,741
it's a big figure.

588
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:31,571
We must give him back the money.

589
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:32,941
Right. It's not like we're poor.

590
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,062
It's not that.

591
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:36,611
The money Jiang Hongbin gave

592
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:38,501
isn't a bride price. It's too much.

593
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,142
I guess this money is for us

594
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,981
to buy dowries for Xiang Nan.

595
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:44,822
Seriously?

596
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,411
We can't use his money to buy dowries.

597
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:48,221
Exactly.

598
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,770
Aren't those businessmen

599
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,171
always after a grand display?

600
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,741
Perhaps this is what he means.

601
00:22:56,372 --> 00:22:57,331
What would we look like

602
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,981
if we married Xiang Nan
off using his money?

603
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,611
We hold a wedding we can afford.

604
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:03,331
Right.

605
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,530
Your mom is right.

606
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:06,131
You two oversimplify the situation.

607
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:08,302
It's different from the time you got married.

608
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:09,181
Your dowry

609
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,131
was a blanket,

610
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:12,651
a bike,

611
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,770
or expensive things like a fridge

612
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:14,941
or a TV.

613
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,102
The modern dowry is different.

614
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,811
A house and a car are the basics.

615
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,371
Some even give stocks or shops.

616
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:22,422
Can we afford that?

617
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:23,690
Right. So even if

618
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:25,501
we prepare the dowry,

619
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,051
they'll be brought over

620
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,501
to their family.

621
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,210
We will prepare dowry

622
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,781
we can afford.

623
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,371
We might not meet their standards.

624
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:39,181
But we can still meet our own standards.

625
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:43,662
We won't use his money.

626
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:45,781
We'll hold another wedding in Kunshan.

627
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:47,342
Right?

628
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,102
Dad, Mom, Qian, and Zhong.

629
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:54,811
We're talking about you.

630
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:55,530
What about me?

631
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:56,741
Perfect timing.

632
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:59,062
Your mom and I are discussing it.

633
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,062
What's it about?

634
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:04,690
Your dad wants to hold another wedding

635
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:06,142
in Kunshan for you.

636
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:07,461
Why?

637
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:10,970
It's to show all relatives and friends

638
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,331
you're raised well

639
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:13,371
and married to a fine man

640
00:24:13,372 --> 00:24:14,622
with a grand wedding.

641
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:16,930
Isn't it the same if we have it in Suzhou?

642
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:17,811
On that day,

643
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:19,371
Jiang will send all kinds of fancy cars

644
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:20,450
to pick them up.

645
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,941
Isn't that grand, too?

646
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:24,021
That's different.

647
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:27,221
Besides, your dad

648
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,741
doesn't want to accept this money.

649
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,062
Return it to Jiang.

650
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:36,822
We also broke
an expensive vase the other day.

651
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:38,770
I came here

652
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:39,770
to tell you about that.

653
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,250
That's a fake vase.

654
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:43,091
Jiang said it wasn't worth much.

655
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:44,210
Fake vase?

656
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:44,690
Yes.

657
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,102
Why didn't he tell us earlier?

658
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:47,781
His sister was making a fuss.

659
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:51,021
He said it was a replica.

660
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,822
Did he say that
to make you feel better?

661
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:55,342
He wouldn't.

662
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:56,811
There's no reason to put an expensive vase

663
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,142
right at the entrance, right?

664
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:00,051
Besides,

665
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:02,021
about Jiang's family.

666
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:04,051
There are only two people

667
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,131
in his family,

668
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:06,422
he and his sister.

669
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,091
It'll be awkward for him

670
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,941
to face so many of our relatives

671
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,582
if he comes here.

672
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,261
It's not quite comfortable for him.

673
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,611
Your mom and I

674
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:21,250
just want to give you a grand wedding

675
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,651
so that others won't look down on you.

676
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:23,091
Yes, Dad.

677
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:25,181
I understand what you mean.

678
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,770
But if our relatives see

679
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:27,530
that only two people

680
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,571
show up on the groom's side,

681
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:29,541
would they think

682
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:31,382
the groom doesn't take me seriously?

683
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:33,891
And if anyone

684
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,342
gossips about it behind our backs,

685
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:37,690
we won't know how to explain it, right?

686
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:38,331
Yes.

687
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,490
Xiang Nan makes a good point.

688
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:41,582
Yes, Xiang Nan is thorough.

689
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:45,541
Are you serious?

690
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:46,490
You weren't saying this

691
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:47,730
last night.

692
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:48,411
But the situation now

693
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:49,770
is three against two.

694
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:51,382
Not anymore.

695
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:52,690
It's four against one,

696
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:53,422
huh?

697
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,021
I'm outnumbered.

698
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:57,290
Right.

699
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,062
Right?

700
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,021
Traitor.

701
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:02,941
Jeez.

702
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,131
He's so stubborn.

703
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:04,930
What's wrong with him?

704
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,102
He's sulking again.

705
00:26:06,372 --> 00:26:08,051
He always is.

706
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,811
Isn't it normal
to have four against one?

707
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:10,582
Exactly.

708
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,382
He'll get better after taking a walk.

709
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:16,822
Go and calm him down.

710
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:25,622
Dad wants to do something he can

711
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:26,891
at your wedding.

712
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:27,411
You know what?

713
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:28,490
I think

714
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:29,730
he probably wishes

715
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:31,382
he could cook the banquet himself.

716
00:26:32,052 --> 00:26:33,781
Your husband is Jiang Hongbin,

717
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,741
who can provide you with everything.

718
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:40,541
He feels like there's nothing
he can give you, so he's upset.

719
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:42,622
Zhong,

720
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,891
what did Dad do

721
00:26:44,892 --> 00:26:46,622
for your wedding?

722
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,582
My wedding was way too simple.

723
00:26:49,652 --> 00:26:51,250
He just bought some furniture

724
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,622
and held a banquet in a hotel.

725
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:56,662
I also wish I could have a simple wedding.

726
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:57,862
That's out of the question.

727
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,941
Jiang Hongbin is a rich businessman.

728
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:00,770
He'd lose face

729
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:02,102
if the wedding was simple.

730
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:03,770
Xiang Nan,

731
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:05,651
Dad and I had made a decision

732
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:06,741
on one thing.

733
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:10,102
Wear a cheongsam for the toasts.

734
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,461
I hired an experienced embroiderer
in Shanghai.

735
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,741
Later, I'll take you for a fitting.

736
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:19,422
Dad chose the design,
so it's a bit old-fashioned.

737
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,651
Why do you suddenly

738
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:22,862
ask me to wear a cheongsam?

739
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:24,422
Why?

740
00:27:25,052 --> 00:27:26,902
It's not Dad's idea.

741
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:29,062
It was Uncle's.

742
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:30,571
When you were born,

743
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:31,571
you were particularly long.

744
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:32,981
Longer than other babies.

745
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:36,730
Uncle said you would surely

746
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:38,902
be tall and have a great figure
when you grew up.

747
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:41,331
You'd have to wear a cheongsam
when you get married.

748
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:42,062
It'd be gorgeous.

749
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,541
All right. I'll wear it for sure.

750
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:59,822
Send Gao Ping's resume to me.

751
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:01,342
Why do you need that?

752
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:05,131
Fuzhen's Faculty of Medicine
is interested in him.

753
00:28:05,132 --> 00:28:06,541
They'd like to see his resume first.

754
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:07,582
Really?

755
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,651
If it wasn't for you going to Shenzhen,

756
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:12,461
he wouldn't have applied
for Hong Kong University, right?

757
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:15,342
That's why he lost his chance to stay
in the faculty.

758
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,730
Don't you feel guilty

759
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:19,261
if you don't make it up to him?

760
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:20,741
Thank you.

761
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:22,422
Well, don't thank me first.

762
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:24,411
Send it to me now. I'm waiting.

763
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,422
Right away.

764
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:38,622
I'm going out.

765
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:42,902
Who are you meeting
with an expensive gift?

766
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:45,582
Someone from Fuzhen?

767
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:47,862
Is the chance high?

768
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,142
Maybe since they've asked for a meeting.

769
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,181
I can't be late. Bye.

770
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:57,541
I'm counting on you, my dear. Please.

771
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:00,371
Good luck. Love you.

772
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,342
Love you, too.

773
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:27,302
Boss.

774
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:30,822
You're early.

775
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,302
You're helping me, and you're earlier.

776
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:41,422
My friend is not coming today.

777
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:43,622
Why not?

778
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:47,181
What about this?

779
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,811
Forget about it.

780
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,221
They have strict rules.

781
00:29:51,412 --> 00:29:53,261
They've reviewed Gao Ping's resume.

782
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:54,781
Here's the feedback.

783
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:58,461
Well, um, his...

784
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:02,941
His field is pretty good,

785
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,371
and his papers

786
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,461
are impressive as well.

787
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:10,181
But the problem is

788
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:12,941
his undergraduate degree isn't good.

789
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,741
It's hard for my friend
to recommend him.

790
00:30:16,011 --> 00:30:18,021
Why does his undergraduate degree
matter here?

791
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:20,250
That's the rule in the faculty.

792
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,461
He has no choice.

793
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:22,422
Wait.

794
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:25,131
Isn't Gao Ping a Ph.D?

795
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:26,382
Why does he attend
his undergraduate program

796
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,342
at that kind of school?

797
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:31,530
Well, Gao Ping's parents

798
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:34,891
divorced when he was a kid,

799
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:35,730
and neither of them

800
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:36,781
looked after him.

801
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:38,741
He was living with his aunt.

802
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,382
He's always had excellent grades.

803
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:43,501
But he didn't do well
in the national college entrance exam.

804
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:45,461
He didn't want to burden

805
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,091
his aunt with the tuition fee

806
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:47,970
to retake the exam,

807
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,142
especially since she didn't earn much.

808
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:52,970
So he just attended

809
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:54,091
a local university,

810
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:55,261
which was quite average.

811
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:57,770
But that doesn't matter.

812
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,142
What matters is

813
00:30:59,412 --> 00:31:00,131
he has made it

814
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:03,371
into the best research institute
in Shanghai for his Master's and Ph. D programs.

815
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:04,021
Right?

816
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:05,210
Besides, he has published

817
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,501
a lot of good papers.

818
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,981
Why do they have to nitpick
on his undergraduate degree?

819
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,662
This is not fair.

820
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:11,891
Fair or not,

821
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:13,541
it's not up to us.

822
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:23,461
You're back.

823
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:27,131
How was it?

824
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:27,902
How was it?

825
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:29,862
What did Fuzhen say?

826
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:32,781
They're arranging
a trial lecture for you.

827
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:36,811
You're the best, my dear.

828
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,021
Thank you so much, my dear.

829
00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:38,981
I'll prepare well.

830
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:40,302
I won't disappoint you.

831
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:43,741
I won't embarrass you.

832
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,382
How about we get him a chance

833
00:31:52,892 --> 00:31:54,021
to give a trial lecture?

834
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:56,741
Will that even help?

835
00:31:57,531 --> 00:31:58,662
If he can convince them

836
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:00,342
with his trial lecture,

837
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,662
he might win a chance.

838
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:30,541
Xiang,

839
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,811
look at Xiang Nan's vase.

840
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:33,741
It's beautiful.

841
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:34,662
Yes, it is.

842
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,411
Did you even see that?

843
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,422
I did.

844
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:39,411
Then,

845
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:40,741
why didn't you like the photo?

846
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:42,741
You can do it for me.

847
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:45,051
No, it's different.

848
00:32:45,052 --> 00:32:46,131
You should give some response

849
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,902
to their posts.

850
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:50,622
You can represent me.

851
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:53,181
I'm busy now.

852
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:56,941
I've realized
that you're getting weird these days.

853
00:32:58,132 --> 00:32:58,891
You should at least

854
00:32:58,892 --> 00:33:00,770
respond to the girls' posts.

855
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,902
Jeez.

856
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:03,342
You're busy with this every day.

857
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:04,891
I have to.

858
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,371
Why are you inviting so many guests?

859
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:07,662
Didn't Xiang Nan say

860
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:09,371
Hongbin has fewer family members?

861
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:11,530
It's not appropriate
if we invite so many guests.

862
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,701
Cut it down.

863
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:14,021
Cut it down?

864
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:16,501
Listen,

865
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:18,582
if they think we invite too many guests,

866
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:20,142
I will hold a grander wedding

867
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,781
in Kunshan.

868
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:23,822
Xiaolan.

869
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,131
- Xiaolan.
- I heard you from afar.

870
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,582
You came here.

871
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:31,571
Nice.

872
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:32,701
Is this dress nice?

873
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,290
I'm going to wear this

874
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,411
to Xiang Nan's wedding.

875
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:37,250
How much?

876
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:38,021
Take a guess.

877
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,181
480.

878
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:42,021
Lower.

879
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:44,490
This is really nice.

880
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:45,450
Only 88. Unbelievable, right?

881
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:46,701
Seriously?

882
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:48,422
It's beautiful.

883
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:49,822
Where is Xiang Zhijun?

884
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:52,261
He's inside.

885
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,622
He's working on the guest list.
Not in a good mood.

886
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:55,981
About what?

887
00:33:56,612 --> 00:33:57,981
Xiang Nan's wedding

888
00:33:58,092 --> 00:33:59,411
is decided to be held in Suzhou.

889
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,662
That's completely normal.

890
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:02,582
But he wants it in Kunshan.

891
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:05,302
Xiang Zhijun.

892
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:10,051
What's wrong with you?

893
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:12,501
You're already in your sixties,

894
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,342
why can't you think clearly?

895
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:16,491
Let the girl decide

896
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:17,210
on her wedding.

897
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:17,971
Why do you want

898
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,581
to decide for her, huh?

899
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:21,541
Stop meddling.

900
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,302
Whatever. You know nothing.

901
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,302
You don't know any better.

902
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,822
Can you not make me mad for one day?

903
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,890
Xiaolan, pour me some water.

904
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:33,902
The jug is right here.

905
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:36,862
Well.

906
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,021
Once Xiang Nan's back,

907
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,850
tell her to come to me.

908
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:42,661
Why?

909
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:44,621
It's her wedding.

910
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,822
I want to design a hairstyle for her.

911
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:49,461
A fancy hairstyle.

912
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:51,611
You can call her yourself.

913
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:52,890
It's not urgent,

914
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,531
but I need to discuss
the hairstyle design with her.

915
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:56,422
Xiang Zhiying,

916
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:58,621
let me make that clear.

917
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,461
Forget about designing
a hairstyle for Xiang Nan.

918
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:04,782
Why not?

919
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:08,101
That's strange.

920
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:09,370
I helped Xiang Zhong

921
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:10,690
with her hair at her wedding.

922
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,171
Why can't I design it for Xiang Nan?

923
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:12,931
Why?

924
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:14,621
Xiang Zhong and Xian Nan
aren't the same.

925
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:16,290
How so?

926
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,061
Back then...

927
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:21,021
Aunty.

928
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:21,971
Anyway,

929
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:23,222
forget about the hairstyle thing.

930
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,651
Xiang Nan's husband is well-off.

931
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:27,222
He'll get her a better hairstylist.

932
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:29,262
Mom,

933
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:31,051
these fruits are from my office.

934
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:31,862
I brought some for you.

935
00:35:33,492 --> 00:35:34,461
I should get going.

936
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:36,621
Why are you leaving?

937
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:43,141
I...

938
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:44,451
I don't get it.

939
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:45,290
You're to blame.

940
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:46,981
Why blame me?

941
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:48,382
You said they are different.

942
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:49,730
I don't understand.

943
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,501
How are they any different?

944
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:52,581
Xiang Zhong.

945
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,382
He didn't mean that.

946
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,491
I know what he meant.

947
00:35:57,492 --> 00:35:58,461
You don't have to explain it.

948
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:03,541
I know I don't matter in this family.

949
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,370
No. It's because

950
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:08,690
Xiang Nan's parents

951
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:10,011
passed away when she was a kid.

952
00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:12,021
Your dad always considers her

953
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:13,702
as he's afraid she might feel left out.

954
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:15,941
Aren't you worried
I might feel left out?

955
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,981
When you brought me back
from the village,

956
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:23,342
it happened

957
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:26,141
to be near my birthday.

958
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:29,302
I was so naive that I thought

959
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:30,770
you fetched me back

960
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,822
to celebrate my birthday.

961
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:33,822
But when I got back,

962
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:35,822
you said nothing at all.

963
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:37,742
That was when I realized

964
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:38,410
I didn't matter

965
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:39,501
in this family.

966
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:41,210
No, Xiang Zhong.

967
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:42,941
You know the reason.

968
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,810
When Xiang Nan came over

969
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:46,931
to celebrate her birthday at our place,

970
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:47,730
your dad kept urging her

971
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:48,810
to be faster.

972
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,461
But on their way here,

973
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:51,770
her family got into an accident,

974
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:53,810
and her parents passed away.

975
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,730
From then on,

976
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:55,611
we stop celebrating

977
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,210
anyone's birthday.

978
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:58,581
You know this.

979
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:00,941
Of course, I do.

980
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:02,290
I know you've still carried the guilt

981
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,182
after all these years.

982
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:06,051
But I was still a child.

983
00:37:06,052 --> 00:37:07,461
I was young.

984
00:37:07,532 --> 00:37:10,661
You shouldn't have put your guilt on me.

985
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:16,651
I understood you had no choice
but to send me to the village

986
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,061
because of financial problems.

987
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:20,702
I knew it was hard for you.

988
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:22,422
But since you brought me back,

989
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:25,302
you haven't paid attention to me either.

990
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,342
When I first went to school,

991
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:33,862
my classmates made fun of me
for my accent,

992
00:37:34,612 --> 00:37:36,061
so I stopped going.

993
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:37,862
Did you ever ask me about it?

994
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:42,011
I was slow in studying

995
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,182
and couldn't improve my grades.

996
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,182
I was stressing out.

997
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,902
I hid under my blanket to cry every day.

998
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:51,581
You didn't know that, did you?

999
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:54,890
I'm sorry.

1000
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:55,742
Later,

1001
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:57,931
there was a rare opportunity

1002
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:00,182
to go to a private school.

1003
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,862
But Xiang Nan also reached school age,

1004
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:09,422
you secretly gave Xiang Nan the spot.

1005
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:13,302
You thought I didn't know?

1006
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:22,250
Mom,

1007
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:24,182
I'm also part of the family.

1008
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:27,491
I'm your child.

1009
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:29,342
Why are you treating me like this?

1010
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,342
I know.

1011
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:36,931
When I came back home,

1012
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:41,182
I told myself I had to behave
and be obedient.

1013
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:44,051
I was afraid, you know?

1014
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:44,782
Mom.

1015
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:48,141
I was worried that if I misbehaved,

1016
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:49,810
you'd send me back

1017
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,342
to the village.

1018
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:56,661
I was walking on eggshells every day.

1019
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,342
When we got

1020
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:03,091
new clothes,

1021
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,141
they always went to Xiang Qian.

1022
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,091
You always give good food

1023
00:39:07,092 --> 00:39:08,382
to Xiang Nan first.

1024
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:09,702
What do I have?

1025
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:13,571
They both get every good thing.

1026
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:15,101
What's left for me?

1027
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:19,862
If I had been able to go
to a better university like them

1028
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:21,370
and get a decent job,

1029
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:24,101
would I be struggling like I am now?

1030
00:41:06,612 --> 00:41:08,330
Is this your wedding's return gift?

1031
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:09,581
This is too cheap.

1032
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:12,461
All my relatives and friends think it's fine.

1033
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:14,541
If you think this is cheap,

1034
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,410
you can offer them

1035
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:16,541
an extra red packet each.

1036
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,581
Why didn't you tell Hongbin?

1037
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:26,971
What should I tell him about?

1038
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:28,141
The bracelet.

1039
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,531
If you tell him,

1040
00:41:29,532 --> 00:41:31,410
he may feel bad and buy you

1041
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:32,730
a white gold bracelet.

1042
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,621
That'll be a few ten thousand more
than mine.

1043
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:37,742
I'm really curious about one thing.

1044
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,810
If I come from a rich family,

1045
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:40,981
would you still have this attitude?

1046
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,581
If only you had a rich family.

1047
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:44,571
Let's see if I would

1048
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,141
bow to you earnestly.

1049
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:50,862
Jiang Jiaqiao, listen.

1050
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:52,051
First,

1051
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:53,051
if you really think

1052
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,262
I'm marrying your brother for money,

1053
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:56,531
there's nothing I can explain.

1054
00:41:56,532 --> 00:41:57,822
Argue with Jiang Hongbin yourself.

1055
00:41:58,172 --> 00:42:00,541
He wants to marry me, not me.

1056
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,342
Second,

1057
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:04,422
I didn't tell him about the bracelet.

1058
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:05,091
Because

1059
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:06,382
it's just trivial.

1060
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:08,250
We're going
to live under the same roof soon,

1061
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:09,531
there's no need to intensify

1062
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:10,501
this little dispute.

1063
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:12,330
If you still want to raise a stink,

1064
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:13,931
fine, I'll play along.

1065
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,461
At worst, we fall out and fight.

1066
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:17,661
Third,

1067
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:19,862
this wedding isn't just mine,

1068
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:21,141
it's also your brother's.

1069
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:23,501
If you mess it up, no one will be happy.

1070
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:25,290
If you're willing to help,

1071
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,661
I'm grateful to you.

1072
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,541
But if otherwise,

1073
00:42:28,652 --> 00:42:30,182
get out of here.

1074
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:32,822
I have work to do.

1075
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:34,101
Stay if you want,

1076
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:35,342
or just leave yourself.

1077
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:38,370
You're such an actor.

1078
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:39,611
You act like a big hare

1079
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:40,661
in front of my brother.

1080
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,171
Oh, come on. It's bunny.

1081
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:45,262
Hares stay wild.

1082
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:48,422
Bunnies aren't as huge as you.

1083
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:50,981
Fine. You're small.

1084
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:52,101
Small in every way.

1085
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:54,262
Who are you calling me small?

1086
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:55,531
Yes, I'm indeed bigger

1087
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:56,902
than you are.

1088
00:42:57,612 --> 00:42:58,702
I'm not small!

1089
00:42:59,532 --> 00:43:00,862
Come down. Explain what you just said.

1090
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:02,742
