00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 28=

4
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,520
Gao Ping.

5
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:41,279
Miss,

6
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,549
have you seen

7
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,759
anyone in this room?

8
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,880
I haven't cleaned that room yet.

9
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,069
I don't think

10
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,719
the guest came outside.

11
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,359
Thank you.

12
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,680
Gao Ping,

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,228
I just want to talk to you.

14
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,600
Can you open the door?

15
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,279
Gao Ping.

16
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:55,480
Gao Ping.

17
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,200
Gao Ping, watch out.

18
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:03,839
What are you doing?

19
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:08,829
Deng Haiyang, what's up?

20
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,960
I have something going on.

21
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,680
I saw Gao Ping.

22
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,200
Alright, I got it.

23
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:14,908
What's wrong?

24
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:15,509
Deng Haiyang is here.

25
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,960
He said Gao Ping was over there.

26
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,039
That way.

27
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:32,240
Deng Haiyang.

28
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:33,989
Aren't you...

29
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,468
Aren't you looking for him?

30
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:36,240
I...

31
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:38,200
What is he doing?

32
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,080
Should we call the police?

33
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,080
Gao Ping.

34
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,559
Sir,

35
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,760
can you please help pick him up?

36
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,319
Are you alright?

37
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,240
Come on, come on to the boat.

38
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:22,839
Hurry up.

39
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,269
You've been avoiding me,

40
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,668
are you planning not to see me again

41
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:53,640
in the future?

42
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,908
Aren't you going to be there

43
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,839
when we get the divorce certificate?

44
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,960
Aren't you still going to see me?

45
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,479
Have we reached the point

46
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,069
where we can't even

47
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,200
sit and talk face-to-face?

48
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,200
If you want to study abroad,

49
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:12,839
if you want a divorce,

50
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,069
if you want to get rid of this family,

51
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,389
if you want to get rid of
me and the kids,

52
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,960
you can tell me directly.

53
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,799
Gao Ping,

54
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,640
from the time we met
and got married until now,

55
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,359
for these five years,

56
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:30,320
I've supported you
no matter what you wanted to do.

57
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:35,000
I have been working so hard out there

58
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,120
and making money to support the family,

59
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,069
but I have never allowed you

60
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,949
to face any pressure in life

61
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,479
when you were studying,

62
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,039
right?

63
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,919
Of course,

64
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,588
you have taken excellent care

65
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,960
of Cong and Qi,

66
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,839
you provided them with a lot of love.

67
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:57,389
I feel that in our relationship,

68
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,520
there aren't any major conflicts.

69
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,228
So I can't figure out

70
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,039
why we should separate this way.

71
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,279
I didn't want this either.

72
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,479
But you have already done it.

73
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,719
You brought Li Shu to our home,

74
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,640
made me doubt you,

75
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:18,919
we fought,

76
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:21,799
you left the house,

77
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,309
you even accused me of being paranoid

78
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,640
and didn't trust you.

79
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,599
Why do we have to end up like this?

80
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,440
If I

81
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,080
have another honest path to take,

82
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,320
I wouldn't want to
cause all these either.

83
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,159
I have joined the postdoctoral program.

84
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,359
But no matter
how skilled I am in my field

85
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,359
or how many papers I publish,

86
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,599
no school would take me in two years.

87
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,520
Because my initial academic background
is too weak.

88
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,200
I have been studying all my life.

89
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,599
I don't know how to do anything else.

90
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:11,960
What am I going to do?

91
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:15,228
Every single day I've stayed here,

92
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,668
I just feel like a loach.

93
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,080
I'm lying in a stinky ditch.

94
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:24,320
No matter how much I struggle or flail,

95
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:28,239
I just can't get out
of that stinky ditch.

96
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,269
There are clearly good schools

97
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,468
and good institutes overseas.

98
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:35,668
I can go out there and give it a try.

99
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:36,788
I can just try.

100
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,359
Why do I have to lie in this smelly ditch?

101
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:45,880
But how can I get out?

102
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,919
I am committed to you.

103
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,839
I am committed to Cong and Qi.

104
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:55,629
What right do I have

105
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,640
to ask you to accompany me abroad?

106
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:01,279
Sometimes I try to persuade myself
to just forget it,

107
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:03,960
but I really don't know

108
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,440
how can I make myself give up willingly.

109
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,869
Do you remember
the exchange student opportunity

110
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,679
in the U.S. three years ago?

111
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,359
At that time, you said
because of your parents, your sisters,

112
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,719
Cong and Qi's studies,

113
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,149
you couldn't go.

114
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,788
Yes,

115
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,159
I certainly know that.

116
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,320
You said, husband and wife

117
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:32,960
can't be separated for so long.

118
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,279
I knew that I would be sacrificing
in the end.

119
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,720
But the problem is

120
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,319
how long will I have to sacrifice?

121
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,319
I...

122
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,229
Am I supposed
to keep living like a parasite

123
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,799
for the rest of my life?

124
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,159
I really don't know

125
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,679
what else I can do but divorce.

126
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,120
You could've at least been direct.

127
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,400
The reason why
you didn't want to tell me

128
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:15,589
is because you didn't want to

129
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,039
be the bad guy.

130
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,068
You want to divorce gracefully

131
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:22,360
and protect yourself.

132
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,079
But have you ever thought about this?

133
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,120
All your behaviors

134
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:31,039
will have an effect on Cong and Qi.

135
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,640
It's true that...

136
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,279
they are not your biological children.

137
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,480
But they have called you Dad

138
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,039
ever since they learned how to speak.

139
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,589
What am I supposed to tell

140
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,428
the two kids that the man
whom they've called 'Dad' for five years

141
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,760
doesn't want them anymore?

142
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,679
Will your conscience not be condemned?

143
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,079
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:23,120
It's too late.

145
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:27,520
I don't want to forgive you now.

146
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:13,720
Let's go.

147
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:35,640
Here.

148
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,869
I trust your vision.

149
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,749
You can never go wrong.

150
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,640
I don't trust anyone but you.

151
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:54,679
Biao.

152
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:56,120
Apologies, everyone,

153
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,319
we are late.

154
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,600
Let me introduce,

155
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,039
this is Xiang Nan,

156
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,919
my wife.

157
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,559
This is Biao.

158
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,109
Hi, Mr. Biao.

159
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,908
Hongbin,

160
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,229
we have been waiting for you two.

161
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,480
What took you so long?

162
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:09,919
Come, have a seat.

163
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,439
Serve the tea.

164
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,319
Xiang Nan.

165
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,319
Mr. Biao, I'm sorry

166
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,720
that I made an extra leg

167
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,959
for the toad I gifted you.

168
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,149
I didn't know

169
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,908
the reference of the three-legged toad,

170
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,109
and it was an unintentional mistake.

171
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,229
I am sorry

172
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,679
for embarrassing you.

173
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,880
My wife

174
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,640
shouldn't be blamed entirely
for this matter.

175
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,520
It's my fault
that I didn't make it clear.

176
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,908
You should think about

177
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:40,720
how to make up for your mistake then.

178
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,799
What I make isn't worth much.

179
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:44,319
They are just glass.

180
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:46,360
Don't say that.

181
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,360
You could become a great artist

182
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:51,520
and your works will be worth a lot then.

183
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,159
Jiang Hongbin,

184
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,389
you should properly present

185
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,480
your wife.

186
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,428
She might earn

187
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,959
even more than you in the future.

188
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,159
Alright, this is over.

189
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,149
Have a seat.

190
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,039
Come, sit.

191
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,520
This way.

192
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,679
Okay, thank you.

193
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,880
You must be Mrs. Jiang.

194
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,360
Hi, you are...

195
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,428
My husband Fang has a steel business.

196
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:38,629
We have been

197
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,159
cooperating with Jiang for years.

198
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,199
Sorry,

199
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,548
I am not really familiar

200
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:44,308
with his friends

201
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:45,469
from his business circle.

202
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,279
Right,

203
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,989
we have never seen you

204
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,679
in our gatherings.

205
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,959
Here.

206
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,720
This is...

207
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,679
I didn't even notice.

208
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,079
Thank you.

209
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,720
You are welcome.

210
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:26,760
Thanks to you.

211
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:27,760
It's nothing.

212
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,400
How about it?

213
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,279
Have you been busy?

214
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:37,760
Xiang Nan.

215
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,840
Here.

216
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:42,959
Let me introduce.

217
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:44,319
This is Mr. Fang

218
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,760
and this is Mrs. Fang.

219
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,149
We have already met

220
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,240
in the hallway.

221
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,919
Right.

222
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,229
Mrs. Fang

223
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,869
did me a huge favour.

224
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,629
Mrs. Jiang,

225
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,629
you are being too kind.

226
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,269
How can Xi

227
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,109
help you in any way?

228
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,149
She doesn't know anything.

229
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,880
Fang,

230
00:14:57,909 --> 00:14:59,599
stop belittling Xi.

231
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,188
She is a great artist

232
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,039
graduated from
a professional music school.

233
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:03,948
She's too good for

234
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:04,828
you who's unsophisticated.

235
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:05,389
Right.

236
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,120
Here,

237
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,520
go perform a piece

238
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,000
to liven up the crowd.

239
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,400
That's great!

240
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,319
We are indeed blessed.

241
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,279
If I don't play well,

242
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:15,880
I hope everyone can understand.

243
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:46,028
It's agreed then.

244
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:46,919
Make yourselves at home.

245
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,469
Fang, keep your voice down.

246
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,349
You are scaring me.

247
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,360
Yes.

248
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,079
Here.

249
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,079
Here.

250
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:04,720
I quite like it here.

251
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,480
Let's meet here for tea next time.

252
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,679
Yes.

253
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,959
She's ignorant because she's young.

254
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,600
Mrs. Jiang,

255
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,080
please let me know about
any good exhibitions in the future

256
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,640
so I can check them out

257
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,120
and gain exposure.

258
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:19,640
Sure.

259
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,439
Mrs. Fang,

260
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,239
I actually wanted to ask you.

261
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,519
Won't you feel

262
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,040
a little uncomfortable

263
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,320
to perform on such occasions?

264
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,400
I have also asked this question

265
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,880
to myself

266
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,199
when I was around your age.

267
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,880
I stopped thinking about it
anymore after that.

268
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,389
Anyway, whether I'm playing on stage

269
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,759
or below, I'm still playing.

270
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:45,640
With four strings, it doesn't matter
where I play.

271
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,400
It's all the same.

272
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,988
Xi,

273
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:52,029
what are you doing?

274
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,959
Let's go.

275
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,360
I should go.

276
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:01,280
Take care, Mrs. Fang.

277
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,679
I wonder how Mrs. Fang

278
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,519
can be so gracious and decent.

279
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:19,468
Do you want me to be

280
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:20,759
someone like that?

281
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,400
You can always learn from others.

282
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,800
Living in a clear and transparent way

283
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,479
can't be a bad thing, right?

284
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:32,640
Jiang, let me ask you,

285
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:36,320
do you want me to become a

286
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,040
docile,

287
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:39,600
well-behaved, obedient,

288
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,360
submissive, and empty trophy wife?

289
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,360
Not everyone can be a trophy wife.

290
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,519
Lady,

291
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,080
let's go.

292
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:10,919
(Deng Haiyang: Are you home yet?)

293
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,040
(Xiang Zhong: Yes.)

294
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,600
(Why did you show up today?)

295
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:23,309
(Deng Haiyang: You didn't reply
to me on WeChat.)

296
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,040
(I got worried so I contacted Xiang Nan.)

297
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,159
(Deng Haiyang:
You can drive pretty well now,)

298
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:31,880
(I guess you don't need
any training anymore.)

299
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,640
(Xiang Zhong: Yes.)

300
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,719
(We should go collect
the document on Monday.)

301
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:05,280
(Xiang Zhong: Alright.)

302
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,040
Hello.

303
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:28,880
I

304
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,439
heard some things.

305
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:32,519
I thought about it,

306
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,280
and I think I'd better
tell you about it.

307
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,629
Somehow, that Li Shu

308
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,640
got 200,000

309
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,280
and she's going to buy a house
in her hometown.

310
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,829
She's living happily now

311
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,959
and enjoying a comfortable life.

312
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,640
(Xiang Qian: Return 200,000
to me immediately.)

313
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,149
(Transfer and withdrawal)

314
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,040
You...

315
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,948
You are sometimes...

316
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:15,708
I think you're too soft-hearted

317
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:16,829
(Transfer 200,000)
and kind,

318
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,919
(to Li Shu)
you know?

319
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,789
Why do you ask to meet

320
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,120
at such a late hour?

321
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,988
Return the 200,000 to me first.

322
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,040
I need to use it.

323
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,759
I'll look for an opportunity
to make it up to you later.

324
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,280
Are you kidding?

325
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,479
How can I locate you after that?

326
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:05,389
Xiang Nan found out.

327
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,280
I'm afraid that if I don't pay her back,

328
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:09,228
I really don't know

329
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:10,468
what she will do.

330
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:11,800
What does that have
anything to do with me?

331
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:12,629
Listen,

332
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,199
you only gave me half of the money.

333
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,428
Aren't you worried that I will

334
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:16,640
tell everything?

335
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:20,040
What are you doing?

336
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,869
Why must you force things

337
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,149
to a point of no return?

338
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,029
If I'm not doing well,

339
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,719
how well can you be?

340
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,239
To a point of no return?

341
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,600
Gao Ping, do you think I'm scared?

342
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:36,199
I'm warning you,

343
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:38,549
give me the rest of the money quickly.

344
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,199
If you made me angry I can do anything.

345
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,890
(Return 200,000 to me immediately.)
(Before 12 am.)

346
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:10,640
(Xiang Qian: You have to)

347
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:12,869
(return the 200,000 before 12 am.)

348
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,959
(No discussion.)

349
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:35,908
Hi, Sir,

350
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:36,748
your order is complete.

351
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,880
Alright, thanks.

352
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,400
Why are you showing up to work?

353
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,719
Good morning.

354
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,600
I would be fired if I didn't.

355
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,159
Who dares to fire you?

356
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:08,999
I'm right here. Don't worry.

357
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,428
You always protect me like this.

358
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,549
Vice President Sun from the head office

359
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,880
is going to be jealous.

360
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,919
I don't want to
cause you to be fired, too.

361
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:21,069
That'll be great.

362
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,320
We can start a business together.

363
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:25,600
Fine.

364
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,880
Let's both resign now.

365
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,120
Well, there's no need

366
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,029
to be this impulsive.

367
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,629
You should make it through
at least until the end of the month.

368
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,268
This way, you can still

369
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,840
get a full month's salary.

370
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:47,268
What's wrong?

371
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:48,309
Are you sure

372
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,159
that you have fully recovered mentally?

373
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:55,640
That's good.

374
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,479
With a focused mind,
everything is at peace.

375
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:02,840
I need to trouble you
for something again.

376
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:04,159
What is it?

377
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,999
Can the person who inquired

378
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,560
Gao Ping and Li Shu

379
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:10,268
contact Mr. Lu

380
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:11,268
from Gao Ping's

381
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:12,439
postdoctoral program?

382
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:16,600
Haven't you heard that
you can reach anyone through six people?

383
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,640
If there's someone
that you want to know more about,

384
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,840
there are definitely ways
for you to do so.

385
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:23,519
Can you

386
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:25,600
ask him when will

387
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,948
Gao Ping meet Mr. Lu

388
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:28,640
recently for me?

389
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:29,668
Whether it's a dinner party

390
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:31,199
or an academic seminar,

391
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:32,999
it has to be the earliest

392
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,519
with a crowd, the more the better.

393
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,309
Sister,

394
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,159
come here.

395
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,679
What's wrong? What's the rush?

396
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:51,880
What should we do now?

397
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,829
We can't just let it go, right?

398
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,479
Of course not,

399
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,948
but what's the use of being anxious?

400
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:58,759
We need to know
what Xiang Qian is thinking.

401
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,029
I have found

402
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,829
Li Shu's profile on Weibo

403
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,908
and other social media.

404
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,479
I'll see if there are any clues.

405
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,629
You can tell me anytime

406
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,629
if there's anything for me to do.

407
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,919
I want to help too.

408
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,400
How about this?

409
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:12,948
You can think about whether
there is anyone around you

410
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:14,199
who works in advertising.

411
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,759
Let's collect the evidence

412
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,029
and if we can't fix her,

413
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,439
let's expose her online.

414
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:21,629
Let me ask Xu Miao.

415
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,629
She knows a lot of people.

416
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,679
Sure, you can ask her.

417
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,159
Are you sure

418
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,239
that you can go alone?

419
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,360
Yes.

420
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:49,479
I'll go by myself.

421
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,120
I'll wait for you here.

422
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,600
Sure.

423
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,829
Where did you go?

424
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,428
Professor.

425
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:10,199
Here.

426
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,080
Hi, Mr. Lu,

427
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,759
my name is Xiang Qian.

428
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:20,668
I am Gao Ping's wife.

429
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:21,719
What are you doing here?

430
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:23,309
To be precise,

431
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,199
I am his soon-to-be ex-wife.

432
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,919
We are getting divorced.

433
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,919
We are currently in
the divorce cooling-off period.

434
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:31,999
What brings you here?

435
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,988
Nothing much, Mr. Lu.

436
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,069
It's for our family affair.

437
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,840
Here's the thing,

438
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,029
When Gao Ping and I

439
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,759
were in the process of divorce,

440
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:40,629
many unbelievable things

441
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,159
happened.

442
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,640
This involves

443
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,040
the participation of
another student of yours

444
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,120
so I'd like to speak to you.

445
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:49,708
Let's go out and talk.

446
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,069
I think this is

447
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,919
an internal issue within your family.

448
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,149
Shouldn't the two of you

449
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,479
resolve this privately?

450
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,880
If this can be solved privately,

451
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,508
I wouldn't be bothering you here today.

452
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:00,840
I'm really sorry.

453
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,439
Li Shu, right?

454
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,199
You happen to be here too.

455
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:05,389
I have several questions

456
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,719
to ask you again.

457
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:10,829
What kind of questions?

458
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,320
I don't know anything.

459
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:14,149
I haven't asked yet.

460
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,908
Why are you

461
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:15,629
acting oblivious?

462
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,389
Let's talk outside.

463
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:16,988
I beg you.

464
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,549
Why do you keep telling me
to go outside?

465
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,629
Gao Ping, when we got divorced,

466
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,080
I gave you two 200,000.

467
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:23,320
Where is the money now?

468
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,040
Mr. Lu,

469
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:33,479
this is the thing.

470
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:35,560
Before this,

471
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,869
Gao Ping kept saying

472
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,439
we should hire a tutor

473
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:42,320
for our kids and he kept
recommending Li Shu to me.

474
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:46,239
Then, Li Shu came to my home

475
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:49,040
to tutor my kids.

476
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,040
All this while,

477
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,159
she kept leaving

478
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,280
all kinds of clues at my home

479
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,869
that made me suspect

480
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,719
that she share
an improper relationship with Gao Ping.

481
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,719
This led to a crack in our relationship.

482
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,719
In our marriage, too.

483
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:08,199
Then, I filed for divorce.

484
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,800
Of course,

485
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,800
that is what Gao Ping wanted too.

486
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,280
He wanted to study abroad
after doctoral graduation,

487
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,560
so he was eager
to get rid of this family

488
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,080
and get out of his marriage
before graduation.

489
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:26,959
That is not even the worst.

490
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:28,908
What's worse is

491
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,309
that when we were getting divorced,

492
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,479
I left 200,000 for him out of goodwill

493
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,959
but it turns out
that he transferred it to Li Shu.

494
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:49,479
Gao Ping,

495
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:51,988
I thought I knew you very well

496
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:55,280
throughout the years
we were living together.

497
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,840
The truth is, I don't know you at all.

498
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,600
Today, I realize

499
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:05,199
I don't even understand you at all.

500
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:08,069
You clearly know

501
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,719
that I have to painstakingly

502
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,959
raise two children

503
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,199
all by myself after this.

504
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:17,309
Although I need the financial security

505
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,919
so desperately,

506
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,668
I still wouldn't let you be penniless

507
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:25,759
as you walk out of this home.

508
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,120
Am I right?

509
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,600
What does this 200,000 mean to you?

510
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,560
Is it an appearance fee to Li Shu?

511
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:42,508
Is it a reward for Li Shu

512
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,040
for cooperating with you in your act?

513
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:46,629
You two have done

514
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,040
some disgusting, filthy, shameful things.

515
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:51,199
Why must I pay for it?

516
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:59,679
Mr. Lu,

517
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:03,600
is this considered a scam?

518
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:06,668
What nonsense are you talking about?

519
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:08,428
You gave me the money willingly.

520
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:10,159
How I spend it is my business, right?

521
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,439
Right.

522
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,629
Even if you say that

523
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,479
you lent the money to Li Shu,

524
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,199
I have no evidence
and I can't explain clearly, right?

525
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,919
Yes.

526
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:24,428
Then what are you talking about?

527
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,199
What do you mean by scam?

528
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,679
Have you also forgotten

529
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,199
that we are not divorced yet?

530
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,199
What is this money?

531
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:38,479
Does it count as

532
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,519
marital property for us two?

533
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:45,360
Gao Ping, you got too hasty.

534
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,919
There's something you forgot.

535
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,389
This money was transferred

536
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,120
from our joint family card.

537
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:58,719
I can check the transfer record.

538
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:05,239
If we trace back the source of this money,

539
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,400
it's from my personal income.

540
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,120
Tell me, do you think I have any right
to ask for it back?

541
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:14,149
If you are not happy

542
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,439
with what I said today,

543
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,479
you can sue me.

544
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,239
The money doesn't belong to you,

545
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,800
nor does it belong to anyone else.

546
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,800
You must return every single cent to me.

547
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,880
If I need it,

548
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,519
the two of you might even

549
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,400
have to compensate me
for mental distress.

550
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,280
Are you crazy?

551
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,748
I deserve this money.

552
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,280
Why should I compensate you?

553
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,719
Did you hear that, Mr. Lu?

554
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,719
Look at the character
and worldview of your student.

555
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:57,840
Can such a student graduate under you?

556
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,349
Can a person
with such unethical behaviour

557
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,840
continue to conduct scientific research?

558
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:07,080
If this matter gets out

559
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,519
and escalates to a legal level,

560
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,999
leading to negative public opinion,

561
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,320
tell me,

562
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,439
will it have any impact
on your personal image

563
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:19,560
and the reputation of the programme?

564
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:23,880
Stop it. I'm begging you.

565
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:25,040
Gao Ping,

566
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:27,840
is everything your wife said true?

567
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,320
Is that the truth?

568
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,959
Gao Ping, Li Shu,

569
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:42,428
I really didn't expect you two

570
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:43,640
to be of this character.

571
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,360
You collaborated to deceive someone

572
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,948
to this extent.

573
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:49,600
Not to mention,
you blackmailed for money.

574
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,759
Do you still have any conscience?

575
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,159
Do you know morals?

576
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:56,400
No matter what the dispute is,

577
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,719
emotional or financial,

578
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,919
it must be resolved within three days.

579
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:05,040
Do not ruin the reputation
of our programme!

580
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm leaving first.

581
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,880
Are you happy now?

582
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,160
Why should I be happy?

583
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,639
I am a victim here.

584
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:39,280
What am I happy about?

585
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,999
I just want my money back.

586
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:48,240
I am also getting used.

587
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,479
Shouldn't I take the money?

588
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,559
I'm gonna tell you

589
00:34:52,749 --> 00:34:54,160
what you told me.

590
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:56,880
'For every grievance, there's a source.'

591
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,079
Your creditor is right here.

592
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:17,519
How did it go?

593
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,639
I said everything I wanted.

594
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,599
I definitely want the money back.

595
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,069
As for how the programme

596
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,599
is going to punish him, he deserves it.

597
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,959
Care about reputation?

598
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,999
It's not that easy.

599
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:36,029
In fact, giving him a punishment

600
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,240
is actually a bargain to him.

601
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,400
I watched Mr. Lu coming out
with an angered face.

602
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,439
He must be furious.

603
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,240
An old, reputable professor,

604
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,840
who abstains from cigarettes and alcohol
and known for his rigorous teaching,

605
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:50,360
must have really fallen on hard times

606
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,439
to have encountered such a student.

607
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,559
What did you say?

608
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,280
What's wrong?

609
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:58,919
Mr. Lu doesn't drink?

610
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,519
That is what my friend said.

611
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,720
Can you help me to confirm this?

612
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,320
What's wrong?

613
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,788
Do you remember the day

614
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:09,200
you accompanied me
to the police station?

615
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,868
It's the day Qi and Cong

616
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,599
got lost with Ms. Zhang.

617
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:14,999
When we went back,

618
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:16,800
Gao Ping told me...

619
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,280
Where were you in the afternoon?

620
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,989
Prof. Yang

621
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,268
made an appointment with Mr. Lu

622
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,519
from the doctoral programme for lunch.

623
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,308
Mr. Lu loves drinking

624
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:30,119
so I had a few drinks with them

625
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,400
and got drunk.

626
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,959
That jerk.

627
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:36,800
I wonder how many lies he told.

628
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:55,200
I went to that friend of mine
to confirm this.

629
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,360
Mr. Lu has a bad liver

630
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,160
so he gave up drinking a few years ago.

631
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,800
Besides, guess what he said?

632
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,188
Mr. Lu had a meeting

633
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,119
in Xiamen on March 11th.

634
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:09,959
He wasn't even in Shanghai.

635
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,308
Is there something going on

636
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:27,720
that prompted you
to suddenly call us out?

637
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,240
It's about your sister and Gao Ping.

638
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:36,629
I was with her on the day

639
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,639
she checked the dashcam footage

640
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,360
of their family car, right?

641
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:41,868
We found out

642
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:43,439
that their car was parked

643
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,439
in a hotel for a long time.

644
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:47,909
I happen to have a friend

645
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,708
working there

646
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:49,509
so your sister asked me

647
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,439
to ask my friend about it.

648
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,840
However, after asking,

649
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,800
we found this.

650
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:04,228
The two of them

651
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:06,240
entered the hotel around 12 am

652
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:07,999
and they came out around 6 am.

653
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,559
Gosh.

654
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,400
What a scumbag.

655
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,999
I've seen this woman before.

656
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,479
Who is she?

657
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,599
I don't know who she is,

658
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,228
but I told Xiang Qian

659
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:21,880
that I saw this woman

660
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,629
sitting in Gao Ping's car

661
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,079
when I was crossing the street
on a random day.

662
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:32,828
When I told Xiang Qian about it,

663
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:33,959
she wasn't bothered.

664
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:37,840
Gao Ping actually cheated on her.

665
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:41,360
That's disgusting.

666
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,240
This is

667
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:50,519
your sister's family affair,

668
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:53,519
but as a friend,

669
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:54,959
I can't just ignore it.

670
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,999
So

671
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,240
I asked you two to meet to discuss

672
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,800
how to talk to your sister.

673
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,069
Come on, stop looking at it.

674
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,280
You should eat.

675
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,708
My eyes

676
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,800
are starting to see double.

677
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,039
They all look alike to me.

678
00:39:19,749 --> 00:39:21,039
Let me do it.

679
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:22,069
Look,

680
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,308
could this be Li Shu's alt account?

681
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:24,400
Let me see.

682
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,509
(Hemeng Nana's Weibo)

683
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,268
This...

684
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:28,989
(Bit by bit I'm lowering
my expectations of you.)

685
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,549
The address is correct

686
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,760
but it doesn't seem like her.

687
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,919
See?

688
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,039
I'll take a look again.

689
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,029
What time is it?

690
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,868
You should go back.

691
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,240
Jiang must be worried.

692
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:47,479
It's fine. I already told him.

693
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:51,629
By the way,

694
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,469
have you completed

695
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,840
the divorce procedures
with Deng Haiyang?

696
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,919
Yes.

697
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:56,429
I've been busy for the past two days.

698
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,160
I didn't even have time to tell you.

699
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,039
How do you feel now?

700
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,360
Do you feel sad?

701
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,549
When I just did it,

702
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,629
I was slightly upset,

703
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,388
but I'm fine now.

704
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:13,680
It feels quite freeing,

705
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:14,919
I make myself busy, too.

706
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,400
I think you are in a good state now.

707
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,119
This one.

708
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:24,709
It seems like her.

709
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,010
(Weibo text)

710
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,410
(Latte)

711
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:30,519
No way.

712
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:32,840
It's not her.

713
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,439
It's the wrong nail color.

714
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:58,429
Why did I fall asleep?

715
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,119
How long have I been asleep?

716
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,788
Not long.

717
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:02,469
You can sleep a little longer.

718
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,188
I'll keep looking.

719
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:04,519
No more sleep.

720
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,160
When I close my eyes,

721
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:08,989
I am still looking

722
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,039
for her alt account even in my dream.

723
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:12,919
I'd better look for it awake.

724
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:15,228
It's too hidden.

725
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:16,720
We just can't seem to find it.

726
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,079
How about this?

727
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,959
The location is nearby.

728
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:24,160
Only kittens and puppies' images
are posted.

729
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,039
It's a guy.

730
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,160
Li Shu.

731
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,149
Who are you?

732
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,439
I am Xiang Qian's sister.

733
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:51,268
I don't know where Gao Ping is.

734
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:52,360
I'm here to see you.

735
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,479
You must know

736
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,880
Lin Xiao.

737
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,629
We know

738
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,668
all the filthy things you did

739
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:05,919
with Gao Ping.

740
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:07,720
Besides,

741
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:08,708
we found

742
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,149
your alt account on Weibo.

743
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,788
From taking pictures of peony flowers

744
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:13,388
on the first day you entered their house

745
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:15,680
to the display of the ring
Gao Ping gave you,

746
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,919
you have recorded everything clearly.

747
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,119
I already took screenshots.

748
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:20,388
In a situation like yours,

749
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:22,188
I can sue you for fraud.

750
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:23,919
You can possibly get
