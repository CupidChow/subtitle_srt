(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 17=

4
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,979
Mom?

5
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:40,540
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:42,859
What's going on?

7
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,580
Don't!

8
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,619
Lie down.

9
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,660
I would have no idea that you were

10
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:48,219
hospitalized

11
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,699
had Qian Feng not called me.

12
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:51,100
What's going on?

13
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm fine.

14
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,900
Why is your face injured too?

15
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,619
I...

16
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,100
I'm fine.

17
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,740
How did you get injured?

18
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,180
My goodness. What happened?

19
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,419
Where are you going?

20
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,259
I'm going to work.

21
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,059
You can't just leave him.

22
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,659
He needs someone to look after him.

23
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:12,099
Go and apply for leave.

24
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,499
I can't.

25
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:19,460
You can't expect me to tend to him

26
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,900
when I'm this old.

27
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,020
I'll hire a caretaker for him.

28
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,020
He doesn't need a caretaker.

29
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:27,300
You're his wife.

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,700
He needs you.

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,819
We're divorced.

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,939
I'm not obliged to do so.

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,379
Have you completed the procedure?

34
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,140
You haven't, right?

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,099
That means you're obliged to do so.

36
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,260
Enough already.

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,099
I'm not a vegetarian, you know?

38
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,860
I can do it myself.

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,499
Don't talk.

40
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:45,260
Have some water.

41
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,819
No thanks.

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,180
You should.
Look at how dry your lips are.

43
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,900
Hurry. Be obedient.

44
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:50,740
Xiang Zhong,

45
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,140
if you wish to continue with
the divorce procedure,

46
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,020
you have to take care

47
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,059
of Deng Haiyang.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,020
If not,

49
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,379
I would never agree to the divorce.

50
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,900
You don't get to make the call here.

51
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,140
She's something else now.
Did you see that?

52
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,180
She's something else.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,580
Look at how arrogant you look.

54
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,539
You merely hired

55
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,020
a divorce attorney in Shanghai,
you know?

56
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,339
Great timing.

57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,740
You can ask the attorney about this.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,180
You're having an affair outside

59
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:18,539
even when the divorce procedure
isn't completed.

60
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:19,659
What should we do about that, then?

61
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,619
How would the verdict go

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,980
if we were to go to court?

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,860
Mom!

64
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,819
Where did you hear that nonsense from?

65
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,539
Listen,

66
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,059
good news travels near

67
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:32,219
while bad news travels far.

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,300
Fine.

69
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,379
Xiang Zhong,

70
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,339
since we're already

71
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:37,099
talking about this topic,

72
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,140
let's make things clear.

73
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,619
You want to get a divorce?

74
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:42,260
Sure.

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,939
The conditions are simple.

76
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,860
You have

77
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:45,900
to walk away empty-handed,

78
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,339
leave the house behind for Haiyang,

79
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,619
and pay us an extra one million yuan

80
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,740
as a mental damage compensation.

81
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,659
What gives?

82
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,499
What gives?

83
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,020
He's lying on the hospital bed.

84
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,819
This will definitely affect

85
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,140
his quality of life.

86
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,659
My shinbone is fractured.

87
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,659
How will this affect my quality of life?

88
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,099
My goodness.

89
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,580
That's enough.

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,740
She already turned you into a cuckold.

91
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,140
Why are you still defending her?

92
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,580
I'll say this as well.

93
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,740
We will get a divorce.

94
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,260
You won't get a single cent from me.

95
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,619
My parents bought the house for me.

96
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,339
Don't even think about it.

97
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:15,379
Stop right there!

98
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:16,820
Stop right there!

99
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,500
Listen up!

100
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:19,659
I won't let you

101
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,940
take all the benefits!

102
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,260
You won't get away that easily!

103
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:23,859
Can you please stop?

104
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,020
Just shut up!

105
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,580
Xiang?

106
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,099
Xiang!

107
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:37,380
Hurry!

108
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:40,539
Xiang Zhong's mother-in-law
is calling us.

109
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,940
Just answer the call, then.

110
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,260
I can't communicate with her.

111
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:44,060
You're not answering it?

112
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,700
How can I talk to her, then?

113
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,580
Just tell her.

114
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,020
It's been ringing for so long. Hurry.

115
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,820
Talk to her.

116
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,620
Hello, In-law.

117
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:53,739
Xiang Zhijun,

118
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,659
tell Xiang Zhong to come
to the hospital right now.

119
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,140
Bai, what's going on?

120
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,419
What do you mean?

121
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,060
Deng Haiyang broke his leg.

122
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,099
He's been hospitalized.

123
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:03,620
Don't you think
Xiang Zhong should be here?

124
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,500
Tell her this.

125
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,500
She has to come and take care of him

126
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,940
as long as
the divorce procedure isn't completed.

127
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:11,739
Hello, Bai?

128
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,020
She hung up.

129
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,380
How did he break his leg?

130
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:16,940
How should I know?

131
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:18,380
What about this?

132
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,099
Let's prepare some food

133
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:21,460
tomorrow.

134
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,500
Tell Xiang Zhong to come.

135
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,620
We'll visit Haiyang

136
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,620
in the hospital together.

137
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:27,140
Tomorrow?

138
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
But he's already hospitalized.

139
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,299
Don't worry.

140
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,419
Do you think his mother

141
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,539
has the time to call us

142
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,380
if his life was in danger?

143
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,539
You're always smarter than me.

144
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:43,859
Why did you come

145
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,140
and pick me up all of a sudden?

146
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,779
What do you mean by that?

147
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,620
You were in a major meeting.
I was worried that you might be drunk.

148
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,940
What's that smell?

149
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,099
It's so fragrant.

150
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,539
Do you mean the fragrance?

151
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,900
Do you still remember Sun Ying?

152
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,299
Which Sun Ying?

153
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,859
You mean the one who went to Shenzhen
on your behalf?

154
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:12,140
She criticized the team she was once on

155
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,620
severely.

156
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,140
It must've been tough on you.

157
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,260
The scent is too strong.

158
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,260
Did you change the fragrance?

159
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,700
I didn't.

160
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,900
This doesn't smell like

161
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,620
the previous one.

162
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
I can't take it

163
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,859
when the flower scent is too strong.

164
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,140
This is too much.

165
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,460
It's not that bad.

166
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:38,859
They smell almost the same.

167
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,339
Gao Ping, Xiang Qian,

168
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,419
you guys are back.

169
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,700
Yeah.

170
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:08,380
Why are you here this early?

171
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,419
I told her to come.

172
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,500
I've been too busy lately.

173
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,900
I told her to proofread my thesis.

174
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:14,219
Once I'm done with the thesis,

175
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,219
I'll play with

176
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,339
Qi and Cong

177
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,339
and teach them how to
make things with modeling clay.

178
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,460
You're exploiting labor here.

179
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:21,500
That's not true.

180
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,299
Gao Ping gave me

181
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:24,260
an opportunity to learn.

182
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,979
I'll continue, then.

183
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,779
Go ahead.

184
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,700
Ping,

185
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,060
I'm heating milk with the microwave.

186
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,820
You and Xiang Qian can share it.

187
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,460
Alright. Leave it there. I'll get it.

188
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,500
What's wrong?

189
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,020
What's wrong?

190
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,779
What's wrong?

191
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,179
I'm fine.

192
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,060
It scalded my hand.

193
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,580
I'm fine.

194
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,659
My goodness.

195
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,219
Don't touch it.

196
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:51,820
I'll do it.

197
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,380
Don't pick it up with your hands.

198
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,339
Stay out of this. Just leave.

199
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,020
I'll do it.

200
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,179
I told you not to do that.

201
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,219
You just had to do it, huh?

202
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:00,060
Aunty, please clean it.

203
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,020
I'm fine.

204
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,339
Gao Ping, hurry and treat your wound.

205
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,299
I'm fine.

206
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,260
Xiang Qian, what else do you need?

207
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:15,659
Sit down.

208
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,539
Do you know how old you are?

209
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:28,779
I just went and got changed

210
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,179
as it's almost time
to pick the children up.

211
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,539
Look at you.

212
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,340
Aunty, let me help you out.

213
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,980
It's fine. I'll clean it.

214
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,340
It's fine. Pass me

215
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,459
the broom. I'll help you out.

216
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,819
I'm fine. The cut isn't deep.

217
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,179
You should go now.

218
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:41,860
Be careful, okay?

219
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,740
Did you scald yourself as well?

220
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,179
I'm fine.

221
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,140
Disinfect it and let it air out for now.

222
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,980
Let's see if there are
any blisters later.

223
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,179
Don't you think Li Shu is too familiar

224
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:16,779
with our house's layout?

225
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:19,779
What? Do you feel uncomfortable

226
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:20,539
just because she knew

227
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,779
where to find the band-aid?

228
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,620
She helped Aunty treat her wound

229
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,059
when she cut herself last time.

230
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,500
I think she's just

231
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:28,659
too warm-hearted.

232
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,260
It's not about being warm-hearted.

233
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,380
Don't you think
that she's acting strange?

234
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:37,900
She's not that bad.

235
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,220
She's just a little too warm-hearted.

236
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:39,819
It's...

237
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:46,699
Share her WeChat profile with me, then.

238
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,059
What? Do you have business with her?

239
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,220
She's my children's teacher.

240
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,740
What's wrong with me
asking for her WeChat profile?

241
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,500
I'm fine with it

242
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:56,740
if you want to ask her about

243
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:57,740
our children's studies.

244
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,459
But if you intend

245
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:00,740
to ask about my relationship with her,

246
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,059
I'll tell you this first.

247
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:04,779
I care about this family a lot.

248
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,220
I care about Cong and Qi a lot as well.

249
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,939
Please don't be so paranoid

250
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,620
and sensitive.

251
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,179
I think you should

252
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,500
care about how sensitive I am.

253
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,100
Is Xiang Qian causing you trouble again?

254
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,539
I shared your WeChat profile
to Xiang Qian.

255
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,620
Do I have to approve her friend request?

256
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,659
You have no reason not to.

257
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:07,819
Don't worry.

258
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,260
I don't post anything on my Moments.

259
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,380
This is for you.

260
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,860
You can't just

261
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,819
borrow the ring
from your friend all the time.

262
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:26,100
You're wearing it for one moment

263
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,140
and not wearing the next.

264
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,779
It'll be strange
if people ask you about it.

265
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:32,500
This is my first time receiving

266
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,980
a ring from a man.

267
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,140
Say, do you think I should be happy

268
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,100
or upset?

269
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,500
Help me put it on.

270
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:37,380
Xiang Nan,

271
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:38,539
where are you?

272
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,980
I'm in the studio.

273
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,659
Jiaqiao is going to meet Li Hao today.

274
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,500
You should keep her company

275
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,260
so that you can keep Jiaqiao in check.

276
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,100
I can't be there today.

277
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,220
I'm very busy today.

278
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,419
You have two other friends

279
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,459
helping you out, right?

280
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,459
You have no idea

281
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,020
how genuine Li Hao is.

282
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,860
He fainted

283
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,059
at the construction site

284
00:12:58,539 --> 00:12:59,579
as he didn't eat after Jiaqiao said

285
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,860
he was too muscular.

286
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,699
Where can you find

287
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:03,740
a genuine man like him?

288
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,340
Jiang Jiaqiao doesn't know

289
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,620
how to cherish him at all.

290
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,059
Jiang.

291
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,020
I'll tell you this again.

292
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,620
I'm extremely busy today.

293
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,140
I can't go there,
and I don't feel like going.

294
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:17,299
Alright now, Xiang Nan.

295
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Stop being emotional.

296
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,860
It won't take you that long

297
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,939
for you to head back.

298
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,179
I'm not being emotional here.

299
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
Can you respect people for once?

300
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,980
You knew that Jiaqiao

301
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:28,980
doesn't like Li Hao.

302
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,819
Why must you force them

303
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,020
to be together?

304
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,819
And now,

305
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,860
I have an exhibition to attend.

306
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,020
There's a large-scale joint exhibition

307
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,179
that I need to prepare for.

308
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:37,659
Can you please show me

309
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,740
and my profession

310
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,500
some respect?

311
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,140
I'm not stopping you
from holding the exhibition.

312
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,620
How am I disrespecting you?

313
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,059
Aren't you being insensible here?

314
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:48,220
Hello?

315
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,620
Xiang Nan?

316
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,380
She's ridiculous!

317
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,659
Madam.

318
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:19,939
Madam.

319
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:20,539
Mr. Wang.

320
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,860
Mr. Jiang told me to send you there.

321
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,500
Please tell Mr. Jiang

322
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,380
that I'm busy today.

323
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm not going anywhere.

324
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,100
Madam,

325
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,939
Mr. Jiang said

326
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,819
that if I failed to pick you up today,

327
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:35,579
I...

328
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm afraid

329
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,819
I have to get a new job tomorrow.

330
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:50,220
Come.

331
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,860
We have to enjoy it while it's hot.

332
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:53,659
Why aren't you eating?

333
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:54,659
You have to enjoy it while it's cold.

334
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,260
It's melting.

335
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,340
I've bought you all the popular food

336
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,459
on this street.

337
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,140
I'll buy you everything you want to eat

338
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:01,980
today.

339
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,020
What else do you want to eat?

340
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:04,860
I don't take them.

341
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:05,779
You can go ahead.

342
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:08,620
I can't take them.

343
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:09,740
But why?

344
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,020
I need to control my weight.

345
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,419
I need to be strict with my diet.

346
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,900
How heavy are you?

347
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,900
110

348
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,179
kg.

349
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,579
110 kg?

350
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,340
That's right.

351
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:25,740
If only you could lose

352
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,620
another 50 kg.

353
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,380
You can do it.

354
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:31,939
I...

355
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:32,740
Jiang Jiaqiao.

356
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,020
Xiang Nan.

357
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,260
I thought you weren't coming.

358
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,939
Have a seat.

359
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:38,500
Jiang Jiaqiao.

360
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:39,340
You don't like him at all.

361
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:40,699
Why are you going out
on a date with him?

362
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,779
Li Hao, I'm sorry.

363
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:43,740
I know

364
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,459
that you're a great person.

365
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,620
But Jiang Jiaqiao

366
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,059
doesn't like you at all.

367
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,980
She even detests you.

368
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,819
You touched her hand previously.

369
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,419
She went back and washed
her hands for three days.

370
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,939
She almost washed off her skin.

371
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,779
Show me your hand.

372
00:15:58,419 --> 00:15:59,579
Show it to me.

373
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,380
It's fine.

374
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,900
Why did you wash your hands, then?

375
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,620
My brother told Li Hao to take me

376
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,699
to the gym this afternoon.

377
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,900
He held my hand.

378
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
His palms were so sweaty.

379
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,539
It felt greasy. I...

380
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,260
I wanted to wash away

381
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,020
that awful feeling.

382
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,659
It felt as if I could
never wash it away.

383
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,539
I...

384
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:28,860
I...

385
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:29,980
If I'm not mistaken,

386
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,419
your family only had one son
per generation

387
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,059
for three generations in a row, right?

388
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:34,860
She didn't even allow you
to touch her hands.

389
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,819
It's impossible for her

390
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,299
to deliver your offspring for you.

391
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,419
How dare you still laugh?

392
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,140
And, you starved yourself

393
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:42,659
until you fainted

394
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,260
just because of her casual remark.

395
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:46,500
Aren't you going through
all these sufferings

396
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:48,020
just because

397
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,179
their family is wealthy...

398
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:49,579
Enough!

399
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,380
You have gone too far.

400
00:16:58,779 --> 00:16:59,939
Li Hao, I'm sorry.

401
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:02,779
How dare you still laugh?

402
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:05,340
I had to say it on your behalf.

403
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
And now, I've offended him.

404
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,300
My brother will definitely blow up
if he finds out.

405
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,060
Where are you guys going?

406
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,939
Aren't we supposed to visit Haiyang?

407
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:24,739
Let's head there together.

408
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,659
I'm not going.
You guys shouldn't either.

409
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:28,659
What's wrong again?

410
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,019
Don't tell me you argued with

411
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:30,939
your mother-in-law again?

412
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:31,979
Argue with her?

413
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:32,780
Now, she's utterly

414
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,620
unreasonable.

415
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,540
She said I would have
to give them the house

416
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
and one million yuan as compensation fee

417
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,380
if I get a divorce.

418
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:38,659
Does she think I'm crazy?

419
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,820
He fell by himself.

420
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,259
Why should we compensate him?

421
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,979
It's all because of
the incident in Tongli.

422
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,499
Don't go there.

423
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,380
You guys will only cause trouble for me.

424
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,820
Are we still heading there, then?

425
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:52,140
I don't think we should.

426
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,780
Are you not heading there?

427
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,499
She...

428
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,259
Xiang Zhong,

429
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,259
let's forget about the fact
that you two aren't divorced yet.

430
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:00,019
Even if you two are divorced now,

431
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,179
don't you think

432
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,140
I should visit Haiyang?

433
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,179
We already fell out with each other.

434
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:03,939
Why are you heading there?

435
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:04,979
You want to seek trouble?

436
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:07,140
You're insensible indeed.

437
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,380
You're not going, huh?

438
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,459
Fine, I'll go there myself.

439
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:13,780
You...

440
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,219
You guys!

441
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,580
Don't go!

442
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:16,939
Wait, look at him.

443
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,380
It's spilling. Look at you.

444
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,419
You should follow her.

445
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,780
Why are you following me?

446
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,060
Wait.

447
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:24,780
Enough already.

448
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,499
Be a good girl.

449
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,179
How could you listen to her?

450
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:29,499
My goodness.

451
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:30,900
Hold it properly.

452
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,019
- Fine.
- Don't spill it.

453
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,459
I'm holding it properly.

454
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:37,419
Look at what they're doing.

455
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,499
We have to compensate them
with the house and money.

456
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,419
Isn't she being unfair

457
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:42,580
here?

458
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,140
Don't you know Xiang Zhong well enough?

459
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,900
With that temper of hers,

460
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,820
I'm sure she said something unpleasant.

461
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,259
That's why she made

462
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,219
Haiyang's mother angry.

463
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,620
His mother is something else as well.

464
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
His mother...

465
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,019
She's a crazy woman.

466
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,900
That's right.

467
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,100
But listen.

468
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,219
When we're there,

469
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,540
we have to be subservient.

470
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:02,459
It isn't shameful for us

471
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,340
to lower our worth.

472
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,340
We cannot talk back

473
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,340
or retaliate.

474
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,820
We'll make sure
she cannot lose her temper

475
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:08,780
and that she has to hold it in.

476
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,019
If not, Xiang Zhong has to suffer

477
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,340
if

478
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:13,459
we provoke her.

479
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:17,100
Look at you. Can you even do that?

480
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,499
Can you?

481
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,620
Why can't I?

482
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,979
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,459
You won't be able
to hold it in when you're there.

484
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,140
What about this?

485
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,699
I'll head inside first.
You can come later.

486
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:27,739
A good man doesn't compete with a woman.

487
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:29,060
You'll be in danger, then.

488
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,100
I won't fight her.

489
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:31,979
I will...

490
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:32,699
I...

491
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,860
One doesn't hit a smiling face.

492
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,580
As long as

493
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,179
we can lower our worth

494
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,179
and pretend to be subservient...

495
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,739
Yeah.

496
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,659
She...

497
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,780
What else can she say?

498
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,979
We'll shut her up.

499
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,499
Just feed her the soup.

500
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,540
Listen.

501
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:49,540
Don't you know

502
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:50,459
his mother well enough?

503
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,499
It all depends on you now.

504
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:53,780
Alright.

505
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:55,979
Come.

506
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,100
Enough.

507
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,219
Hurry.

508
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,620
What's wrong?

509
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,019
Dad.

510
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,580
Haiyang.

511
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,620
Dad.

512
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
In-Law,

513
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,060
when did you come back?

514
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,380
Don't move.

515
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:26,419
Haiyang,

516
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,019
your mother-in-law and I
did some research on

517
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,219
fractures.

518
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,939
Now, you need

519
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,380
top-quality protein the most.

520
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,580
Therefore, we made some

521
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,620
stewed beef

522
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,540
and chicken breast for you.

523
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,259
Wait.

524
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:40,219
You see,

525
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:41,060
there's a concept called

526
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,979
isotope complementarity.

527
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,219
You are what you eat.

528
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:45,540
However, I suggest

529
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
that you should refrain from

530
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,019
pork bone soup during the first week.

531
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:50,499
It's too oily.

532
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,459
I told you already. It's not a fracture.

533
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,620
It's bony crack.

534
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,580
Bony crack?

535
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,820
What exactly are you trying to say?

536
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,580
Look.

537
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,540
He has bony crack.

538
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,380
These two are different things.

539
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,140
Enough already.

540
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,459
Look at the situation we're in.

541
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,179
Are you two here

542
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:02,140
to perform cross-talk?

543
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:03,300
Hurry.

544
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:04,499
Tell Xiang Zhong to come.

545
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,179
In-Law,

546
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,140
listen.

547
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:08,580
Xiang Zhong

548
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:09,620
is working right now.

549
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
No matter what,

550
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,380
we shouldn't disturb her
when she's working,

551
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,060
right?

552
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,739
Is she not coming?

553
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,340
Do you expect an old hag like me

554
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,259
to serve him?

555
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,060
Do you think it's appropriate?

556
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:18,699
You see, we...

557
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:19,860
In-Law,

558
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,860
you just came back, didn't you?

559
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
Your luggage is over here.

560
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,419
Hear me out.

561
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,060
In-Law,

562
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,820
you can head back and rest first.

563
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:27,300
I'm serious.

564
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,900
Just leave Haiyang to me.

565
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,499
Can you actually take care of him?

566
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,140
We'll be fine.

567
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,340
Both of us are healthy.

568
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
He has to do everything

569
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,060
from his bed for the next few days.

570
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:37,259
How can you guys take care of him?

571
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:40,019
If he's going to pee and poop
from his bed,

572
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:41,780
we shouldn't feed him too much protein.

573
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,820
If not, it'll stink.

574
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,300
Dad, Mom,

575
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,060
why don't you guys head back first?

576
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,979
I can take care of myself.

577
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:48,860
You guys are getting a divorce.

578
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:50,259
Stop calling them that.

579
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,659
In-Law,

580
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,060
they aren't divorced yet.

581
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,780
He's not wrong for calling me Dad.

582
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:55,939
He's not wrong for calling me Mom
as well.

583
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,459
Indeed.

584
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,380
It's just that I don't know
which of us should respond first

585
00:21:58,499 --> 00:21:59,580
when he says "Mom".

586
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,140
What about this?

587
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:00,780
You can respond first.

588
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,620
Enough already.

589
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,179
Can you two stop your comedy routine?

590
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,820
Hurry up. Take your things

591
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:05,340
and leave.

592
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:06,419
Tell Xiang Zhong to come here.

593
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,820
What about this?

594
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,860
Don't be angry.

595
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,860
It's bad for your health.

596
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,900
In-Law,

597
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,979
I'm sure your trip

598
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,780
was exhausting.

599
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,300
You're over 60 years old.

600
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,019
It's taking a toll on your body.

601
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,100
It won't be worth it
if you fall sick now.

602
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:17,459
Stop talking.

603
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,699
You guys are definitely

604
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:19,739
up to no good.

605
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:20,820
Stop talking.

606
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:22,100
Take your things and leave.

607
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,259
You two

608
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
should leave

609
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:25,100
immediately.

610
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,580
Wait.

611
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:25,820
The knife...

612
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,380
Get out!

613
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:26,739
The knife...

614
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:26,900
Wait.

615
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,219
The knife...

616
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,580
Don't say that.

617
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:29,499
In-Law,

618
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,979
You...

619
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,419
We're family.

620
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:32,219
We can talk things over.

621
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:33,179
What family?

622
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,699
How can you guys bully us like this?

623
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,019
Bai.

624
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,140
Who are you calling Bai?

625
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:40,060
Bai.

626
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,699
I...

627
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:41,939
Who's Bai?

628
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:42,739
Bai!

629
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,860
None of us should cross the line!

630
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,939
I'm a father-in-law

631
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,580
while you're a mother-in-law!

632
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,499
We're trying

633
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:52,979
to coax you while putting on a smile

634
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,780
as we speak

635
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,459
just so we could

636
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,860
resolve the conflict
between our children.

637
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,219
Now, you're ordering us around

638
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,739
as if we're your servants!

639
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,259
Do you think that's appropriate?

640
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,179
Who told you guys to come?

641
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:02,219
Who told you guys to come?

642
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,060
Haiyang is sick!
We came here to visit him!

643
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:04,939
We came out of good intentions!

644
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:05,659
Is that wrong?

645
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,939
Why are you shouting?

646
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,540
You think you have a loud voice?

647
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,219
That's right!

648
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,419
You imbecile!

649
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:11,100
You shrew!

650
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:11,860
Listen!

651
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,659
I knew

652
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:13,580
you couldn't be this mild-mannered!

653
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,340
You shrew!

654
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,219
Who are you calling shrew?

655
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,860
Just ignore her.

656
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:16,739
Hurry and go.

657
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:17,540
Hurry!

658
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:18,300
Listen!

659
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:19,699
Tell Xiang Zhong to come!

660
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:20,540
You can feed it to the dogs!

661
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:21,499
Take it away!

662
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:22,419
Take your things away!

663
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:24,580
Take it!

664
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:26,100
Take it with you!

665
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,419
Xiang Zhijun, you better listen to me!

666
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:29,780
- Just go!
- Let's go.

667
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:30,780
Open the door!

668
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:32,100
Listen!

669
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:32,900
Xiang Zhijun!

670
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,739
If you don't tell

671
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,060
Xiang Zhong to come here,

672
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,459
you'll suffer my wrath!

673
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,820
What did I tell you?

674
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,699
I said you shouldn't marry this girl.

675
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,419
But you couldn't do it.

676
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,100
You just had to marry her.

677
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,300
Now you see?

678
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:49,540
You deserve this!

679
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,580
They'll be the death of you

680
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,499
sooner or later!

681
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,820
Why are you covering yourself
with the blanket? Hear me out.

682
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:01,620
This is infuriating.

683
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,580
Why did you bring the soup back, then?

684
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,140
I'll take them.

685
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,900
Didn't you say you were going
to feed it to the dogs?

686
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:11,620
You deserve this.

687
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,979
You truly deserve this.

688
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,780
You'll drive me

689
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,060
to the grave

690
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,900
one day.

691
00:24:59,019 --> 00:24:59,620
Aunty,

692
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,820
did the children

693
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:04,019
like the new tutor?

694
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,140
I think

695
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:05,939
they like her.

696
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:07,459
Ms. Li is pretty nice.

697
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,699
It's just

698
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,219
that sometimes,

699
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,100
she doesn't treat herself
as an outsider in the family.

700
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,259
What about the rest?

701
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:22,300
I don't know about the rest.

702
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:24,780
You see, after she came here,

703
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:26,060
it's either she was
teaching the children

704
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,259
at the living room

705
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,900
or helping Gao Ping

706
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,459
to organize his thesis.

707
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,219
I barely speak

708
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,659
to her usually.

709
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,259
Gao Ping said he's not returning

710
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,499
for dinner, right?

711
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:43,300
Yeah.

712
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:44,900
He said he had something to do
in the research center.

713
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,100
He'll be late.

714
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:51,459
If so, you don't need
to prepare too many dishes.

715
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:52,540
There are only four of us
at home anyway.

716
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,140
Madam, you're back.

717
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,979
Ms. He.

718
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,900
Here are your slippers.

719
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,219
Is Mr. Jiang back?

720
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,300
He's back long ago.

721
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:16,499
He had his dinner at home.

722
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,219
Is he in the study room?

723
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:20,900
That's right.

724
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:22,300
Okay.

725
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,060
Xiang Nan.

726
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:27,939
You scared me.

727
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:29,060
What's wrong?

728
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:33,100
The atmospheric pressure
is very low now.

729
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:36,659
Is he downstairs?

730
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,219
Xiang Nan.

731
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,219
You're back.

732
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,499
Come downstairs.

733
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,219
Just leave.

734
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:02,140
What's wrong?

735
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,219
I heard from Li Hao

736
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,019
that he won't see Jiaqiao again.

737
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,459
I wish to know the reason.

738
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:13,499
I guess he has told you everything.

739
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,019
I wish to listen to your explanation.

740
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,100
I have nothing to explain.

741
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,699
Why did you do that?

742
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,860
Why did you

743
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:24,699
break his heart?

744
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,259
Are you trying to stop Jiaqiao

745
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:27,300
from getting a good husband
and leading a comfortable life

746
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,019
on purpose?

747
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,140
I just think that we should

748
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,860
get married

749
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,939
to people we like.

750
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,820
Jiang Jiaqiao is dumb.

751
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,019
If she knew what she wanted,

752
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:35,580
she wouldn't have...

753
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,939
She wouldn't have fallen for that scam!

754
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:38,699
Even so, you can't just use
financial sanctions

755
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,340
to force her to go on blind dates.

756
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Are you reprimanding me?

757
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,939
Xiang Nan, listen up.

758
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:48,259
No one

759
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,300
has ever dared to hang up on me.

760
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,580
You're the first.

761
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,860
I don't want that to happen again.

762
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,140
Are you threatening me right now?

763
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,380
Am I?

764
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,340
I'm supporting all of you right now.

765
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,419
I'm the only person paying for

766
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:03,499
all of your expenditures here.

767
00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:05,179
Is it unreasonable
for me to make some requests?

768
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,780
Jiang, let me ask you something.

769
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:08,419
Would you fire Mr. Wang

770
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:09,860
if I didn't get in the car today?

771
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,659
Jiang,

772
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,580
you're not giving us a choice here.

773
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:16,860
This isn't a request.

774
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,979
This is called coercion!

775
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,780
Xiang Nan.

776
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,699
Thanks.

777
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:17,979
I'll be going now.

778
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,459
Great job.

779
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:18,900
See you.

780
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:19,860
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

781
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,380
Goodbye.

782
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:27,820
(Xiang Zhong:
Let's have supper together.)

783
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,419
(Gao Ping: Okay.)

784
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,219
When I picked up

785
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,580
the children yesterday,

786
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,259
their class teacher
wanted to speak to me.

787
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:54,140
The class teacher said

788
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,300
Cong has made huge improvements.

789
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,659
She said

790
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,419
he could focus much better now.

791
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:01,340
He was usually distracted

792
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,419
when it came to handicraft classes.

793
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,499
But now, he can focus.

794
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:05,140
You didn't see the expression
on Cong's face.

795
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:06,419
He was so happy
that he was doing a little dance.

796
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:07,300
I think

797
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,019
it's been quite some time

798
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,060
since he was praised like that.

799
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,380
I told you before, right?

800
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,459
A child's interest

801
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,100
is their best teacher.

802
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,739
You just need to rouse

803
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:15,780
their interest.

804
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,659
By the way, I remembered something.

805
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,300
Regarding the fragrance,

806
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,179
when I was buying modeling clay

807
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,100
with

808
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:31,259
the children,

809
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,820
they gave us a free gift.

810
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,979
There was a sample pack

811
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,100
for a new type of fragrance.

812
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,699
I didn't pay any attention to it.

813
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:37,699
I just kept it in the car.

814
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:48,499
Please do a kind deed.

815
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,860
Show me some mercy.

816
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:51,979
Tell me what's going on.

817
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,100
If not,

818
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,580
I feel restless.

819
00:30:58,019 --> 00:30:59,019
Stop peeling it.

820
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,820
One of your fingers

821
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,979
was wounded, right?

822
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,820
When I was taking a bath,

823
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:09,659
I found

824
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,860
a lipstick

825
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,659
in our bathroom.

826
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
It wasn't mine.

827
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,499
It wasn't Aunty's, either.

828
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:19,900
If no other women

829
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,939
came to the house,

830
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,900
I think it should belong to Li Shu.

831
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,380
I think so.

832
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,860
I'll ask her about it later.

833
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,419
Why did her lipstick

834
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,060
appear in our bathroom?

835
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,939
What are you trying to get at?

836
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:46,780
I'm trying to say

837
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,860
that there's a guest restroom
in the house.

838
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,259
Cong had a stomachache yesterday.

839
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:51,060
He was occupying the guest restroom.

840
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,060
Li Shu was in a hurry
to use the restroom.

841
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,140
That's why I let her
use the main restroom.

842
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,219
What a coincidence, huh?

843
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,219
It is a coincidence.

844
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:57,100
What else could it be?

845
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:00,499
What answer

846
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:01,540
do you wish to hear from me, then?

847
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:08,939
Gao Ping,

848
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,499
you should try to
put yourself in my shoes.

849
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,860
After I came back from my business trip,

850
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,540
the fragrance on the car was changed.

851
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:16,900
A young and beautiful woman

852
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:18,699
was in my house

853
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,259
acting like

854
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:21,739
she was the female head of the family.

855
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:23,259
And now,

856
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,060
I've found her lipstick

857
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:26,380
in

858
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,219
our

859
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,580
private restroom

860
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,900
in the master bedroom.

861
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,780
What would you think

862
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,100
if you were in my shoes?

863
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,939
I'm sorry. The thesis has been

864
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:53,939
occupying too much

865
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:54,979
of my energy and time lately.

866
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,499
I'll apologize to you, okay?

867
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,100
That fragrance

868
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,540
was just a free gift.

869
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:06,739
To me, it's just a fragrance.

870
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,300
That's why I left it in the car.

871
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:10,580
I didn't pay any attention to it.

872
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,820
As for the lipstick,

873
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,620
it might've fallen out
of her pocket by accident.

874
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,540
It was a coincidence.

875
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,620
It's not like

876
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,340
I placed it there.

877
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,860
I've already

878
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,979
explained myself to you.

879
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,979
If you're still unsatisfied,

880
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:26,300
I'll explain it to you again.

881
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:45,739
This is unexpected indeed.

882
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,419
We've been living together

883
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:50,340
for so many years.

884
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:53,300
But to you,

885
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,380
I'm actually that kind of person, huh?

886
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,699
Boss,

887
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,619
get me a bottle of beer.

888
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:10,180
Boss,

889
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:11,419
get me a bottle of beer.

890
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,499
Alright. Coming right up.

891
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,340
(Instead of hiring a tutor outside,)

892
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:56,180
why don't I

893
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,499
head to the research center and see if

894
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:58,700
there are any juniors willing
to do part-time work

895
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,660
to support their studies?

896
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:01,180
Firstly,

897
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,579
I know them better.

898
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:03,979
Secondly,

899
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,740
it's cheaper than hiring
a private tutor.

900
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,820
We can save some money too.

901
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:07,939
What do you think?

902
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,900
(What do you think about Li Shu?)

903
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,619
(Are you close to her)

904
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,619
(or not?)

905
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,660
Not really close.

906
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,380
What's the matter?

907
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:16,740
Gao Ping, hurry and treat your wound.

908
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,939
I'm fine.

909
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,419
Xiang Qian, what else do you need?

910
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,660
(I'll apologize to you, okay?)

911
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:25,740
(That fragrance)

912
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,300
(was just a free gift.)

913
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,619
(To me, it's just a fragrance.)

914
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,740
(That's why I left it in the car.)

915
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,979
(I didn't pay any attention to it.)

916
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,099
(As for the lipstick,)

917
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:34,860
(it might've fallen out
of her pocket by accident.)

918
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,780
(It was a coincidence.)

919
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,860
(It's not like)

920
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,579
(I placed it there.)

921
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:38,059
I've already

922
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,019
explained myself to you.

923
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,419
If you're still unsatisfied,

924
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:41,380
I'll explain it to you again.

925
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:03,220
Xiang Zhong.

926
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,340
What are you doing here?

927
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:07,780
Are you heading to the hospital or not?

928
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,139
I've already hired a caretaker.

929
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,860
What else do you want?

930
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:11,939
I'll ask you one last time.

931
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,459
Are you heading to the hospital or not?

932
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,780
No. I'm busy.

933
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,860
Is she your mother-in-law?

934
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,139
She's quite fierce.

935
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,419
My daughter-in-law, Xiang Zhong,

936
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,820
may look refined on the outside,

937
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,900
but she's devious on the inside.

938
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,019
She wanted to divorce my son.

939
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,220
My son didn't want to comply.

940
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:33,300
Because of that,

941
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,260
she almost made my son blind.

942
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,139
It's that ridiculous?

943
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,860
This time, my son got hurt

944
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,180
because she had an extramarital affair

945
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,180
and my son caught her red-handed.

946
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,220
Xiang Zhong!

947
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:50,019
Xiang Zhong!

948
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,220
You should go down and take a look!

949
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,939
Someone's criticizing you

950
00:36:51,939 --> 00:36:53,059
with a loudspeaker downstairs!

951
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,499
Hurry and contact Deng Haiyang!

952
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,900
- Hurry!
- Okay.

953
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:59,780
I've begged Xiang Zhong

954
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,459
to take care

955
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:02,099
of her husband in the hospital
time and time again.

956
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,700
She didn't pay any attention to it.

957
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:05,099
She didn't care about it at all.

958
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,539
Everyone,

959
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,860
don't you think a person like her

960
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,860
shouldn't be a part
of this organization?

961
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,660
That's right.

962
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,220
I have no choice

963
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,660
but to beg for an explanation

964
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:18,019
from the members

965
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,380
and superiors of the organization.

966
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,499
I want to seek justice.

967
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,900
Yeah, you should.

968
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:23,820
You should seek justice.

969
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,099
Superiors, please come here.

970
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:27,260
What are you doing?

971
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:28,660
What are you doing?

972
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,220
Bai Lifang!

973
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,139
Don't you think
you're going overboard here?

974
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,180
You've already committed
all those atrocious deeds.

975
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,700
Why are you afraid of being criticized?

976
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,340
I just want you to head to the hospital

977
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,180
and take care

978
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,419
of Deng Haiyang.

979
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,180
Is my request unreasonable?

980
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,900
Deng Haiyang and I are already divorced.

981
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,180
I'm not obliged to take care of him.

982
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:43,300
You wish to cause a commotion?

983
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:44,220
You want to spread rumors

984
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,340
and do a protest, huh?

985
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:45,979
Fine.

986
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,459
Head to the streets,

987
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:48,139
the TV station,

988
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,900
or the radio station
to report me, then!

989
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,019
You think I'm afraid?

990
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:52,660
What are you guys looking at?

991
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,340
All of you saw that, right?

992
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:54,780
Xiang Zhong!

993
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,059
I just want her to head to the hospital

994
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,700
and take care of my son!

995
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,499
Is my request unreasonable?

996
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,820
Not at all.

997
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:02,380
Superiors, please come out!

998
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:23,419
Mister.

999
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:24,380
Stop here.

1000
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,260
Please wait.

1001
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,260
I'll stop after this junction.

1002
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,300
I have no choice

1003
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:34,660
but to beg for an explanation

1004
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,220
from the members

1005
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,579
and superiors of the organization.

1006
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,180
What's with the startled reaction?

1007
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,419
Hurry! Take a look!

1008
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,740
That's right! Seek justice!

1009
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,860
- Superiors, hear her out!
- Yeah!

1010
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,099
What are you doing?

1011
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,619
Bai Lifang!

1012
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,780
Don't you think
you're going overboard here?

1013
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:51,740
You've already committed
all those atrocious deeds.

1014
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:53,419
Why are you afraid of being criticized?

1015
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,700
Listen.

1016
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,459
Your son and I are already divorced.

1017
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:56,979
Where are you going?

1018
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:58,099
I'm not obliged to...

1019
00:38:58,099 --> 00:38:59,419
You like to cause a commotion, huh?

1020
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:18,740
Hold tight.

1021
00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:23,979
Everyone, come and take a look.

1022
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,979
Come and take a look.

1023
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:25,380
This is...

1024
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,740
I...

1025
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,260
I'm telling the truth here.

1026
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,059
Madam,

1027
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,220
how long do you plan

1028
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,539
to keep this board of yours?

1029
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:37,740
I'll take it away only when

1030
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,539
she heads to the hospital.

1031
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,220
If she doesn't,

1032
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,979
I won't.

1033
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,459
You see,

1034
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,019
this is a family dispute.

1035
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,380
We can understand that you guys
have a family dispute going on.

1036
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,619
But this is causing a negative impact,

1037
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,700
don't you agree?

1038
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,139
Are we not allowed
to voice our opinions now?

1039
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,300
Of course you are allowed to do so.

1040
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:54,499
But you have to do it

1041
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:55,740
through official channels?

1042
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:56,459
Don't you think?

1043
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,740
You're being so loud.

1044
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,900
There's no way for us to work.

1045
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:01,139
Are you the leader here?

1046
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,900
Can you make the call here?

1047
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,260
Tell the person in charge

1048
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,539
to come here.

1049
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,939
Get out of the way.

1050
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,019
Move out of the way.

1051
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,579
Move out of the way!

1052
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:19,459
What are you guys looking at?

1053
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:20,220
What are you doing?

1054
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,099
Bai, what are you doing?

1055
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:22,820
What do you think I'm doing?

1056
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,220
What are you doing?

1057
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,820
What do you think I'm doing?

1058
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:24,780
Get out of the way!

1059
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,499
What are you doing?

1060
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,740
You're disturbing public order,

1061
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,419
you know?

1062
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,820
I'll tell you this again!

1063
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:30,660
Get out of the way!

1064
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,139
What are you doing?

1065
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:32,740
You...

1066
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:33,939
What are you doing?

1067
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:34,939
What are you doing?

1068
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,059
You're too much!

1069
00:41:36,419 --> 00:41:37,619
Get out of the way!

1070
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,539
I'll tell you this again!

1071
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:39,300
Get out of the way!

1072
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:40,340
Get out of the way!

1073
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:41,220
Get out of the way!

1074
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,419
My waist.

1075
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,820
Get out of the way!

1076
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,499
You're still coming at me

1077
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,499
even when you've sprained your waist?

1078
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,979
How dare you still come at me?

1079
00:41:58,059 --> 00:41:59,059
You deserve that sprain!

1080
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,660
Officer!

1081
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,820
The cops are here.

1082
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,539
She's disturbing public order here.

1083
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:03,099
Look at her.

1084
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,139
Officer, great timing.

1085
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,820
What's going on?

1086
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,380
Look at her.
She's disturbing public order.

1087
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:08,180
Talk one at a time.

1088
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,220
Don't listen to him!

1089
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Don't listen to their nonsense.

1090
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,419
Tell the cop what you did.

1091
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,740
Fine.

1092
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:14,220
They were spouting nonsense.

1093
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,700
You...

1094
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,499
You rode the bike here, right?

1095
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:17,180
Yeah.

1096
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,340
I came here to keep her in check.

1097
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:19,340
You didn't wear a helmet, right?

1098
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,220
He did.

1099
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,019
Who said so?

1100
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:22,099
- He didn't.
- I did.

1101
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,139
I...

1102
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,059
That's not a helmet.

1103
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:25,660
Come. You have to pay a fine.

1104
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,419
Officer.

1105
00:42:26,499 --> 00:42:27,099
A fine?

1106
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,019
Please abide by the law
and fine him as you should.

1107
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,740
Fine him!

1108
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:30,539
Shut up!

1109
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,300
You shut up!

1110
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,419
What is this?

1111
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,180
Take your fine.

1112
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,619
Pay your fine at the police station

1113
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,419
in the next three days.

1114
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,419
Go and pay your fine!

1115
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,499
Wait.

1116
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,780
She...

1117
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,619
Are you ignoring her?

1118
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:45,660
You guys have lost.

1119
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,979
