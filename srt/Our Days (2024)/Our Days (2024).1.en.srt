- Alright.

You shouldn't work all the time.

He is a PhD holder.

47

They gave birth

48
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,360
to a pair of twins, a boy and a girl.

54
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:25,541

a milk tea last month.

(Xiang Family's Eldest Son-in-law,
Gao Ping)

Which lady did you
order the milk tea for?

58
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,060
It was probably for Dayuan.

00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,480
Dayuan isn't dieting anymore?

60
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,781
Can she drink milk tea?

What are you up to?

73
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:35,879
Nothing.

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,999
Why didn't you make any noise

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,981
when you came home?

76
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:39,461
Who are you talking to on the phone?

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
Just a gamer, with issues.

78
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:46,740
You're no better.

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,901

Eat it or not, up to you.

81
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Why do you keep
leaving the toilet unflushed?

82
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm eating,
and you're talking about the toilet.

83
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,360
Just flush it for me, that's all.

84
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:04,221
Do it yourself.

Right after obtaining
Master's Degree of Art,

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,060
she opened her own studio

89
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,079
in Suzhou.

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,319
If she gets married later,

91
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,581
her husband

92
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,920
will definitely be someone special.

93
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,300
Does she have a boyfriend?

94
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,101
No, not yet.

95
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,960
Nowadays, young people

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,500
(Xiang Family's Third Daughter, Xiang Nan)
might not even tell you if they do.

97
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:36,141
That's impossible.

98
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,461
If Xiang Nan had one,

99
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,260
she wouldn't keep it from me.

100
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,820
(Xiang Nan: Thank you for the treat.)

101
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:48,341
(Mr. Jiang: When can I meet
my future father-in-law?)

102
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,720
Xiang Qian, you're finally here.

103
00:05:58,721 --> 00:05:59,860
What's going on?

104
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:01,519
All the smart home systems in this house

105
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,940
were designed by us.

106
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,439
The voice feature on the television

107
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
is set to be on all the time by default.

108
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,040
So now she thinks

109
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,439
we sent her private information

110
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,901
to a third party.

111
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,840
Her husband discovered her cheating,

112
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:14,981
and now they're getting a divorce.

113
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,439
She's pretty furious.

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,841
You'd better be mentally prepared.

115
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:20,680
(Daming's Smart Home System)

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,559
This room doesn't have any devices
connected to our system,

117
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,519
besides the television.

118
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,079
Exactly.

119
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,661
This is the key issue.

120
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,920
I answered all my important calls

121
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,300
in this room,

122
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,981
and somehow,

123
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:32,781
the leaked details are so specific.

124
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,180
This isn't surveillance,
then what is it?

125
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,600
How much longer is this going to take?

126
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:39,421
I have to go out in ten minutes.

127
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:43,101
If you don't give me an answer today,
then just wait for a legal notice from my lawyer.

128
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,661
Mrs. Mo,

129
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:47,680
has this room

130
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:49,160
been renovated?

131
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,141
No.

132
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,700
Then, can I take a look
behind this painting?

133
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,879
Look at the wallpaper here.

134
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,500
It's obviously been patched.

135
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,940
Take the painting down.

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,199
Huang Chong, do you bring a ladder?

137
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,901
Yes, I do.

138
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,461
Go and take it.

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,461
You see, Mrs. Mo.

140
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,399
I told you,

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,101
we won't install anything
that isn't confirmed on the drawings.

142
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,040
And this isn't

143
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,500
even our product.

144
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,360
Maybe you should check

145
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:47,421
with your husband?

146
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,480
If you persist

147
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:50,999
it's our product

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,199
and our responsibility,

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,999
then we might have to

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,541
involve our legal team as well.

151
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:56,461
Yuanyuan,

152
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,999
process the home visit inspection fee

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,661
through the application

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,260
for Mrs. Mo.

155
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,461
Alright.

156
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:08,879
Xiang Qian,

157
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,120
you're amazing!

158
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,221
That's satisfying!

159
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,461
After all, it's her fault.
And, she still wants to wrong the others.

160
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,439
Xiang Qian,

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,639
you're so detail-oriented.

162
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,101
I was looking all over
and couldn't spot that.

163
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,260
I have to be thorough.

164
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,360
If I missed a detail,

165
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:22,120
we'd be getting

166
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,341
her legal notice.

167
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,620
A marriage

168
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,940
with monitoring each other like this
is just too scary.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,820
If that's what marriage is, why do they marry?
Staying single is a lot simpler.

170
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,800
(Xiang Zhijun: Come home quickly.
We have something to discuss.)

171
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,959
Sis, our car is in the parking lot.
We will go that way.

172
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,679
Go ahead.

173
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,279
Bye.

174
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,180
Bye, sis.

175
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,861
Hello, Dad?

176
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,901
What's up?

177
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,360
Come back home now.

178
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,700
I have something important.

179
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,141
You have such a drama every day.

180
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,000
(Xiang Qian: Our dad really thought
I lived right next door to him.)

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
(He always thought
I could just get home right away.)

182
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,759
(You know, a round trip from Shanghai
takes over two hours.)

183
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,440
(Xiang Zhong: He just called in a panic,)

184
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
(saying there's an urgent matter
and I have to go home.)

185
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,399
(I'm still at work.)

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,440
(Now, I have to take leave.)

187
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:16,800
(Xiang Nan: The customized bottle
for a client is only halfway done.)

188
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,039
(Seems like I'll have to start over.)

189
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,340
(See you at home later.)

190
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:21,940
Stop here will do.

191
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,741
Thank you.

192
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,661
Qian.

193
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,421
You may go first.

194
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,741
Whose car did you come back in?

195
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,600
I happened to have a friend

196
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:41,480
who lives nearby,

197
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,021
so he gave me a lift.

198
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,279
Zhong.

199
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,021
What's the old man up to now?

200
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:47,700
I don't know.

201
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,421
He said it had to be
discussed in person.

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,021
Let's go.

203
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,541
Park here.

204
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,381
Let's go.

205
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:05,980
Aunt Xue!

206
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,300
You're back.

207
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,340
Aunt.

208
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:19,919
Dad, mum.

209
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,279
We're back.

210
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,421
Dad, mum.

211
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,060
Where are they?

212
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,421
Show your face.

213
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,519
Xiang Qian is calling me.

214
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,340
Dad!

215
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,460
Mum!

216
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,141
We're here!

217
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,480
We're here!

218
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:35,580
Come over here.

219
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,679
Oh my goodness, mum.
Why are you dressed like that?

220
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
What are you doing?

221
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:39,320
We're taking photos.

222
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:40,440
Why are you taking photos?

223
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,480
Just so you know, we're running
out of chances to be together.

224
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,060
You probably don't know, but there's
a redevelopment project of the old town.

225
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,879
This residential area

226
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,840
won't be safe for long.

227
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:47,741
Where's Xiang Nan?

228
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
I'm here.

229
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,700
Come here.

230
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:50,980
Does this look good?

231
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:51,799
What's wrong?

232
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,541
- Where should I put my hand?
- Just put it there.

233
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,580
That's fine.

234
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:54,799
Good.

235
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,999
Xiang Zhong, Xiang Zhong, smile!

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,541
Look over here.

237
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:58,700
Xiang Qian.

238
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,300
Come on.

239
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:03,399
Xiang Qian, look here.

240
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,300
I'm recording for my mum.

241
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:06,519
Alright.

242
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,180
Only Xiang Qian isn't looking good.

243
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,381
Sing, sing, sing!

244
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:16,580
Weaving fishing nets.

245
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:19,279
Weaving, weaving fishing nets.

246
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,060
Alright.

247
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,340
I have an important announcement
to make to all of you.

248
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,621
Let's go inside.

249
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Pull our mum back.

250
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:24,919
You

251
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,399
pull her back first.

252
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,661
Let her sing by herself here.

253
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:29,720
Come on.

254
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,501
How can you do that?

255
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:31,999
Mum,

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,799
how did you get there?

257
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,720
How did you get down?

258
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,261
I swam over.

259
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,861
Dad.

260
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,340
Come take a look.

261
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,360
How is the photo?

262
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:40,799
Very good.

263
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,060
Send them over to them.

264
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,141
I will send it.

265
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:43,759
Xiang Nan, you...

266
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm Xiang Zhong.

267
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:46,960
Oh, right. Xiang Zhong, you...
Why are you pouting?

268
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:47,679
You...

269
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,060
There's nothing to be happy for.

270
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:50,980
Alright.

271
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,261
Let's go into the topic.

272
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,820
Here's the situation.

273
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,600
If our home gets torn down

274
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,460
for redevelopment,

275
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:03,861
the compensation should be substantial.

276
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,621
After discussing

277
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,741
with your mum,

278
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,021
we decided to

279
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:10,940
split it into four portions.

280
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,580
We'll keep 20%

281
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,799
for ourselves

282
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,220
as our retirement fund.

283
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,381
Xiang Qian has two kids now,

284
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,679
and she will probably have

285
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,261
another one with Gao Ping,.

286
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,700
So,

287
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,340
we'll leave

288
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,820
Xiang Qian 20%.

289
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,580
Xiang Zhong's life

290
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,781
is simpler

291
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,141
and doesn't have any burden,

292
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,901
so she'll also get 20%.

293
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,460
And the rest,

294
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,781
we'll leave

295
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:42,741
for Xiang Nan.

296
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:44,180
Hmm...

297
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,039
No need, dad.

298
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,639
I don't need that much.

299
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,180
Don't give it all to me.

300
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,400
What are you troubled about?

301
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,440
I don't need a single cent,
you can give it all to Xiang Nan.

302
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:53,799
No, sis. I...

303
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,799
You don't want it?

304
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,080
Then, he won't be happy.

305
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,661
That's not the case, Xiang Zhong.

306
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:00,200
Xiang Nan just graduated
and is starting her own business.

307
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,501
She'll also eventually get married.

308
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,940
It makes sense

309
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,399
to give her more money, isn't it?

310
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,440
I'm not saying it doesn't.

311
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,879
I agree, I have no objections.

312
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,799
I said it, give it all to her.

313
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
You guys see her attitude.
Does it sound like she has no objections?

314
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:11,919
What attitude

315
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
would be appropriate?

316
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,560
Does she sound like she has no objections?

317
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,440
Stop it. Stop it.

318
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:16,999
It's all

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
still uncertain.

320
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:19,661
Am I right, mum?

321
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,919
Who informed you about this?

322
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,159
Isn't it just some rumor

323
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,861
circulating in your friend group?

324
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,039
Which relevant authority

325
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,879
officially notified you

326
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,279
about this demolition?

327
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Yeah, exactly.

328
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,320
Even if it really happens someday,

329
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,261
I think

330
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,679
out stance is that

331
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,759
you two should keep the money
for your retirement,

332
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,120
and how much you want to give Xiang Nan

333
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,080
is up to you.

334
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,021
I don't need it.

335
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,440
No.

336
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:39,440
I don't want it either.

337
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:39,759
Hold on.

338
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,480
What's wrong with my allocation?

339
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:41,799
Wait.

340
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,799
Can we not get called over

341
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,919
for things that aren't certain?

342
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,840
I still have work.

343
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,300
Is it that unreasonable to call you home
when there's something important?

344
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:47,879
Did I not come?

345
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,261
When did I ever not come?
Haven't I always come right away?

346
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,621
I have a live stream to do.

347
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,679
We're not done talking.
Why do you leave for a live stream?

348
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,060
It has nothing to do with me.

349
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,519
Xiang Zhong.

350
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,300
Zhong,

351
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:01,480
it's time for lunch.

352
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:02,919
Eat before you leave.

353
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,781
I don't want to eat.

354
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Eating won't

355
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,141
take long.

356
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,360
Can you guys just stop for a moment?

357
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,940
You can just think of me as being left
in the countryside and not brought back.

358
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
If you have anything,
find Xiang Qian or Xiang Nan will do.

359
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,039
Don't come to me,

360
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,879
okay?

361
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,700
Be careful.

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,279
What do you think I'm here for?

363
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,720
Watch your step.

364
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,320
If that's how it is,
don't come back anymore.

365
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,501
Do you think I want to come back?

366
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,200
Can you say a little less?

367
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,460
Fine.

368
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,560
Xiang Zhong.

369
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,980
- Stop arguing.
- Xiang Zhong!

370
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:31,999
Can't you

371
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,999
speak properly?

372
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,679
Since when did I not speak properly?

373
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,960
Every time I say something,

374
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:36,759
it's always my fault.

375
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,381
You guys never have any issues?

376
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,661
What issues?

377
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
It's just a small issue. And, you've been
hung up on it for over 20 years.

378
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:43,560
That's not our parents' fault.

379
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,240
It was just due to the policy.

380
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:47,279
Yeah, policy issues.
It's all about the policy.

381
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,639
Why do they give birth to many kid?

382
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,240
Alright.

383
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,360
It's all our fault.

384
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:52,600
Everything was mistakes
from the beginning. Is that okay?

385
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,519
What mistakes have you made?

386
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,039
You just wanted
to give the Xiang family a son.

387
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
If I had been a boy, would I
have been sent to the countryside?

388
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,440
What are you talking about?

389
00:14:58,441 --> 00:14:59,240
Let me tell you,

390
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,320
even if you were a boy,

391
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,039
I'd still send you

392
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,360
to the countryside.

393
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,120
Who knows?

394
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:04,320
Why are you

395
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:04,879
messing around?

396
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
Why does it escalate

397
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,999
to a gender issue again?

398
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,580
You're really...

399
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:11,340
No, she is...

400
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,621
Where are you? I'll come to find you.

401
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,700
Who is that?

402
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,661
Xiang Nan,

403
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,340
who are you on the phone with?

404
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,141
My boyfriend.

405
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,279
Boyfriend? Who is your boyfriend?

406
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,261
Who is he?

407
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,460
It's

408
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:39,501
the guy over there.

409
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:41,781
Is he already here?

410
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,060
The one in the suit?

411
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,180
Yes, you're right.

412
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:56,141
Yes.

413
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,840
The one waving the fan?

414
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:58,820
Waving the fan?

415
00:15:58,841 --> 00:15:59,159
No way,

416
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,919
why is he bald?

417
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,580
How old is he?

418
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,440
No, it's not the one waving the fan.

419
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:11,440
It's not the one.

420
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:12,399
Look up.

421
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,141
The one above.

422
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,901
Which one above?

423
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:19,501
The billboard.

424
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,240
Isn't he...

425
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,200
What's his name?

426
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:24,279
He is Jiang Hongbin,

427
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,100
right?

428
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:25,901
Yes.

429
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:28,799
Jiang Hong...

430
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,021
Who's Jiang Hongbin?

431
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:31,480
He's a real estate agent.

432
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,279
Pretty famous

433
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,759
and very successful.

434
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,720
That's just a billboard

435
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:36,300
for his own project.

436
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,879
- That's right.
- Then, that's pretty good.

437
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
What do you mean "good"?

438
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,501
That's bad.

439
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:42,460
He's pretty old.

440
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:43,879
And, this is probably
a touched-up photo.

441
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,421
Otherwise, he'll look older.

442
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,261
Xiang Nan,

443
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:48,999
how old is he?

444
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,480
He's not that old.

445
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:52,759
Early forties.

446
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,340
Hold on.

447
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,340
Early forties?

448
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,980
This...

449
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,180
Isn't it still acceptable?

450
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:01,320
You're still very young.

451
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,100
Xiang Nan, what's the situation?

452
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,919
He was married before,

453
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,501
but divorced now.

454
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,861
Does he have kids?

455
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,360
What is his status now?

456
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,460
Is he staying alone?

457
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,500
He has a daughter

458
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:17,381
who's nearly fifteen,

459
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:18,520
but she lives with his ex-wife

460
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,879
in Canada.

461
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,239
He's by himself

462
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,141
here.

463
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,199
He has a daughter in Canada?

464
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,080
Even though she's far away,

465
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:25,239
she's still his child, isn't she?

466
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,040
At his age,

467
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,000
with a divorce and a kid,

468
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,301
it's not that unusual.

469
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:29,180
Xiang Zhong.

470
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,540
How long have you two been together?

471
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,700
We've been together for half a year,

472
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,159
but he's serious about me.

473
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,341
He's sincere.

474
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,540
He wants to marry me.

475
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,301
I thought

476
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,879
he hasn't met all of you yet,

477
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,159
so at least let him come over

478
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,840
and get to know each other,

479
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:54,040
have a meal together

480
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,840
or something.

481
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,399
Stop it there.

482
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,460
No need.

483
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,101
As long as you're happy.

484
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,220
I have no objections.

485
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,861
Do you have any objections?

486
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,040
Neither your mum nor I
have any objections. Is that fine?

487
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,141
Dad, I...

488
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:08,159
Mum.

489
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,220
Is the tail broken?

490
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,040
If it's not broken,

491
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,341
then follow me.

492
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,159
I was just thinking

493
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,239
we could discuss it together.

494
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,260
No need for discussion.

495
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,901
This is not considered a discussion.
You're just informing.

496
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,740
The old man spoiled you for nothing.

497
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,061
Zhong.

498
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,120
Qian.

499
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,220
Come with me.

500
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,980
Qian, am I done for?

501
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,899
You're done for.

502
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,200
(Jiang Hongbin
Chairman of Hongjiang Group)

503
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,199
I tell you,

504
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,220
you've spoiled her.

505
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,800
How come is this my fault?

506
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,280
- It's because of you spoiling her.
- Be careful.

507
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,220
She's just like you.

508
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:43,661
Alas!

509
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,341
Just leave it like this.

510
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,421
Everything becomes terrible.

511
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,101
Fine!

512
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:03,020
What are you doing?

513
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:05,280
If you have something
to say to the kids, just say it to them.

514
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:06,180
What should I say?

515
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:07,120
Call them

516
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:08,520
and say whatever you want to say.

517
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,700
She keeps everything from me.

518
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:11,220
Why could I say?

519
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,360
Both kids

520
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,520
are such headaches.

521
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,800
As for Xiang Zhong throwing a tantrum,

522
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:16,061
I won't comment that.

523
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,360
When she was little,

524
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:18,581
we are really sorry for her.

525
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:19,661
As for Xiang Nan,

526
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,560
we gave her

527
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,661
our full attention.

528
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,821
And what do we get in return?

529
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,141
She's about to get married.

530
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,020
Then, only she tells us

531
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
she's dating someone

532
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,040
who's divorced and has a kid.

533
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:29,800
You see this...

534
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,220
Keep your voice down, okay?

535
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,540
We're from the
Pudong District Police Station.

536
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,101
Are you Lanzhi?

537
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,460
Yes, I am.

538
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,180
Please come with us to cooperate
with an investigation.

539
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,101
Where are you taking me?

540
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:47,341
Why?

541
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,740
Why are you taking her?

542
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:52,861
What did she do?

543
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:56,439
You haven't experienced enough.

544
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,581
And, you're dating someone
so older, I am...

545
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:01,239
I...

546
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,141
What's up, dad?

547
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,821
Xiang Qian.

548
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,080
I'm telling you,

549
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:06,901
the police took your mum away.

550
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:07,740
What?

551
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,341
We're coming back right now.

552
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,341
Oh my god, what a day!

553
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,101
What's wrong, dad?

554
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,341
Dad!

555
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,399
What happened?

556
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,980
Take a look at this. You read.

557
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,260
This...

558
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,520
- What did they say?
- They didn't say anything.

559
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,220
As soon as they came,
they took her away. This...

560
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,080
Wait,

561
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,620
should you call Feng Yue?

562
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,901
Their family has a lot of connections
with the Public Security Bureau.

563
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,719
Can you stop mentioning him?

564
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
We've been divorced
for five or six years.

565
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:43,560
Why would I call him?

566
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:45,000
Who else can help us, other than him?

567
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,840
This could solve the immediate problem.
If you don't call him, what will we do?

568
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:48,679
It's alright.

569
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,600
Stay calm for now.

570
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,639
I'll send this detention notice to the lawyer
to see what's going on.

571
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
Yeah, dad, stay calm.

572
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:55,360
Let Qian talk to the lawyer first.

573
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,320
Xiang Nan, make dad a cup of tea,
don't let him get too stressed.

574
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,919
I...

575
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,800
Where are you going?

576
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,540
Packing a few things for Mum.

577
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:30,901
Thanks.

578
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,700
How is it, Lawyer Wu?

579
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,341
Preliminary assessment suggests

580
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,239
it's a case

581
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,861
of soliciting prostitution.

582
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,540
What kind of case?

583
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,020
Soliciting prostitution.

584
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,020
My mum?

585
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,600
Lawyer Wu,

586
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:48,639
are you sure the person

587
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,940
you met is my mum?

588
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,520
Lanzhi,

589
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,500
59 years old, that's your mother, right?

590
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,540
Yes.

591
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,061
This can't be possible.

592
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,180
Please stay calm.

593
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,901
It's not that your mother
was involved in prostitution.

594
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
The primary suspect
is called Lin Shufen,

595
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:08,399
an old colleague

596
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,940
of your mother's from the silk factory.

597
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:13,600
She's also the owner of a beauty parlor
that's allegedly facilitating prostitution.

598
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,000
Your mother did

599
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,220
introduce some older women

600
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,239
to Lin Shufen

601
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,959
and accepted a referral fee.

602
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,101
Aunt explained everything to me

603
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,959
that she didn't know anything
since the beginning.

604
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,600
Lin Shufen actively sought her out

605
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,040
to introduce some people

606
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,159
to her beauty parlor

607
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,199
for treatments.

608
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,040
In this case,

609
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,719
if Aunt is telling the truth,

610
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,479
legally,

611
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,661
she shouldn't be held liable.

612
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,520
Hold on.

613
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,421
When you were there with my mum,

614
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,061
how was her condition?

615
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:39,679
She seemed quite anxious

616
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,780
and nervous.

617
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:41,840
But don't worry,

618
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,040
I told her

619
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,901
to be honest.

620
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,341
What's

621
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,301
the worst outcome?

622
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:51,381
Aunt might

623
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:52,980
face charges for solicitation,

624
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,360
which could result in a prison

625
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:55,199
term of up to five years,

626
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,381
and also pay a fine.

627
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:59,320
A more severe case

628
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:01,301
could mean over five years.

629
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:04,020
Oh my god.

630
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,840
This requires a process of investigation

631
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:09,980
and evidence collection.

632
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:11,220
(How long)

633
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:14,199
(is that process?)

634
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,439
(Legally, detention)

635
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,940
(shouldn't exceed 37 days.)

636
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,280
(Chai Jin)

637
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,280
This concludes

638
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,000
my data analysis for the project.

639
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:30,199
If anyone has suggestions,

640
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,381
feel free to share.

641
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,540
Where's the tea?

642
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,061
Here's an empty bottle.

643
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,460
They even keep the empty bottle.

644
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,560
American ginseng is here.
Make him some tea.

645
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,341
Alright.

646
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:01,280
Dad,

647
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:03,341
I made you some American ginseng tea.

648
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,460
Drink a bit.

649
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,500
Take a break.

650
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:09,581
Dad, don't worry.

651
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,260
Qian has already contacted a lawyer.

652
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,621
Don't worry.

653
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,500
As long as Qian is here,

654
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:21,020
everything will turn out fine.

655
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:26,919
Yuanyuan,

656
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,080
you depart now from the office

657
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:29,301
to the International Finance Center.

658
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:30,560
Which counter,

659
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:32,239
whom to look for, and what to pick up,

660
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,661
I'll message you shortly.

661
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,020
And, where to deliver it to,

662
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,540
I'll send it to you as well.

663
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,661
Mr. Gao.

664
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,180
It's my pleasure, Miss Xiang.

665
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,980
It's been a long time since I met you.

666
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,520
I just finished my lunch and was about
to send my client off.

667
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,301
You just called me in time,
to keep me waiting here.

668
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,720
It's just so coincidental. Have a seat.

669
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,020
I'm so lucky.

670
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:07,980
You see,

671
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,239
it's already the afternoon.

672
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,141
You must haven't eaten yet.

673
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:12,679
I ordered a few dishes for you.

674
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,341
You see if you'd like to add anything.

675
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,500
No need.

676
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,800
I don't want to take up

677
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,220
your afternoon session.

678
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:20,821
Alright.

679
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,879
I have something

680
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,621
I'd like to ask for your help.

681
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:30,360
Hmm...

682
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,719
My mum got involved

683
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,661
in a somewhat unsavory case.

684
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:35,479
They just

685
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,360
took her in.

686
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:37,740
She's at the detention center now.

687
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:41,260
What kind of case?

688
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:45,061
I just met with the lawyer.

689
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:49,661
He said it's suspected involvement
in prostitution solicitation.

690
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:56,621
Sorry about that.

691
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,020
It's alright,
I almost want to laugh too.

692
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,679
But, this is absolutely impossible.

693
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,239
My mum could never
do something like that.

694
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,239
She's an elderly lady,

695
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,260
who is almost at her sixties.

696
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:06,101
She must have been tricked.

697
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,719
But I also understand

698
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,959
that the Public Security Bureau

699
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,280
need time

700
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:11,740
to investigate.

701
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,661
Since you're familiar with people in the
Public Security Bureau,

702
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,239
I wanted to ask if you could

703
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,199
put in a word for them

704
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,760
to prioritize
investigating my mum's part

705
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,600
in this.

706
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:22,040
If it's a misunderstanding

707
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,540
and nothing happened,

708
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:25,360
they can release her sooner.

709
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:27,239
My mum lives a princess-liked life.

710
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,360
She's never been through something

711
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:29,421
like this in her life.

712
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:33,901
Understood.

713
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,421
I completely understand.

714
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,520
Look at you,

715
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:38,700
as a daughter,

716
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,381
this is very touching.

717
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,520
By the way, I

718
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,840
came across your wife's

719
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:46,919
social media recently

720
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,020
that she liked this particular bag.

721
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,239
And, I happened to have

722
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,000
a contact at the store,

723
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,479
and I let her reserve one for me.

724
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,621
I was just wondering

725
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,500
when I could give it to you,

726
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,901
and here's the chance.

727
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,901
No need for all this between us, right?

728
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:03,760
This is not so particular.

729
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:05,260
It's just a gesture.

730
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,740
Mr. Gao.

731
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,500
Sorry to interrupt.

732
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:13,061
- Could you sign here?
- Alright.

733
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,800
No, no.

734
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:14,800
It's on me.

735
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,320
- Mr. Gao, please give me the chance.
- That's no need for you to do that.

736
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,280
Please give me the chance
to pay the bill. Thank you.

737
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:20,180
Miss, here you go.

738
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,421
Thank you.

739
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:27,460
I just finished eating.

740
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,661
It was Xiang Qian.

741
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,159
I invited her several times.

742
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,360
But, she always finds excuses

743
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:33,260
and superficial.

744
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:34,260
See?

745
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:35,581
Now she's the one asking me for a favor.

746
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:38,399
She's almost forty,

747
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,260
and still pretending to be a young girl.

748
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,421
Alright, that's all.

749
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,460
Mr. Gao,

750
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,159
I've paid the bill.

751
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,760
Thank you for giving me the chance.

752
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:52,780
You're leaving now?

753
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,020
Everyone at home is waiting for news.

754
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:56,700
Please, I'm counting on you.

755
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,540
Don't you worry.

756
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,020
It's a small matter.

757
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,000
Thank again.

758
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:01,320
Alright.

759
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,421
Goodbye, see you.

760
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,901
(Chai Jin: I was in a meeting)

761
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,180
(and missed your call.)

762
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,980
(What's wrong?)

763
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,141
(Xiang Qian: I'm having a family affair
and I'm handling it.)

764
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,301
(Chai Jin: The Yiyang Community project)

765
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,101
(didn't get approved by the headquarters.)

766
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:45,861
(Xiang Qian: Why?)

767
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:47,780
(Chai Jin: Let's talk in person.)

768
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:52,141
Look at this.

769
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,901
It's your mum's favorite flower.

770
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:55,180
I'll put it here.

771
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,500
It looks perfect here.

772
00:28:59,121 --> 00:28:59,760
You're back.

773
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:00,621
Xiang Qian.

774
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,040
Xiang Qian, where's mum?

775
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,260
Why didn't she come back with you?

776
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,520
Mum won't be able to come back for now.

777
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,000
She has to wait
until the investigation is complete.

778
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,381
Investigation?

779
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:15,061
Mum's gotten

780
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,421
involved

781
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,460
in a medical beauty scam.

782
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:24,760
The primary suspect is my mum's

783
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,861
former colleague from the silk factory,

784
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:28,061
Lin Shufen.

785
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:29,940
The one who owns the beauty parlor.

786
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,159
Do you know about her?

787
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,500
How could I not?

788
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,439
Back in the day,

789
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,800
your mum was in the same factory as her.

790
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:38,180
She was quite a beauty in the factory.

791
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,919
Do you know

792
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,661
what she's doing now?

793
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:44,880
Didn't you just...

794
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,439
Didn't you just say
she runs a beauty parlor?

795
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah.

796
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,399
That's right.

797
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,661
So it's related to
a medical beauty scam.

798
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,879
Yes.

799
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,901
Was mum deceived by her?

800
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:56,500
She must have been.

801
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,800
Lawyer Wu said

802
00:29:58,801 --> 00:29:59,439
Mum claimed

803
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,901
she didn't know anything.

804
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:02,879
Lawyer Wu also said

805
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,260
it shouldn't be a big problem.

806
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,520
If it's not a big problem,

807
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:07,421
how long will she be held?

808
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
I don't know.

809
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:10,239
Once the investigation is done,

810
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,280
she will be fine

811
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:12,460
and able to come back.

812
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:16,199
Your mum is such a particular person.

813
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,719
How could

814
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,280
she bear

815
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,861
being in there?

816
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:21,159
I just packed and brought

817
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,341
some clothes for her.

818
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,861
She's so timid.

819
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,901
She must be terrified.

820
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:31,460
There's nothing we can do.

821
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,180
Whether she's scared or not,
none of us can visit her right now.

822
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:37,220
I asked Lawyer Wu

823
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,020
to check on mum daily

824
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:41,621
and keep us informed.

825
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,760
Did you bring the heart medicine

826
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:50,940
to your Mum?

827
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,840
Hurry, this is serious.

828
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:53,581
Yes.

829
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:56,000
Also, let's bring her

830
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:56,800
daily vitamins too.

831
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,381
See, the medication is all here.

832
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,960
(Nanpu Bridge)

833
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,159
It's all preservatives.

834
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,800
Yeah.

835
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,760
Look at this, it's from 2017.
It's been expired for years.

836
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,940
It might even have bugs in it.
Oh my goodness.

837
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,260
I threw it away,
and they picked it back.

838
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,141
Dad, where are you going?

839
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,220
You go follow him.

840
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,421
He went out.

841
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,719
Where is he going?

842
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,540
Dad!

843
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:02,421
Dad!

844
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,260
Dad!

845
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,700
Dad, where are you going?

846
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,159
Dad, where are you going?

847
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,460
I'll go with you.

848
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,080
(Pudong District Detention Center, Shanghai)

849
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,239
We're closed.

850
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,301
Come here tomorrow.

851
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:44,700
I'm here to bring my mum her medication.

852
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,560
She had a stent operation

853
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:47,719
on her heart.

854
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,500
She has to take heart medication daily.

855
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:54,080
Could you please open the door
so I can pass the medication through?

856
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,940
I won't go inside.

857
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:01,581
Hello, Qian.

858
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,101
Dad just fainted.

859
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:05,780
Why?

860
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,320
He just went

861
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:09,159
to the ATM to check his balance.

862
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,879
He took a look

863
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,780
and then fainted when he got home.

864
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,301
How's he now?

865
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:14,919
I'm with Zhong.

866
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,000
We called an ambulance,

867
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,719
and we're on the way to the hospital.

868
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,861
When will you...

869
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,040
(Pudong District Detention Center, Shanghai)

870
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,821
Anything?

871
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:03,421
Sir,

872
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:06,100
can I borrow your phone?

873
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,799
My phone's broken,

874
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,319
and my car's out of petrol

875
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,480
in the parking lot.

876
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:12,620
I need to call someone to pick me up.

877
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,901
Hello?

878
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:19,540
Boss,

879
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,480
my phone broke,

880
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:22,920
and my car ran out of petrol.

881
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,520
I can only

882
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,000
remember your number.

883
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,540
Can you come pick me up?

884
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,821
Are you okay?

885
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:29,341
Where are you now?

886
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,279
I'm at the

887
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,140
Pudong District Detention Center.

888
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:35,181
Also,

889
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,960
could you quickly

890
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:37,040
contact Xiang Nan

891
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,440
and ask her

892
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:39,120
to call this number?

893
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,460
It's urgent.

894
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:41,679
And, please

895
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,560
let Gao Ping know

896
00:35:42,561 --> 00:35:44,000
my phone is broken

897
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:45,580
and to contact me as soon as he can.

898
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:46,880
Alright.

899
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:48,020
Don't worry.

900
00:35:48,561 --> 00:35:49,540
Alright.

901
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:53,839
Sir,

902
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,821
could I wait for another call?

903
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:57,660
Of course, no problem.

904
00:35:58,121 --> 00:35:59,221
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

905
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,580
Take your time.

906
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,639
Thank you.

907
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,660
No rush.

908
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,100
Hello, Xiang Nan.

909
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:25,520
Qian,

910
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:27,060
are you okay?

911
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm fine.

912
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:29,359
My phone broke.

913
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,660
How's dad?

914
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,120
Dad is alright.

915
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:33,460
He just woke up.

916
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:34,520
The doctor suspects

917
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:35,400
a minor stroke,

918
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,799
so they're going

919
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,261
to do a CT scan of his brain.

920
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,080
So now is his speech,

921
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:41,140
his awareness,

922
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,759
and his facial expression,

923
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,940
all normal?

924
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,440
Everything is normal.

925
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:46,759
He's conscious.

926
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,741
Well.

927
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:48,861
Hmm,

928
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:50,701
you are with Zhong now, right?

929
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,301
Yes, we're both here.

930
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,719
I won't come over now.

931
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,639
My car is out of petrol.

932
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,540
I'm waiting for Chai Jin
to come to fetch me.

933
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,140
I'll come by tomorrow.

934
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,781
Take care of Dad, okay?

935
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,359
Alright.

936
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,781
Don't worry.

937
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,639
By the way, if there's anything urgent,

938
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,319
you can

939
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,440
call Chai Jin.

940
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:10,060
He'll be here soon.

941
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,359
Sir, thank you.

942
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,839
Alright.

943
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,799
Thank you.

944
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,261
You're welcome.

945
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,199
I'm fine.

946
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,301
What happened to your leg?

947
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,261
I fell.

948
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:42,880
Are you alright? Can you walk?
Do you need to go to the hospital?

949
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,080
I'm fine. It just hurts a little.

950
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:45,600
I might have just scraped the skin.

951
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:46,821
Get in the car.

952
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:50,301
Thank you.

953
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:01,861
Thank you.

954
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:03,781
I found you an old phone.

955
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,020
You can use it for now.

956
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,821
You thought of everything.

957
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,000
If I couldn't think of this,

958
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:12,381
I'd be useless.

959
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,159
This is the best thing

960
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,660
that's happened to me today.

961
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,701
Still haven't heard from Gao Ping?

962
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,580
Seems like he's pretty busy.

963
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:31,741
Can't reach him when it's critical.

964
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,781
Around this time,

965
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,821
he's probably with the kid.

966
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,060
Xiang Nan told me

967
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:46,100
your mum

968
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:48,020
was deceived, right?

969
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:51,341
Losing some money isn't a big deal.

970
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,901
If it were just simply a deception,
that would be fine.

971
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,901
But she's suspected
of facilitating prostitution.

972
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:01,181
Oh my goodness.

973
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,460
What happened?

974
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,861
Were you able

975
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,500
to bring her the medication?

976
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:21,580
No.

977
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,701
I was a few minutes too late.

978
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:32,960
Let's go find Bai

979
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:34,821
and see if she can help.

980
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:43,261
Bai's uncle has it arranged.

981
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:45,100
He'll be here on duty soon.

982
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,741
Isn't it awkward
to keep bothering your ex?

983
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,159
I'd love to bother
my current girlfriend,

984
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,460
but she doesn't exist.

985
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:54,960
Are you having too many?

986
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:56,460
And you don't know which one is yours?

987
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,781
Don't worry.

988
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,421
I'll try to find more.

989
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,741
I go in first.

990
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,279
I'll go in with you.

991
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,940
No need, I'm fine.

992
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,080
Hello, Sir.

993
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:08,221
- It's me again.
- Here you are.

994
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
Please open the gate for me.

995
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:10,781
Alright.

996
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,221
Thank you.

997
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:16,060
- Are you good to go?
- Yes.

998
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,480
I'll wait for you outside.

999
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:19,381
Alright.

1000
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,120
The doctor said

1001
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,421
after the intravenous drip,

1002
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:24,920
they'll keep him
for observation overnight

1003
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:26,060
to see his condition.

1004
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:27,341
It should be fine.

1005
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,000
Zhong, you...

1006
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:39,600
Don't you have a live stream tomorrow?

1007
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:40,639
Do you want to go back first?

1008
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,861
I'll stay here.

1009
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:44,781
It's still early. I'm fine.

1010
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,140
Alright.

1011
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,020
I didn't get the chance to ask you.

1012
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,901
Hmm...

1013
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,741
Jiang Hongbin

1014
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:03,359
is someone with rich condition,

1015
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,181
there must be plenty of girls

1016
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,000
surrounding him.

1017
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:07,920
Have you ever thought

1018
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:08,679
about why he chose

1019
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,980
to be together with you?

1020
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:15,140
Maybe it's because I'm the prettiest.

1021
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,140
I know you're beautiful.

1022
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,940
What I mean is,

1023
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,120
people in business

1024
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,540
can be quite shrewd.

1025
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,060
You should get to know him better,

1026
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,181
right?

1027
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,239
You can't guarantee

1028
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,301
he'll only

1029
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,381
be good to you.

1030
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:32,421
Of course, I can't guarantee that.

1031
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,100
But think about it,

1032
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,781
I'm still young too.

1033
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,239
I can't guarantee

1034
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,040
that in a few years,

1035
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,221
I'll still

1036
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,901
love him either.

1037
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,040
Thank you, sir.

1038
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,421
Thank you.

1039
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,580
Was it successful?

1040
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,140
Yes.

1041
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:50,880
Calling you

1042
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:52,781
was the best decision.

1043
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,221
You're my lifesaver.

1044
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,301
Here's some bandages

1045
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,861
and iodine.

1046
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,901
Clean up your wound.

1047
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,261
You're so thoughtful.

1048
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:16,839
Do you need my help?

1049
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,861
I can't roll up my trousers now.

1050
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:22,060
Thanks.

1051
00:42:52,421 --> 00:42:53,232
You scared me!

1052
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,654
What are you doing?

1053
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:55,765
Scared you?

1054
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,133
You're back early today.

1055
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:58,194
Not asleep yet?

1056
00:42:58,353 --> 00:42:59,334
I wanted to ask you something.

1057
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:02,367
For the money in our joint account,

1058
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:03,747
