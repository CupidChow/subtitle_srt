=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 10=

4
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,167
(Xiang Zhong: 10 AM, I'll wait for you
at the Civil Affairs Bureau.)

5
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:44,237
(Xiang Zhong:
I'm going to wait 15 minutes.)

6
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:46,408
(If you don't come, I'm going
to get the lawyer to represent you.)

7
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,167
Any vegetables for you? It's fresh.

8
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,796
I've got everything.

9
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:26,997
Maybe a couple of melons?

10
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,007
Save the melons and eggs
for yourself.

11
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,248
You don't know what you're missing.

12
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:32,916
Sure.

13
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,756
Alright, I've got my stuff.

14
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,007
I can get that any day.

15
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:38,648
Mr. Xiang, you're here.

16
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:40,036
It's been a while.

17
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:41,157
The fish today are really fresh.

18
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:42,368
How much for the shrimp?

19
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:43,847
Got guests at home?

20
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,677
My daughters are back.

21
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:47,968
This is

22
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:49,607
my second daughter's favorite.

23
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:51,316
Come, give me 1.5 kilogram.

24
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,076
Sure.

25
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,237
You make me jealous.

26
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,648
Must be lively with so many kids.

27
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,423
It's my regret.
We should've had more children.

28
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:58,539
Xiang!

29
00:03:58,637 --> 00:03:59,327
Xiang!

30
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:04,277
Huh? What is it?

31
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,408
Come here.

32
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:09,808
How come your second daughter
got divorced?

33
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:11,768
What nonsense!

34
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:14,036
I ran into Qian this morning.

35
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,368
He told me.

36
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:16,157
His son

37
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:17,316
and your son-in-law

38
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:18,408
are pretty close, right?

39
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,047
You must be mistaken.

40
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:23,167
No.

41
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,356
Qian said

42
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,167
it's pretty much set in stone.

43
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:29,287
What...

44
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:34,036
Are you sure you heard it right?

45
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:34,957
I'm sure.

46
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,448
Qian Feng's dad said so.

47
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:40,208
Let me call Xiang Zhong and ask.

48
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,847
No, don't.

49
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,036
If she gets upset,

50
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,528
she might not come home today.

51
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:47,328
Then...

52
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:48,556
How about this?

53
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:50,287
We'll ask her face-to-face
when they're back.

54
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:52,676
Xiang Nan is coming home today.

55
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:53,877
It's a happy occasion.

56
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:54,888
Don't be asking that.

57
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:57,328
Grandpa, Grandma!

58
00:04:58,357 --> 00:04:59,487
- The kids are back.
- They're here.

59
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,247
Make sure

60
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,367
you don't say anything.

61
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:04,077
Okay.

62
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:04,768
Hurry up.

63
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,607
Grandpa, Grandma!

64
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:10,047
Yes, I heard you.

65
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:12,047
I heard you.

66
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,408
You guys are here.

67
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,317
Grandma, I need to pee.

68
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:16,476
I need to go to the bathroom.

69
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:17,487
First thing to do
is going to the bathroom?

70
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:18,397
That's always the case.

71
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,397
I'll put these inside.

72
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:20,847
Come, come.

73
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:21,847
Dad!

74
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,208
I'm home.

75
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:25,996
Mom.

76
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:26,687
Good, good.

77
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:27,807
I'm back.

78
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:28,877
Welcome back.

79
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:29,648
Qian.

80
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:30,768
Qian, Gao Ping.

81
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,356
Thanks for coming.

82
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:32,367
Where are the kiddos?

83
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:33,607
Bathroom.

84
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:34,528
They're in the bathroom.

85
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:35,796
Come.

86
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:37,888
Mr. Wang, you can leave them
on the table. Thanks.

87
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:38,717
Let me do it.

88
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:39,596
I specifically got someone

89
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:40,397
to buy this tea.

90
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:41,476
Hopefully you'll like it.

91
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:42,408
You guys keep buying stuff.

92
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:43,877
You brought so much stuff.

93
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:44,687
That's right.

94
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:45,157
Thanks.

95
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,556
Yours is too luxurious.

96
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:47,116
Don't waste it.

97
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,077
Gao Ping. Have tea with us.

98
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,367
I'll go and set the table.

99
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:50,116
Let me help you.

100
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,167
No, it's okay. I can do it.

101
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:53,116
Dad, if you like black tea,
you don't have to buy it.

102
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:53,957
I have plenty.

103
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:54,877
Your tea is too high-end.

104
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:56,317
I wouldn't want to waste it.

105
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:57,197
Wang, come.

106
00:05:57,198 --> 00:05:57,916
Have some tea.

107
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:58,397
I have to go.

108
00:05:58,398 --> 00:05:58,968
I'll pass.

109
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:00,957
Isn't Zhong back yet?

110
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,727
No.

111
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:02,436
Thanks.

112
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:03,927
Okay, see you.

113
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,208
Sit, Dad.

114
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,727
Grandpa, I want to water the plants.

115
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:09,596
Water the plants.
There, it's ready for you.

116
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:10,528
It's ready.

117
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:12,088
Don't water them too much.

118
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:13,356
Hey...

119
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:15,167
You're welcome to visit
if you like the liveliness.

120
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:16,528
If you'll have me.

121
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:19,287
Did you now buy the burclover?

122
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:21,157
I forgot.

123
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:21,676
What?

124
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:22,356
Burclover.

125
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:23,676
I'll go and buy it now.

126
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:24,916
- We forgot burclover.
- No burclover?

127
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,157
We'll go.

128
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,367
Let them go.

129
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,088
Okay.

130
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,157
Dad, we'll be right back.

131
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:30,927
We'll go.

132
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,036
You sample the tea, Hongbin.

133
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,247
Okay, you guys go ahead.

134
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:34,408
Okay.

135
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:38,197
Right, water the plants.

136
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:38,996
It's okay. I can do it.

137
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:40,487
Water the pot there too.

138
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:42,837
How are things

139
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:44,047
with your sister-in-law?

140
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:47,036
She went to Hainan after our wedding

141
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:48,408
and hasn't returned.

142
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,968
That's good.

143
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:51,607
Don't come back.

144
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,448
I mean, with her character,

145
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:54,916
imagine living with you
under one roof.

146
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,487
How will you two get along?

147
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:58,957
Her level?

148
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,356
I can handle her.

149
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,927
I'll trample on her if I have to.

150
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,517
Yes, I believe that.

151
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:07,116
But make sure you know your limits.

152
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:08,916
Don't put Jiang Hongbin
in a difficult position.

153
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,436
He's much older.

154
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,208
If he can't even handle this,

155
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,757
he should start over.

156
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,120
- What are you doing?
- I want ice cream.

157
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:18,328
Uncle Wu.

158
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:19,356
I'm going to take one.

159
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,328
You're back.

160
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:21,727
Uncle Wu.

161
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:23,287
Pay up, Qian.

162
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,877
You took a bite before paying.

163
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,287
Why are you two out here?

164
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:27,287
Zhong.

165
00:07:27,718 --> 00:07:28,408
Want one?

166
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:29,687
I don't eat cold stuff.

167
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,596
We're out to get that...

168
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:32,768
Get burclover.

169
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:33,916
Why don't you park your bike

170
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,047
and go with us?

171
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:37,637
Okay.

172
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:38,397
No point going home

173
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:39,607
when you two are not there.

174
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:46,487
Zhong, Qian.

175
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:48,528
Do you guys remember?

176
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:52,157
After we went swimming at Dad's factory,

177
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,448
we'd eat ice cream here.

178
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:54,637
We'd fight over this chair

179
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:56,047
and I'd always win.

180
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:58,607
That's because Qian
wouldn't let me beat you.

181
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:00,968
Troublemaker.

182
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,927
Nan, aren't you

183
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,116
going on a honeymoon?

184
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:10,167
When are you leaving?

185
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:11,448
Don't even mention it.

186
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:12,637
We've been planning

187
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,008
the honeymoon for so long.

188
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,236
But for the past few days,

189
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:16,957
he's on his phone the moment
he wakes up.

190
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:17,517
He's like

191
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:18,648
a moving office.

192
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:20,317
Wasn't he already like that

193
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:21,607
when you were dating him?

194
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,208
Still, you need to be persistent

195
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,727
about the honeymoon.

196
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:26,676
You two

197
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:27,757
need to spend quality time alone.

198
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,116
If you start compromising

199
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,397
right after getting married and say

200
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:31,077
no honeymoon is fine,

201
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,648
what if he's working during

202
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,637
future wedding anniversaries
and other occasions?

203
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:35,528
That won't do.

204
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,357
The process of marriage

205
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:38,556
is a continuous subtraction.

206
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,608
At last, you'll end up in the red.

207
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:43,687
You're depressing.

208
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:44,477
Zhong,

209
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:46,036
I barely got married,

210
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:46,916
and you're telling me

211
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:47,997
all about the negative stuff.

212
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,167
That's not good.

213
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:51,927
Do you guys remember?

214
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,287
It was at that alley.

215
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:56,167
There was a bunch of hooligans

216
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,567
and they were whistling at Zhong.

217
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:58,728
I remember.

218
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:00,728
Did that happen?

219
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,087
Yes.

220
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:05,648
It was your second year summer break.

221
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,316
Deng Haiyang was one of them.

222
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:07,916
I remember that

223
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,117
a boy from Shanghai

224
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,076
had hair this long.

225
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:11,167
That boy,

226
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,517
he wore his pants

227
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,287
halfway down his butt.

228
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:15,167
Right?

229
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:15,956
Every time I saw him,

230
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,397
I wished I could pull his pants up.

231
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:18,277
Yes!

232
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:20,117
And once, Deng Haiyang ran out

233
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:22,008
and spitted at that boy.

234
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:22,997
Really?

235
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:24,087
That's so childish.

236
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:25,728
Gross.

237
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,567
I asked Zhong at the time,

238
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:29,248
what kind of guys do you like?

239
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:30,956
She said she couldn't stand
childish guys.

240
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,608
She liked the boy from Shanghai.

241
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:33,956
You like the type

242
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,997
who wears their pants

243
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:36,728
showing half the butt?

244
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,277
I think Deng Haiyang

245
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,927
had fallen for Zhong then.

246
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,157
No way.

247
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,277
How old were we?

248
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,488
We were just kids.

249
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:45,277
Second year

250
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:46,687
is not clueless.

251
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:47,836
When I was in sixth grade,

252
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,157
a boy wrote me a love letter.

253
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:49,796
But Qian said

254
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,597
that boy was no good.

255
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,167
Because there were so many typos.

256
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:53,397
Even without the typos,

257
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:55,167
you shouldn't be in a relationship
in primary school.

258
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:56,567
Oh really?

259
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:00,687
Xiang Zhong.

260
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:02,796
How are you

261
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:04,047
and Deng Haiyang doing lately?

262
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,047
We got divorced.

263
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,128
What?

264
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,368
What do you mean?

265
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:10,807
You've done the paperwork?

266
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:13,087
The day before yesterday.

267
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:15,447
Wait,

268
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:18,167
Dad is going to be so pissed.

269
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:19,517
Let him be.

270
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,888
I'm used to it anyway.

271
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:24,287
Let's go get the vegetable.

272
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:26,608
Yes, the burclover.

273
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:31,207
Dad.

274
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,397
It feels really nice here.

275
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,287
Yes, it is.

276
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:36,997
But,

277
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:38,768
our time here is limited.

278
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:40,848
The old town is getting a face-lift.

279
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,648
I doubt we'd be able to keep the house.

280
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:43,848
I'm going to miss it.

281
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:46,047
It's okay. If it gets torn down,

282
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:47,076
I'll find you

283
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:47,916
a bigger house.

284
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:51,167
You'll get me a bigger house?
I'd probably be lost.

285
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,477
Living in a house is about the feelings.

286
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,556
If it does get demolished,

287
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:55,316
I've lived here

288
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:56,157
more than 30 years.

289
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,836
It does choke me up a little.

290
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,128
Dad, we're back.

291
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:01,408
Xiang Zhong is here.

292
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:02,207
Where's Haiyang?

293
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:04,528
He's away on business.

294
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:05,597
Another business trip?

295
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,927
Yes, he's quite busy.

296
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:09,488
What are you guys talking about?

297
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:11,040
- Xiang Nan.
- Nothing much.

298
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,848
Come sit down. Have tea.

299
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:13,888
Keep Hongbin company.

300
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:15,517
I'm going to cook.

301
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:17,207
Okay, I'm ready to eat.

302
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:18,008
Okay.

303
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,608
Xiang Zhong really got a divorce?

304
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:28,877
When Nan and I went out

305
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:29,716
to get burclove,

306
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,087
we bumped into her.

307
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:33,637
That's when we heard.

308
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:35,768
Isn't there a cooling period
to get a divorce nowadays?

309
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,768
So you guys already knew.

310
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:42,488
You gave me a fright.

311
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:43,888
Why didn't you tell me?

312
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,327
It's a serious matter.

313
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,848
I heard it from somebody else.

314
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:48,927
I can't believe it.

315
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:50,796
I told you before

316
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,277
about the divorce, didn't I?

317
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,008
I only had to finish the paperwork.

318
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:55,687
No matter what, Xiang Zhong,

319
00:11:56,398 --> 00:11:57,877
shouldn't you have informed me

320
00:11:57,878 --> 00:11:58,436
before

321
00:11:58,437 --> 00:11:59,648
you signed the papers?

322
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:01,287
What?

323
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:04,207
Did you have to sign it or stamp it?

324
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,728
Why must I tell you?

325
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:08,807
You're always like this.

326
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,316
You never think of others

327
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,488
before doing something, no?

328
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:12,436
I had considered

329
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:13,237
you guys' feelings,

330
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:14,117
that's why

331
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:16,036
I did the paperwork
after Xiang Nan's wedding.

332
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,207
Is that wrong?

333
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:17,997
Can we

334
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,248
not talk about that today?

335
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:21,716
It's Xiang Nan first time home
after wedding today.

336
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,757
Can we come together

337
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,117
and have a light-hearted meal?

338
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:26,517
That's what I'm here for,

339
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,128
but he's not letting me.

340
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:29,087
Who?

341
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:30,036
Why are you shouting?

342
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:30,757
What?

343
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:32,287
Is getting a divorce something shameful?

344
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,008
What if other people heard?

345
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:35,237
So what?

346
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:38,036
I'm telling you. With your attitude,
you'll never get along with anybody.

347
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,716
That's fine, I'm fine by myself.

348
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,716
What's the big deal?

349
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:41,397
Sure.

350
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:42,277
Go ahead and live

351
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:43,408
by your lonesome self.

352
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:47,008
Gosh, you people are too much.

353
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,047
Zhong.

354
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:07,807
What's happened?

355
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,888
Couldn't you have talked nicely?

356
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,567
You're the one who brought it up.

357
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:14,597
I told you,

358
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,608
don't talk about this matter today.

359
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,408
I asked Xiang Qian, not her.

360
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:21,436
So you still asked
and this is how it turned out.

361
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:22,757
Well, you shouldn't have
raised your voice.

362
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,757
You appeared and started questioning her.
What about that?

363
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:25,436
Did I raise my voice?

364
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,757
Aren't you now?

365
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,368
You think this is me raising my voice?

366
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:31,128
Xiang Zhong.

367
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:33,327
Xiang Zhong.

368
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:34,608
Xiang Zhong!

369
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:35,916
Come on.

370
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,648
You saw the way he spoke to me.

371
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,796
Yeah, I got a divorce.

372
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,488
Did he have to be so upset?

373
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:42,196
Yes, I know.

374
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,556
He's always looked down on me,

375
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,757
thinks I'm useless.

376
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,796
So am I supposed to find

377
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:46,556
an equally useless man

378
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,207
and spend a terrible life together?

379
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,117
I can assure you that that's not
what Dad thinks.

380
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:52,277
Two days ago,

381
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,008
Dad came all the way to Shanghai
to see me.

382
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:56,157
He asked me for an update about you.

383
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:57,877
We came to an agreement

384
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,196
that we should respect

385
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,076
Xiang Zhong's decision.

386
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:01,687
Respect Xiang Zhong's choice.

387
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,357
Although Dad didn't say anything,

388
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:03,956
you know him,

389
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:05,528
when he's agreeing to something,

390
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,567
he does this, right?

391
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:10,008
He respects you.

392
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,757
The reason he got angry just now
is because you did the paperwork

393
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:13,768
without telling him.

394
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:15,316
He heard it from an outsider.

395
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:16,728
That's why he's angry.

396
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:17,956
You know his temper.

397
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,207
Of course he'd be angry.

398
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:24,880
Xiang Nan just got married
and is home today.

399
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,488
Could we all have a meal together?

400
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:27,848
Okay?

401
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:29,528
Forget it.

402
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:30,517
With his attitude,

403
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:31,757
do you think we'll be able
to have a meal together?

404
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:32,327
No.

405
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:32,927
Hey!

406
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:34,517
Dad is all about his ego.

407
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:35,196
He'd never

408
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:36,436
bring that up at the dining table.

409
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:37,087
Xiang Zhong.

410
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:37,927
Xiang Zhong!

411
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:05,327
(I'm going to stay with Qian Feng
for the time being.)

412
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,967
(Once the cooling period is over,)

413
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:08,608
(I'll go back and get my things.)

414
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:10,248
(Also,)

415
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:11,676
(my mom got angry with me)

416
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,967
(and went on a trip to Xinjiang.)

417
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:15,047
(Keep this to yourself for now.)

418
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,927
(Let her enjoy the trip.)

419
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,128
(I will tell her myself.)

420
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:20,648
(Thanks.)

421
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:23,927
(Take care of yourself.)

422
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:52,877
I hope these little rings

423
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,728
will keep your lifelong vows

424
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,488
safe and secure.

425
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:59,848
Safekeep the love you share
in this lifetime.

426
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:06,608
Now, I'll represent the guests

427
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,528
and ask the groom a question.

428
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:09,967
Groom.

429
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:11,087
I don't know.

430
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:12,087
You know.

431
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:13,956
You must know.

432
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:14,687
Yes.

433
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:16,517
Where did you first confess

434
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,517
your feelings

435
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,008
to the bride?

436
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:21,327
Good one.

438
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:24,967
The Forbidden City.

439
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:26,648
Isn't it Nanjing?

440
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:28,087
It's Beijing.

441
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:29,237
Beijing.

442
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,167
You remembered wrong.

443
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,087

You haven't eaten, have you?

475
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:19,767
I brought you food.

476
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:20,996
Did you

477
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,196
have to come all the way?

478
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:23,128
Isn't it a hassle?

479
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:24,727
Come and eat.

480
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,687
I will eat.

481
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,568
If you won't eat it now,
I'll keep it in the fridge for you.

482
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,848
Eat it when you feel like it.

483
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:44,967
Xiang Zhong,

484
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:46,648
is your fridge

485
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,368
supposed to be a shop sample?

486
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,487
There's nothing inside.

487
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,328
How have you been surviving?

488
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,436
You know very well

489
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,967
that we don't cook in this house.

490
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:03,128
Okay.

491
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:04,877
Since you've decided to get a divorce,

492
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:05,808
so be it.

493
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:07,487
No need to think too much.

494
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:09,888
Just know that
this is a small neighborhood.

495
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,167
People are going to talk.

496
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:13,687
But don't take it to heart.

497
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:15,397
In through the left ear,

498
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:16,328
out through the right.

499
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,357
You know what they say.

500
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,196
If getting married was a mistake,

501
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:22,487
then getting divorced is a realization.

502
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:23,956
Mom,

503
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,808
since when were you so eloquent?

504
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,648
I'm not used to it.

505
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,007
I heard that from some TV show.

506
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,527
Who is it?

507
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:39,037
Who? I don't know.

508
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:39,848
Do I open it?

509
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,648
Who's there?

510
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,368
Open it.

511
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:46,077
Surprise, Zhong!

512
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:48,117
Mom? Why are you here?

513
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:48,956
What are you doing?

514
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:50,557
How come you didn't go back to Suzhou?

515
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:51,476
I wanted

516
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:52,797
to come have a chat with Zhong.

517
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:54,648
We didn't manage to talk much today.

518
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:56,837
I brought you bird's nest.

519
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:58,568
You need nourishment.

520
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:00,117
I'm not sick or anything.

521
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:01,368
Nourish what?

522
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:02,597
Don't say that.

523
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:04,077
Getting divorced is exhausting.

524
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,128
You need supplements.

525
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:09,637
Don't move.

526
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:10,487
Let's make a bet.

527
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:12,037
I'm guessing it's food delivery.

528
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,128
What say you?

529
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:15,568
Gosh.

530
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,996
Don't try to be cunning.

531
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:19,117
You must have ordered it,

532
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,956
of course you'd win the bet.

533
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,797
How did you know?

534
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:24,288
How did you know I ordered delivery?

535
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:26,608
Mom.

536
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:27,756
Qian.

537
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:29,397
Aren't you going back to Shanghai?

538
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:30,048
Wait a minute.

539
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:32,808
Why is everyone here?

540
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:35,557
I thought you were the deliveryman.

541
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,637
We were having a chat.

542
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,317
I ordered fried chicken and beer

543
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,247
and planned to drink
the night away with Zhong.

544
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,088
I didn't expect you two to come.

545
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,516
I see, and you didn't tell me.

546
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:46,557
You even got Mom to come,

547
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:47,117
but not me.

548
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:47,676
No.

549
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:49,288
Mom was here first.

550
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,608
You can't drink the night away
with just beer.

551
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,368
You always plan ahead, Qian.

552
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,073
Qian,

553
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:56,837
I also ordered hotpot.

554
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,232
It should be here soon.

555
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,743
I'm glad there's more people

556
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,234
so we can have a merry meal.

557
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:02,317
Okay.

558
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:03,236
What time is it?

559
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:04,157
What's okay about it?

560
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:06,808
Hotpot at this hour
is bad for digestion.

561
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:08,637
It's only 9 PM.

562
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:10,077
We're not going to sleep tonight.

563
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:11,236
We'll be up all night.

564
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:11,877
It's fine, Mom.

565
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:12,756
If you can't handle it,

566
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:14,117
you can sleep in the room.

567
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:14,927
We'll hang out.

568
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,357
I can handle it.

569
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,927
Can you, really?

570
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:19,117
I can handle it.

571
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:20,597
We'll be up till morning.

572
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:21,516
Sure.

573
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:23,676
You sure? My goodness.

574
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:24,157
Alright.

575
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,648
Let's pour the drinks then.

576
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:27,236
Let me see if I can

577
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:28,037
prepare anything else.

578
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,557
- You didn't change into slippers.
- Neither did I.

579
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,608
Wash your hands.
You two haven't washed your hands.

580
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,476
- Change your shoes.
- Never mind.

581
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:34,848
You already stepped inside.

582
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:35,557
I'll get you two

583
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:37,236
some comfortable clothes later.

584
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:38,207
Okay.

585
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:39,637
Let Mom stay.

586
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:41,048
I'll ask Dad to come later.

587
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:43,088
Does Dad know?

588
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:44,236
We'll have beer.

589
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,167
Mom, what are you drinking?

590
00:21:45,717 --> 00:21:46,888
I'm fine with anything.

591
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:47,877
Come on then.

592
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:49,597
I want white wine. Do you have it?

593
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:50,317
White wine?

594
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:51,408
Yes, I'll look for it.

595
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:53,727
Bring out the white wine.

596
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:55,797
Mom is the smartest.

597
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:57,007
Mom's the smartest.

598
00:21:58,237 --> 00:21:58,916
Your brain

599
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,397
seems to be working hard today.

600
00:22:00,398 --> 00:22:02,487
My brain works better
when your dad isn't around.

601
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,157
Mom, what are you drinking?

602
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,436
You can drink beer.

603
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:08,487
Is beer okay?

604
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:10,608
Is this beer?

605
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:12,568
Mom wants white wine.

606
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:15,247
- Let's have our first sip.
- Come on.

607
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:16,956
What are we celebrating?

608
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:18,007
Celebrate that Dad's not here.

609
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,328
He'll cry angry tears.

610
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:35,568
So tired.

611
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:36,767
You're back.

612
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,088
Did you have fun?

613
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:48,328
Jiaqiao.

614
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,007
Come over here.

615
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:51,487
I want to talk to you.

616
00:22:58,118 --> 00:22:58,888
I'll get it.

617
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,247
I know you're still upset with me.

618
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:10,207
I acted rashly that day.

619
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:13,368
I shouldn't have hit you.

620
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:17,247
So I'm apologizing to you.

621
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:19,527
There, there.

622
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,527
Don't be angry.

623
00:23:21,957 --> 00:23:23,487
That's the first time you hit me.

624
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:25,117
You hit me in front of so many people.

625
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:25,996
Okay, okay.

626
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:26,767
Don't be mad.

627
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:27,967
Sit.

628
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,967
You know what?

629
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,128
Getting married in that cheongsam

630
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:38,727
was Xiang Nan's
birth father's last wish.

631
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:41,967
What would you do if it were you?

632
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:44,808
Also,

633
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:46,328
I

634
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,648
am seriously about Xiang Nan.

635
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:52,088
I've been divorced for a while.

636
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:54,516
Shouldn't I

637
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,888
have my own family?

638
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:58,088
And you.

639
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,196
You should also think

640
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,568
about finding your own family.

641
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:03,117
You just think I'm a bother.

642
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:04,568
You want to have your married life.

643
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:06,487
You're not a bother, okay?

644
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,848
You're almost 35 years old.

645
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:11,368
You need to have
your own family in the future.

646
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:12,877
Someone has to look after you.

647
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:14,157
I don't want another family.

648
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:15,236
I don't want to get married.

649
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:16,767
This is my home!

650
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:17,956
I want to be your little sister

651
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:18,716
forever!

652
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:20,527
Why don't you get it?

653
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:22,117
I... even when I'm married,

654
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:23,727
you're still my little sister.

655
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:28,487
Jiaqiao,

656
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:30,848
my hope is that

657
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,328
you can find your own happiness.

658
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:34,276
Don't you wish the same for me?

659
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:36,397
Of course I do.

660
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:37,608
Then listen to me.

661
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,637
I

662
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:41,157
found an experienced tailor to make

663
00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:42,527
an exact copy of the cheongsam.

664
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:44,648
Hand it to Xiang Nan when it's ready,

665
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:46,288
and apologize to her personally.

666
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:50,687
Do I have to do that?

667
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:52,967
She can hate me if she wants to.

668
00:24:54,277 --> 00:24:56,648
You just said you want me to be happy.

669
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:58,247
Right?

670
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:01,527
So long as you live under this roof,

671
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:03,597
you'll need to learn to control

672
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:04,767
your temper.

673
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:07,167
Get along with Xiang Nan.

674
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:08,247
Got it?

675
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:09,328
Alright.

676
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:13,368
Do it for my sake.

677
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:15,727
Go and apologize to her.

678
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:45,368
Xiang Nan.

679
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,167
Come here.

680
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:48,196
Come here.

681
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:48,967
What is it?

682
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:50,007
Sit down.

683
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:51,357
I have something important

684
00:25:51,358 --> 00:25:52,328
to tell you.

685
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:53,727
Please sit.

686
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:54,956
Jiang Jiaqiao,

687
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:56,767
just say whatever it is you want to.

688
00:25:58,237 --> 00:25:59,128
Xiang Nan,

689
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:00,568
I'm sorry.

690
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,557
I didn't know that the cheongsam

691
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:10,276
meant so much

692
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,808
to you.

693
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:15,648
What's this? Compensation?

694
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:16,837
The wedding is already over.

695
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:18,288
What's the point of this?

696
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:19,808
I'm sorry.

697
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:26,877
Jiang Jiaqiao.

698
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:27,687
Ms. He.

699
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:30,447
Ms. He, quickly.

700
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:31,077
Coming.

701
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:32,648
- Come.
- We're all here.

702
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,837
You know Ms. He and Wang well,

703
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:36,167
so I won't introduce them.

704
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:37,487
This is Ms. Liu.

705
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:39,088
She's in charge of cleaning.

706
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:41,436
This is Ms. Li.

707
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:43,247
She's in charge of the kitchen.

708
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:44,527
And this is Qian.

709
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:46,727
He's Ms. Liu's husband.

710
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:49,276
He'll be taking care of the garden,

711
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:50,848
buying groceries and such.

712
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:52,196
If you need to go out

713
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:53,236
and get a hold of Wang,

714
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,927
you can ask Qian.

715
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,088
That's all.

716
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,288
Everyone,

717
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:02,196
I'll be in your care.

718
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,048
Thank you.

719
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:04,956
You're too courteous, Mrs. Jiang.

720
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:05,756
No, please.

721
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,848
Just call me Xiang Nan.

722
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:09,357
If

723
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:10,276
there's nothing else,

724
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,447
we'll get back to our work.

725
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:12,207
Okay.

726
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:12,808
Okay.

727
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:16,797
My brother

728
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:18,648
usually eats breakfast at home.

729
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:20,436
For lunch, if there are no plans
on the weekends,

730
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:21,608
he'll eat at home too.

731
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:23,397
If he doesn't have appoints at night,

732
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:24,927
he always comes home for dinner.

733
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:29,397
That means,

734
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,996
if he's going to eat at home,

735
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,597
it's best that you find time
to accompany him.

736
00:27:32,598 --> 00:27:33,637
Because he really dislikes

737
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:34,927
eating alone.

738
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:36,288
Got it.

739
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:38,368
Is there anything else?

740
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:39,527
I'm going out.

741
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:43,317
Xiang Nan,

742
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:44,687
what else do you want?

743
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:47,247
I'm already showing you courtesy.

744
00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:49,236
Don't misunderstand though.

745
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:50,727
I'm not trying to reconcile with you.

746
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:52,648
I'm just doing this for my brother.

747
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:53,727
So am I.

748
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,157
You can do whatever you want

749
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:57,167
with this cheongsam.

750
00:27:57,398 --> 00:27:58,288
I'm not taking it.

751
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:27,608
Aunty.

752
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:28,727
What's up?

753
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:30,767
It's nothing.

754
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:32,328
I just thought of you.

755
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:35,888
You can tell me if there's something.

756
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:38,996
I heard from Yu that you spent 5,500

757
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:40,207
to hire a nanny.

758
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:46,797
What's the matter?

759
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:47,888
Why are you asking that?

760
00:28:48,638 --> 00:28:49,877
I just don't understand why

761
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:50,927
you're spending needlessly.

762
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:52,447
I'm sitting idle at home.

763
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,167
Why don't I go
and look after the kids for you?

764
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,436
Cleaning, cooking,

765
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:56,527
I can do it all.

766
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,247
Well...

767
00:28:58,677 --> 00:28:59,877
I shouldn't take advantage

768
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:01,487
and ask you to work for me.

769
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:03,368
If you feel bad,

770
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:05,088
you can pay me a salary.

771
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,328
The point is that the current nanny

772
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:08,756
is doing a good job.

773
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:10,077
And it's not good if I were to fire her

774
00:29:10,078 --> 00:29:12,007
without a valid reason.

775
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:14,767
Gao Ping.

776
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,637
I'm in a pickle right now.

777
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,687
Think of it as doing me a favor.

778
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,916
You know the situation

779
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,167
your cousin is in right now.

780
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,037
How about this, Aunty.

781
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:26,637
Give me a bit of time.

782
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:28,487
Let me speak to Xiang Qian first.

783
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,207
I'll let you know, okay?

784
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:33,007
Okay, I'll be waiting.

785
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,368
Okay, see you, Aunty.

786
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:42,967
Ms. Zhang.

787
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:46,956
Yes?

788
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:47,527
I

789
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:48,927
am changing the bed sheets.

790
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:52,967
Next time,

791
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,687
if I or Xiang Qian is on the phone,
we'd appreciate it if you stepped away.

792
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:00,877
Oh, I'm sorry.

793
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:03,568
I'll take note next time.

794
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:34,837
I'm back!

795
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:36,048
Mom.

796
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,797
Mom, you're back.

797
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:39,597
Yes, I am.

798
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:40,767
Long day?

799
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:42,088
Ms. Zhang.

800
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:44,516
Can you be more careful

801
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:45,317
when you're working?

802
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:46,888
You spilled water on my paper.

803
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:48,368
I can't use them now.

804
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:51,207
I...

805
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:53,247
I didn't notice.

806
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:54,648
I'm sorry.

807
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,117
Next time, don't touch the things
on my table, okay?

808
00:30:57,118 --> 00:30:57,967
I'll tidy it myself.

809
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:00,527
Noted.

810
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:03,408
She's becoming lax.

811
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:07,648
What did you say?

812
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:09,797
She's becoming lax in her work.

813
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:11,037
Look what she did.

814
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,368
Half a month of work, wasted.

815
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:15,007
Okay, don't be angry.

816
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:18,207
Ms. Zhang is quite good at her work.

817
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:19,916
I'll talk to her later.

818
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:20,637
I'll ask

819
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:21,848
if there's any problem lately.

820
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:24,128
No matter what,
it doesn't excuse what she did.

821
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:25,727
She just wasted my time.

822
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:28,357
Dad, I want to play with the tent.

823
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:31,247
Me too, Dad.

824
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,608
Daddy is working right now.

825
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:36,128
Mommy will play with you!

826
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:40,568
I've got you!

827
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:42,916
You're locked up.

828
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:44,568
Say the chant, the chant.

829
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:47,317
You're back, madam.

830
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:48,088
Ms. He.

831
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:50,328
Here are your slippers.

832
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:51,527
Thanks.

833
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,648
Mr. Jiang is waiting for you to eat.

834
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:55,808
Where is he?

835
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:56,848
In the dining room.

836
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:00,527
Okay, I'll go see him now.

837
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:07,157
Why didn't you start eating earlier?

838
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,207
This is no good.

839
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:12,848
Why aren't you eating?

840
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,077
I had food delivery

841
00:32:15,078 --> 00:32:16,288
in the office.

842
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:19,516
Why didn't you tell me

843
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:20,648
you already ate?

844
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:21,956
I texted you and told you

845
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:23,207
to eat first, right?

846
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:25,357
But you didn't tell me

847
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,767
you ordered food delivery.

848
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:27,916
Why would I

849
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:28,848
have waited so long then?

850
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:31,648
I'm sorry.

851
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:34,247
I'll be sure to make it clear next time.

852
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:47,368
Ms. He.

853
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:49,608
Mr. Jiang.

854
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:50,767
Clear the table.

855
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:53,037
Why?

856
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,117
You only had a bite.

857
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:54,808
It's okay.

858
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:56,247
I don't have much appetite anyway.

859
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:57,328
Clear them away.

860
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:58,568
No, don't.

861
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:01,117
Ms. He, is there more soup?

862
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:02,128
Pour one for me.

863
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:03,357
Yes, I'll get it.

864
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,088
Thanks.

865
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,048
It's okay, Xiang Nan.

866
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:09,196
No need to force yourself

867
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:10,527
since you've eaten.

868
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:12,476
I suddenly feel like supper,

869
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:13,408
is that okay?

870
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,247
Can I eat?

871
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:17,967
Yes?

872
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:19,516
Okay.

873
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:20,207
Ma'am,

874
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:21,328
here's the soup.

875
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:22,487
Okay, thanks.

876
00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:26,687
I just realized.

877
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:28,597
You married me

878
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:29,276
because

879
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:30,648
you wanted me to eat with you.

880
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:32,128
Did you just realize?

881
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:36,476
You should've married
a talented chef then.

882
00:33:36,477 --> 00:33:37,476
She can eat with you

883
00:33:37,477 --> 00:33:38,888
and cook you delicious food.

884
00:33:40,358 --> 00:33:41,527
A chef?

885
00:33:41,838 --> 00:33:43,408
They're probably not as pretty as you.

886
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:44,436
Probably?

887
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:45,527
Who's actually prettier than me?

888
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:47,128
Just kidding.

889
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:49,288
Xiang Nan.

890
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,207
Next time...

891
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:53,117
Next time,
if you're able to eat at home,

892
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,568
you should try your best to do so.

893
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:56,288
We're now family.

894
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,007
We should live like one.

895
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:03,007
Anyway, I want to tell you something.

896
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:04,317
The little gifts

897
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:05,568
you gave away on our wedding,

898
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:06,888
the guests loved them.

899
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:07,716
Xu Weiwei

900
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,088
thinks you have great tastes.

901
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:10,927
She's like to get to know you.

902
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,048
Who's Xu Weiwei?

903
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:14,768
Biao's wife.

904
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:17,047
And who's Biao?

905
00:34:18,478 --> 00:34:20,408
A business partner of mine.

906
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:22,888
He contributed a lot in terms of funding.

907
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:25,688
You can say he's a major investor.

908
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:29,208
So what you mean is,

909
00:34:29,638 --> 00:34:31,688
as your wife,

910
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,236
I should make an effort

911
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,927
to impress your investor's wife.

912
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:35,808
Am I right?

913
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:36,768
Smart.

914
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,276
But Jiang,

915
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,888
I've never interacted with such people.

916
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:42,557
I don't know

917
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:43,848
how I should act around them.

918
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:46,087
It's okay.

919
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,408
When the time comes,

920
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:49,236
I'll ask Jiaqiao to go with you.

921
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:50,236
Whatever you're unsure of,

922
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:51,248
you can ask her.

923
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,007
If Jiaqiao is with me...

924
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:56,927
Okay, it's settled then.

925
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:00,888
Here's an abalone for your effort.

926
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:01,848
Okay?

927
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:03,236
What?

928
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:04,437
Are you trying

929
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,248
to plump me up?

930
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:06,917
Plumpness brings luck.

931
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:07,756
Is that so?

932
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:08,597
How come

933
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:09,848
you're always working out then?

934
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:12,888
I work out to stay healthy.

935
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,408
It's so that I can
always be here for you.

936
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,288
Such a smooth talker.

937
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:19,196
No sincerity at all.

938
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:20,208
Eat up.

939
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:31,808
Thanks.

940
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:18,087
(Deng Haiyang: Aren't we
in a cooling period?)

941
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:20,368
(You sure removed your ring quickly.)

942
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:31,520
(Xiang Zhong: You should remove it too.)

943
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:46,328
Haiyang.

944
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:07,408
I've got a text.

945
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,688
Xiang Qian said

946
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,796
Gao Ping has to meet with a teacher.

947
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:13,836
The kids have art lesson.

948
00:37:13,837 --> 00:37:15,328
So they're not coming today.

949
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:17,927
And Xiang Nan?

950
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,236
Xiang Nan said,

951
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,408
I'm busy. I can't go back.

952
00:37:23,998 --> 00:37:25,967
Xiang Zhong also said she's busy.

953
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:27,888
Forget it then.

954
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:32,888
What should I eat then?

955
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:37,408
Gosh.

956
00:37:46,317 --> 00:37:47,647
Don't cook if you don't want to.

957
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:50,408
No need to take it out
on the cutting board.

958
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,117
I'll order food delivery.

959
00:37:52,118 --> 00:37:53,037
What do you want?

960
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:53,927
I have no appetite.

961
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:03,408
One vanilla ice cream.

962
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:08,168
Duck leg.

963
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:11,927
You're not ordering for me?

964
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:13,477
You said you're not eating.

965
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:14,087
I...

966
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:15,356
Since when did you

967
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:16,597
start listening to me?

968
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:17,957
Now you choose to listen?

969
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:18,676
I said I'm not eating

970
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:19,756
so you're not ordering?

971
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:20,876
Look at you.

972
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:22,168
I'm ordering for you.

973
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:23,208
What did you get?

974
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:24,037
Duck leg?

975
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,248
I ordered two portions. The duck leg.

976
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,808
And also ice cream.

977
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:30,688
So I get an ice cream
after eating the duck leg?

978
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,117
Are you trying to kill me?

979
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:33,728
You don't have to eat it together.

980
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:37,888
I want boiled fish.

981
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:42,796
Boiled fish.

982
00:38:42,797 --> 00:38:43,967
Hang on.

983
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:45,276
Boiled fish.

984
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:46,248
That's my request.

985
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:47,917
Okay, order sent.

986
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:48,527
Okay.

987
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:52,236
Jiang,

988
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:53,728
I'm going to wear this outfit.

989
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:55,208
I think it's quite nice.

990
00:38:56,357 --> 00:38:57,408
Not that one.

991
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:58,688
Here.

992
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:00,768
Check this out.

993
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:02,888
I picked it for you.

994
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:03,997
What?

995
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:05,007
What's up with the flowers?

996
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:06,356
Flowers bloom for prosperity?

997
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:07,527
This is more formal.

998
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:08,196
There.

999
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:09,477
It's giving me

1000
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:11,356
ornamental vase vibe.

1001
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:12,888
The blue and white porcelain kind.

1002
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:15,408
Here.

1003
00:39:16,598 --> 00:39:17,437
Pick a bracelet.

1004
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,368
Which one do you want?

1005
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,288
They're so bulky.

1006
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:23,597
Can I eliminate these two?

1007
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:25,037
They feel quite heavy.

1008
00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:26,437
I won't be able to lift my hand.

1009
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:27,316
No thanks.

1010
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:29,487
You have to wear one
to go with the dress.

1011
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:31,688
Do I really have to go?

1012
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:33,356
Of course you do.

1013
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:34,557
I want you to

1014
00:39:34,558 --> 00:39:36,248
get to know my friends  slowly.

1015
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:38,328
Come, pick one.

1016
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:40,356
I will go,

1017
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:42,127
but I'm not wearing
the gigantic gold chain.

1018
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:42,756
Okay.

1019
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,047
Don't wear it.

1020
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:46,396
I'm not feeling this dress either.

1021
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:46,917
No, no.

1022
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,647
You have to wear a gown.

1023
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:49,796
After all,

1024
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:51,047
we're attending a formal event.

1025
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,957
Alright, Miss Xiang Nan.

1026
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,047
You can't run from it.

1027
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:57,047
You'll have to be involved

1028
00:39:57,118 --> 00:39:58,647
in the wifes' social networking.

1029
00:39:58,717 --> 00:39:59,567
Okay?

1030
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,127
Be good. Get changed.

1031
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:05,007
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1032
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,848
What a big screen.

1033
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,567
Which one do you like?

1034
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:22,396
None of it.

1035
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:23,356
None of it?

1036
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:24,647
Have some fruits.

1037
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:27,248
Mrs. Gao.

1038
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:34,607
What is it?

1039
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:36,927
I...

1040
00:40:37,598 --> 00:40:39,087
Can I ask you

1041
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:41,647
for an advance on my payments?

1042
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:43,728
Is there a problem?

1043
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:46,967
Our family home is falling apart.

1044
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:48,487
We want to refurbish it.

1045
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:53,368
How many months of advance?

1046
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:57,487
Six months.

1047
00:40:57,918 --> 00:40:59,248
Is half a year okay?

1048
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:05,117
It's doable if the money

1049
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,447
is for the house.

1050
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:08,876
Is your husband

1051
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:10,168
addicted to gambling?

1052
00:41:15,998 --> 00:41:17,716
He keeps calling me.

1053
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:19,368
I have no other choice.

1054
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:21,836
This won't do.

1055
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:22,957
It's a bottomless pit.

1056
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,368
He'll keep asking for more.

1057
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,967
Next time he calls you again,

1058
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:28,607
pass it to me.

1059
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:29,808
I'll bluff him a little.

1060
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:31,967
Really?

1061
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:33,487
Carry on.

1062
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,527
Thank you.

1063
00:41:48,078 --> 00:41:48,848
All good.

1064
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,087
Aunty.

1065
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:07,127
Listen.

1066
00:42:07,478 --> 00:42:09,157
I'll text you the list of things

1067
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:10,607
Xiang Qian likes to eat.

1068
00:42:10,717 --> 00:42:11,836
You can make some

1069
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:12,808
and send it over.

1070
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:13,957
Oh, right.

1071
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,356
Separate the spicy

1072
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:17,248
and non-spicy stuff, okay?

1073
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:19,848
Alright.

1074
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:46,917
You socialites

1075
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:48,527
never seem to be punctual.

1076
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:51,716
Who do think Miss Weiwei is?

1077
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:53,127
This is her home ground.

1078
00:42:56,038 --> 00:42:57,168
Miss Weiwei.

1079
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:00,967
Quick.

1080
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:03,208
