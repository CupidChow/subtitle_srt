00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 6=

4
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:41,238
The head office plans
to promote talents from the front end

5
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:43,557
and I recommended you.

6
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:44,958
Me?

7
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:49,347
Boss, I'll have to go to Shenzhen
after getting promoted.

8
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:49,907
Gosh,

9
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:51,106
I have a family.

10
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:53,277
It's not that easy
for me to relocate.

11
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,518
I know it's not easy,

12
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:57,717
that is why you have to plan ahead.

13
00:01:58,348 --> 00:01:59,746
Isn't Gao Ping

14
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:01,438
graduating with a PhD this year?

15
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,586
The timing is just right.

16
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:04,717
He can search for a job
in Guangdong Province first.

17
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:07,827
He wants to stay at the institute

18
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,238
to continue his research.

19
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,878
Besides, the chances are quite high now.

20
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,906
You can't

21
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:17,786
prioritise him in everything.

22
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,798
You have to think for yourself.

23
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:23,198
Even if I don't think on his behalf,

24
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,678
I have

25
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:26,947
another two younger siblings
and three elders at home.

26
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:28,317
I have to think for them, too.

27
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,157
It's not like your family

28
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,238
won't function without you, right?

29
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,798
That is in fact, true.

30
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:45,198
Xiang Qian, you think about it again.

31
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:46,827
The age of 35

32
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,997
is the glass ceiling
for women in the workplace.

33
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,758
If you don't get promoted this time,

34
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,678
you might not get another opportunity.

35
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,398
Gender discrimination in the workplace
is prohibited.

36
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:58,758
Am I wrong?

37
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,157
No, you do have a point.

38
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,238
I will think about it carefully.

39
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,638
Let me remind you,

40
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,157
this is such a good opportunity,

41
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,638
you might not have
this kind of opportunity after this.

42
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:09,437
I know.

43
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:10,997
Bye, see you tomorrow, Boss.

44
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,667
Everyone says this,

45
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:20,518
that getting married and falling in love
are two different things.

46
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:21,387
How could I know

47
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:23,238
that Deng Haiyang
would change so fast?

48
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,918
After getting married,

49
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:28,358
he figured his friends
are more important than me

50
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,317
He refused to listen to anything I said.

51
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:32,306
As soon as he gets off work,

52
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:34,997
he follows them to go drinking,
have skewers, and head to karaoke.

53
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,480
I can't even locate him sometimes.

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,157
Even at home, he just lies down
and do nothing.

55
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:40,906
He's either lying on the sofa, or lying
in the room playing on the phone.

56
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:42,478
We don't communicate at all.

57
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,877
Besides, you know his mother,

58
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,458
she always makes a scene
with unreasonable arguments

59
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,678
and is hard to reason with.

60
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,918
She just despises me.

61
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,387
Every time she argues with me,

62
00:03:58,388 --> 00:03:59,466
Deng Haiyang would keep silent

63
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,758
and not say a word.

64
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,066
He's just spending his days

65
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,157
like a pile of dirt.

66
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,478
I really think I can no longer

67
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,238
live this life.

68
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:22,067
As soon as I was born,

69
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:23,998
I was abandoned in the countryside.

70
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:26,998
At that time, I felt

71
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:29,917
loneliness in my days,

72
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:34,837
no one wanted to talk to me.

73
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,398
I kept wishing

74
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,078
that my parents would come
pick me up,

75
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:48,638
but I was wrong.

76
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,917
When I met Deng Haiyang after that,

77
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,717
I thought

78
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,318
he was nice to me

79
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,638
so I wanted to
live a good life with him.

80
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:12,597
How nice is it when someone

81
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,078
treats and protects

82
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:17,078
you well.

83
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,157
However, I was wrong again.

84
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,037
So,

85
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:32,106
Sis, I really...

86
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:33,277
I think

87
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:36,717
happiness and sense of security

88
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:39,477
can't be given by others at all.

89
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:42,118
I can only provide those to myself.

90
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:05,998
Sis, you're here?

91
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:08,597
It's good that you're here.

92
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,318
Please help me

93
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,187
talk to Xiang Zhong.

94
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:15,187
She keeps wanting a divorce lately.

95
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,426
Divorce, divorce, divorce,

96
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,546
stop saying that.

97
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,958
It's very childish, you know?

98
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:22,797
With your behaviour like this,

99
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:24,958
what is she waiting for
if not a divorce?

100
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:28,466
You must know
that among all my friends around me,

101
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:31,758
none of them are divorced.

102
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,666
If I'm the only one
who gets divorced,

103
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,267
I will be so embarrassed.

104
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,226
So embarrassed, you know?

105
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,438
So embarrassed.

106
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:40,477
Did you get married for others to see?

107
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:41,837
That's not it.

108
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:46,198
The thing is, today is my closest friend...

109
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:47,958
My closest friend's

110
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:50,597
birthday, his wife is coming.

111
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,118
Skinny's wife, she's coming, too.

112
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:57,277
Everyone's wife, all humans' wives,
will be there.

113
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,867
Yet, when I told Xiang Zhong to go,

114
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:00,680
she kept refusing.

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,947
Deng Haiyang, you're drunk.
Can you please stop talking nonsense?

116
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,318
I'm not talking nonsense.

117
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,677
Isn't that the truth?

118
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:07,638
Anyway, I am

119
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,518
never getting a divorce.

120
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:12,878
I'm leaving.

121
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:15,597
Leaving.

122
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,878
Can't you close the door
when you're using the toilet?

123
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:21,878
I closed it.

124
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,346
Just close it.

125
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:24,398
It's closed.

126
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:27,507
You just keep nagging.

127
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:29,187
Can't you just come here
and close it for me?

128
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:30,318
Shut up.

129
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,157
You just won't close it. Sis?

130
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:38,477
Sis...

131
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,586
Sis, see?

132
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,827
Can you see what is happening here?

133
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:46,226
This is the frustration of life.

134
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:47,917
Life is exhausting.

135
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:50,518
When I am home,

136
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:53,518
it's like...

137
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:56,078
When I ask her to close the door,

138
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:58,318
no one would close it for me.

139
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,786
I am not even qualified to get someone
to close the door for me.

140
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:02,837
At the end of the day...

141
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:04,797
At the end of the day,
what does this mean?

142
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,958
I just feel humiliated.

143
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:10,226
It's difficult, you know?

144
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:11,878
Life is just too exhausting.

145
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:14,438
It's foggy.

146
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:20,398
Like that.

147
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,277
Zhong,

148
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,597
you always talk about
how our parents

149
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,238
left you in the countryside
when you were a child.

150
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:41,197
I have to tell you

151
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,638
that it's not because of them,

152
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,277
it's because of the government policy.

153
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,426
As I listened to you today,

154
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,478
I can understand how you feel.

155
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:55,598
When you were in the phase

156
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,077
where you need our parents

157
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,598
to be focused on you
and take care of you,

158
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,598
they did not stay with you.

159
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:04,398
When you returned home,

160
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,026
they probably paid too much attention

161
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,638
to things that they shouldn't
pay attention to,

162
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,277
and that made you very uncomfortable.

163
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:12,467
Therefore, in your marriage,

164
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,277
you needed Deng Haiyang
to be focused on you.

165
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,906
I'll refer a lawyer to you later.

166
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,718
You should get a consultation.
I have to go.

167
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:23,917
Sister, slow down.

168
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,998
Xiang Qian?

169
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:14,118
(Chai Jin: If you go to Shenzhen,
there will be greater prospects.)

170
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,317
(I suggest you discuss this
with Gao Ping and hope he understands.)

171
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,627
(Institute of Molecular Biology)
(Professor's Office)

172
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:39,557
You may come in.

173
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:42,638
Prof. Yang,

174
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,077
sorry to bother you.

175
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:45,946
I have sorted out

176
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,227
the materials you requested for you.

177
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:49,186
I have also highlighted areas

178
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:50,467
that are more important to you

179
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:51,426
with a coloured marker.

180
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:52,518
Please take a look.

181
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:55,906
You are the best,

182
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,598
you are always so meticulous.

183
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,838
Thank you, Prof. Yang.

184
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,677
Prof. Yang,

185
00:11:03,348 --> 00:11:05,546
when is the trial lecture

186
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:07,440
for those staying in the institute
roughly scheduled?

187
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,957
I'd like to prepare in advance.

188
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,118
Soon.

189
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:11,747
Alright.

190
00:11:11,748 --> 00:11:12,718
Don't get impatient.

191
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,878
How is the preparation of your paper?

192
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:20,186
It'll be done soon.

193
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,398
I just need to finalize the ending.

194
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:23,437
Write it well.

195
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:24,747
As far as I know,

196
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:25,987
there are several professors here

197
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:28,398
who are having very high expectations
for your paper.

198
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:29,797
I think

199
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,718
everyone thinks the same as I do.

200
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:33,838
In the end, who can stay
in the institute

201
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,998
ultimately depends on research ability.

202
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:38,998
I understand.

203
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:40,718
Thank you, Prof. Yang.

204
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:42,347
Please resume working.

205
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:43,317
I'm leaving now.

206
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,917
Thank you, Prof. Yang.

207
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,826
(Dad: Look at Haiyang.)

208
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:10,718
Zhong.

209
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,557
Xiang Zhong, you...

210
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,546
Don't get disappointed in me, alright?

211
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,878
I really...

212
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,706
Everything you said,

213
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:22,998
I will change them all.

214
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:40,957
How are you? Does your waist still hurt?

215
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,998
I'm fine. It still hurts a little.

216
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:45,747
Give me that.

217
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,197
It's fine, I can carry it myself.

218
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,598
Stop bringing him to drink all the time.
You should cut on drinking, too.

219
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,998
You don't cook,

220
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,786
do you just let him eat outside food?

221
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:55,878
Why would I cook for him?

222
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:58,638
People tell the truth after drinking.

223
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,197
Couldn't you see?

224
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,358
He

225
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,437
clearly still has feelings for you.

226
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:06,066
He always says he'll change,

227
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,917
but he's still the same after so long.

228
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:09,706
Can't you just

229
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,238
give him another chance?

230
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:13,718
I've engaged a lawyer.

231
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,557
If he doesn't agree to divorce, I will sue.

232
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,118
Who asked you to find a lawyer?

233
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:20,557
Why can't I find a lawyer?

234
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:23,186
Xiang Zhong, do you have to
make everyone uncomfortable

235
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,786
because of this matter?

236
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,557
Why? Would it embarrass you
if we get divorced?

237
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,587
Fine. No one would be embarrassed
if you get divorced.

238
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:29,518
Happy?

239
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,238
Where are you going?

240
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:37,518
Where are you going?

241
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:38,398
Get the divorce.

242
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:39,718
You...

243
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:43,037
The younger generation
has its own mindset. Don't stop them.

244
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:44,147
They can't go on any longer,

245
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,598
it's no good to keep arguing all day,

246
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:46,957
it's awkward and pointless, right?

247
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,520
(Xiang Zhong: Come home
for dinner tonight.)

248
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:23,518
(Deng Haiyang: I want soup.)

249
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:17,677
What are you doing?

250
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:21,358
I just took a shower.

251
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,398
Deng Haiyang, you are thinking too much.

252
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,077
You are thinking too much.

253
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:46,037
This is not important.

254
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,507
The reason I asked you to come back

255
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:48,426
is because I want you

256
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:49,758
to stop pestering my parents.

257
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,467
You have hands and feet.

258
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:52,906
Don't you know how to order takeouts?

259
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:55,227
Aren't you always drinking and having skewers
with Qian Feng and the others?

260
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,306
Why do you have to pester my parents?

261
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,518
No, did you forget

262
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,867
our secret code?

263
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,267
When we mention soup,

264
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:05,107
it means an invitation

265
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:06,677
to...

266
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:07,507
Stop it.

267
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,598
Deng Haiyang, that is no longer relevant.

268
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,227
No, why? It is very important.

269
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:13,306
How is this not important?
It is too important.

270
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,437
There isn't anyone around...

271
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:19,157
Wait, what do you mean?

272
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,107
What do you mean?

273
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,917
If you think it's important,
find someone else.

274
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:25,706
You are just refusing to let it go, right?

275
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:27,826
Aren't you good
at chatting people up online?

276
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:28,587
Go ahead.

277
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,878
Find someone else to chat.

278
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:31,957
If you keep doing this,

279
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:33,277
I will go out.

280
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,186
Go ahead.

281
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,507
No one is stopping you, go.

282
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:37,398
I'll go.

283
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:12,477
You're home.

284
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:14,957
Why aren't you asleep?

285
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:17,638
You're still reading?

286
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:18,878
I was waiting for you.

287
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,917
Waiting for me?

288
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,638
Is there something important?

289
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,358
Chai Jin called me.

290
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,838
Why didn't you mention
the promotion to me?

291
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,318
That's because

292
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:44,078
I haven't thought about it yet,

293
00:17:44,348 --> 00:17:45,917
so I didn't tell you.

294
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:48,717
What is your concern?

295
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,318
There are plenty.

296
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:55,997
Our parents are getting old,

297
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,558
Aunty is also getting old,

298
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,757
Xiang Zhong is getting a divorce,

299
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,558
and Xiang Nan is getting married.

300
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,358
Besides, you're planning to stay
with the institute.

301
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,027
Well, if

302
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:10,706
your concern is your parents
and your two sisters,

303
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:12,598
then I have nothing to say.

304
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,358
However, if you are concerned about me,

305
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,798
I don't think that is necessary.

306
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:22,038
How could I not?

307
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:25,118
If my planning to stay with the institute

308
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,318
affects your promotion,

309
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:30,558
what would your parents think?

310
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:33,237
How am I supposed
to conduct myself in the future?

311
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,757
Won't I be the most selfish person

312
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:38,757
holding you back in everyone's eyes?

313
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:43,118
Why do you want to
care about what others think?

314
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:43,666
Right?

315
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:47,237
This is about the two of us,
as long as we both discuss it, it's fine.

316
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:48,598
People

317
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,118
are bound to follow conventions.

318
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,677
I think I mind a lot.

319
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:58,878
But your life plan

320
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:03,278
is to stay with the institute in Shanghai.

321
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:03,906
You're right,

322
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:08,157
but my life plan also
has you and our children.

323
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:15,197
So, you're saying

324
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:18,838
I don't want you to give up staying
with the institute because of me,

325
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:22,717
you also don't want me to give
up the promotion because of me.

326
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:26,278
Then, the two of us
should discuss it properly

327
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:28,717
to see if there is any other solution.

328
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:31,398
There's no need to discuss,

329
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,757
just listen to me.

330
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:35,598
This is a rare opportunity for you.

331
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:37,387
We don't know when you will get

332
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,278
another opportunity like this.

333
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,038
Since it is here,

334
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,237
you should just grab it.

335
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,517
Xiang Nan

336
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:48,997
is about to start a family, right?

337
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:51,318
She can take care of your parents,

338
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:52,997
she can share so much of your stress.

339
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,278
You should do what you want to do.

340
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:01,318
If I really move to Shenzhen,

341
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:04,347
what about your job?

342
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:06,398
Are we going to be separated?

343
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:08,878
No,

344
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,358
I'll go with you.

345
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:31,878
What's wrong?

346
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:38,157
Why did you call Gao Ping?

347
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:41,997
How was the talk?

348
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:44,147
What do you mean?

349
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,717
Why did you call him?

350
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,038
Since you couldn't make a decision,

351
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:52,717
I had to make the decision for you.

352
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,147
You are not helping me make a decision,

353
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:58,237
you are forcing him to make a decision.

354
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,906
How could he say no to you
when you called him up like that?

355
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:02,587
If he really wants
to stay with the institute,

356
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,437
why couldn't he say no?

357
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:11,677
Chai Jin,

358
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:14,358
you are my master

359
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,038
who brought me into the industry.

360
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:19,398
We have been working together
for so many years, you are my best friend, too.

361
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,186
However,

362
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:24,798
shouldn't friends
have some boundaries, too?

363
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:28,466
I don't need others
to make decisions for me,

364
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,878
I can think through issues myself.

365
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:39,957
Xiang Qian,

366
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:41,787
I admit,

367
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:42,838
I...

368
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:44,957
I do care a little bit too much,

369
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:46,917
but like you said,

370
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:49,838
as your master and good friend,

371
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:53,917
I just think you should think more

372
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:57,558
for your children and your parents.

373
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:58,867
Let's not talk about

374
00:21:58,868 --> 00:21:59,787
your marriage first,

375
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:01,677
and of course, I'm not qualified
to discuss it too,

376
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:03,757
but let's talk about money.

377
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:07,038
Gao Ping can't support the family, right?

378
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:09,560
However, after you went with him,
you wanted children, right?

379
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,358
Say one less, and say two more,

380
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,197
How much do you think
the education and upbringing costs

381
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:15,917
for these three or four kids,
plus the expenses

382
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:17,840
for three elderly people
amount to in a year?

383
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:20,517
You must have calculated this
in your mind, right?

384
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:23,347
Even if Xiang Nan marries Jiang Hongbin,

385
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,506
you can't take Jiang Hongbin's money

386
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:28,038
to take care of the elderly, right?

387
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,547
Even if Gao Ping stays
with the institute,

388
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:34,838
his salary plus your salary,
the household income,

389
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:37,398
do you think you can manage your lives?

390
00:22:44,307 --> 00:22:46,120
Let's not talk about stock options

391
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,997
for the position of the marketing
department manager at the head office,

392
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:52,717
let's just discuss the annual salary, it's
at least twice as much as you make now, right?

393
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,477
I'll let you in on a secret.

394
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:55,986
Do you know how much

395
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,237
Qin, the previous manager,

396
00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:59,917
was offered to be poached?

397
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,266
It is for the coming 3,000,000 bucks
annual salary.

398
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:09,798
Shouldn't you also work hard
to fight for it now?

399
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,278
I know,

400
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,717
you must have been
calculating this in your mind

401
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:17,986
for a long time,

402
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:19,387
which is why you're so conflicted

403
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:20,598
and can't make a decision.

404
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:21,827
Next week,

405
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:24,677
the head office will send someone
to conduct an epidemiological survey.

406
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,237
They will pick between you and Sun Ying.

407
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:30,197
Make sure you're well prepared.

408
00:23:58,467 --> 00:23:59,147
Mum.

409
00:23:59,148 --> 00:23:59,827
Gosh.

410
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:01,517
You scared me.

411
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:06,398
What are you doing at the hospital?

412
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:09,027
My eyes need some treatment.

413
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:10,477
I took off the patch, look.

414
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:11,746
Have you recovered?

415
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:12,986
Yes, I feel much better.

416
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:13,917
No problem.

417
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:20,878
I came to visit a colleague.

418
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:26,027
Number 85, Lanzhi,

419
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:27,878
please go to Room No. 2 for treatment.

420
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,666
Number 85, Lanzhi,

421
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,437
please go to Room No. 2 for treatment.

422
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:35,477
That's for me.

423
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:38,440
I've been losing a lot of hair lately
so I came to check it out.

424
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:44,517
Don't tell Xiang Zhong.

425
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,638
Don't tell your dad either.

426
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,870
(Dermatology Department)

427
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:14,867
Grandpa, Grandma.

428
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:15,746
My babies.

429
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,798
Come here.

430
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:17,746
Come on.

431
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:19,266
Grandpa, I need to use the toilet.

432
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,997
I need to use the toilet, too.

433
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:23,237
Gao Ping, did your thesis defense
go well?

434
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:24,677
It was quite smooth.

435
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:26,358
Great.

436
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,880
Gao Ping, how is the situation regarding
staying with the institute?

437
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,437
Pretty good.

438
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:33,878
-I'll go in and look after the kids.
- Sure.

439
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:39,197
Come here.

440
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:41,986
What's wrong?

441
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:42,957
My back hurts.

442
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:47,867
Dad,

443
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:49,638
I need to report something to you.

444
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:50,997
Go on.

445
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,957
I'm looking at a promotion now.

446
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:57,186
I might be promoted to the head office

447
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:58,477
as the Marketing Manager.

448
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:01,878
There will be an allotment
of some shares to the company

449
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:04,358
and I will get a higher annual salary.

450
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:06,278
Significantly higher.

451
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:09,078
That's not easy. Congratulations.

452
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,147
However,

453
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:13,598
the head office is located in Shenzhen.

454
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:19,798
Do you have to move to Shenzhen, too?

455
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:22,798
If I get the promotion, yes.

456
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:27,186
How about Gao Ping?

457
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:28,517
We will go together.

458
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:33,677
That's not easy.

459
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,226
Dad,

460
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,358
if I really go to Shenzhen,

461
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:41,358
I can't keep coming home

462
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,398
like I do now.

463
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,237
Don't worry,

464
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:48,078
your mother and I will go visit you.

465
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:54,038
It is a blessing for you

466
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:55,838
to find Gao Ping.

467
00:26:57,187 --> 00:27:00,598
You should think about him
when you make decisions.

468
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,986
I didn't make the decision alone.

469
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:06,078
We have discussed it several times.

470
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:24,997
Gao Ping,

471
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:28,197
black or grey?

472
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:30,638
Grey.

473
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:32,078
Good one.

474
00:27:56,348 --> 00:27:57,237
I'm heading out.

475
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:07,878
Nervous?

476
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,798
So nervous.

477
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:15,038
You're fine.

478
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,278
Go, I'll wait for your good news.

479
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:22,717
You can do it.

480
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:38,437
What's wrong?

481
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:42,038
Miss Xiang, the hard drive
seems to be broken.

482
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,878
That's not possible, can you unplug it
and plug that interface back in?

483
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:54,437
Why is it unresponsive?

484
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:02,237
Just keep trying.

485
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,598
Alright.

486
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:25,986
(Xiang Qian)

487
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:26,627
Sorry,

488
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:27,666
the number you have dialed

489
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,197
is temporarily unavailable.

490
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:30,437
Please try again later.

491
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:40,558
(Xiang Qian: Gao Ping,
I'm having issues with my hard drive.)

492
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,520
(I have the original file
in my computer at home.)

493
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,226
(Can you make a copy
and send it to me?)

494
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:45,838
(I wonder if it'll be too late.)

495
00:29:59,388 --> 00:29:59,946
Hello.

496
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:01,477
Ms. Zhang, where is Gao Ping?

497
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:02,946
He went out,

498
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:04,757
I guess he went to send the girls.

499
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:07,358
Alright, thanks.

500
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:19,320
(Chai Jin: How's it going?)

501
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:24,957
(Xiang Qian: I'm contacting Gao Ping
for a solution.)

502
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:37,506
(Chai Jin: It's been 15 minutes.)

503
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:40,118
(They are all from the main office,
it's not appropriate to wait any longer.)

504
00:30:57,308 --> 00:30:58,067
Her hard drive,

505
00:30:58,068 --> 00:30:59,387
she's having an issue with it

506
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:00,717
and she needs to solve it.

507
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:02,278
She will be here soon.

508
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:05,278
There she is.

509
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:08,917
Excuse me,

510
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:10,757
sorry for taking up your time.

511
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:13,957
Something unexpected happened,

512
00:31:14,947 --> 00:31:16,717
my hard drive is damaged

513
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:18,867
and my presentation slides

514
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:20,598
of the project plan in a 3D video form

515
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,318
is inside.

516
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:28,157
Well, since an incident occurred,

517
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:31,477
let me start with the accident.

518
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:09,946
According to international survey data,

519
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:11,307
the market size of smart homes

520
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:12,906
in the country

521
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:15,917
will exceed 230 billion USD by 2026.

522
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,827
Before the arrival

523
00:32:17,828 --> 00:32:20,506
of a super-aged society in 2030,

524
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:25,517
our company will have an unshakeable
position in the industry.

525
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,437
Thank you.

526
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:53,957
How was it?

527
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,358
I just gritted my teeth and finished it.

528
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,627
Why did the hard drive
have issues suddenly?

529
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,278
I figured that was strange, too.

530
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:02,558
I've been busy all week for nothing.

531
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,757
What did Chai Jin say?

532
00:33:06,388 --> 00:33:08,157
It doesn't matter,

533
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:10,917
Sun Ying is more prepared than me.

534
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,957
I didn't get to play the 3D demo

535
00:33:12,987 --> 00:33:15,477
and I got everyone to wait
for more than ten minutes.

536
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:17,827
It's my fault.

537
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:19,387
I was sending the girls to kindergarten

538
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,677
so I didn't answer the call.

539
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:23,118
When I later called,
you didn't answer either.

540
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:25,157
It's fine.

541
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:27,038
If I get it, I get it.

542
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:28,598
If I don't,

543
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,477
we don't have to worry about it anymore.

544
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:32,426
You can continue preparing
to stay with the institute,

545
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,997
and I'll continue working on my plan.

546
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,517
I should hang up, my boss is here.

547
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,677
I've discussed with Yu and the others.

548
00:33:58,947 --> 00:34:03,078
Indeed, your materials
are not as prepared as Sun Ying's.

549
00:34:03,548 --> 00:34:04,997
Sorry, Boss.

550
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,798
However,

551
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:10,278
however,

552
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,717
everyone generally thinks

553
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,266
whether it's vision or perspective,

554
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,467
you are more suited than Sun Ying

555
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:18,878
to enter the management level.

556
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:21,398
So...

557
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,226
So?

558
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,077
So you and Sun Ying have
the same number of votes.

559
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:27,398
What's next? The company decides

560
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:28,957
to ask for my opinion.

561
00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:31,427
What is your opinion?

562
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:32,826
Do you even need to ask for my opinion?

563
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:35,198
If you're keen, I'll sign it right away.

564
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,186
(Xiang Qian: Boss said)

565
00:34:58,187 --> 00:35:00,637
(he'll make sure I'll go to Shenzhen
if I'm keen.)

566
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:18,077
(Gao Ping: Okay.)

567
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:49,117
(Hubby: I saw your mother
in the hospital.)

568
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:55,358
(She is losing her hairs,
but she doesn't want me to tell you.)

569
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:06,838
Mum.

570
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:10,266
What are you doing here?

571
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,318
Where are you going?

572
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:12,386
I'm getting some groceries.

573
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,597
I'll make some maran head
for your dad tonight.

574
00:36:14,628 --> 00:36:16,437
Did you go to the hospital two days ago?

575
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:19,878
Haiyang told you?

576
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:22,678
I already told him not to tell you.

577
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:24,386
Why didn't you tell me?

578
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:25,838
What did the doctor say?

579
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,957
I'm just losing some hairs.

580
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:31,198
Why can't you tell me
if it's just hair loss?

581
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:35,266
I'm suspecting that I damaged my hair
after getting it dyed at your aunt's.

582
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,878
I didn't dare tell your dad.

583
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:39,678
I'm afraid if he finds out,
he'll make fun of me.

584
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:41,957
Are you sure you're fine?

585
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,238
I think so.

586
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:49,917
You scared me.

587
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:51,637
What else are you hiding from me?

588
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,158
Xiang,

589
00:37:03,508 --> 00:37:05,318
are you looking for Ying again?

590
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:16,198
Xiang Zhiying.

591
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:19,117
Xiang Zhiying, what are you doing again?

592
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:20,798
What?

593
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:22,358
What?

594
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:24,666
I can forget about
you dyeing Xiaolan's hair,

595
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,306
what bad products did you use on her?

596
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:28,427
You're talking nonsense here.

597
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:30,718
When did I use bad products?

598
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:33,306
Why is she losing so much hair then?

599
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:34,437
How would I know?

600
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:35,947
What is wrong with you?

601
00:37:35,948 --> 00:37:38,746
What does her hair loss
have to do with me?

602
00:37:38,747 --> 00:37:40,346
We use the same product.

603
00:37:40,347 --> 00:37:41,866
Here, look at my hair.

604
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:42,706
Feel it.

605
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:44,386
Do I have hair fall?

606
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,798
- Then why is she losing her hair?
- How would I know?

607
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:49,997
Are these what you bought?

608
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:52,346
Did you use this to dye her hair?

609
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:53,758
Go and check.

610
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:54,627
What should I check?

611
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,027
I can't even read what's written on it.

612
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:57,346
You never know,

613
00:37:57,347 --> 00:37:59,238
she might have some issues herself.

614
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:00,917
What nonsense are you talking about?

615
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:07,637
Xiang Zhijun,

616
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:09,358
do you still remember

617
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:11,306
Ye, the old man from your unit?

618
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:12,786
Wasn't his wife like this, too?

619
00:38:12,787 --> 00:38:14,107
She kept losing her hair

620
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:15,947
and when she went
to a hospital to check,

621
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:16,997
it was cancer.

622
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:19,547
Xiang Zhiying, listen.

623
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,158
You just can't say anything good.

624
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,947
Xiang Zhijun, listen.

625
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:26,637
Think about it yourself.

626
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:27,838
Use your brain.

627
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:30,637
Listen, you really need to bring her
to get it checked out.

628
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:31,987
Don't be stingy this time.

629
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:33,346
Go to a large-scale hospital. Understand?

630
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:33,947
You go yourself.

631
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:34,507
You go.

632
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:35,507
You go.

633
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,346
You are crazy,

634
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,997
I'm being serious here.

635
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:41,186
Xiang, a chess match?

636
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:42,798
You can play
the stupid chess game yourself.

637
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:46,077
You are polluting the environment
by smoking here every day.

638
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:48,597
He's nuts.

639
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,117
Why didn't you tell me that
you went to the hospital for a checkup?

640
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:53,398
Tomorrow,

641
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:54,947
I'll take you to Shanghai Hospital

642
00:38:54,948 --> 00:38:55,838
to get it checked.

643
00:38:55,908 --> 00:38:57,266
We can't even get an appointment

644
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,957
at a big hospital.

645
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:01,158
I am here.

646
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:02,957
I will find a way.

647
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:05,678
You will tell the kids again.

648
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:08,437
Xiang Zhong is now
occupied with the divorce

649
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:10,318
so she's not feeling great.

650
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:12,306
Xiang Nan is preparing
to get married

651
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:13,838
so she is busy.

652
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,947
Xiang Qian is preparing
for her promotion,

653
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:17,477
not to mention she has two kids.

654
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:18,907
Our children are very busy,

655
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,517
we shouldn't disturb them.

656
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,427
All human's life span

657
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:28,798
are limited.

658
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:31,358
It's just time.

659
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:33,398
It's fine.

660
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,278
Stop overthink.

661
00:39:35,387 --> 00:39:38,077
What are you talking about?

662
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:45,306
It's fine. Don't worry.

663
00:39:45,307 --> 00:39:47,477
I'm here, don't be afraid.

664
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:49,798
Nothing will happen.

665
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:54,306
I'm not afraid.

666
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,037
I'm just worried about you.

667
00:39:58,588 --> 00:39:59,838
I'll be fine if you are.

668
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:01,437
What can happen to me?

669
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:07,798
Mum.

670
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:09,358
Mum?

671
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:10,467
I got you

672
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:11,346
a new,

673
00:40:11,347 --> 00:40:12,027
different

674
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:13,666
anti-hair loss shampoo.

675
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,477
I placed it in the bathroom.

676
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,467
I've ordered

677
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:22,158
two silk quilts for you here.

678
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:24,437
It's hot over there in Shenzhen,

679
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,706
you can't use thick ones.

680
00:40:25,707 --> 00:40:26,907
These will do.

681
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:27,507
Mum,

682
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,866
you're so worried.

683
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:30,547
We can buy quilts anywhere now.

684
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:32,907
How can you compare ready-made ones
with ordered ones?

685
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:34,358
Look at this.

686
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:36,477
When are you leaving?

687
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:38,786
After Gao Ping comes back
from Hong Kong, China.

688
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:41,198
Let's see what the result
of his interview is.

689
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:42,957
Look.

690
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,398
Look at your Aunt.

691
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:47,278
She's crazy.

692
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:50,627
Look at this video.

693
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:51,637
See?

694
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,346
Is she on a trip?

695
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:54,386
She's crazy.

696
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:55,907
Why didn't she tell me?

697
00:40:55,908 --> 00:40:57,507
How inconsiderate.

698
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:58,477
Look.

699
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:00,517
Let me ask her.

700
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:04,198
They're like a bunch of lunatics,
she's not alone.

701
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,398
Xiang Qian, are you home?

702
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:11,077
Aunt, are you on a trip?

703
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:14,158
Why didn't you tell me
about the trip earlier?

704
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:17,306
Your mother said

705
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:18,866
that you are getting promoted recently

706
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:20,358
so you are extremely busy.

707
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,637
Where are you going?

708
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,437
We are going to Yunnan.

709
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:29,517
We'll go take a look around
the ethnic minorities.

710
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,987
Pay attention to your safety,

711
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:31,666
be safe.

712
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,358
Don't buy random things.

713
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:34,547
By the way,

714
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:36,987
listen, your mother's...

715
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:38,398
Isn't Mum here?

716
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,957
I'm fine.

717
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,386
Xiaozhi, listen to me,

718
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:45,306
I have checked here,

719
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:48,306
none of us with permed hair
is suffering hair loss.

720
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:49,878
Just hang up. It's fine.

721
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,746
You have to get that Xiang Zhijun

722
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:54,758
take you to the hospital
to go check it out, understand?

723
00:41:55,108 --> 00:41:56,798
Shut up, you liar.

724
00:41:58,428 --> 00:41:59,358
Xiaolan?

725
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:00,917
What's wrong?

726
00:42:03,747 --> 00:42:04,597
Xiaolan!

727
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:05,266
Mum!

728
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:06,678
Look at your mother.

729
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,030
(Outpatient)

730
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:26,597
Why are we at
the International Department?

731
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:30,117
This is arranged by Jiang Hongbin.

732
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:31,917
Where is Mum?

733
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:32,997
She's asleep.

734
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,718
What happened actually?

735
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:36,907
She did a CT scan.

736
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,117
There's nothing much.

737
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:40,198

738
00:42:40,508 --> 00:42:41,826

739
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:43,077
they'll do a comprehensive check-up.

740
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:44,957
The doctor also suggested doing a

741
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:46,427

746
00:42:58,267 --> 00:43:00,077
If you do, why didn't you tell me?

747
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:02,186
I was afraid it might affect
your promotion

748
00:43:02,187 --> 00:43:03,838
and delay your bright future, what else?
