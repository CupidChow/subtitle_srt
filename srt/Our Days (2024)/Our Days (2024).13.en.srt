00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,000
=Our Days=

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 13=

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,410
Haiyang, what's wrong again?

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,810
Don't come up with
stupid ideas next time.

6
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,882
Take her down with one blow?

7
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,449
My foot.

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,770
You guys are something else.

9
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,890
I think Zhong isn't that fierce.

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,690
It's just that she speaks
harshly sometimes.

11
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,330
But don't you think

12
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,330
she is just like a thermos flask?

13
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,289
She may be cold on the outside,

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,289
but she's always warm on the inside.

15
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,289
Ling.

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,289
As an outstanding female,

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,729
you should analyze
Haiyang's situation for us.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,970
If someone

19
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,849
were

20
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,009
to gift you something suddenly,

21
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,090
what does that mean?

22
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,930
According to your logic,

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,250
I suppose the deliveryman
has a crush on me as well.

24
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,119
Are you ETC?

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,358
Do you only know how to argue?

26
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,598
That "someone" I was referring to

27
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,009
was someone like an ex-boyfriend.

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,679
What does it mean
when he buys things for her

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,679
and is concerned about her?

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,439
If he dares to come,

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,210
I'll tell my brother to break his legs!

32
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,038
My ex-boyfriend bought me
a bouquet of chrysanthemum

33
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,769
for my birthday.

34
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,490
Don't you think he's asking for it?

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,449
You mean...

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,090
So,

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,279
chrysanthemum,

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,130
it's

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,478
yellow, right?

40
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,478
Isn't that good?

41
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,449
What does it imply?

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,918
People buy chrysanthemum

43
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,650
to pay respect to the dead!

44
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,719
Yellow rose represents love
that has faded.

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,078
How could someone in a relationship

46
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,250
buy flowers like that
for their girlfriends?

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,009
You must've lost your mind.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,210
Haiyang,

49
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,889
don't tell me you bought yellow roses

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,889
for Zhong?

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,090
For who?

52
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,449
Zhong.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,119
Me?

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,518
Yes, you.

55
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,289
That can't be.

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,559
We've been married for so many years.

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,009
It'll be boring

58
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,329
if I buy her flowers again.

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,930
That's impossible.

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,399
So, you want to court her back,

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,959
yet you're not even willing
to buy her flowers?

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,289
No one would say yes to you.

63
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,609
What do you know?

64
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,449
If that's what Haiyang said,

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,609
that means he already
bought her flowers, am I right?

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,210
You're my brother.

67
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,410
Being in a relationship is
different from selling seafood.

68
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,410
More doesn't necessarily mean it's good.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,569
Since that's already the case,

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,250
let's not dwell on it, okay?

71
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,090
Let's not put all our eggs
in one basket.

72
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,649
Let's drink until we drop

73
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,329
while we still can.

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,610
In life,

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,409
the most tragic thing

76
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,649
is to be a beggar
when you were born with a silver spoon.

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,250
This outstanding female beside me,

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,969
her name is Ling.

79
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,329
Haiyang!

80
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,730
Haiyang!

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,209
Look at how foxy she looks.

82
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,449
Haiyang?

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,329
Haiyang.

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,170
Haiyang!

85
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,209
Haiyang?

86
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,690
- Ling.
- What does he mean by that?

87
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:48,679
He didn't mean anything.

88
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,889
It's just that many people

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,009
don't know how to appreciate beauty.

90
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,449
Are you still awake?

91
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,089
I couldn't sleep.

92
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,318
You see, Xiang Qian

93
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,490
always abides by her principles.

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,850
She has a straightforward nature.

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,170
Sorry about this.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,209
Ping.

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,999
You're pretty good yourself.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,250
And, you're well-educated too.

99
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,889
You see, she...

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,889
She's a divorcee with two children.

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,039
Why did you fall for someone like her?

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,449
She was nice to me.

103
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,089
Besides,

104
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,250
it's difficult for a family like us

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,850
to establish a foothold in Shanghai.

106
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,610
Your wife is too capable
for your own good.

107
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,290
You won't be able to handle her.

108
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,758
She'll trample upon you

109
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,610
for the rest of your life.

110
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,250
Even so, I don't have a choice.

111
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,670
(Deng Haiyang)

112
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,569
(Xiang Zhong: Are you free?)

113
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,610
(Wang Yuxi: What's the matter?)

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,209
(Xiang Zhong:
Someone broke into my house.)

115
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,370
(Wang Yuxi: Who is it?)

116
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,529
(Xiang Zhong: I don't know.)

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,278
(Wang Yuxi: Stay in your room
and lock the door.)

118
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,529
(I'll head there immediately.)

119
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,959
I've already called the cops.

120
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,730
I'm at your doorstep.

121
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,250
Don't come out.

122
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,278
Don't move!

123
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,250
Sir!

124
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,409
Sir!

125
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,809
You arrested the wrong person.

126
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,250
I'm the good guy.

127
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,289
The good guy?

128
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,278
Did you call the cops?

129
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,250
Yes, I did.

130
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,250
The person you need to arrest is inside.

131
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,130
He's inside?

132
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,839
Sir,

133
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,999
I have something to tell you guys.

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,319
For a unit like this, there's a backdoor

135
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,359
to its balcony.

136
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,169
Should we go and check it out?

137
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,599
Alright.

138
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,758
You can take him there.

139
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,038
Okay.

140
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,809
Take a look.

141
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,518
You, follow me.

142
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,130
Okay.

143
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,649
Turn on the lights.

144
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,119
Turn on the lights!

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,009
Okay.

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,370
Let me try another switch.

147
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,490
Can you turn on the normal lights?

148
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,490
This...

149
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,850
Sorry about this.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,330
This isn't my house.

151
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,490
Who's there? I'm a cop!

152
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,570
Put down your sword!

153
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,769
Sir,

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,409
that's the owner.

155
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,719
Sir.

156
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,599
You're finally here.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,719
I'm glad to see you here.

158
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,719
When I was sleeping,

159
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,999
it felt like someone
broke into the living room.

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,330
I'm serious.

161
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,370
Where is he, then?

162
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,409
I...

163
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,370
I have no idea either.

164
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,009
Where is he?

165
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,130
Who's there?

166
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,839
Who's there?

167
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,570
Who's inside?

168
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,330
Show yourself!

169
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,319
The cops are here!

170
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,090
Show yourself!

171
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,009
Hurry and show yourself!

172
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,130
Don't move! I'm a cop!

173
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,289
Sir.

174
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,049
Deng Haiyang?

175
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,649
Do you know him?

176
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,999
He's my ex-husband.

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,130
Your ex-husband?

178
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,289
We aren't divorced yet.

179
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,970
We are. It's the cooling-off period now.

180
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,798
That means we aren't divorced yet.

181
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,730
We are divorced.

182
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,518
We aren't.

183
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,038
We are.

184
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,809
We aren't.

185
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,638
Sir.

186
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,970
You, stay there.

187
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,929
Let me ask you two this.

188
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,649
Are you two still husband and wife?

189
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,158
Yes.

190
00:11:59,159 --> 00:11:59,850
No.

191
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,239
- Yes.
- No.

192
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,210
We're just in the cooling-off period.

193
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,929
That's what we're doing now.

194
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,130
Isn't it?

195
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,330
I understand now.

196
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,999
You two are still husband and wife,
am I right?

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,970
- That's right.
- That's wrong.

198
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,289
Mister.

199
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,529
By the way,

200
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,529
what's your relationship with her?

201
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,730
I'm her neighbor.

202
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:27,450
You should go back.

203
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,769
If so, I'll head back first.

204
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,929
Wait a minute.

205
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,289
Sir,

206
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,889
I don't know him.

207
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,239
Who is he?

208
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,090
What?

209
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,278
I just want to know who he is...

210
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,798
So, you are?

211
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,278
Don't touch him!

212
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:40,758
Who are you?

213
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,879
Calm down.

214
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,879
Calm down.

215
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,130
Sir, I'm...

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,359
Deng Haiyang, you're drunk.

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,719
Can you stop your nonsense?

218
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,879
I'm not doing anything!

219
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,438
Calm down.

220
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,479
Let him talk. Talk properly.

221
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,929
I'll say something.

222
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,049
I think

223
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,119
there's a misunderstanding
between us now.

224
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,558
And now,

225
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,610
we should clarify ourselves.

226
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,529
What do you mean?

227
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,158
You got drunk and came to my house
to stir up a ruckus.

228
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,758
Your house?

229
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,038
It's our house!

230
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,119
How is it your house now?

231
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,970
Are you done?

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,850
Listen!

233
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,529
- Listen!
- Listen to me!

234
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,959
A guy I've never seen before
is inside my house.

235
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,239
Can't I even ask him

236
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,210
about his identity?

237
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:13,319
What's wrong with that?

238
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,438
How is this your house?

239
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:15,518
How is this not my house?

240
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,438
Are we even divorced yet?

241
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:17,479
Deng Haiyang, listen up!

242
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,239
This isn't your house!

243
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,398
You better get out of my house!

244
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:19,918
Get out!

245
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,558
Get out!

246
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,730
Get out!

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,638
Hey! That's dangerous!

248
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,319
Don't be angry.

249
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,638
That's dangerous, you know?

250
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,079
Don't throw it around!

251
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,330
You should calm down too.

252
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,610
What are you doing?

253
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,330
I'll leave.

254
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,038
Look at what you've done.

255
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,130
You even used a sword.

256
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,319
Why can't you two talk it over?

257
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,730
Must you resort to this?

258
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,490
That's mine.

259
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,649
I came here to take my stuff.

260
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,570
You see,

261
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,250
I came back

262
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,809
to deliver some flowers

263
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,090
to her.

264
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,409
But now, I think

265
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,730
you don't deserve it.

266
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,970
Keep your sword.

267
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,850
Are you having your meal?

268
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,809
You don't say? Do I look like
I'm brushing my teeth now?

269
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,490
Cut to the chase.

270
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,678
Firstly, let me apologize
for what I've done last night.

271
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,970
I was indeed quite drunk.

272
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,929
That's why I was impulsive.

273
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,398
It won't happen again.

274
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,250
I just wanted

275
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,689
- to talk to you.
- I've changed the locks.

276
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,409
Fine.

277
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,130
That guy last night...

278
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,678
It's that guy.

279
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,169
So, what's the relationship...

280
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,130
What's the relationship

281
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,769
between you two?

282
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,090
We're just neighbors.

283
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,689
Just neighbors?

284
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,879
Do neighbors get
that close to each other?

285
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,570
You're done, right?

286
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,929
Yeah.

287
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,090
I'm done.

288
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,719
Do neighbors

289
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,959
go to their neighbors' house

290
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,970
in the middle of the night?

291
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,490
You broke into my house
in the middle of the night.

292
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,479
Who else can I seek

293
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,570
besides my neighbors?

294
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,649
I thought

295
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,678
the divorce procedure

296
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,769
wasn't completed yet.

297
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,359
Why can't I return to our house?

298
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,438
It doesn't matter if
the divorce procedure is completed or not.

299
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,158
Can't I even

300
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,169
have male friends now?

301
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,250
Of course you can.

302
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,278
But that guy last night...

303
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,330
Listen.

304
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,438
He has a sneaky look.

305
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,638
He has a fair and tender look to him.

306
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,958
I'm sure he's a bad egg.

307
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,478
I'm sure he harbored
ill intention toward you.

308
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,169
He went to our house
in the middle of the night, you know?

309
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,969
Harbored ill intention toward me?

310
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,810
That does sound nice to me.

311
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,759
What's wrong?

312
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,929
Did something happen?

313
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,559
Qi's mother,

314
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,010
so, this is the situation.

315
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,839
When they were playing

316
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,678
on the slide
at the children's playground,

317
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,599
your daughter

318
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,319
pushed her son,
and he fell to the ground.

319
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,799
His lips are hurt.

320
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,039
We told her to apologize to him,

321
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,169
but she wouldn't do it.

322
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:41,050
Qi,

323
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,850
did you push that kid?

324
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,010
Mom is here.

325
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,090
You trust me, right?

326
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,958
If so, you should tell me

327
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,090
what happened.

328
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,799
He pushed me to the ground yesterday.

329
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,398
Why didn't he apologize to me?

330
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,489
Why did Grandaunt tell me
to apologize to him instead?

331
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:05,850
Did that happen?

332
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,330
There was a dispute
at the central garden yesterday.

333
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,279
He wanted to chase us away.

334
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,799
He didn't want us to play there.

335
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,370
He pushed me
when we weren't willing to leave.

336
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,570
His mother wouldn't let us leave

337
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,729
unless we apologized to him.

338
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,530
I still had to clean up the house and cook.

339
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,879
The central garden

340
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,519
is located right in front
of our backyard.

341
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,198
All those children

342
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,039
are usually loud when they play there.

343
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,850
Who can withstand that?

344
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,079
Isn't that a children's playground

345
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,759
in your condominium?

346
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,559
Why must you guys

347
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,130
always play near the villa area?

348
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,649
Miss Ma,

349
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,839
the central garden

350
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,209
is the neighborhood's public area,
am I right?

351
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:49,929
It's in the same neighborhood.

352
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,678
Your management didn't state

353
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,958
that children
living in the condominium area

354
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:56,010
cannot play at the central garden.

355
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:58,649
That's true.

356
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,359
Actually, a dispute between children

357
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,799
is nothing major.

358
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,770
An apology can solve everything.

359
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,330
Who should apologize to who now?

360
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,649
Who said a dispute between children
isn't a major deal?

361
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,249
We're educating our children here.

362
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,559
People are raising
their children all wrong now.

363
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,290
Stop nagging
and dragging other topics into this.

364
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,759
Just apologize and be done with it.

365
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,330
My son has a fencing lesson to attend.

366
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,359
Dou's mother,

367
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,889
we cannot apologize to you.

368
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,929
Yesterday's dispute
hasn't been resolved yet.

369
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,158
These two are different things.

370
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,570
Yesterday's dispute
has already been resolved.

371
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,799
My children didn't
do anything wrong yesterday.

372
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,290
Even so, they were forced to apologize.

373
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,839
That's not reasonable.

374
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,759
How is this fair to them?

375
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,799
I'm too lazy to argue with you.

376
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,958
I'll ask you this.

377
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,209
Will you apologize or not?

378
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,799
Tell Dou to apologize to Cong.

379
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,090
And, I'll tell Qi to apologize to Dou.

380
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,489
You don't want to apologize?

381
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,649
Fine.

382
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,010
Just you wait.

383
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,130
Let's go.

384
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,638
Dou's mother!

385
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:53,689
What kind of person is she?

386
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:56,929
This...

387
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,969
Aunty,

388
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,879
it wasn't our fault.

389
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,649
Why should we apologize?

390
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,689
They were fierce.

391
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,370
So what?

392
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,409
One doesn't need to shout to be right.

393
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,610
We should be reasonable.

394
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,519
If you think you can't resolve
such issues in the future,

395
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,249
you can call me

396
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:20,610
or Gao Ping in advance.

397
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,929
He's busy with his thesis.

398
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,889
I'm working too, you know?

399
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,998
It doesn't matter who's available.

400
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:30,198
I'm just trying to say

401
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,718
that you can call us in advance, okay?

402
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:33,449
It was just a minor issue.

403
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,478
When children play with each other,

404
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,918
they'll push each other around.

405
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,570
It's fine as long as
they apologize to each other.

406
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,238
Aunty, you must take note

407
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,678
when you spend time with the children.

408
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,198
You must guide them
in the right direction

409
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,850
and help them develop
a correct worldview.

410
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,438
Differentiating between
right and wrong is a vital skill.

411
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,079
Just now, Qi said

412
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,759
that she was avenging her brother.

413
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,998
Why was she trying to seek revenge?

414
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,249
It's nothing major.

415
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,090
What? You think I'm trying
to lead your children astray?

416
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,649
I didn't treat them

417
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,330
as outsiders even though

418
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,610
I just found out
that they weren't Gao Ping's children.

419
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,330
What do you mean by that?

420
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,158
Did Gao Ping not tell you guys

421
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:08,958
that I had two children

422
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,449
before he married me?

423
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,650
(Reception Room)

424
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,570
What's wrong? What happened?

425
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,839
No one else knew about it

426
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,449
besides your mother, right?

427
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,330
What are you talking about?

428
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,610
The fact that I'm a divorcee

429
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,249
with two children.

430
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,599
The kin and friends I have

431
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,850
at my hometown

432
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,090
are relatively uneducated.

433
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,169
They have a conservative mindset.

434
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:52,998
Therefore, they're quite biased

435
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,438
when it comes to this.

436
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,238
I didn't want my mother
to be stressed out over this

437
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,649
back at home.

438
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,530
Therefore, during festive occasions,

439
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:05,918
whenever I said I wanted
to bring my children to your hometown,

440
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,050
you used all kinds of excuses
to brush me off.

441
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,570
That means

442
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,839
it's impossible for you
to take me and my children

443
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,969
back to your hometown

444
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,570
at the same time, right?

445
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,090
That's not it.

446
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,158
I do wish to take you
and our children back

447
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:20,958
to our hometown.

448
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:25,438
But you have no idea
how foul their mouths were.

449
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,438
My mother and I were badmouthed

450
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,638
by them since young.

451
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:29,610
I...

452
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,638
I truly had enough of it.

453
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:32,559
I'm frustrated over this.

454
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,209
I...

455
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,158
I want to hold my head high

456
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,489
in front of them.

457
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:42,530
But you have to face it eventually.

458
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,130
That means one day,

459
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,130
you have to choose between

460
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,599
taking me and our children
back to your hometown

461
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,209
or avoiding the gossip back home.

462
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,729
Xiang Qian, you see,

463
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,519
isn't it good for us
to keep our lives private

464
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,519
and enjoy it ourselves?

465
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,319
Whether or not they know about this

466
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,729
doesn't matter, right?

467
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,530
I think it does matter.

468
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,090
It's not like I have something to hide.

469
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,249
Aunty.

470
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,689
Aunty.

471
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,010
Thank you.

472
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,570
Is this boiled egg with sugar?

473
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,409
It's been so long since I had it.

474
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,689
You made a bowl for me every day

475
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,209
when I was taking my NCEE.

476
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,158
Your NCEE result
wouldn't have been that terrible

477
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,889
had I been wealthy enough

478
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,330
to provide you with
nutritious meals every day.

479
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,409
How could that be your fault?

480
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,889
It's because
my mindset wasn't strong enough.

481
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,290
Are the children asleep?

482
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,209
Yeah.

483
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:19,929
Did something happen?

484
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,770
Xiang Qian reprimanded me.

485
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,050
She said there was something wrong
with the way I educate the children.

486
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,039
Don't take it to heart.

487
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,290
That's how she is.

488
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,998
She can't control her emotions

489
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,489
when she gets angry.

490
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,090
Is she still angry?

491
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,449
She's not back at this late hour.

492
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,610
That's not it.

493
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,729
She's working overtime.

494
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,449
She has it rough as well.

495
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,050
Ping,

496
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:47,050
you're so nice to her.

497
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,889
You're nice to her children too.

498
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,570
Does she even appreciate your effort?

499
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,649
Sometimes,

500
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:55,689
a man like you can't afford
to stay feeble all the time.

501
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:57,799
Aunty, you know me well.

502
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,729
I...

503
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,449
I don't like to argue.

504
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,209
If you don't argue with her,

505
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:05,530
she won't think
that you're being understanding.

506
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,610
She'll only think that you're feeble
and easy to bully.

507
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,810
Finish it, okay?

508
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:20,689
Please rest early.

509
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,319
Look.

510
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,079
The parameters of our product

511
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,359
have all changed now.

512
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,610
That's why I'm saying...

513
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,090
You must be exhausted.

514
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:02,209
I'm fine.

515
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,530
You can leave first if you're tired.

516
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,689
Tell Gao Ping to fetch you.

517
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,770
I drove here.

518
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,209
It's late.

519
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:16,449
Did Dr. Gao not give you a call?

520
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,850
Usually, if you worked past 12 A.M.,

521
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,050
he would've sent you
all kinds of warm text messages.

522
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,850
Why is he being inconsiderate today?

523
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,449
What do you want?

524
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,530
I'll treat you to it.

525
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,689
It's the same.

526
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:33,799
It's my first time seeing

527
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,370
a superior who doesn't like
his subordinates to work overtime.

528
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,039
What do you mean?

529
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,449
Are you going to sleep here?

530
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,169
Are you sulking?

531
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:50,998
You see,

532
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:52,729
we've been married for so many years.

533
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,839
Even so, you didn't tell your family

534
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,279
about my personal details.

535
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,238
And, I asked Aunty about it.

536
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,489
Was I wrong?

537
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,958
I already told you as well.

538
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,330
I have my own bitter reasons
for not doing so.

539
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,319
What do you want me to do, then?

540
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,839
Do you want me to call them one by one

541
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,010
and tell them about it?

542
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,119
I didn't tell you

543
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,610
to call them one by one.

544
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,319
I just want to know why you did so.

545
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,409
Can't I even do that?

546
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,290
Xiang Qian.

547
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,929
You're back.

548
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,169
Did I wake you up?

549
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,130
It's fine. I'm a light sleeper.

550
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,649
I wish to have a chat with you.

551
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,169
Sure. Let me get changed first.

552
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,039
How much do you know about

553
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,330
Gao Ping's family?

554
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,889
My second sister,

555
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,810
which is Gao Ping's mother,

556
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,449
was very beautiful when she was young.

557
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,638
Everyone in the family
frowned upon her relationship

558
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,530
with Gao Ping's father.

559
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,169
His father was a playboy.

560
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,770
Everyone in our hometown knew that.

561
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:55,559
But it felt like

562
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,678
my second sister was bewitched by him.

563
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:57,889
She insisted on following him.

564
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,209
She even eloped with him.

565
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,050
When she came back,

566
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,290
her pregnancy was already eight months in.

567
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,079
Having a child without getting married

568
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,409
is generally looked down upon.

569
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,729
In addition,
she didn't have a proper job.

570
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,689
My second sister

571
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,969
just wanted to get married
to a reliable man.

572
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,610
Not only did she not find a reliable man,

573
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,810
but she also ruined her reputation.

574
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,998
Gao Ping grew up in an environment

575
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,530
filled with detrimental gossip and rumors.

576
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,449
He was afraid
that people might look down on him.

577
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,519
That's why he worked harder

578
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,050
than anyone else when it came to studying.

579
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,810
He just wanted
to stand up for his mother and himself.

580
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,599
You see,

581
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,209
he did become successful.

582
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,599
He got into a college in Shanghai.

583
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,209
He even obtained a PhD.

584
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,918
Now, his mother can finally
hold her head up high

585
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,409
in front of everyone else.

586
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,130
But if...

587
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,850
If...

588
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,770
What?

589
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,050
What are you trying to say?

590
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:03,090
If other people find out

591
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,799
that he married a divorcee with children,

592
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,119
he won't be able
to raise his head high again,

593
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,969
don't you think?

594
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,238
Aunty,

595
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:17,209
what are you trying to tell me here?

596
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,530
Xiang Qian.

597
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,290
Although I'm not well-educated,

598
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,969
I'd been working in the city before this.

599
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:28,209
I understand the mindset
of cultured individuals like you.

600
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,130
Gao Ping is already
facing immense stress

601
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,330
by being together with you.

602
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,969
Can you please
be more understanding toward him?

603
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,130
How am I not understanding enough?

604
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,638
You see,

605
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,478
it's already tough on him

606
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,519
for him to work on
his thesis all day long.

607
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,438
Now, you're arguing with him

608
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,319
after coming back from work.

609
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,370
It's been tough on me too.
I had to work overtime until now.

610
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,010
And, I didn't try to argue with him.

611
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,209
Shouldn't you try
to be in my shoes for a second?

612
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,918
We've been married for five years.

613
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,810
Even so, there are still plenty
of secrets between us.

614
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,969
Don't we need to clarify things?

615
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,409
I already told you.

616
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,290
Gao Ping had bitter reasons
for doing so.

617
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,850
Do you have to force him
to make a stand?

618
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,729
Besides,

619
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,279
just look at Gao Ping's status

620
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,370
and qualifications.

621
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,610
Getting married to him

622
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:13,209
isn't a loss for you at all.

623
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,370
Doesn't that make you two even?

624
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:20,290
That's the way
you're looking at things now, huh?

625
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,969
So, you think that it's disadvantageous

626
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,958
for Gao Ping to marry me, right?

627
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,478
He should divorce me

628
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:29,158
and marry another PhD graduate.

629
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,678
This way, he can tell his family

630
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:32,409
about his partner officially, right?

631
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,209
That's not what I mean.

632
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,249
Don't say that.

633
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,770
I just think that Gao Ping
has it pretty tough.

634
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,850
I feel sorry for him.

635
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:46,850
I also hope that you can be
more understanding toward him.

636
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,050
I can understand
that you feel sorry for him.

637
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:55,839
But I think there are

638
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,570
certain things we need to clarify here.

639
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,130
Both Gao Ping and I are adults.

640
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,079
We can take responsibility

641
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,090
for our own choices.

642
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,478
There's no such thing

643
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,929
as getting a disadvantageous partner.

644
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:09,169
I don't like what you said just now.

645
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:10,438
Secondly, you're my elder.

646
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,570
I respect you.

647
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,409
Thank you for helping us out.

648
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,370
But regarding my relationship
with Gao Ping, please stay out of it.

649
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,290
And,

650
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,050
you don't need

651
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,689
to provide us with too many suggestions.

652
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,050
The two of us will deal
with our own issues.

653
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,918
Aunty, I worked overtime

654
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,610
and was only able
to come home not long ago.

655
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,729
You should rest well too.

656
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,770
I have to wake up early tomorrow.

657
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:07,570
Flowy, Blacky, time to eat.

658
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,729
Good morning.

659
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,290
Good morning.

660
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,610
You can wipe your hands with this.

661
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,530
Thanks.

662
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,689
It's time for them
to take their vaccine today.

663
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,489
Let's go.

664
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,090
This is for you.

665
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,889
For me?

666
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,889
I did some research.

667
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,158
Such thermos flasks have the best
heat-retaining properties

668
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:34,969
among all of them.

669
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,359
I ordered two of them.

670
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,370
This is for you.

671
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:38,610
Thank you.

672
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,729
How did you know
that green was my favorite color?

673
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,130
I just happen to know.

674
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,599
I'll be going on a trip to Tongli

675
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,638
with my friends next week.

676
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:51,729
Do you want to join me?

677
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,449
Do you have any concerns?

678
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,079
Kunshan is a small place.

679
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,169
People will gossip about this.

680
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:08,050
Do we even need
to care about other people's opinions?

681
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,849
So, did you leave the house early

682
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,010
just to avoid me?

683
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,729
That's not it.

684
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,329
This morning,

685
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,759
I was in a hurry to reach the center

686
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,050
to retrieve my materials.

687
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,958
Last night, your aunty

688
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:52,050
did teach me a harsh lesson.

689
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,410
What did she say?

690
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,799
She thinks
that you're swallowing a huge grievance

691
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,289
by marrying a divorcee like me

692
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,450
who has her own children.

693
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,890
Didn't I tell you before?

694
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:09,998
People from my hometown

695
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,849
are quite biased about this.

696
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,958
Is that what you think as well?

697
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,610
Do you feel that it's unfair?

698
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,570
Don't you know
my character well enough?

699
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,930
I don't.

700
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,050
Why would I know your character?

701
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,729
What are you trying to get at?

702
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,759
I think you've been
acting strange lately.

703
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,890
All of your reactions were off.

704
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,769
Are you hiding something from me?

705
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,130
Who said so?

706
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:46,319
In the past, whenever
I worked past 12 A.M.,

707
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,319
you would either call me

708
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,490
or order food for me.

709
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,450
You didn't call me last night.

710
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:51,879
And, you slept in the study room

711
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,799
after I went home.

712
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,130
What did you mean by that?

713
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,050
Last night, I...

714
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,970
I just took a short break
in the study room.

715
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,450
I didn't expect to fall asleep.

716
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,890
It was already very late when I woke up.

717
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,890
Mainly,

718
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,649
I feel quite stressed out lately.

719
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,090
The interview for
the mobile research center

720
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,249
is nearing.

721
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,849
If I fail to grab hold of this opportunity,

722
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,369
I'll have no idea
what to do in the future.

723
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,530
I'm sorry.

724
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,369
It's my fault.

725
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,289
I didn't do a good job lately.

726
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,090
Don't be stressed out.

727
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,410
I'm sure everything will work out.

728
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,010
You can talk to me
if you feel stressed out.

729
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,450
We can talk it over,

730
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,249
am I right?

731
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,010
You can enjoy your lunch break.

732
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:08,930
I'll be going now.

733
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,169
Xiang Qian.

734
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,010
I'm sorry.

735
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,410
You said it just now.

736
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,729
Thank you.

737
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,729
Why are you thanking me?

738
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,890
Thank you for taking on
so much on my behalf.

739
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,689
I'll return home earlier

740
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:38,169
after work tonight.

741
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:42,570
Let's have a chat and catch a movie,

742
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,289
okay?

743
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,369
Don't be stressed out, okay?

744
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,369
I'll be going now.

745
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:01,849
Goodbye.

746
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,329
Drive safe.

747
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,410
What a touching farewell.

748
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,279
Why did your wife come

749
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,649
to the research center at this time?

750
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,570
Don't tell me she's here
to conduct a duty check?

751
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,729
Isn't she too sensitive?

752
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,090
But it does make sense.

753
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,279
You're an outstanding man.

754
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,359
I'm sure other women will...

755
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,518
I thought you were going
to take your PhD.

756
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,610
Are you still doing it?

757
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:42,970
Yeah.

758
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:44,879
There are some useful topics

759
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,478
in the mobile research center,

760
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,890
and I can introduce some mentors to you.

761
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,249
Weren't you going abroad?

762
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,130
Will your wife and her children
follow you there?

763
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,970
Who told you that I was going abroad?

764
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,478
Didn't you apply for

765
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,530
the Wellcome Sanger Institute
in the U.K.?

766
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,159
You even requested Mr. Lin

767
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,649
to write you a letter of recommendation.

768
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,050
Am I right?

769
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,759
I saw the letter by accident

770
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,930
when I went there to obtain his signature.

771
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,849
I'm not a member of the academy yet.

772
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,530
And, I haven't gotten into
the mobile research center either.

773
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,930
That's just my backup plan.

774
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,438
Don't worry.

775
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,930
I won't tell anyone else.

776
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,530
Thank you.

777
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,118
I heard that winter in the U.K.

778
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,359
is cold and damp.

779
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,610
I haven't been there before.

780
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,050
Me neither.

781
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:35,169
You must tell me about it
when you're there, okay?

782
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,038
Maybe I can find you

783
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,209
when I have the time
to visit the U.K. in the future.

784
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:43,799
Haiyang,

785
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,369
are you guys heading
to Tongli for a trip?

786
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,689
I don't think so.

787
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,879
I saw Xiang Zhong skiving during work

788
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,478
to make a guide.

789
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,398
I thought you guys were going on

790
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:56,450
a romantic weekend trip.

791
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,719
Yeah.

792
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,799
I would've forgotten about it
if you didn't remind me.

793
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,689
Xiang Zhong, she...

794
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,998
She wanted to go there for some time.

795
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:05,249
But something always cropped up.

796
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,478
Since you guys are finally
going on a trip,

797
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,199
you guys must enjoy yourselves, okay?

798
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,199
Okay. I'll make a move first.

799
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,090
Goodbye.

800
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,478
Hello.

801
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:27,809
The number you have dialed is busy.

802
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,649
Wait a minute.

803
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,130
Xiang Zhong.

804
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,970
Did you go outside just now?

805
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,319
Are you heading to Tongli?

806
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,759
Why are you heading there?

807
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,809
Who will you head there with?

808
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,118
You're not my superior.

809
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,118
Stay out of my business.

810
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,849
Are you heading there with our neighbor?

811
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,890
Are you going to elope with him?

812
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:54,759
That's right.

813
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,930
I'm going to elope with him.

814
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:56,639
Happy now?

815
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,329
You...

816
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,289
What's your name?

817
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,398
What's your occupation?

818
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:31,890
Which company are you working for?

819
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,249
I'm on a temporary break.

820
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,849
You're not a local, aren't you?

821
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,839
Sorry. My cab is here.

822
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,890
Hey, listen.

823
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,010
You better stay away from Xiang Zhong.

824
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,050
You're being quiet.

825
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:50,729
You want to keep silent, huh? Fine.

826
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,010
I'll start, then.

827
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,359
Xiang Zhong and I

828
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,679
haven't completed
the divorce procedure yet.

829
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,639
That means we aren't divorced yet.

830
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,679
If you continue to flirt with her,

831
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,958
you'll be seducing a married woman.

832
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:00,930
Do you understand that?

833
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,689
Does she know
that you said this about her?

834
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,050
Why don't you take a guess?

835
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:07,689
I'm sure she'll be upset

836
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,610
if she finds out.

837
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,769
Sorry. I'm in a rush here.

838
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:40,890
Mister, you're here.

839
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:41,639
It's the weekend.

840
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,078
I'm sure your children have returned.

841
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,679
That's right.

842
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,998
All of them are back.

843
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:45,639
Come.

844
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,759
Give me two pounds of mud shrimp.

845
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,199
Okay.

846
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,118
And give me a fresh Mandarin fish.

847
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,558
I'll get you a Mandarin fish
from the shop.

848
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,649
I'll get you a fresh one.

849
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,639
This is great.

850
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,769
Please clean it for me.

851
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,490
Alright.

852
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:55,478
Xiang?

853
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:56,289
Xiang!

854
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,329
Xiang!

855
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,118
You're being so secretive.

856
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,359
What bad news do you have for me now?

857
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,490
Your daughter, Xiang Zhong,

858
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,610
did she get herself a new boyfriend?

859
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,610
