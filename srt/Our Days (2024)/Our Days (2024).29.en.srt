00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 29=

4
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:40,556
Do you know this woman?

5
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:43,957
I don't.

6
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,036
She's Lin Xiao.

7
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,106
The former chancellor's daughter

8
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,517
from Gao Ping's institution.

9
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:50,906
She's now

10
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,237
at the Sanger Institute of Cambridge.

11
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:54,385
She's also helping Gao Ping apply for

12
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,077
an offer letter to the UK.

13
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:57,396
We found

14
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,466
her Weibo's alternate account

15
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,396
through Li Shu's

16
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:04,317
and discovered she had an affair
with Gao Ping.

17
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:05,945
They've been together

18
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:07,157
for at least six months.

19
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:10,317
Also,

20
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:11,626
Chai's friend

21
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,066
saw Gao Ping

22
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,066
and this woman

23
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,597
were at the Hyatt Hotel.

24
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,265
First

25
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:19,356
on Chinese New Year's Eve

26
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,837
and then again

27
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:23,785
on the day

28
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:24,916
of Lin Xiao's birthday.

29
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:28,317
It was March 11th.

30
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,636
Qian.

31
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,397
So?

32
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:41,756
So it means

33
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,437
this jerk cheated on you.

34
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:45,426
All of this

35
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,036
is part of his setup.

36
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:48,476
We can't

37
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,066
let him get away.

38
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:51,385
We must salvage his reputation.

39
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:53,356
We should call him out.

40
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:57,985
Xiang Nan,

41
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:58,825
I honestly don't want

42
00:02:58,826 --> 00:02:59,677
anything to do with him.

43
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:04,866
He's not the father

44
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,346
of my children either.

45
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:07,397
I...

46
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:09,146
But

47
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,225
how could he put you through
such big trouble

48
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,545
while living a good life

49
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:12,306
with Lin Xiao

50
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:13,186
and getting everything

51
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:14,466
he desires?

52
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:15,665
Lin Xiao even helped him apply for

53
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,146
an offer letter.

54
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:17,196
That's not fair!

55
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,516
Well,

56
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,636
I've already met

57
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:28,837
with his adviser.

58
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:32,956
I believe Mr. Lu will,

59
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,225
well,

60
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,956
make a fair judgment.

61
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:40,825
Even though I don't want

62
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:41,985
to have anything to do with him,

63
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:42,956
however,

64
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:46,196
reputation, money, or status,

65
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:47,385
none of these things

66
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:49,117
should be within his reach.

67
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:53,636
If anything goes wrong,

68
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,476
I'll put it right immediately.

69
00:03:58,147 --> 00:03:59,277
I see.

70
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,356
Since you've already made up your mind,

71
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,036
we'll respect your decision.

72
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,385
It's just that Xiang Zhong and I

73
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:07,586
can't bear to see you suffer so badly

74
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:09,236
because of him.

75
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:11,466
In that case,

76
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,196
I'll tell Xiang Zhong about it.

77
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,396
Qian,

78
00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:30,385
Xiang Zhong just texted me.

79
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:32,477
She's at Gao Ping's institution.

80
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,705
Boss, it's urgent.

81
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,357
I can't explain right now.

82
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,626
Xiang Zhong is at Gao Ping's institution.

83
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,276
Can you go check on her?

84
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:10,877
Gao Ping.

85
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:17,836
Why... Why are you here?

86
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,636
Don't you really know why I'm here?

87
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:24,317
Where were you on March 11th?

88
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:26,746
You were celebrating

89
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:28,636
your mistress's birthday
in a hotel room

90
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,756
while your child almost got abducted.

91
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:32,945
How could you do that

92
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,557
to my sister and the children?

93
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:36,426
Over the years,

94
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:39,357
my sister has supported you financially
and paid your tuition fee.

95
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,117
Have she ever mistreated you?

96
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,786
(Lectures on Molecular Biology Year 2023)
Do you know who his mistress is?

97
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:48,917
It's Lin Xiao, the daughter
of the chancellor, Mr. Lin.

98
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,786
Can we not talk about it here?

99
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:57,705
Let's go somewhere else.

100
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:58,557
Why?

101
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,186
Are you used to finding new places

102
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:01,756
to meet your mistress?

103
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,877
Is my sister not good enough for you?

104
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:06,917
What do you specialize in, really?

105
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:08,877
Living off women?

106
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,465
You seem to be an educated man,

107
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,756
but, in fact,
you're a cheating scoundrel.

108
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,265
Do your coursemates know

109
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:16,756
how sanctimonious you are?

110
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,156
Xiang Zhong, mind your mouth.

111
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,106
Yes, I have my selfish reasons.

112
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,276
What about your sister?

113
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:24,426
Why did she choose me?

114
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,956
Wasn't it because I was young,

115
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:27,477
highly educated,

116
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,716
and presentable to her parents?

117
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,317
Most importantly, I'm poor.

118
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,877
I'm poor enough to be controlled.

119
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,716
To her, I was a rug

120
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,546
to wipe away her failed marriage.

121
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:40,426
Did I contribute nothing?

122
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,716
Did I make no sacrifices?

123
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:42,705
Have you ever seen a guy

124
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:43,585
who would raise someone else's children

125
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,265
as his own for five years?

126
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:46,265
I...

127
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,265
Sorry.

128
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,426
You think you did nothing wrong

129
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,426
to cheat and live off my sister?

130
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:50,465
Xiang Zhong.

131
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,505
Xiang Zhong, stop.

132
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:52,705
You think it's unfair to be a father?

133
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:53,705
Eh?

134
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:54,786
So you chose to be a jerk?

135
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:55,797
Calm down, Xiang Zhong.

136
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:56,825
Enough.

137
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:58,516
Don't waste your energy on
someone like this.

138
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:04,196
That's enough.

139
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:07,836
Gao Ping.

140
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:13,276
You

141
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,917
could have had a happy life.

142
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:21,836
You're on your own now.

143
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,956
Let's go. Come on.

144
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,265
Scoundrel.

145
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,357
Jerk.

146
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,156
Do I have to deliver the goods?

147
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:46,516
Mom,

148
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,437
are you

149
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:53,705
getting a divorce with Dad?

150
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,106
Mom, is Dad not coming back?

151
00:07:57,107 --> 00:08:00,066
Qi says we won't see Dad again.

152
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,276
Is that true?

153
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:09,237
Yes.

154
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,477
Dad won't come back anymore.

155
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,306
There are some things

156
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:18,677
you're too young to understand now.

157
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,516
You'll know when you're older.

158
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:24,956
In this world,

159
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,917
there are many kinds of families.

160
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:31,437
Some families have a dad and a mom.

161
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:33,917
Some families have only a mom

162
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,037
or a dad.

163
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,506
For example, in your kindergarten

164
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:38,557
many of the children

165
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:39,985
are the only children

166
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,876
in their families right?

167
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,557
But you're different.

168
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:46,186
Cong has an elder sister,

169
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:47,517
and Qi has a younger brother.

170
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:48,465
Right?

171
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:51,876
Both of you are good friends and siblings.

172
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:55,076
You'll grow up together.

173
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:57,506
Right?

174
00:08:57,507 --> 00:08:58,225
Yes.

175
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:59,037
Yes.

176
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,625
What matters is

177
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,637
you'll live a happy life

178
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:07,876
with Grandpa, Grandma,

179
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:09,757
Aunt Zhong,

180
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,146
Aunt Nan.

181
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:11,666
That's right.

182
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,386
Yes.

183
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:13,836
And also your godfather.

184
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,266
They all love you very much,

185
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,116
right?

186
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:19,476
Very well.

187
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:21,956
Let's color the field here.

188
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,076
All right.

189
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:26,116
What happened
to this little penguin's face?

190
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:28,876
Aunt Nan.

191
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:31,637
You're having fun here.

192
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:35,277
Nice drawing.

193
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,116
Qian, let me read you something.

194
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:41,225
Moments of peace rarely last.

195
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:43,196
Life is full of chaos.

196
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:45,146
Even if the world is unfair to you,

197
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:47,196
hold onto a content and joyful heart.

198
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,225
Gently and silently love...

199
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:50,557
Enough.

200
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,437
Stop reading me this kind of thing.

201
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:54,225
They are helpful for you.

202
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,666
You need some positive energy

203
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,797
to cheer you up now.

204
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:06,105
The day when I decided to marry him,

205
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,076
I already made up my mind.

206
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:11,786
I don't want to hold on to someone

207
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:14,116
who doesn't want to be with me.

208
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,345
As for everything in the past,

209
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:17,876
we did it without complaints.

210
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,797
I don't want to argue over who did more.

211
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,517
When I was in Grade 7,

212
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:27,196
Aunty just got divorced and lost her job.

213
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:28,786
Every day after school,

214
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,546
Dad and Mom would send me to her place

215
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,076
to do homework and eat

216
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:35,236
because they were worried
about her being alone.

217
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:38,037
The next day,

218
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,836
Aunty came home
with a cart of winter melons

219
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,317
and started learning to cut hair.

220
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:45,546
Finally,

221
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:46,865
she became a certified hairdresser

222
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,066
and opened a hair salon

223
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,757
to start a new chapter in her life.

224
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,437
Aunty told me

225
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,026
nothing is impossible

226
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:56,476
if you can move on from it.

227
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:03,116
If you don't face
something nasty like this,

228
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,476
life isn't truly meaningful.

229
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:13,996
Anyway, I'm not the delicate
and dazzling type.

230
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:17,797
I'll just live a brave life.

231
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:21,956
I get it now.

232
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:24,716
You don't need advice.

233
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,196
You need a cart of winter melons.

234
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:28,757
I'll buy them for you.

235
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,517
What's wrong with you?

236
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:31,956
Don't you want to practice cutting hair?

237
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,797
You play with them. I'm going to cook.

238
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:36,146
Sure.

239
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:36,876
Come.

240
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:38,797
Let me see what you're doing.

241
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:53,945
(Weibo Content)
Is my sister not good enough

242
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,437
(This jerk doesn't deserve a single dime.)
for you?

243
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,157
What do you specialize in, really?

244
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:59,517
Living off women?

245
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:01,786
You seem

246
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,386
to be an educated man,

247
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:05,476
but, in fact,
you're a cheating scoundrel.

248
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:12,546
It's him, right?

249
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:13,945
Yes, that's him.

250
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,266
He's horrible.

251
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,116
Exactly.

252
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,786
I think he's that guy.

253
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:29,317
Yes, that's him.

254
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:31,037
Have you read the news?

255
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:40,825
Ms. Qin.

256
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,757
Gao Ping.

257
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:46,825
Come.

258
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:48,476
I was looking for you.

259
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,506
You were asked

260
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:51,865
to be the valedictorian

261
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,917
to give a speech
at the graduation ceremony.

262
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:56,397
The school authority
issued a notice just now

263
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:58,157
and asked us to replace you.

264
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,196
Why?

265
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:04,397
Didn't you see the trending search?

266
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,386
Gao Ping,

267
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,996
you've gone viral now.

268
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,210
(Look at this jerk.)

269
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:32,625
(This man has a questionable character.)

270
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:33,677
(He doesn't deserve to be a PhD.)

271
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:34,956
(He doesn't deserve it.)

272
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:35,825
(I strongly advocate)

273
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:37,356
(revoking his PhD.)

274
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:39,345
(His wife must be furious.)

275
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:41,277
(Has he lost his interest in his wife?)

276
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:52,836
Xiang Qian,

277
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,306
this is the data comparison

278
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,196
we just finished.

279
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:56,797
Please verify it.

280
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,076
Okay.

281
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,596
Did you check on the trending search?

282
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,917
It's about

283
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:05,906
a PhD from a famous research institution

284
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:07,637
who set up a divorce setup.

285
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,825
I saw another post

286
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:11,517
saying...

287
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,596
If there's nothing else,
I should get going.

288
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:39,345
Hurry up.

289
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:39,945
Coming.

290
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,236
What are you busy with?

291
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,557
I'm all done.

292
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:45,116
Do I look good?

293
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,426
It's just a simple meal.

294
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:48,906
Why are you

295
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:50,745
dressing like this?

296
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:51,945
You said we're meeting your friends

297
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:53,517
and asked me not to embarrass you.

298
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:55,266
Gu has

299
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,625
poor eyesight.

300
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,465
He can't even tell colors apart.

301
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,666
Do you really think he can see

302
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,066
what you're wearing?

303
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:00,666
Is it just him?

304
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,666
Of course.

305
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,825
He wants to introduce a date

306
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:03,625
to Xiang Zhong,

307
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:05,066
so he wants to discuss it with us.

308
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,225
Well, I'll change my clothes.

309
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:07,105
No need.

310
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,157
There's no time for that.

311
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:09,345
By the time you're done changing,

312
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:10,146
the restaurant will be closed.

313
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:11,637
Grandpa, Grandma.

314
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:13,306
Look at them.

315
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,116
Darlings are here.

316
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:16,666
Be careful.

317
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,836
Where's your brother?

318
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:19,985
Come on.

319
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,677
Give it to me.

320
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:23,836
What brings you here?

321
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:24,426
Mom,

322
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:25,386
why are you dressed so nicely?

323
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:26,317
Where are you going?

324
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,825
Your dad is taking me to meet a friend.

325
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:30,876
It's Mr. Gu.

326
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,236
Mom, I've been a bit busy lately.

327
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,506
I want Cong and Qi

328
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:37,236
to stay in Kunshan for a few days,
is that okay?

329
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,596
No problem.

330
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:39,906
Let's stay at Grandma's place,

331
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:40,906
all right?

332
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,146
Yay!

333
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:44,066
I love to stay at Grandma's place.

334
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,637
That's wonderful. Where's Gao Ping?

335
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:48,196
He went on a business trip

336
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:49,236
to work on a project in Fujian.

337
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,666
When you're here,

338
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,517
you have to listen
to Grandpa and Grandma.

339
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:53,745
Okay.

340
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:54,716
I'm leaving.

341
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,146
All right.

342
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:58,506
- Dad, Mom, if there's anything,
- See you, Mom.

343
00:15:58,507 --> 00:15:59,225
call me.

344
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,745
- Let's eat together.
- I need to work.

345
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,037
The traffic is terrible.

346
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:09,225
Where are you going?

347
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:09,906
I'll go and check on her.

348
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:11,186
How about Gu?

349
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,157
We still have time.

350
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,637
Xiang Qian.

351
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:19,956
Is something troubling you?

352
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:21,356
No.

353
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,345
If you have any problems,

354
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:24,757
don't hide them from me.

355
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:25,945
I know. Just go back.

356
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:27,317
Aren't you going out with Mom?

357
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,397
Remember to get enough rest.

358
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,476
Zhong.

359
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,797
Qian, you're back.

360
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,437
I brought the kids here.

361
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:53,317
Have you seen the trending search?

362
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:54,557
I did.

363
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:56,557
That's why I sent them here.

364
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:58,345
It's my fault.

365
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,757
I wasn't thinking.

366
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:02,266
But the post used an alias,

367
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:05,157
it won't affect the kids
too much, right?

368
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:07,225
I don't know.

369
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,466
They're on tablets every day.

370
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:12,436
I'm worried they might accidentally

371
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,665
click into the news.

372
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,557
Well, they can't read much.

373
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,306
Don't worry. It's summer break now.

374
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,037
I brought them back here

375
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:21,746
to keep Dad and Mom company.

376
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:23,797
That's pretty good.

377
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:25,825
You see, the video

378
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:27,905
has gone viral now.

379
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,356
Can it be taken down?

380
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,752
All right. I'll ask around about this.

381
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:32,167
I'm not sure if it'll work.

382
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:33,632
We'll find a way.

383
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:35,237
Right.

384
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,156
Anyway, I don't care

385
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:39,746
if people find out

386
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:40,997
what kind of person he is.

387
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:44,676
Qian, I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

388
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:45,506
Don't worry.

389
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:46,746
I don't blame you.

390
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:47,957
I'm just wondering

391
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:49,946
how to get Cong and Qi back

392
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:51,145
to their normal lives.

393
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:52,436
That matters more.

394
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,717
I'm heading to work now.

395
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:06,957
Mr. Lin,

396
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:09,237
did you ask for me?

397
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:11,076
Listen,

398
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,636
I've already sent Lin Xiao

399
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:14,997
back to the UK.

400
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,037
You should stop meeting each other.

401
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:18,477
I hope

402
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:19,706
you'll stop interfering

403
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,076
in her life anymore.

404
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:22,436
Let's end it here.

405
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:25,277
Mr. Lin, I...

406
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:27,076
I'm serious about Lin Xiao.

407
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,876
If she wasn't my daughter

408
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,957
and she didn't help you apply for
the offer letter,

409
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:34,237
would you still be with her?

410
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:36,557
Answer me.

411
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:40,237
Let me tell you this.

412
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:45,037
I appreciate your hard work and talent.

413
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:46,557
However,

414
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,037
no one is born into fairness.

415
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,836
Stop using the wrong methods

416
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:54,076
or stepping on others

417
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,037
to take shortcuts.

418
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,436
You'll only drag yourself
deeper into the mire.

419
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,636
I hope you will remember this
as a life lesson.

420
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,156
By the way,

421
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:09,436
I've sorted out

422
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,037
those things you and Lin Xiao

423
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:13,797
left in the room.

424
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,237
I wanted to throw them away.

425
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:20,317
But then,

426
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:24,037
I leave them at the building entrance.

427
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:25,156
Remember.

428
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:28,237
You're on your own now.

429
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:03,076
Mister.

430
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,717
Mister!

431
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:05,717
Mister.

432
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:07,797
Could you please help me
move some stuff?

433
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:08,946
No,

434
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:09,665
there's somewhere I need to be.

435
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,557
I can't help you.

436
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:11,466
Don't go.

437
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:12,625
I'll pay you.

438
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:13,957
I'll pay you. Is that okay?

439
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,585
All right, there. Wait for me there.

440
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:16,636
Wait there.

441
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:17,997
Thank you.

442
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:24,997
Everything is here?

443
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:26,197
Yes.

444
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:28,876
Two hundred.

445
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,237
Sorry?

446
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:32,797
How much?

447
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:33,905
Two hundred.

448
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:34,706
I'll transfer

449
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:35,916
all your stuff here.

450
00:20:36,106 --> 00:20:36,916
Wait.

451
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:38,585
That's not right.

452
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:40,026
That's actually robbery.

453
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:40,905
You can do it yourself, then.

454
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,425
I should get going now.

455
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:42,477
Wait.

456
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,116
Can you lower it a bit?

457
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,946
Thirty, okay? Thirty.

458
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:48,317
You may as well give me five.

459
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,356
Two hundred. Not a single cent less.

460
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:52,717
Fine.

461
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,836
I'll give you one hundred.

462
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:57,306
You don't have to do it.

463
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:58,345
I'll borrow your bike.

464
00:20:58,346 --> 00:20:59,836
I'll transport them myself, all right?

465
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,876
You need to load them yourself.

466
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:05,876
Well, help yourself.

467
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,277
Are you okay?

468
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,625
Give me another one hundred.

469
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:24,957
I'll help you.

470
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,797
Right?

471
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:28,916
Can you manage?

472
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:31,277
Wait,

473
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:32,636
are you really fine?

474
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,116
If not, I can help out.

475
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,116
Are you sure you can do it?

476
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,797
You can pay a bit more, right?

477
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,105
I'll help you if you do.

478
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:44,076
See?

479
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:47,197
Let me help you.

480
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:50,145
You're so stubborn.

481
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:51,237
You can't handle this.

482
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:57,596
Let me do it.

483
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,277
I'll hold them for you.

484
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,997
I won't charge you, okay?

485
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:02,905
If you really can't manage,

486
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,517
just add fifty more.

487
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:05,345
Right?

488
00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:05,986
No need. I'll do it myself.

489
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:06,625
I'll unload them

490
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,786
at the entrance.

491
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:08,425
No need.

492
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:09,026
Hey.

493
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,876
Hold the brake.

494
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:12,066
Hold the brake.

495
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,066
The handbrake down there.

496
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:13,757
Hold it.

497
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:18,916
My bike!

498
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,185
Why did you insist

499
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:22,836
when you can't even ride it?

500
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:25,746
It's only two hundred.

501
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:27,116
Look what happened.

502
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,266
You have to compensate for my bike.

503
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,037
Follow my live stream. Follow me.

504
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,396
My pants are torn.

505
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:32,385
You owe me my pants,

506
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:33,197
you know?

507
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:34,997
Did you hear me?

508
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:35,986
Here's something for you guys.

509
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,425
Here's something for you guys.

510
00:22:37,426 --> 00:22:38,145
Let me show you this.

511
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:39,865
A heartbroken young man

512
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:41,277
jumped into the river.

513
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:42,105
Hey.

514
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:43,717
You have to compensate me,
understand?

515
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:44,585
You owe me my bike

516
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:45,636
and pants.

517
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:47,066
Look at what you've done.

518
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:47,905
Come on, send me more gifts.

519
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:48,757
Look at this young man.

520
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:49,986
Look.

521
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:50,997
He's trying to kill himself.

522
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:52,706
Get the bike out of the water.

523
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:53,557
My goodness.

524
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:09,517
Look at him.

525
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:10,986
He's heartbroken
and trying to kill himself.

526
00:23:10,987 --> 00:23:12,116
Look. He throws

527
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:14,277
all his furniture into the water.

528
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:15,425
What are you up to?

529
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,037
Is it funny?

530
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:19,876
He's trying to hit me!

531
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:20,876
He's trying to hit me.

532
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,197
My nose.

533
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:28,557
My nose is broken.

534
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,076
Call the police!

535
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:39,797
Hello?

536
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:40,665
Hello.

537
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,076
Is this Ms. Xiang Qian?

538
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:43,517
Yes, I am.

539
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:45,026
We're Xuhui District

540
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:46,197
Street Police Station.

541
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:47,957
What's the matter?

542
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:49,836
Is Gao Ping

543
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:51,916
your husband?

544
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,185
What happened?

545
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:56,317
Here's the situation.

546
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:57,105
Your husband

547
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:58,197
got into a fight with a man

548
00:23:58,386 --> 00:23:59,916
and broke that man's nose.

549
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:02,477
His wound has been assessed

550
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,865
as a Grade 10 disability.

551
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:04,625
The injured party

552
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:05,665
is an influencer.

553
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,997
Initially, he demanded
a one million settlement.

554
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,557
After negotiation,

555
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,076
it's been reduced
to 300,000.

556
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:11,625
Would you be able

557
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,345
to come down to the police station

558
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:13,436
for the procedure?

559
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,266
What if

560
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,116
we can't afford the settlement?

561
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,825
If you can't afford it,

562
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:23,706
we'll have to treat this

563
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,037
as a criminal case.

564
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:27,596
Your husband may be charged
with aggravated assault.

565
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:31,625
In that case,

566
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:32,986
proceed as you see fit.

567
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:34,916
We're getting a divorce.

568
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,690
(Police)

569
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,676
Gao Ping,

570
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:00,636
try to think about

571
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:01,905
who else

572
00:25:01,906 --> 00:25:03,076
you can reach out to.

573
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,356
You can't just wait around like this.

574
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:12,636
The injured party gave you three days.

575
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:14,356
If you can't pay,

576
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:15,345
we'll have to proceed

577
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,916
with criminal charges as required.

578
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,237
Your relatives,

579
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:19,876
friends,

580
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:21,396
or coursemates,

581
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:24,396
is there really no one you can contact?

582
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,037
Buddy,

583
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,037
how did you slip so far?

584
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,105
Xiang Nan.

585
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:52,786
You're back.

586
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:53,676
Are you going out?

587
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:55,396
I'm heading to my studio.

588
00:25:58,866 --> 00:25:59,865
Did my brother

589
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,277
take you to his construction site
two days ago?

590
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:03,156
Yes. Why?

591
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:07,625
Your construction was suspended

592
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,665
because of the procedural issues.

593
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,356
It has nothing to do with me, right?

594
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:16,277
Did you investigate this?
Was that really necessary?

595
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,517
I didn't investigate it.
Someone told me.

596
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,026
Who told you?

597
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:22,317
Does it even matter?

598
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,997
What matters is, why you lied to me?

599
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:27,277
You condemned me
for something I didn't do.

600
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,916
Don't make it sound so serious.

601
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:32,836
I'm under tremendous stress
because of you.

602
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:36,356
Weren't the results good anyway?

603
00:26:37,386 --> 00:26:38,865
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

604
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:40,237
apologized to Biao.

605
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,266
Why do I have to apologize?

606
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,706
Is that really important?

607
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:46,957
Yes, it's very important.

608
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:48,836
If you had just listened to me

609
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,636
and apologized to Biao,

610
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:53,237
I wouldn't have done that to you.

611
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,436
So you're admitting it?

612
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:01,076
Did you really
have to pull such tricks on me?

613
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:03,717
I did it

614
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:05,076
to keep us out of harm's way

615
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:06,436
and for efficiency.

616
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:07,676
Also,

617
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:09,836
stay out of my work

618
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:11,436
from now on.

619
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:13,596
I don't like it.

620
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:18,197
I don't like it either.

621
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:25,997
Come in.

622
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:28,706
Mr. Jiang,

623
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:29,466
Mr. Tao from the engineering division

624
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:30,557
is waiting outside.

625
00:27:30,707 --> 00:27:31,757
Show him in.

626
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:32,876
All right.

627
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:56,396
Zhong.

628
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:58,076
Why did you come here?

629
00:27:58,826 --> 00:27:59,997
Well,

630
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:04,317
I got the certificate
as a smell specialist.

631
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:05,825
Really?

632
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:07,356
Congrats!

633
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:08,596
Besides,

634
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:09,986
there were more than 8,000 participants

635
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,066
from the Ministry
of Ecology and Environment

636
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,116
in the training.

637
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:14,517
Only 36 passed the exam.

638
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:16,625
What a surprise!

639
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:18,596
You're at the top of the heap.

640
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:20,905
So I thought

641
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,317
maybe we could

642
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,116
celebrate today.

643
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:26,665
Sure. Of course, we must celebrate this.

644
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,306
I'll buy you a meal.

645
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:28,477
Anything you like.

646
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:31,105
I also wanted to thank you

647
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:32,517
for helping me with my driving practice.

648
00:28:34,186 --> 00:28:35,317
Well,

649
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,636
let's go to our usual place.

650
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:40,317
Are you trying to save me some money?

651
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:42,066
Let's go.

652
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:42,836
Sure.

653
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:45,676
Well done. I really didn't expect that.

654
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:49,676
So your training session has ended?

655
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,197
Yes.

656
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:54,557
Are you

657
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,957
going back to your unit?

658
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,836
Yes, right.

659
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:09,436
I guess we won't run into each other

660
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:11,797
on the subway anymore.

661
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,145
That's good for you.

662
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:14,596
I hate squeezing in on the subway.

663
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:20,317
Zhong,

664
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,116
do you really plan to work

665
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:25,266
in Shanghai in the long term?

666
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:25,746
Yes.

667
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:27,546
I enjoy my current job.

668
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:28,185
You know what?

669
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:31,596
Two of my articles
got over ten million views.

670
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:33,037
I know.

671
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:33,706
You do?

672
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:34,345
Right.

673
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:35,625
I subscribed to your public account.

674
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:39,037
I've read all your articles.

675
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:40,237
You read them all?

676
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:41,266
What do you think?

677
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,037
Incredible.

678
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:44,625
Don't exaggerate.

679
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:45,226
I'm not.

680
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:45,665
I mean it.

681
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,876
They are incredible.

682
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:50,066
You know what? One of my readers

683
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,706
sent me a private message.

684
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,466
I was quite touched.

685
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:54,596
He said

686
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:57,676
he read two of my articles
about commuting,

687
00:29:57,866 --> 00:29:58,786
and they gave him a lump in his throat.

688
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:01,066
He's tired from the daily commuting,

689
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,385
but he still perseveres

690
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,596
with the job he likes.

691
00:30:05,106 --> 00:30:06,836
He felt encouraged.

692
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:08,145
That made me realize

693
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:12,396
that my current job was meaningful.

694
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:15,596
Yes, it's incredibly meaningful.

695
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,105
Can you say something

696
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,596
other than "incredible"?

697
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,517
Well, I just...

698
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:21,946
I just want to say

699
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,266
it's incredible.

700
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:25,557
Well, enough with the compliments.

701
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:30,436
You need to keep up
the good work as well.

702
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:32,557
Sure.

703
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,436
I will.

704
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:44,466
Ma'am, I'd like a bowl of prawn noodles.

705
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,105
What about you?

706
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:45,905
Eel noodles.

707
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:46,706
A bowl of eel noodles.

708
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:47,665
Order some more.

709
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,546
Do you want some gravy?

710
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,385
I can't eat much.

711
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:50,825
No?

712
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:52,356
It's on me. Eat as much as you like.

713
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:53,746
Are you sure that's enough?

714
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:54,786
All right, that's it.

715
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:55,517
Okay.

716
00:30:55,547 --> 00:30:56,557
Thank you.

717
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:58,425
Pick your orders up over there.

718
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,237
Who wants fish bone broth noodles?

719
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,105
No, I don't want.

720
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:03,277
You don't want this, either?

721
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:04,546
- What is that?
- Don't look back.

722
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:05,546
My old man is over there.

723
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:06,345
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

724
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:06,706
I want.

725
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:07,477
Let's go.

726
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:08,636
Fine, I'll eat it myself.

727
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,676
- Look at them.
- It's delicious.

728
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,076
Xiang Zhong.

729
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:26,905
Dad,

730
00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:27,916
you're here?

731
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,436
Haiyang,

732
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:33,717
are you eating here together?

733
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:37,436
We just happened to run into each other.

734
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:38,266
Right.

735
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:41,277
We ran into each other.

736
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:45,116
What's so special about today?

737
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,517
Why does everyone eat noodles today?

738
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:49,237
Come on in.

739
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:50,546
No. You go ahead.

740
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:51,345
Well.

741
00:31:51,346 --> 00:31:53,546
Mom and the kids are waiting
for you inside.

742
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:54,636
We're leaving, then.

743
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,596
Okay.

744
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:57,237
Xiang Zhong,

745
00:31:57,747 --> 00:32:00,517
how did you know the kids were inside?

746
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:02,076
Did you see us?

747
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:04,625
Qian sent them to Kunshan,

748
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:07,197
so I guess you wouldn't be here
without them, right?

749
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:08,957
Exactly.

750
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,636
Let's go inside.

751
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:11,957
Something came up. I have to go now.

752
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:13,757
Let's go, Haiyang.

753
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:15,717
Are you hungry?

754
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:17,746
I...

755
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:18,596
I...

756
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:20,277
Are you hungry?

757
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,266
I... I want noodles.

758
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:23,356
That's right. Come with me.

759
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:24,596
But I'm not hungry.

760
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,105
Oh, dear. What now?

761
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:29,156
I got to go now.

762
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:29,905
I should get going, too.

763
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,997
All right.

764
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,026
I need to work overtime.

765
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:35,237
I'm going that way.

766
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:36,197
Okay.

767
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:37,145
Bye-bye.

768
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:37,706
Sure.

769
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:38,797
Bye, Dad.

770
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,356
You're back, Madam.

771
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:58,636
What is it?

772
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:01,557
Mr. Jiang locked Xiaotong in the gym room

773
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,156
and took her phone.

774
00:33:03,507 --> 00:33:05,997
Xiaotong was yelling just now.

775
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:07,477
Why?

776
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:21,876
Xiaotong.

777
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:25,997
Xiang Nan,

778
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,145
is that you?

779
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:29,145
Yes, it's me.

780
00:33:29,146 --> 00:33:30,876
Can you let me out?

781
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:33,105
Why did your dad

782
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:34,356
lock you up?

783
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:36,066
I need to see Guy.

784
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:37,625
I must see him.

785
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:39,156
He's leaving today.

786
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:41,757
I just want to say goodbye.

787
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,916
It's no use telling me this.

788
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:46,836
You should talk to your dad.

789
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,546
If it weren't for Jiang Hongbin,

790
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:49,876
he wouldn't have left.

791
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:52,345
Jiang Hongbin kept
pressuring Guy's family

792
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:53,865
through the school,

793
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,665
forcing him to transfer.

794
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,797
His mother is taking him to Guangxi.

795
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:00,557
If I don't see him today,

796
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:02,557
I won't be able to meet him again.

797
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:11,076
Are you still there, Xiang Nan?

798
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:14,757
Yes, I am.

799
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,677
Madam, Xiantong, you are back.

800
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:32,677
Madam,

801
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,426
Mr. Jiang

802
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:35,597
came home early without notice.

803
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:37,637
He asks you to go to his study.

804
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:42,317
All right.

805
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:43,516
Got it.

806
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,356
Don't worry.

807
00:34:46,387 --> 00:34:47,516
Go upstairs first.

808
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:49,317
I'll talk to him.

809
00:34:50,226 --> 00:34:51,597
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

810
00:35:06,427 --> 00:35:08,197
Why are you back so early?

811
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,426
Would you rather

812
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,597
I come back late?

813
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:16,277
Yes.

814
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:17,426
Then,

815
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:19,036
I wouldn't have to explain anything.

816
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:28,466
If I hadn't found out

817
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:29,757
Jiang Xiaotong was gone,

818
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,197
were you not going to tell me?

819
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:35,836
As if you need me to tell you.

820
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:36,986
You have so many spies

821
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,717
keeping an eye on us.

822
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,797
There's nothing we can hide from you.

823
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:46,157
Where did you go earlier?

824
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:49,956
We went to say goodbye to Guy.

825
00:35:50,827 --> 00:35:51,996
Who is Guy?

826
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:56,717
He's the boy
whom you forced to transfer.

827
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:02,476
Xiang Nan,

828
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:04,797
do you know

829
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:08,117
why I locked Xiaotong in the room?

830
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:10,225
You know very well

831
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:12,036
I want to keep her away from that thug.

832
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,197
Why did you take her to see him?

833
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:16,996
Did you do it on purpose?

834
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:20,826
Did you have no friends

835
00:36:20,827 --> 00:36:21,996
when you were a teenager?

836
00:36:23,786 --> 00:36:26,026
Their teenage friendship is precious.

837
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:27,956
Besides, the boy is leaving today.

838
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:29,866
Can't you let Xiaotong

839
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:30,757
keep a good memory with him?

840
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:33,637
Friendship?

841
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:37,305
Do you know what her relationship

842
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:38,436
with that brat is?

843
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:40,705
I believe in what she said.

844
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:41,836
I do not.

845
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:42,986
When she told me

846
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:44,516
she was bullied at school,

847
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:45,836
do you know

848
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:48,105
how many sleepless nights

849
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:48,996
I had over that?

850
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,757
If I had insisted
on keeping her back then,

851
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:54,157
she wouldn't have been hurt.

852
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:56,197
I even thought of going to Canada myself

853
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,876
to teach those thugs a lesson.

854
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,386
But all my worries seem
to be a joke to her.

855
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:07,906
What if she's telling the truth this time?

856
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:09,105
What if she didn't lie to you?

857
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,836
I don't care whether it's true or not.

858
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:13,996
Xiang Nan,

859
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,277
I'm not discussing this with you.

860
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,317
Jiang Xiaotong is my daughter.

861
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:21,876
It's my right to teach her in my way.

862
00:37:21,987 --> 00:37:24,516
You have no say in this matter.

863
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:26,077
I hope you won't make

864
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,197
such a stupid mistake again.

865
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:30,237
She's only a teenager.

866
00:37:30,306 --> 00:37:32,466
She can choose what she wants to do

867
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,066
and who she wants to be.

868
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,506
Why do you have to

869
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:36,386
keep forcing everyone

870
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,157
to become who you want us to be?

871
00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:40,597
What are you getting at?

872
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:48,197
Jiang Xiaotong, Jiang Jiaqiao, and me.

873
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,757
Have you ever respected us?

874
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:52,466
Have you ever asked us

875
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:53,717
about what we truly wanted?

876
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,265
Do you think this is the way
to show us care?

877
00:37:56,266 --> 00:37:57,906
I'm telling you, no!

878
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,625
You are stripping us of our basic rights.

879
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:01,506
Let me tell you this.

880
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:02,876
You do not have the right to do that.

881
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:04,996
Yes, I do.

882
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:06,036
No, you don't.

883
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:07,356
Stand right there.

884
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,677
Are you insane?

885
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,346
Let's make this clear.

886
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:12,145
What are you doing?

887
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:13,197
Let go of me!

888
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,876
Stop challenging me ever again.

889
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:40,717
Mom, is Dad a bad guy?

890
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:42,996
Why are you asking this?

891
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:45,105
Dad didn't pick up our calls.

892
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:47,836
Does Dad not want us anymore?

893
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:50,745
Dou's dad didn't answer his call,

894
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,757
and his mom thought he was a bad guy.

895
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:56,717
You miss Dad, don't you?

896
00:38:58,266 --> 00:38:59,916
We miss you too, Mom.

897
00:39:01,427 --> 00:39:03,637
I'll be back soon to fetch you.

898
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:06,105
In the meantime,

899
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:10,197
do listen to Grandpa and Grandma, okay?

900
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:12,597
Okay, Mom.

901
00:39:13,347 --> 00:39:14,346
Bye-bye.

902
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:15,546
I'll come and fetch you back soon.

903
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:17,036
Bye-bye.

904
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:18,237
Bye-bye.

905
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,916
Attorney Wu, could you please

906
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:33,906
look into

907
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,916
Gao Ping's situation now?

908
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:47,197
(Attorney Wu: Gao Ping has been transferred
to the detention center.)

909
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:48,346
(I heard that his aunt)

910
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:49,305
(is selling her house)

911
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:50,436
(to raise money for him.)

912
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:12,237
Why are you up?

913
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:13,906
Come.

914
00:40:13,907 --> 00:40:15,396
I saw you got up.

915
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,476
Do you really believe

916
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:21,077
Haiyang and Xiang Zhong

917
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:23,757
ran into each other there earlier today?

918
00:40:26,947 --> 00:40:28,956
Do you believe in
the coincidence like that?

919
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:32,105
So

920
00:40:32,106 --> 00:40:34,036
they might get back together?

921
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:38,077
It'll be good

922
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:39,516
if that's true.

923
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,117
But Haiyang's mom

924
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:44,237
is such a pain.

925
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:48,916
Still, they can't abandon her.

926
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:54,597
You see,

927
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,876
what's wrong with these two girls?

928
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,556
Xiang Nan

929
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:00,466
married Jiang Hongbin,

930
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,117
who has a troublesome sister.

931
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,145
Xiang Zhong

932
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:05,237
married Haiyang, who is pretty good,

933
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:07,876
but his mom is a problem.

934
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,077
As for me,

935
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,117
I have the little tag-along.

936
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:15,117
Did they take it after us?

937
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:16,745
Is it after me

938
00:41:16,746 --> 00:41:17,876
or after you?

939
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:20,785
You're so blessed.

940
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:22,356
You're different from their case.

941
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:23,597
Certainly.

942
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:25,757
These two girls

943
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:27,317
didn't inherit good fortune

944
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:28,836
from us.

945
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:31,677
They're not as lucky as I am.

946
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:16,556
Why didn't you come home last night?

947
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,556
I was working at my studio.

948
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:34,745
