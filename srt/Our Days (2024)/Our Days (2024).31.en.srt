=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 31=

4
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,429
So are you planning to take a long leave

5
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:43,309
or are you going to resign?

6
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,029
Were the reasons

7
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:48,309
I gave for quitting

8
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,149
not good enough?

9
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:52,630
Alright.

10
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,869
If you've made up your mind,

11
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,029
go ahead and submit the letter.

12
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,350
What is it?

13
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,589
Do you feel a bit upset

14
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,789
because I didn't try to keep you?

15
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:07,389
You should at least do the motion

16
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,110
and persuade me.

17
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:11,270
Didn't we just talk

18
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,550
about wanting to live
like your second aunt,

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,190
chic and carefree?

20
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,070
How about

21
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,910
I leave the job with you?

22
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,389
We can start our own business.

23
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:23,150
I can do that. That's fine by me.

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,190
The ball is in your court.

25
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,109
Xiang.

26
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,669
Xiang Qian joined the helping group.

27
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:02,630
How did she know?

28
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:03,430
Here.

29
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:04,829
Look.

30
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,910
I can't see. Just read it to me.

31
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,070
Thank you everyone.

32
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,190
I received a lot of care in the past

33
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:12,150
especially with all the hush-hush.

34
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:13,310
Thank you.

35
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:16,229
I'm telling you people to keep secret.

36
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,310
Who...

37
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,549
There's more.

38
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:19,310
What?

39
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,150
One more thing.

40
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,870
I've resigned.

41
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,709
She quit?

42
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,229
So you really chose

43
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,549
to live the retiree life?

44
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,310
I wouldn't dare retire.

45
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,630
I still have a house to pay off

46
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,669
and two kids to send to school.

47
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:42,470
I'm glad you remember

48
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,109
you still have a mortgage.

49
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,949
Xiang Qian.

50
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:47,789
Did you quit

51
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:48,949
a little too recklessly?

52
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,269
It's not, Dad.

53
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,470
I thought long and hard about it.

54
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,229
The company I'm at

55
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,750
has too many rules and red tapes.

56
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,910
If I stayed,

57
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:58,949
I doubt it'd have any progress.

58
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,350
I wish to look for...

59
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:02,310
How do I put it,

60
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:02,949
a company

61
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,630
I'm more aligned with.

62
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,310
You think you run a company?

63
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,229
You think you can choose

64
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,070
whichever you want?

65
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,549
Is it that easy, child?

66
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,829
I know it's not easy.

67
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,470
I've worked for a long time.

68
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,909
I have social experience,

69
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,430
and also work experience.

70
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,070
Right?

71
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,870
I also have social resources.

72
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,430
So don't worry too much, Dad.

73
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:32,149
You.

74
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:34,709
You never liked to talk to us

75
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,949
about things ever since young.

76
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,909
You want to make your own decisions.

77
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:42,469
I won't say more

78
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,310
about your work.

79
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,190
Now, the matter of you

80
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,949
and Gao Ping.

81
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:48,389
You only told us

82
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,509
about it much later.

83
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:51,790
I know.

84
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:54,589
You didn't want to tell us

85
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:55,990
and make us worry.

86
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,790
But did you

87
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,269
think how your mom and I would feel?

88
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,550
Our child...

89
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,269
When they're grown up,

90
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,990
they start to move further away
from the parents.

91
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,349
I didn't know how to break it to you.

92
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,709
You didn't know how to say it

93
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,149
so you suffered alone.

94
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:19,469
Is it any better because

95
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,550
we didn't know?

96
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,149
Right.

97
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,790
When you were younger,

98
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,389
Mom and I had put you under

99
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:31,310
a lot of pressure.

100
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,670
Back then, we as parents

101
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,029
were too vain.

102
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,389
We cared too much about
what the neighbors thought.

103
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,149
Hence we paid attention

104
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,509
to whether your boyfriend

105
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,670
is of a certain status

106
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:45,990
or has the capabilities.

107
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,149
Thinking back now,

108
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,349
what do those things matter?

109
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,750
Not even dog shit.

110
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,269
What your mom and I

111
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:54,509
really care about

112
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,829
is whether

113
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,389
you are living well.

114
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,509
Even though it dazzles on the outside,

115
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:03,829
deep down, you're unhappy.

116
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:05,349
Do you think we'd be glad?

117
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,670
Gao Ping that jerk.

118
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,829
I can't believe how he tormented you.

119
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:15,990
Karma will come for him.

120
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,310
Dad, stop it.
Don't waste your anger on him.

121
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,029
What's happened has happened.

122
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,589
I rather not talk about it.

123
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,070
From now on, when something is wrong,

124
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,790
don't keep it to yourself

125
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,829
and suffer alone.

126
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,310
Talk to your mom and I.

127
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,349
I wonder how things are

128
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,070
with Xiang Zhong and Haiyang.

129
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,269
You don't say.

130
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,029
If those two

131
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,310
actually got back together,

132
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,589
it'd be pretty amazing.

133
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:56,630
I think so too.

134
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,029
Right?

135
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,430
I can see that Deng Haiyang

136
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:01,829
has undergone a huge change.

137
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:05,670
No matter what,

138
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,829
we should stay out of their business.

139
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,190
We should respect

140
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,269
their decisions.

141
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,110
Right?

142
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,269
I've always respected

143
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,430
you guys' decisions.

144
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,750
Did you?

145
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,509
Didn't I?

146
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,870
Yes, sure.

147
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,909
You always respect us.

148
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,430
Geez.

149
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,630
I'm learning along the way too.

150
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:28,670
So you guys

151
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,709
should give me space

152
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:33,469
for me to grow.

153
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,310
Sure we will.

154
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,909
We'll give you

155
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,149
as much space as you need,

156
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,029
okay?

157
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,110
Child,

158
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,750
no matter what

159
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,029
you encounter,

160
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,829
you have to put your happiness

161
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,070
and well-being

162
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,070
first.

163
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,389
Why did you ask me out?

164
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,269
It's nothing.

165
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,790
I was running an errand nearby

166
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,509
so I thought I'd ask you out for lunch.

167
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:12,709
Is that so?

168
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,709
Is it really so convenient?

169
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,349
Actually, not super convenient.

170
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,909
Deng Haiyang

171
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:23,630
has been showing up

172
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,389
a lot lately.

173
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,110
What's going on between you two?

174
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,190
There...

175
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,870
is nothing going on.

176
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:35,269
But Deng Haiyang

177
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:36,909
has indeed changed a lot.

178
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:39,670
His training in Shanghai just ended.

179
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:40,910
So he'll be returning

180
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:41,949
to his life

181
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:42,989
and work.

182
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:45,749
Who knows that might
just undo all the changes?

183
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:46,949
Moreover, you know

184
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,109
how his mom is.

185
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,670
I don't even dare think about it.

186
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,109
Then let's disregard his mom for now.

187
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:53,949
What is your standpoint

188
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,109
on you two's relationship?

189
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,989
Dad said

190
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:00,869
they bumped

191
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:01,910
into you two while out eating.

192
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,790
The old man is anxious to find out

193
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:06,949
your inclination.

194
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,430
You do know

195
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,190
that he has a soft spot
for Deng Haiyang.

196
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,310
I'm not sure myself.

197
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,749
Thanks.

198
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:24,310
Is this okay?

199
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,109
Yes.

200
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,270
Never mind me.

201
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:27,349
What's your plan now

202
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,109
after you quit?

203
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,670
I don't know yet.

204
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,589
I've been enjoying spending time

205
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:35,749
with the kids at home.

206
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,109
As long as you're happy.

207
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,109
Has Gao Ping paid you back?

208
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,030
We just spoke.

209
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,390
He's going to pay me back bit by bit
every month

210
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:44,910
starting from when he gets his salary.

211
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:46,510
What is he doing now?

212
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:50,030
He's working as a technician at some

213
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,989
intestinal research institute

214
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:53,030
in Guangdong.

215
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:55,270
What kind of intestinal research?

216
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,030
Supposedly, you analyze

217
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:00,270
excrement

218
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,709
to study

219
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,510
the human intestinal flora.

220
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,910
Meaning to say,

221
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,629
his daily work

222
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,829
is studying human feces.

223
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:11,349
I think so.

224
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,390
A jerk studying human excrement.

225
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,709
I'd say that's a pretty good match.

226
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,910
Whatever.

227
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,749
Anyway, it's a good thing

228
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,629
that he found a new job

229
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,829
and is living a new life.

230
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:26,829
It smells good.

231
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:28,869
Waiter,

232
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,270
can we have two forks?

233
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,790
I'm famished.

234
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,070
The day-lighting is quite good.

235
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:46,829
It's just that the location
is too remote.

236
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,109
With

237
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:51,469
our current funds,

238
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:53,629
this is the best lot

239
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:54,829
we can afford.

240
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,430
We?

241
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,550
I've submitted
my resignation letter too.

242
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,790
Didn't I tell you?

243
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,910
You really quit?

244
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:07,629
I told you.

245
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:08,869
You quit, I quit.

246
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,510
Then we'll start a business together.

247
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,989
Are we that close?

248
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:18,949
Don't overthink it.

249
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:22,629
Don't think I'm following you.

250
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:24,989
I am pulling you over

251
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,869
to continue to exploit
your untapped labor

252
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,190
so that you can create value for me,

253
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,910
get it?

254
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,749
Actually,

255
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,589
I've long been thinking about

256
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,190
starting my own company.

257
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,469
It's just that, with the current

258
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,270
general state,

259
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,589
no work is easy.

260
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,869
It's even harder
when you're doing it alone.

261
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:46,629
That's why

262
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:47,670
I've been dallying.

263
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:48,709
But we both saw

264
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,749
how the company is right now.

265
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,749
Personnel infighting is bad.

266
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:53,310
Constantly fighting among ourselves,

267
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:54,989
we'd collapse before long, no?

268
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,869
Might as well try my luck elsewhere.

269
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,190
Agreed.

270
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,150
With my resources

271
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,989
and your marketing skills,

272
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:11,510
our one plus one

273
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,550
will definitely be larger than 20.

274
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,070
Why is it 20

275
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:16,949
and not 100?

276
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,270
I was going to say 200.

277
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:20,869
But we shouldn't talk big.

278
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,510
Taking 1 for 10,

279
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:23,709
you and I together

280
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,349
would only equal to 20.

281
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:26,430
So 20 it is.

282
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,869
Let me remind you.

283
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,869
You should really think this through.

284
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,510
My luck has been pretty bad lately.

285
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,629
I don't want it to affect
the success of your company.

286
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:38,670
Luck is bad?

287
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,589
You can always change it.

288
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:41,949
How?

289
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:44,629
The answer is,

290
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,349
sincerity is the key to success.

291
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:48,949
Come,

292
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,589
let's fix your bad luck right away.

293
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,390
How is coming here
going to change my luck?

294
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:05,310
This is White Crane Temple.

295
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,229
I chanced upon it while passing through

296
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,270
and discovered this

297
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,390
awesome angle.

298
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:13,989
Isn't it beautiful?

299
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,829
Wait a bit

300
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,629
for the bell to ring.

301
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:21,629
When the bell rings,

302
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,510
go ahead and make a wish.

303
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,510
Perhaps on the line of

304
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,030
prosperity for the company

305
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,390
or hoping that it'd get listed.

306
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,790
Will they ring the bell?

307
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,109
From what I know about temples,

308
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,150
they...

309
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,310
ring the bell in the morning
and beat the drum in the evening.

310
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,550
Haven't you heard the midnight bell ring

311
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,629
announcing the boat's arrival?

312
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:42,390
That's ringing the bell at night, no?

313
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,229
Bro, that's Hanshan Temple.

314
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,150
Hanshan Temple, White Crane Temple,

315
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,030
they're all temples,

316
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:49,989
places of purity.

317
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:51,749
And ringing the bell is auspicious.

318
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,390
See how they ring the bell

319
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,270
when the company is listing?

320
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,390
When was the last time you came?

321
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,670
Will they really ring it?

322
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,550
I'm sure it will.

323
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:09,949
As for when...

324
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:11,589
I know.

325
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,070
I'll ask a friend.

326
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:15,989
If that doesn't work,

327
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,510
I'll ask him to ring it for us.

328
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,989
Are you showing off
your social resources?

329
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,550
You seem to have friends everywhere.

330
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:25,349
Got it.

331
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,869
Just wait.

332
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,310
It's ringing.

333
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:38,749
It's ringing.

334
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,390
Make a wish, quick!

335
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,790
Where is the sound coming from?

336
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,510
Never mind that.

337
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,790
Go on and make a wish.

338
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:47,949
Your phone is ringing.

339
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,869
Come on.

340
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,829
Why must you be

341
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,469
so meticulous?

342
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,709
I knew it couldn't have come

343
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,229
from there.

344
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,949
Hurry up and make a wish.

345
00:14:58,109 --> 00:14:59,190
The bell is ringing anyway.

346
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,310
Done?

347
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:27,070
Don't worry.

348
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,390
Everything will be alright.

349
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,190
Chai Jin, thank you.

350
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,430
This is nothing to thank me for.

351
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,030
Thank you for your willingness

352
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,270
to share weal and woe,

353
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,030
for wanting to start a business with me.

354
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,070
If not because

355
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,390
you're still useful,

356
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,390
I wouldn't have asked you.

357
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,629
Yi Yi.

358
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,989
Xiang Nan.

359
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:32,550
What happened?

360
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:33,829
Why did the police take

361
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:34,589
Xu Miao away?

362
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,070
They said she is suspected
of occupational embezzlement.

363
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,829
Occupational embezzlement?

364
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,910
Xu Miao would never.

365
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:43,469
Xu Miao said

366
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,510
Jiang came here a few days ago

367
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,229
with his accountant

368
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,310
and went over the accounts with her.

369
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:49,150
A few days ago?

370
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,790
How come

371
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:52,070
you guys didn't say anything?

372
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:52,949
We thought it wasn't so serious

373
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:53,589
at the time.

374
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,829
So we didn't tell you,

375
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,030
lest it made things

376
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,030
worse between you and Jiang.

377
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,030
Where are you going?

378
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,109
Hey...

379
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,310
Jiang Hongbin.

380
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:07,949
Why was Xu Miao

381
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:08,949
taken by the police?

382
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,149
Did you plot against her?

383
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,149
I didn't plot anything.

384
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,389
She fabricated a fake contract
and took the money.

385
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,990
Some business partner she is.

386
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,589
You didn't even realize you got scammed.

387
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,149
Xu Miao would never do that.

388
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:20,030
True or not,

389
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,189
it's no use telling me.

390
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,710
If she hadn't,

391
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,070
why are the police questioning her then?

392
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,669
Xiang Nan,

393
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,950
if you

394
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,990
really want to help your friend,

395
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,030
we can talk about it

396
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,990
at home tonight.

397
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,869
Otherwise,

398
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:39,550
teaching her a lesson
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

399
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:41,109
Close the door.

400
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,349
You're back, Mr. Jiang.

401
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,270
Is Xiang Nan home?

402
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,470
Is madam coming back?

403
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,909
Never mind.

404
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,429
Hongbin, you're back.

405
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,629
Jiaqiao.

406
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:32,310
Give Xiang Nan a call.

407
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:33,349
Ask her where she is.

408
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:34,389
Xiang Nan?

409
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,710
Is she coming back?

410
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,750
What...

411
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:55,070
Sorry.

412
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,230
The number you've dialed

413
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,470
is currently unreachable.

414
00:18:57,829 --> 00:18:58,950
Please try again later.

415
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:03,189
Hongbin,

416
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,790
Xiang Nan said she's not coming back.

417
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,950
All the things have been delivered?

418
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,270
Why didn't you ask the deliverymen

419
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,790
to unpack the boxes

420
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,589
before leaving?

421
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,270
Unpacking

422
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,470
costs 100 for every item.

423
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,310
It's only 100.

424
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,990
100 is still money.

425
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,270
When starting out,

426
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,790
every penny counts.

427
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:52,869
Ma'am,

428
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,669
you're being too miserly.

429
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,470
Hurry up and unpack.

430
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,030
I don't know how to unpack that.

431
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,750
I'll handle this.

432
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,629
You want me to do it?

433
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:07,750
I...

434
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,550
Okay, yes. I can do it.

435
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,349
Okay.

436
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,310
What happened?

437
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,310
It's nothing.

438
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,909
Just a little prick.

439
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,189
I'm okay.

440
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,149
Be careful, okay?

441
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,070
You've got everything ready.

442
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:48,349
It's like

443
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,750
a mobile nurse station.

444
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:52,149
Disinfect it first.

445
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,589
It's fine.

446
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,750
No need to be so tedious.

447
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:55,790
Here.

448
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:57,710
Take it and wipe it down.

449
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,510
Okay.

450
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:00,829
This is how it is

451
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:01,710
when mothers go out.

452
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,310
See? There are teddy bears.

453
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:05,790
I guess

454
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,909
I'm receiving attention
thanks to my godson.

455
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,710
This business partner of mine

456
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,909
is truly a gem.

457
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,750
Not only is she self-sufficient,

458
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,310
she also takes care of others.

459
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:26,470
I rather not be self-sufficient

460
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,109
and care for others.

461
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:27,829
Spend the money.

462
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,869
Pay someone to unpack.

463
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,070
That's the idea.

464
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:31,990
See?

465
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:33,109
The little helper

466
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:33,990
is a fast learner.

467
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,349
Killing a chicken with an ox knife

468
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,550
is a waste of resource, understand?

469
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,349
Yes, okay.

470
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,629
Come, let's eat.

471
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,270
By the way,

472
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,070
about the old town renovation project
where your parents live.

473
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:52,869
I heard Hongjiang Group

474
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:54,669
is likely to win the bid.

475
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:57,790
Is Jiang Hongbin involved

476
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,470
with the old city renovation?

477
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,030
He never said anything.

478
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,189
Is he supposed to report

479
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,669
his plans to you first?

480
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,909
I've seen

481
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,030
their plans though.

482
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,510
There are two commercial towers.

483
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,750
And an elderly care facility.

484
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,990
Really?

485
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:18,869
We should go for the project.

486
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:20,149
If you're interested,

487
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:21,109
it's fine with me.

488
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:22,149
However,

489
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,310
no need to force yourself.

490
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:24,950
I know previously

491
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:26,550
you didn't want Jiang Hongbin

492
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,990
to become a client of the company.

493
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:29,070
That's because

494
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,030
you didn't want to have any

495
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,230
vested interests with family,

496
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:32,869
am I right?

497
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,909
But this time it's different.

498
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,869
I've always wanted

499
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,189
to work on an elderly care facility.

500
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:38,750
Plus, it'll be at my family home.

501
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:40,030
That's even more meaningful.

502
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,909
Anyway, whether or not
we'll get to work on it

503
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,070
will depend on our proposal

504
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,829
for the bid.

505
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,270
I'm quite confident

506
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,109
in our proposal.

507
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,149
Good.

508
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:53,829
Let me call him.

509
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,070
Check out that efficiency.

510
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:56,710
Never missing a beat.

511
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:08,189
Hongbin.

512
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,470
Are you free these few days?

513
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,669
Could we have a meal together?

514
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,720
(I'm quite busy this week.
Is it urgent?)

515
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,360
(Jiang Hongbin:
I can do tomorrow lunch.)

516
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,389
What did he say?

517
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,589
That was fast.

518
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,230
He said he can do tomorrow lunch.

519
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:42,149
Nice.

520
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,349
That's what I like about you,

521
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,230
your positive

522
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,470
and enterprising attitude.

523
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,950
Today,

524
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,030
I'll be in charge of the drinking

525
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,869
and you'll handle the talk.

526
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:00,629
After all, it's not appropriate for you

527
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:01,669
to both drink and chat

528
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,869
with your brother-in-law, right?

529
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:05,070
Stop it.

530
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,030
You're making me nervous now.

531
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:12,790
Sir,

532
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,710
all the dishes are here.

533
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,349
Please enjoy.

534
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,349
Okay, thanks.

535
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:16,829
Please remove this.

536
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,270
Thank you.

537
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,950
So sorry.

538
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,909
I came late.

539
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,349
Mr. Jiang.

540
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:34,710
Hongbin.

541
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:36,230
We should apologize instead.

542
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:37,030
We know you're busy

543
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,470
but we're still taking up your time.

544
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,710
Xiang Qian asked me out.

545
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:40,909
I'd make time no matter how busy I am.

546
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,589
Mr. Chai, long time no see.

547
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,750
Yes, it's been some time.

548
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:45,149
You're a busy man.

549
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,349
Work is work, but remember
to take care of your health.

550
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,070
I have been quite bogged down lately.

551
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,990
Come, sit down.

552
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,629
Yes.

553
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:51,750
I'll take up on your offer.

554
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,270
Yes.

555
00:24:58,429 --> 00:24:59,070
This is...

556
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:01,790
Xiang Qian.

557
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,710
You suddenly asked me out to eat.

558
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:05,869
Is there something you wanted

559
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:06,710
to tell me?

560
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:10,070
Hongbin, initially

561
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,189
when I was at the company,

562
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:13,790
despite instances where our businesses

563
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:14,589
overlapped,

564
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:15,750
I tried my best

565
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,869
not to trouble you if I could.

566
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,829
Better to keep our professional
and private matters separate.

567
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,310
But now, Chai Jin and I

568
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:22,790
have left the company.

569
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,149
We're starting our own business

570
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,030
and set up a company.

571
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,310
I've heard.

572
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:27,149
Congratulations.

573
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,470
So,

574
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:31,629
we want

575
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,829
to strive for good

576
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,230
business opportunities

577
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,669
for the new company.

578
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,310
We heard that

579
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:39,790
you'd be bidding...

580
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:41,030
Our family home...

581
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,270
Bid for the old city renovation project

582
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,510
where my parents are staying.

583
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,829
In your project proposal,

584
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:47,750
there are two commercial blocks

585
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,669
and an elderly care facility.

586
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,990
So I'm wondering if

587
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:53,510
we're able to work on
the smart home elements

588
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,629
for the three projects.

589
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,510
Xiang Qian,

590
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:00,429
you two

591
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,189
are planning ahead, huh?

592
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,109
I haven't won the bid yet,

593
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,030
and here you are

594
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,990
discussing business with me.

595
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,070
It's because

596
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,829
we're just starting up.

597
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,149
If we don't get a head-start,

598
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,710
how would we win the bid?

599
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,389
Yes, yes.

600
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,669
I'll be frank with you.

601
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,710
The possibility of us

602
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:21,070
winning the bid

603
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:22,189
is pretty high.

604
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,149
But,

605
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:25,869
currently, many good companies

606
00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:27,790
are eyeing the outsourced projects.

607
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:30,349
Moreover, a lot of them
are well established.

608
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,669
So, we can only employ

609
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:36,030
a unified public bidding.

610
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,109
This way, we won't ruffle
anyone's feathers

611
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,829
and also be responsible
to the government.

612
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,550
It will be decided

613
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,510
using each company's proposal
and quotation.

614
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,909
If yours is good,

615
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,470
I'm all for it.

616
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,109
But if it's not favorable,

617
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,149
I can't make a case for it.

618
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,429
Understood.

619
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,070
I know that is the best way.

620
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:55,829
Well...

621
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,710
We should separate public
from personal interests.

622
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,310
So we...

623
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:01,389
We'll fight for it with our proposal,

624
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,109
yes?

625
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,189
Although

626
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,629
speaking in private,

627
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:06,990
we are family after all.

628
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,349
I...

629
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,310
will be inclined

630
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:11,950
to have some preference.

631
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,070
As long as I'm not put in
too difficult a position.

632
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,429
No, no,

633
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:17,470
that will not happen.

634
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:20,310
Here, Mr. Jiang.

635
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,030
Allow me to toast to you.

636
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:24,270
Well,

637
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:25,790
we are a small company

638
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:26,470
just starting out.

639
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:27,710
I hope you'll take us

640
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,629
under your wing.

641
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,589
We don't treat family members
as strangers.

642
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,389
We should share our resources.

643
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,310
You never know.

644
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:35,829
In the future,

645
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,109
I might require your assistance.

646
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:38,230
Come on now.

647
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,389
Feel free to tell us
if you need anything.

648
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,669
Here.

649
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:43,429
I won't drink.

650
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:43,990
I'm the driver.

651
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,510
Yes, yes, she's driving today.

652
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:46,669
- Bottoms up.
- Be my guest.

653
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
(Ming Wei)

654
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,750
Hello, Ming Wei.

655
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,550
I was in a meeting.

656
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:09,990
Why did you call me?

657
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,470
I asked you to help me

658
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:15,030
find someone

659
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:16,270
to handle the higher-ups.

660
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,669
I've found

661
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,829
a suitable candidate.

662
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:22,470
Who is it?

663
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:27,230
You could say it's a family member.

664
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,429
Don't worry.

665
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,230
If anything bad happens,

666
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,429
they'll bear
the consequences themselves.

667
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,030
We won't be implicated.

668
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:09,470
Door unlocked.

669
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,270
Xu Miao.

670
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:16,669
What happened? Are you okay?

671
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:21,070
I'm sorry.

672
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:23,429
It's all my fault.

673
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,750
You didn't do anything wrong.

674
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,429
Why are you apologizing?

675
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,230
You weren't harmed, were you?

676
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,909
What exactly happened?

677
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,349
Tell us.

678
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:46,270
It's because

679
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:47,990
of the 300 pieces of ornaments.

680
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:49,990
They required a 5% interval fee

681
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,389
to be transferred to a private account.

682
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,030
So I made two labor contracts

683
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,189
to take out the money first.

684
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,189
If you transfer money from a public
to a private account,

685
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:57,510
the bank will investigate.

686
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,909
I had explained

687
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,149
to Jiang

688
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:00,990
beforehand.

689
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:03,230
I really don't get why

690
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:05,070
he still chose to report it.

691
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,669
He's forcing me to go back

692
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,750
and plead with him.

693
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,270
I'm sorry, Xu Miao.

694
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,349
You got sacrificed because of me.

695
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:18,990
Xiang Nan,

696
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:20,869
we are beyond pleasantries.

697
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:23,990
During my time inside,

698
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,589
a lot went through my mind.

699
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,389
Jiang Hongbin

700
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,270
is too powerful.

701
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:31,149
We can't possibly beat him.

702
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,950
So I thought

703
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,470
if I couldn't confront him,

704
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,669
I could at least hide.

705
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,669
If I run,

706
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:39,310
at least I know I'll be safe.

707
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,349
I've got friends

708
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:46,030
who are running a studio in Jingdezhen.

709
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:47,950
Their local policies

710
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,149
have pretty good benefits.

711
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:52,270
They've been asking me to join them.

712
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,990
I...

713
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:56,510
have agreed.

714
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,550
Can I...

715
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,510
go and take a look too?

716
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:10,909
Both of you want to leave?

717
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,950
It will only be me.

718
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:15,149
You can come with us.

719
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:16,909
You should divorce him.

720
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,909
That man is scary.

721
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,429
Getting a divorce is not that easy.

722
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,030
You're back, madam.

723
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:37,629
Are you eating dinner at home?

724
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:04,429
What are you doing?

725
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,470
What are you planning?

726
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,710
Jiang Hongbin.

727
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,149
I'm not coming back.

728
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:20,189
If you won't agree

729
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,270
to getting a divorce,

730
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,990
I'll get my lawyer talk to you.

731
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,109
Are you really going to carry on
with your antics?

732
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:28,629
What antics?

733
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,070
You used Xu Miao

734
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:31,429
to pressure me, control me.

735
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,270
You're forcing me
to come back and beg you.

736
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:34,790
I'll tell you right now,

737
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,349
you're not going
to get your way this time.

738
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,750
Xu Miao has been released.

739
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:38,950
She is fine.

740
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:41,030
I've also closed the studio.

741
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,149
I don't have anything anymore.

742
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,149
I'm going to file for a divorce.

743
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,429
You won't control me any longer.

744
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,589
Was I controlling you?

745
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:52,389
I'm just showing you care.

746
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:53,710
Why can't you

747
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,990
be like other women?

748
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,470
Stay at home

749
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,349
and be a good mother,

750
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:58,429
a good wife.

751
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,629
After all that has happened,

752
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,550
this is what you're going to say?

753
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,550
You got my friend in trouble!

754
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,750
And now you want me to be a good wife

755
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:07,829
and mother?

756
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:09,070
There's no way

757
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:10,189
I'd spend my life with you,

758
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,829
let alone

759
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:12,629
bear a child for such a person!

760
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:13,629
Such a person?

761
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,869
What's wrong with me?

762
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,750
I spend money to look after you,

763
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,070
make you happy.

764
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:19,990
And now you claim I'm controlling you!

765
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,909
Do you have to torture me like this?

766
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,869
Piss me off?

767
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,510
Jiang Hongbin,

768
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,710
your thinking is twisted,

769
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,550
you know that?

770
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,349
You're a madman.

771
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,669
Step aside.

772
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,629
Get back here!

773
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:36,629
Jiang Hongbin!

774
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:40,909
I'm a madman?

775
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:44,389
I'll show you what mad is.

776
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:45,710
Jiaqiao!

777
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,310
Ms. He!

778
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,990
Jiang Hongbin, you beast!

779
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,189
Ms. He!

780
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,710
Jiaqiao!

781
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,189
The more you resist,

782
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:03,349
the more I'll make you do it.

783
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,589
Help!

784
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,189
Jiaqiao!

785
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:55,550
Madam.

786
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,269
Madam?

787
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,350
Mr. Jiang said he's hungry.

788
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,870
He wants you to make him
lotus seed soup.

789
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,350
Mr. Jiang said yours

790
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,030
is more delicious than what we make.

791
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,870
I've soaked

792
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,350
the lotus seed
and snow fungus for you, madam.

793
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:15,269
Once it's ready,

794
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,749
you can serve it to him.

795
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,430
He's waiting for you in the study.

796
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,707
(Qianjin Internet of Things)

797
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,309
Okay, got it.

798
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:42,350
No problem.

799
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,309
Rest assured.

800
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,950
Okay.

801
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,910
I'm on my way.

802
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:48,269
How is it?

803
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,910
Perfect.

804
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,629
I need to be recompensed
for these liver protection tablets.

805
00:35:58,749 --> 00:35:59,629
The result is out.

806
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:02,229
Hongjiang Group won the bid.

807
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,470
Really?

808
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,070
That means we're going to get busy.

809
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:06,669
Sir,

810
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:07,870
could you turn on the lights?

811
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,229
Nice.

812
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:13,749
Now,

813
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,269
we better hurry up on recruiting

814
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:15,990
and get to work.

815
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:18,950
I've been thinking,

816
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,109
if everything goes well,

817
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:21,189
I'd like to bring Yuanyuan

818
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:21,830
and Huang Chong over.

819
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,709
What do you think?

820
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,629
Great minds think alike.

821
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,070
In a battle,

822
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,789
it's better to lean on people
you know and trust.

823
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,350
Okay.

824
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,589
I have to hurry.

825
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:31,749
Mr. Jiang is waiting for me.

826
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,269
Off to battle I go.

827
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:35,990
Call for a driver if you're drinking.

828
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:37,430
Don't worry.

829
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,589
Madam, are you hungry?

830
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:57,189
Whatever you want to eat,
I can make it for you.

831
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,149
Madam.

832
00:36:58,789 --> 00:36:59,309
Madam.

833
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:00,550
You can't leave.

834
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:01,189
Madam.

835
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:03,669
Mr. Jiang gave orders.

836
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:04,789
You should rest at home.

837
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,789
You're not allowed to go out, madam.

838
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,550
Xiang Nan.

839
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:07,789
Miss.

840
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:09,950
Where are you going, Xiang Nan?

841
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:15,229
No!

842
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,189
Ms. He, let her go.

843
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:32,870
Madam!

844
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,430
Who are you calling?

845
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,950
I'm calling Mr. Jiang.

846
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,550
No, don't.

847
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:40,669
If he asks,

848
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:42,669
just say I let her go.

849
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,800
(Jiang Hongbin)

850
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:39,430
Hello.

851
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:41,189
Dr. Liang,

852
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,309
the doctor

853
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:43,910
who did the checkup for you

854
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,390
told me to come and ask

855
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,350
if you need any help.

856
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,709
If you do,

857
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:54,669
we can call the police for you.

858
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,470
No.

859
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,350
Thank you.

860
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,070
If there's a need,

861
00:39:07,149 --> 00:39:07,709
you can

862
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:09,070
call the number stated.

863
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,160
(Say no to domestic violence)

864
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,669
Thanks.

865
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:54,589
Where were you

866
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:55,470
in between 4 and 6 PM

867
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:56,309
on the 3rd of July?

868
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,229
At home.

869
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,950
Is that the usual time you get home?

870
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,470
I own my company.

871
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,749
Why can't I

872
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:05,789
arrange my own schedule?

873
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:07,749
Please answer the question.

874
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:12,030
I remember I had an event

875
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,390
that night.

876
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,789
So I didn't go to the office.

877
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,309
My wife happened to be back.

878
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:20,550
So the feeling came.

879
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,510
Do I have to spell out the details?

880
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:27,830
There are bruises

881
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,309
and scratches on your wife's back

882
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,070
and thighs.

883
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,070
Explain that.

884
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:33,749
It's just a kink

885
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:35,030
my wife and I share.

886
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,709
That's not illegal, right?

887
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,390
My wife can be a little difficult.

888
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,629
Temper tantrums are common.

889
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,390
Hence this...

890
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:49,870
surprise she gave me.

891
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:52,830
Is that clear enough?

892
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:56,350
Mr. Jiang,

893
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,470
you don't have to worry.

894
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,709
For such cases,

895
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,030
when there aren't any special evidence,

896
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:01,269
making a case would be difficult.

897
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,269
After all, the boundary line
of a married couple

898
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,589
is hard to determine.

899
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:06,990
Where's Xiang Nan?

900
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,669
I saw her just now.

901
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:00,629
Let's go.

902
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,910
Come back home with me.

903
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,950
Take a seat.

904
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,030
Based on the other party's questioning

905
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:28,390
and the evidence you provided,

906
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,870
we have had a talk.

907
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,749
Currently, the evidence you have

908
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:33,229
is insufficient.

909
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:35,030
So we won't be making a case.

910
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:38,830
Why?

911
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,629
The fact is,

912
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,430
I have been harmed, no?

913
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,070
And...

914
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:46,990
I have

915
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,629
the injury report

916
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,309
from the hospital.

917
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,470
So why can't I file a case?

918
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,030
Then...

919
00:42:58,789 --> 00:42:59,749
Does that mean

920
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:01,269
there's nothing you can do?

921
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:03,229
I'm sorry.
