=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 15=

4
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:40,277
Xiang Zhong, why...

5
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:41,637
Why did you have to turn off

6
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:42,808
your phone?

7
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:43,997
Nobody

8
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:44,756
could reach you.

9
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:45,637
Look what that did.

10
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,477
The whole world

11
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:47,477
is out looking for you.

12
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:48,487
Is that what you wanted?

13
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:49,808
Sure, blame it on me.

14
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:50,676
If you guys

15
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,437
didn't over-react,

16
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:52,608
would it have gotten out of hand?

17
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:53,637
I'm a grown adult.

18
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:54,396
What's wrong

19
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:55,728
with me going out with friends?

20
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:56,608
Sure you can.

21
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:57,596
I fully support it.

22
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:58,997
You can go overseas for all I care,

23
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,116
as long as you're happy.

24
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:00,956
But listen.

25
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:01,728
You...

26
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:02,728
You and Deng Haiyang

27
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:03,917
just signed the papers

28
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:05,248
and are still
in the cooling period, right?

29
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:06,837
Whatever you're doing,

30
00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:08,128
you need to keep a level head.

31
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,436
No matter what, you're responsible

32
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:10,568
toward both families.

33
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,877
It's not like anything happened

34
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:13,836
with someone.

35
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:15,487
What am I responsible for?

36
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:38,236
Do you really

37
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:39,328
not know your problems?

38
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:41,357
You don't brush your teeth,
you don't shower,

39
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:43,288
and you expect us to be lovey-dovey?

40
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:44,647
What do you take me for?

41
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:46,608
A garbage disposer?

42
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:48,477
The root of our problem right now

43
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:49,807
isn't related to the police report.

44
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,687
Think about it.

45
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:51,888
In the past years,

46
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:54,288
you promised to change
every time we argued.

47
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,077
But in the end,

48
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,608
this is how you are.

49
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:57,676
I can't live

50
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,008
another day with him.

51
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:00,687
Every day is a torture.

52
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:04,236
(I will not divorce her,)

53
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:04,967
(got that?)

54
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:06,367
But can you make her happy?

55
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:20,008
Haiyang.

56
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:22,408
Are you okay?

57
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:26,647
Xiang Zhong

58
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,087
bought you clothes.

59
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,367
Put them on.

60
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:46,008
Where is she?

61
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:48,448
She's with her sisters downstairs.

62
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,328
And Mom?

63
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:52,448
She's tired.

64
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:54,328
And she has a headache.

65
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:55,676
Xiang Qian and the rest

66
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:56,877
got a room next door

67
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:58,128
so she could rest.

68
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:09,048
Get changed.

69
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,007
Go on.

70
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:30,636
Deng Haiyang,

71
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,756
I'll be very clear with you.

72
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:32,597
I brought you the stuff

73
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,196
not because
I still have feelings for you.

74
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:34,876
It's because

75
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:36,168
I can't stand you looking so haggard.

76
00:04:36,237 --> 00:04:37,288
Understand?

77
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:44,927
Who's the boy?

78
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:47,567
What does he do?

79
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:50,447
How long have you known each other?

80
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,007
Stop asking.

81
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,327
If I don't ask you,

82
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,567
would you prefer Dad to ask instead?

83
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,168
He looks pretty young.

84
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,367
Are you two...

85
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:05,556
in a... a relationship

86
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,517
or not?

87
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:07,157
We're not.

88
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:08,608
I told you.

89
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,367
He's a neighbor
who lives in the same area.

90
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:15,968
His name is Wang Yuxi.

91
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,048
He's staying in Kunshan for a few days.

92
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:21,157
For a few days?

93
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:22,687
Where does he usually live?

94
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,127
What does he do?

95
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:26,556
He was working in Shanghai.

96
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:27,957
He quit

97
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,277
and is now helping his cousin

98
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:30,927
look after the house in Kunshan.

99
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,088
He quit at such a young age?

100
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:36,608
Is he from a rich family?

101
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:40,048
I think he went through a bad breakup.

102
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:44,567
A grown man...

103
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:45,756
quit his job

104
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:47,168
because of a bad breakup?

105
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,887
Does that sound reliable?

106
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:49,837
What does

107
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,687
being reliable have to do with me?

108
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,076
Am I not supposed to have friends?

109
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:54,996
I'm not allowed

110
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:56,288
to hang out with male friends?

111
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,436
Sure you can.

112
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,088
I told you.

113
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:00,887
I encourage you to go travel the world.

114
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:02,116
But can we first

115
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:03,636
deal with this matter

116
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:05,648
that constitutes legal repercussions?

117
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:08,648
You and Deng Haiyang
aren't officially divorced yet.

118
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:11,236
Can't you tell

119
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,528
that he's not willing to do it?

120
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,447
Just think, time is up.

121
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:15,116
You guys'

122
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:16,807
cooling period is up.

123
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:18,528
And he says he doesn't want to divorce.

124
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:19,728
Then what will you do?

125
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:20,676
If he won't do it,

126
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,208
I'm going to file a divorce lawsuit.

127
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:26,327
On what grounds?

128
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:27,487
That he's unhygienic?

129
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:28,848
Doesn't shower?

130
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,837
Right now,

131
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:32,687
you're letting him have the edge on you.

132
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:33,636
What if he said

133
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:34,436
you're having an affair,

134
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,728
then what?

135
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:39,076
I didn't do anything.

136
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:40,076
No use telling me.

137
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,247
I believe you.

138
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:42,807
But the others don't.

139
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,088
What then?

140
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:46,768
I get it.

141
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:48,076
You weren't happy after marrying

142
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:48,957
Deng Haiyang.

143
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,007
You were miserable.

144
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:51,597
Isn't that more reason

145
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:52,797
to get this divorce

146
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,007
sorted out smoothly?

147
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,528
Dad said he'll be staying here tonight.

148
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:01,408
He wants to talk to Deng Haiyang.

149
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:23,687
Haiyang.

150
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,567
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

151
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,127
I...

152
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:29,648
am just taking a breather.

153
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:33,996
This place is quite nice.

154
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:34,717
Yes.

155
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:35,648
It's pretty good.

156
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,408
Look, I bought wine.

157
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:38,208
Here.

158
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,088
One each.

159
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:43,567
It's been a while

160
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:44,917
since you and I

161
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,408
sat down and had a drink, right?

162
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:48,517
Let's not go anywhere today.

163
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:49,567
I'm staying overnight.

164
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:51,408
I'll keep you company

165
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,288
and we'll have a good drink.

166
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,608
Have a sip, warm the throat.

167
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:15,567
Have some finger food.

168
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,968
Easy does it.

169
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:39,847
Here you go.

170
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:47,567
Haiyang.

171
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,408
This drink

172
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,168
I offer you

173
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,967
as an apology from Xiang Zhong.

174
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,207
As the father,

175
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,248
I didn't raise my daughter properly.

176
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,727
You got a bad rep because of it.

177
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:04,607
Here.

178
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:10,607
Did you know?

179
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:13,607
Back then,

180
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:17,488
in order to retain my job,

181
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:20,288
I sent Xiang Zhong
back to the countryside

182
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,447
after she was born.

183
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,288
Is was only when she was 10,

184
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:28,408
that we brought her back.

185
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:31,008
After so many years,

186
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,037
Xiang Zhong hasn't seemed

187
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,888
to fully integrate herself

188
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:38,207
into the family.

189
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,807
Your mom and I

190
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:43,008
feel bad about it.

191
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:44,967
After all,

192
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:48,076
it's because we failed

193
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,648
to take care of our own child.

194
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,048
Hence,

195
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,648
when you two got married,

196
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:00,048
your mom and I
were particularly overjoyed.

197
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:04,076
We got a good kid like you

198
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,807
helping us look after her.

199
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:08,128
We thought

200
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:10,687
we could rest easy after that.

201
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:15,488
But who knew?

202
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:18,676
In the end,

203
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,447
this is how it ends.

204
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,967
The fact is,

205
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:29,397
Xiang Zhong's self-centered

206
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:30,607
personality

207
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,008
has indeed

208
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:34,807
over the years,

209
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:37,196
caused you to suffer,

210
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:38,967
both physically and mentally.

211
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:41,927
She held you back.

212
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:45,807
If you wish to assign blame,

213
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:47,596
the blame is on me,

214
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:49,207
the father.

215
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:52,488
I'm sorry,

216
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:54,128
my boy.

217
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:55,807
Dad,

218
00:10:56,118 --> 00:10:57,168
please don't say that.

219
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:58,488
Easy.

220
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,528
Here, let me do it.

221
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:06,476
In a few days,

222
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,447
when the paperwork is processed,

223
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:12,476
I will no longer be able

00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,607

has an event today.

You can leave after a quick check.

266
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,567
Dad.

267
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:02,888
Why is the door open?

268
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,207
Where is Haiyang?

269
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:15,997
I'm leaving.

Don't worry.

My daughter is a wrecking ball.

274
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,207
What could I have said to him?

275
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,727
Our family did Haiyang wrong.

276
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:31,967
Hang on.

277
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:33,076
What did Xiang Zhong do

278
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:34,768
to feel guilty toward Deng Haiyang?

279
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,117
They're not formally divorced yet

280
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:36,956
and she's found another lover.

281
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:37,967
What do you call that?

282
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,447
Having an affair!

283
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:41,888
Since when did Xiang Zhong have a lover?

284
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,556
So she's not supposed to have friends?

285
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:44,797
Or go out and have some fun,

286
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,087
let loose a little?

287
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:47,397
I spoke to Xiang Zhong.

288
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:48,277
It's not true.

289
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:49,768
Nothing happened.

290
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,757
I am 100 percent

291
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,288
behind Xiang Zhong and fully trust her.

292
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,836
So should you two.

293
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:58,048
Believe her 100 percent.

294
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:16,528
Mr. Wang.

295
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:17,476
Madam.

296
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:18,757
What happened?

297
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,607
Why did Jiaqiao
suddenly leave the hospital?

298
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,168
I heard Miss Jiaqiao on the phone.

299
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:23,687
A friend of hers told her

300
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:25,117
that she saw her boyfriend

301
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:26,288
going out with another woman.

302
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,128
They got a room in the hotel.

303
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:29,676
Since when

304
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:31,008
did she have a boyfriend?

305
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:32,687
I'm not sure.

306
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:35,168
I worry she might cause a scene.

307
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,008
That's why I called you.

308
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:38,637
Okay, thanks.

309
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,168
I'll go take a look.

310
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:00,528
Xiang Nan!

311
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,008
What are you doing here?

312
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:03,488
Who are you?

313
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:05,528
It's me.

314
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,117
It's me. Get over here.

315
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:08,797
Why are you here?

316
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,567
It's time for you
to take your medication.

317
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:11,397
The nurses

318
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:12,757
are all looking for you.

319
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:13,727
Go back to the hospital.

320
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,128
What are you doing?

321
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:19,716
Are you looking for your boyfriend?

322
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:20,447
Step back.

323
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:22,207
Is your boyfriend here?

324
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:26,277
Should you be looking

325
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,408
for your boyfriend in your state?

326
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:29,757
Do you have your makeup bag?

327
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:31,368
Why would I have that?

328
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:32,716
You're really of no use, huh?

329
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:33,877
I can say the same about you.

330
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,037
Lipstick, what about lipstick?

331
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:35,637
I have lipstick.

332
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:36,596
But I'm not lending it to you.

333
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,008
It's not hygienic to share.

334
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,637
You really talk too much,

335
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:40,687
you know?

336
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:42,687
Quickly.

337
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:44,888
I'll buy you a new one.

338
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:48,316
Why are you

339
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:49,637
being so sneaky
if you're meeting your boyfriend?

340
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:51,327
Just go up to him.

341
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:57,128
This color doesn't suit me.

342
00:16:57,878 --> 00:16:58,768
Here, take it back.

343
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,157
Still so picky, huh?

344
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:01,316
Be glad you have one.

345
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:01,836
My goodness.

346
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,117
When is your boyfriend coming?

347
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:04,567
Go see him so we can leave.

348
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:07,916
You have to take your medication
on time,

349
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,008
- you hear?
- Shut up.

350
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,248
Wait here.

351
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,048
What are you doing?

352
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:43,876
Give me a hand.

353
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:44,836
Help me put this on.

354
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:45,477
Where

355
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,367
did you get the suit from?

356
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:49,916
Wait,

357
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,208
isn't this Wang's?

358
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,396
Yes, it is.

359
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,087
Then what is Wang wearing?

360
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,327
Never mind him.

361
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:58,717
What on earth?

362
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:00,288
What exactly are you planning?

363
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:02,488
Qu Shaobo.

364
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:03,448
Who?

365
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:05,248
Qu Shaobo.

366
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:08,087
You're here as expected.

367
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:09,607
What?

368
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:11,367
Sorry, who are you?

369
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:12,717
Aren't you supposed to be in New York?

370
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,327
How come you're here?

371
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,167
Is she your girlfriend?

372
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,277
Yes, I'm his girlfriend.

373
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:17,916
Who are you?

374
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:18,957
State your name.

375
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,407
What... What girlfriend?

376
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,928
I don't know her.

377
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,127
What? You don't know me?

378
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:28,847
What did we talk about
in the past six months?

379
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:30,116
You told me

380
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,277
about some foundation, stocks,

381
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,448
Wall Street.

382
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:37,768
Is this the Wall Street you meant?

383
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:38,916
Ma'am.

384
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,087
Ma'am?

385
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,116
Open your eyes wider

386
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:43,488
and take a good look at me.

387
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:45,367
Do you know me?

388
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:47,037
I've never seen you before,

389
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,607
how could we have talked?

390
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,448
Are your eyes growing on your butt?

391
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,048
Who are you criticizing?

392
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:55,008
Take out your phone.

393
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,528
Where's your phone? Take it out!

394
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,208
Hello, dear.

395
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:06,768
Hello?

396
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,167
Who are you?

397
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:12,327
Are you Qu Shaobo?

398
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:14,768
You're not Qu Shaobo. Who are you?

399
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:16,807
Hello?

400
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:19,887
Did someone pretend to be you?

401
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:20,928
Who knows?

402
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,288
There are plenty

403
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,277
of impersonation

404
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,048
and pig butchering scams
on the Internet these days.

405
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,407
Let's go.

406
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,167
Jiaqiao.

407
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:35,768
No!

408
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:37,127
This can't be.

409
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,807
Maybe you got the wrong person.

410
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,607
It can't be.

411
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:28,887
Why didn't you

412
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:30,237
tell me about the incident

413
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:31,327
with Jiaqiao?

414
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:35,688
I thought it was better for her

415
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:37,407
to tell you herself.

416
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:39,916
If I hadn't asked,

417
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,607
do you think she would've told me?

418
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:45,488
Xiang Nan.

419
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:48,008
I'm usually busy with work

420
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,928
and has no time to look after her.

421
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:51,316
Anyway,

422
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,488
you're her sister-in-law.

423
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,167
I hope you can look out for her more.

424
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:57,076
Keep an eye on what she's doing,

425
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,847
who she's hanging around with.

426
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:02,928
Are you telling me to monitor her?

427
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:05,048
I'm not saying monitor.

428
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,477
But look,

429
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:07,437
this incident

430
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:08,807
has caused enough damage, no?

431
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:12,008
If it had happened to you,

432
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:14,887
you'd at least have more experience.

433
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:16,477
She's over 30 years old.

434
00:21:16,478 --> 00:21:17,636
Does she still require

435
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:19,647
a guardian to oversee her love life?

436
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,596
She may be 30 plus,

437
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:22,367
but she's still dense in the head.

438
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:24,688
She never even met the guy,

439
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:25,836
and she thought he was a gem,

440
00:21:25,837 --> 00:21:26,957
showing off to anyone who would listen.

441
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,847
Yeah.

442
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:29,197
If

443
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:29,876
her besties

444
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:30,677
hadn't been swiping video clips

445
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:31,968
and saw that guy,

446
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:33,807
she would still be kept in the dark.

447
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:35,876
Firstly, I don't think

448
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,807
she'd listen to me.

449
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:38,717
Also,

450
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:39,957
it's not my obligation

451
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:40,836
to monitor her.

452
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:41,237
I think it's a bad idea.

453
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:42,048
Alright, Xiang Nan.

454
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:43,448
Just do as I say.

455
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:01,356
Since we've discussed the matter,

456
00:22:01,357 --> 00:22:01,916
today,

457
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,567
we're going to resolve it.

458
00:22:04,718 --> 00:22:05,607
Dou,

459
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:06,396
remember

460
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:07,567
what I taught you?

461
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:08,757
Sorry, Cong.

462
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:10,288
I shouldn't have pushed you.

463
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:11,556
Sorry, Dou.

464
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:13,087
I shouldn't have pushed you either.

465
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:15,076
I'm not angry, Dou.

466
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:16,636
I accept your apology.

467
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,248
We will still be playmates.

468
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:21,728
Let's shake hands, Dou.

469
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:34,277
Dou,

470
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:35,517
when I go to play,

471
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:37,087
I'll invite you along.

472
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,237
Cong, Qi,

473
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:39,477
next time I play,

474
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:41,356
I'll ask you guys too, okay?

475
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:42,688
Okay.

476
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:44,477
Sorry.

477
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:46,448
I shouldn't have shared
the video in the group

478
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:48,008
without asking you first.

479
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:50,208
That's already, ma'am.

480
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,797
We've also deleted the video

481
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:52,928
we recorded.

482
00:22:53,397 --> 00:22:54,197
Dou, come.

483
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:55,167
Let's go home.

484
00:22:57,478 --> 00:22:58,876
Bye, Dou.

485
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,127
Bye, Cong and Qi.

486
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,048
That woman seemed disrespectful.

487
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:07,156
How did you

488
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:08,728
convince her to apologize?

489
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,688
When it comes to our children,

490
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:12,156
we'll do everything

491
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,887
in our power to see something through.

492
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:17,768
Aunty, today is my day off.

493
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:19,356
I need to go to the site.

494
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,087
Let's head home together.

495
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:26,127
Aunty,

496
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:27,916
I met Gao Ping

497
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:28,717
when Qi and Cong

498
00:23:28,718 --> 00:23:29,968
were about four months old.

499
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:30,757
At the time,

500
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:31,876
I had a day-time nanny

501
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,367
who helped me look after them.

502
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:34,957
Because I got a divorce

503
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,407
and was raising the two kids myself,

504
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:38,528
I wasn't speaking with my parents.

505
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,156
Whatever happened,

506
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:42,087
I refused to ask them for help.

507
00:23:42,397 --> 00:23:44,197
On that day, the two kids

508
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:46,248
suddenly had a fever
in the dead of night.

509
00:23:46,317 --> 00:23:48,556
(So I carried them)

510
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,367
(and took them to the hospital myself.)

511
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,448
(Gao Ping happened
to be the overseeing doctor.)

512
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,237
(It was opposite the house.)

513
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:56,237
(He was working as an intern)

514
00:23:56,238 --> 00:23:57,567
(at the private hospital
opposite the house.)

515
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:15,208
Morning.

516
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:20,647
Let me show you something.

517
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,367
This is called the Galant Reflection.

518
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,316
(When we got discharged,)

519
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:40,887
(we exchanged numbers.)

520
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,887
(After that, when he got off his shift,)

521
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,197
he'd often come

522
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:47,167
and take Qi and Cong on walks,

523
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,208
or play with them.

524
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:53,647
Later, we started dating.

525
00:24:57,198 --> 00:24:58,156
After talking to him,

526
00:24:58,157 --> 00:24:58,916
I found out

527
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,127
that being a doctor

528
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:02,327
isn't his ideal job.

529
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:05,087
He prefers to be an academic,

530
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:06,248
conduct research.

531
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:10,607
And I support that and encouraged him

532
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,567
to be a full time research student.

533
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:14,156
I believe that

534
00:25:14,157 --> 00:25:15,008
as long as

535
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:16,647
we don't have high expectations in life,

536
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:19,477
we'd be able to make do.

537
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:20,847
We can manage.

538
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,797
I don't know what your thoughts are

539
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:24,407
on relationships.

540
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:25,968
To me,

541
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,847
allowing the person I like

542
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:29,677
to do what they like

543
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:31,488
and become whoever they want to be

544
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:32,797
is enough to make me happy

545
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,167
and content.

546
00:25:37,597 --> 00:25:39,048
Actually, we approached you

547
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,407
because Gao Ping

548
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:42,607
mentioned you numerous times.

549
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:44,316
I know you're good to Gao Ping.

550
00:25:44,317 --> 00:25:45,647
And Gao Ping feels grateful.

551
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:48,008
But that's exactly what I'm afraid of.

552
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:49,437
I worry that if I don't handle
this relationship well,

553
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:51,087
Gao Ping might be caught in the middle.

554
00:25:52,478 --> 00:25:54,087
Right up to this time,

555
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:57,127
we've received the foods you prepared.

556
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:00,277
Watching Gao Ping eat them,

557
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:01,928
I could tell how happy

558
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:03,197
and blessed he was.

559
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:05,127
He's able to eat the food from home.

560
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:06,807
And so I started to waver.

561
00:26:08,438 --> 00:26:09,957
It's true that I've not had

562
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,768
food from home in a long time.

563
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,607
The thing is, Aunty...

564
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,876
What I'm trying to say is,
even if it were my parents

565
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,237
coming to help me with the kids,

566
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:21,367
and we live together
under the same roof,

567
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:22,528
I would still like

568
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:25,968
to maintain a sense of boundary.

569
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:28,928
Xiang Qian,

570
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:32,968
I'm sorry.

571
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:34,127
Okay.

572
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:35,728
I'll leave tomorrow.

573
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:36,556
No, no.

574
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:37,836
That's not what I meant.

575
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:39,928
I mean we should try

576
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,327
and work it out more.

577
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:42,968
Adapt to each other more.

578
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,647
Let's go.

579
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:00,327
This guy's name is Li Hao.

580
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:01,757
He's an engineer
at a construction company

581
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,677
(Personal Information of Li Hao)
I've been working with long-term.

582
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:05,367
His family background
is pretty straightforward.

583
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,208
The parents passed away early,

584
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:08,728
no siblings.

585
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,567
Aside from being a gym buff,

586
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:12,688
he doesn't have any bad habits.

587
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:15,208
Plus, he's a good cook.

588
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:17,037
Is this another suitor

589
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:18,688
you found for Jiaqiao?

590
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:19,528
What do you think?

591
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:22,968
He's just so-so.

592
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:25,197
He looks like a giant,

593
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:26,076
whereas Jiaqiao is so tiny.

594
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,488
What's wrong with being bigger-sized?

595
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:29,087
He's a gentle soul.

596
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:30,277
I've met Li Hao

597
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:31,728
numerous times.

598
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:33,928
I'm 100 percent sure

599
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:35,596
that he'd be loyal and devoted

600
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:36,768
to Jiaqiao.

601
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,248
If she wants to get married,

602
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:39,768
this is the best kind of candidate.

603
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:41,556
You shouldn't

604
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:42,677
impose your own ideals

605
00:27:42,678 --> 00:27:44,156
on finding Jiaqiao's suitor.

606
00:27:44,157 --> 00:27:46,208
What, I'm not going to harm her.

607
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:46,876
I'm doing this

608
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:47,916
for her own good.

609
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:48,717
But does Jiaqiao

610
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:50,316
think it's good?

611
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:51,836
The way you're coddling her,

612
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,316
it's only giving her more pressure.

613
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:54,957
If she knew what she wanted,

614
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,688
I wouldn't be doing
so much out of worry.

615
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:22,396
My goodness,

616
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:23,437
it's boiling hot!

617
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:24,396
I'm going back.

618
00:28:24,397 --> 00:28:25,836
That's enough. We're here.

619
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,887
Let's just go.

620
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:33,008
It's too hot.

621
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:35,688
Gosh.

622
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:38,768
What kind of man
did my brother find for me?

623
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:39,916
Stop it.

624
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,037
Li Hao is a nice guy.

625
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:42,237
He came here earlier

626
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:43,928
to help prepare everything
in this hot weather.

627
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,407
In the future,

628
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:47,596
having a diligent guy like him

629
00:28:47,597 --> 00:28:48,876
means you won't have to do

630
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,156
any of the chores and labor.

631
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:50,556
Sure,

632
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:51,477
you found a husband

633
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:53,407
just so you could skip doing housework.

634
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,407
Li Hao.

635
00:28:57,758 --> 00:28:58,477
Thanks

636
00:28:58,478 --> 00:28:59,728
for setting up on a hot day.

637
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:00,477
I'm here.

638
00:29:00,478 --> 00:29:02,807
Why did you set the tent up so far away?

639
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:04,208
The sun moved.

640
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:05,448
I'll move them.

641
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:06,887
How heavy are you?

642
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:09,208
220.

643
00:29:11,637 --> 00:29:12,957
I'm not even half your weight.

644
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,316
You wouldn't get angry with me

645
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,087
and break me in half, right?

646
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:17,448
Nonsense.

647
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,277
It's too hot here.

648
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:20,396
Why don't we talk under the shade?

649
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:21,076
Yes, okay.

650
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:21,717
Okay.

651
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,076
Go.

652
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,208
Sit down and chat.

653
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:25,647
Don't talk nonsense.

654
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:30,437
Come sit here.

655
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:31,356
I'll sit here.

656
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:32,076
You...

657
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:33,037
Stop it.

658
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,797
I think you two
look quite good together.

659
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:35,968
Shut up.

660
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:36,968
Here.

661
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,396
Here, it's hot. Fan yourself.

662
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:41,448
Okay.

663
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,887
It's blazing hot!

664
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,156
Why would anyone camp in this weather?

665
00:29:47,157 --> 00:29:48,316
They must be lunatics!

666
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:49,048
No shade?

667
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:54,517
What are you doing?

668
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:55,567
Put me down!

669
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:58,768
Xiang Nan, save me! Help!

670
00:29:58,837 --> 00:29:59,876
Save me, Xiang Nan!

671
00:29:59,877 --> 00:30:00,928
Save me!

672
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:03,048
Alright.

673
00:30:03,557 --> 00:30:04,807
You have the shade here.

674
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:06,607
Right.

675
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:07,277
Here.

676
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:08,847
See, you're out of the sun.

677
00:30:09,077 --> 00:30:10,757
I prepared both meat and vegetables.

678
00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:11,197
Wow.

679
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:12,277
Feel free.

680
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,847
You prepared so much.

681
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:15,448
I want ice cream.

682
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:16,528
You don't have that, right?

683
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:19,116
I'll go.

684
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:19,957
I'll go buy it.

685
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,116
Okay? You two stay and chat.

686
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:21,836
I'll go buy.

687
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:22,636
No, I can go.

688
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:23,156
Xiang Nan.

689
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:23,876
What flavor do you want?

690
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:24,517
Anything, yeah?

691
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:25,327
Okay.

692
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:26,607
Xiang Nan!

693
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:27,768
Xiang...

694
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:29,728
Here.

695
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:32,327
These... These are chilled.

696
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:34,008
Why don't you drink the chilled one?

697
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:34,757
Okay.

698
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:36,048
The ice cream is coming.

699
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:38,957
Why don't we start grilling first?

700
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:39,677
Okay, yeah.

701
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:40,636
Alright.

702
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:41,488
I'll start the fire.

703
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:44,968
Xiang Nan.

704
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:46,008
You're dead meat.

705
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:48,156
That darn Xiang Nan.

706
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:49,327
Unbelievable!

707
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,528
I think that's Jiaqiao.

708
00:30:55,998 --> 00:30:56,847
Is it?

709
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,167
Jiaqiao!

710
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:04,167
Where are you going?

711
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,928
To the bathroom.

712
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:11,208
Who is it?

713
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:14,728
Mom.

714
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:15,807
Why are you here?

715
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:17,277
Your dad is worried

716
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:18,277
and asked me to bring you...

717
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:19,367
Where are my food stuff?

718
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:22,437
He asked me to bring you some food.

719
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:23,277
That's a big bag.

720
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:25,596
It's not like
I can't get food for myself.

721
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:26,957
I can go and buy.

722
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,248
Well, have you?

723
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:31,076
This is too much.

724
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:32,847
Look at you huffing and puffing.

725
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:33,797
Let me pour you water.

726
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:34,728
Xiang Zhong.

727
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:36,208
Recently,

728
00:31:36,238 --> 00:31:37,728
have you seen...

729
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:42,688
the other person?

730
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,847
No.

731
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:44,677
Why?

732
00:31:44,678 --> 00:31:46,567
Did he ask you to watch me?

733
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:48,127
No.

734
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:49,396
What your dad means is

735
00:31:49,397 --> 00:31:50,997
that our neighborhood is small.

736
00:31:50,998 --> 00:31:53,208
Pretty much everyone knows everyone.

737
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:54,356
If word gets out,

738
00:31:54,357 --> 00:31:55,517
you and Haiyang

739
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:57,248
will likely be scrutinized.

740
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,076
Even so,

741
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:00,367
all I did is get a divorce.

742
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,437
Well, the process

743
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:03,037
hasn't been concluded.

744
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,797
So you're not officially divorced yet.

745
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:05,797
Right?

746
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,596
Listen to me.

747
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:08,356
To me, we are already divorced.

748
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:09,847
We're only married in name only.

749
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:13,396
Xiang Zhong,

750
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:14,556
I have to remind you.

751
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,887
Gossip is a fearful thing.

752
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:17,448
It doesn't scare me.

753
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:21,728
Give me the fan at least.

754
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:23,048
In the back.

755
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:24,807
This?

756
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:37,437
Li Hao,

757
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,277
what happened?

758
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:39,768
Why are you taking it down?

759
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:40,717
Where's Jiaqiao?

760
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:41,567
She's gone.

761
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:43,437
Just now, she ran into some friends

762
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:44,688
and it became quite awkward.

763
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,356
But she left without saying a word.

764
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:47,728
What's that suppose to mean?

765
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:50,197
Okay, cool down.

766
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:51,607
I'll give her a call.

767
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:55,327
What's going on?

768
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,876
Losing the power of life

769
00:33:06,877 --> 00:33:09,596
is nothing.

770
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:12,887
So, I'm pleading with you.

771
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:16,288
Don't let me leave you.

772
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:17,768
Except...

773
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,048
What's the deal?

774
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:22,847
How could you just leave like that?

775
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:24,087
You're not answering the phone too.

776
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:26,008
What?

777
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:28,488
Pretending to be the good guy, huh?

778
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:31,957
You knew

779
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,087
my besties

780
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:34,757
were also

781
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:36,567
having a picnic at the park.

782
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,327
So why did you set up the date there?

783
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:40,288
What was your intention?

784
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,717
Why did you

785
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,556
ask Li Hao

786
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:43,728
to meet me there?

787
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:46,037
It's because you wanted

788
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:47,968
the whole world to laugh at me, right?

789
00:33:48,597 --> 00:33:50,807
You wanted people to know

790
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:53,847
that nobody wants Jiang Jiaqiao.

791
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,037
That's why I had to go on a date

792
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:58,876
with a man
I can't even stand the look of.

793
00:33:58,877 --> 00:33:59,797
I had to

794
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:00,717
go on a blind date

795
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:03,208
with a man whose looks
made me want to run off.

796
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:05,248
Why?

797
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:07,677
You're awful, you!

798
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,516
You're the worst!

799
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:10,476
Jiang Jiaqiao,

800
00:34:10,477 --> 00:34:12,368
do you actually have a brain?

801
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:13,396
Just think.

802
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:14,757
Why would I know

803
00:34:14,758 --> 00:34:15,396
that your besties

804
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,167
would be having a picnic at the park?

805
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:18,567
Also,

806
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:21,127
I think Li Hao is not that bad.

807
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:22,157
You having a date

808
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:23,717
with him isn't
as embarrassing as you think.

809
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:25,607
So just think who's the actual problem?

810
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,607
Are you saying I'm the problem?

811
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:30,808
I'm not...

812
00:34:31,078 --> 00:34:32,157
All I did

813
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:34,567
was finding love on the Internet

814
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:36,677
and lost a million in the process.

815
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:37,996
It was only that much.

816
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:39,436
Did you have to go this far,
Jiang Hongbin?

817
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:40,207
You...

818
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,077
I got tricked,

819
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:43,157
but did you comfort me?

820
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:44,287
No, you didn't.

821
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,356
I just want to have a relationship.

822
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:47,528
Listen, Jiang Jiaqiao.

823
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:48,797
I really couldn't care less about you.

824
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:49,677
And I

825
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:50,888
I'm done.

826
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:51,996
That's all. I'm leaving.

827
00:34:51,997 --> 00:34:54,008
Xiang Nan... Xiang Nan!

828
00:34:58,357 --> 00:34:59,436
Listen up, Jiang Jiaqiao.

829
00:34:59,437 --> 00:35:00,848
I'm not falling for your pity act.

830
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:08,167
Jiaqiao.

831
00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:09,717
Your pity act won't work,

832
00:35:09,718 --> 00:35:10,808
you hear?

833
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,008
Jiang Jiaqiao.

834
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:14,767
Ouch...

835
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:23,767
Why does this happen to me?

836
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:32,968
Are you sober?

837
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:35,848
Sorry about just now.

838
00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:38,727
You hurt your hand, right?

839
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,287
Let me put this ointment on you.

840
00:35:41,357 --> 00:35:42,888
Give me your hand.

841
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:48,368
Come on, I already dipped the wand.

842
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:09,287
What is up...

843
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:10,928
with that?

844
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:14,287
Are you trying to make me cry again?

845
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:16,607
It's okay, you don't have to tell me.

846
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,368
This is a story about

847
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,488
my unforgettable love.

848
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:26,916
It was a guy I met

849
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,237
when I went to the UK

850
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:29,687
to study.

851
00:36:32,078 --> 00:36:33,607
His family wasn't well off.

852
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:35,597
My brother was sure

853
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:37,408
that the guy went out with me

854
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:41,848
because he was after
my money and status.

855
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:43,757
To fight back

856
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:45,567
against my brother's sanctions,

857
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,797
we decided to take our own lives

858
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:49,287
to threaten him a little.

859
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,567
But I never expected the outcome.

860
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:55,836
He took the money my brother offered

861
00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:57,968
and disappeared into the night.

862
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:02,207
A true jerk.

863
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:05,476
Maybe it's just as my brother said.

864
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:07,448
I'm not beautiful.

865
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:09,368
I'm bad-tempered.

866
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:10,968
And I'm not smart.

867
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:13,396
No talented man

868
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,287
would fall for me.

869
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:19,687
Tell me, Xiang Nan.

870
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:24,836
Do I really not deserve

871
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,448
to be liked?

872
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,247
You're contemplating.

873
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:33,677
Aren't you supposed

874
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:35,396
to offer me words of comfort right now?

875
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:36,368
For instance...

876
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:38,836
Be your best self.

877
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:40,876
So that when we cross paths,

878
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:42,316
I'll be everything

879
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:43,808
you wish for.

880
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:45,597
Jeez.

881
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:46,727
I have everything you want.

882
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:49,767
Do you have to be so...

883
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:51,928
girly?

884
00:37:51,957 --> 00:37:53,117
I'm going to be girly till I die,

885
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:54,127
okay?

886
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,848
I am the girly gorilla!

887
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:01,687
You do look like a gorilla.

888
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:03,247
What the heck?

889
00:38:07,758 --> 00:38:09,727
Since you praised me,

890
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:12,567
I'm willing to comfort you a little.

891
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,448
Miss Jiang Jiaqiao,

892
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:23,127
I wish you to be forever girly.

893
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:26,928
What?

894
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:29,928
How can you look so beautiful?

895
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,207
Goodness gracious.

896
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:36,117
I want to look as beautiful too.

897
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:37,607
Are you nuts?

898
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:43,087
I don't know how to comfort you.

899
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:46,127
But at least you're smiling.

900
00:38:47,477 --> 00:38:50,167
So... Are we good?

901
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:56,247
You need to sober up.

902
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:57,968
Okay, got it.

903
00:38:59,558 --> 00:39:00,557
Jiang Hongbin!

904
00:39:00,558 --> 00:39:03,008
Xiang Nan is mine!

905
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:04,687
Sober up.

906
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,516
Aunty and I

907
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,087
had a chat today.

908
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:17,637
I told her about

909
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:18,996
our daily lives

910
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:21,048
and habits and what not.

911
00:39:21,837 --> 00:39:22,956
I also told her

912
00:39:22,957 --> 00:39:24,408
how you and I met.

913
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:31,356
I'd like to admit

914
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:32,767
my wrongdoing too.

915
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:34,996
On this matter,

916
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,127
I did harbor a personal agenda.

917
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:40,767
Fang Yuan is Aunty's son.

918
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:43,117
Two years ago, he got in fight
and injured a guy.

919
00:39:43,118 --> 00:39:44,567
He was jailed for three years.

920
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:46,647
After he was released,

921
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:47,637
he wasn't able

922
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,087
to find a stable job.

923
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:51,207
So he did odd jobs.

924
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,528
He's been relying on Aunty to survive.

925
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:56,677
So I thought,

926
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:58,368
since we were looking for help,

927
00:39:59,278 --> 00:40:00,528
why not

928
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:03,368
give the money to Aunty?

929
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:06,167
I wanted to help in any way I could.

930
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:08,607
But I didn't know

931
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:10,207
that it'd cause

932
00:40:10,758 --> 00:40:12,607
you two to become so tense.

933
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:15,488
It's not tense.

934
00:40:16,837 --> 00:40:18,197
Whether we get Aunty

935
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:19,316
or hire

936
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,928
a new helper,

937
00:40:20,957 --> 00:40:22,117
we'll need time

938
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:23,408
to adapt.

939
00:40:24,357 --> 00:40:25,356
Right now,

940
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:26,757
our main concern

941
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,448
is being more careful with whom we hire.

942
00:40:28,997 --> 00:40:30,916
It's better if we got Aunty to come,

943
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,607
because she's family after all.

944
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:34,316
I'm just thinking

945
00:40:34,317 --> 00:40:35,597
that in the beginning,

946
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:36,677
we'll have to sort out the intricacies

947
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:38,048
of living together.

948
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:39,448
This way,

949
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:40,757
it won't create

950
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:42,287
any awkwardness between you and Aunty,

951
00:40:42,678 --> 00:40:43,436
nor create

952
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:44,808
awkwardness between me and her,

953
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:45,597
nor create

954
00:40:45,598 --> 00:40:46,968
awkwardness between you and me.

955
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:51,167
The talk went well.

956
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,528
Glad to hear it.

957
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:59,036
I'm going to sleep first then.

958
00:40:59,037 --> 00:41:00,287
You should sleep too.

959
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,767
Aunty.

960
00:41:11,357 --> 00:41:12,567
Yesterday,

961
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,077
I was talking to Gao Ping

962
00:41:14,078 --> 00:41:15,727
and Fang Yuan came up.

963
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,808
So you know about Fang Yuan.

964
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,087
I thought about it and figured

965
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:24,597
you can't possibly
look after him forever.

966
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:25,757
He has to become independent.

967
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:27,727
For example,
he can go to a technical school

968
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:29,757
and learn some new skills.

969
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:31,488
I made some calls.

970
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:32,237
A company

971
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:33,237
that we've been partnering with,

972
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:34,557
they're located in your area.

973
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,356
They've been informed

974
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:36,687
about Fang Yuan's condition.

975
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,048
And they're willing to take him in.

976
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:39,848
He can start from the bottom.

977
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:42,167
Xiang Qian,

978
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:43,727
thank you so much.

979
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:47,808
In the future,

980
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:48,797
feel free

981
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,087
to tell me about your requests.

982
00:41:50,118 --> 00:41:50,797
Things I can't do,

983
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:52,247
I can learn.

984
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:54,687
I'll fix what needs to be fixed.

985
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:56,888
Thanks, Aunty.

986
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:58,368
No worries.

987
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,077
I'm usually very busy

988
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:00,876
and has a lot to do.

989
00:42:00,877 --> 00:42:01,797
Sometimes,

990
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:03,048
I am too blunt.

991
00:42:03,118 --> 00:42:04,448
Don't let it get to you.

992
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:05,557
Don't say that.

993
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:06,727
I don't mind.

994
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:08,448
Carry on then.

995
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,488
