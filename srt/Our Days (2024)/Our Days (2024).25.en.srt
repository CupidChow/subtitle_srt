=Our Days=

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 25=

4
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,336
Jiaqiao, tell me the truth.

5
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,605
Did he tell you the reason

6
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:43,897
I broke up with him?

7
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,725
Was it because

8
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:47,846
he stole one of your friends' idea
for his graduation project

9
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:51,377
when he did his postgraduate study?

10
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:53,177
He already told me about it.

11
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,926
Due to that,

12
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:56,856
he lost many of his best friends.

13
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,257
He regretted it.

14
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:03,696
However,

15
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,365
there's a positive side to everything.

16
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:06,846
You wouldn't have gotten married
to my brother

17
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,496
had he not done so.

18
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,165
If so, it's impossible for us

19
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,897
to be together now.

20
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:16,896
Life is truly magical.

21
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:18,286
Why did you call me here

22
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:19,817
to view the house all of a sudden?

23
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,416
Just have a look at it.

24
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:22,777
What do you think?

25
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:30,736
It's pretty good.

26
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:32,136
What? Do you intend to buy it?

27
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,136
Not at all.

28
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,617
I don't have the money.

29
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,366
One of my friends

30
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,686
went abroad all of a sudden.

31
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,537
He told me to look after
his house for him.

32
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:46,896
I don't have time for that.

33
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:48,006
Am I right?

34
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,016
When I think about it,

35
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:50,366
you're the best candidate for the task.

36
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:52,257
This way, you don't need
to travel back and forth.

37
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,777
Are you sure about that?

38
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,217
Don't I need to pay the rent?

39
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:58,286
I'm looking after the house for him.

40
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:00,097
He has to pay me instead.

41
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,445
What a coincidence.

42
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:06,736
This place is quite near to my office.

43
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:08,126
That's why when

44
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:09,377
he told me about the location,

45
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,406
I thought that you were
the best candidate for the task.

46
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:14,537
It's just that you need
to take care of the house.

47
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:17,896
Okay?

48
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:19,617
I'll tell him about it
if you're okay with it.

49
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,377
Sure.

50
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,856
This is nice.

51
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,217
Alright.

52
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:26,736
(Are you serious?)

53
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,016
She said yes.

54
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:38,537
It's so nice.

55
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:49,856
Little tag-along?

56
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,377
Lan?

57
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:53,257
I'm here.

58
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:54,296
Look at you.

59
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:55,566
How did it go?

60
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,456
I was right, wasn't I?

61
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:58,696
We can always depend on Xiang Qian.

62
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,456
She's the most resourceful child
we have.

63
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:02,445
Xiang Zhong agreed to live there

64
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:03,205
after viewing it.

65
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:04,057
It's done, huh?

66
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:05,806
This is great.

67
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:06,686
She has both a job

68
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:07,885
and a place to live in.

69
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:09,377
We can rest at ease now.

70
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,016
Look. Isn't it great?

71
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:12,497
Let's "like" the post.

72
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,257
Come on.

73
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,176
Niu, press it for us.

74
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,205
He pressed it.

75
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:19,806
You're something else.

76
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:20,485
Don't do that.

77
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:21,696
- Be gentle.
- Where's your father?

78
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,057
Why is he ignoring you?

79
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:24,845
Did he go drinking again?

80
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,536
He's afraid of you. Stop teasing him.

81
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,776
Let's go and play.

82
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,246
Zhong.

83
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,456
What are you doing here again?

84
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:40,645
My class ended early.

85
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:41,536
I came here to wait for you.

86
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:42,776
Why are you waiting for me?

87
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:43,445
You parked

88
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,046
your electric scooter over there, right?

89
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,006
Hand me the keys.

90
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,057
I'll drive it back for you.

91
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:46,885
No need for that.

92
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,177
I'll drive it back on the weekend.

93
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:51,096
My car is over there.

94
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:53,576
I...

95
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:54,926
Why don't we practice driving

96
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,136
and help you to get familiar with it?

97
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,136
No need for that.

98
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,806
I think you can

99
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,016
step on the gas accordingly.

100
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:24,257
Just shut up. Don't talk.

101
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:26,405
I can shut up.

102
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:27,525
If you're in no hurry,

103
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:28,497
I think...

104
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,057
I can shut up.

105
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,377
But you see, if you're in no hurry,

106
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:38,926
if you maintain this speed,

107
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:40,857
we can definitely reach home

108
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,456
by tomorrow night.

109
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:55,016
Red light, stop!

110
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,885
Can you stop following me?

111
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:01,656
You're making me nervous.

112
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:18,257
Green light, go.

113
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,817
Step on the brakes.

114
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:42,896
Step on the brakes! My goodness!

115
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:43,896
Xiang Zhong!

116
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:45,445
Xiang Zhong!

117
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,126
Xiang Zhong!

118
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:46,885
Are you okay?

119
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,257
Let me see.

120
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:51,126
The handbrake.

121
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:52,405
Pull the handbrake.

122
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:53,046
Where's the handbrake?

123
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:53,937
Over there.

124
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:01,006
Open the door.

125
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:01,696
Don't be nervous.

126
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,377
Come. Slowly.

127
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:04,617
Come.

128
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:05,937
Come.

129
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:07,257
You're okay, right?

130
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,536
Good.

131
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,177
Good.

132
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,576
At least you're fine.

133
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:12,497
Be careful.

134
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:13,536
There's no rush.

135
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,366
Slowly.

136
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,765
- This won't do.
- What?

137
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,177
This won't do.

138
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,977
That was terrifying!

139
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,297
This is normal.

140
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:28,486
Is driving that terrifying?

141
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,806
It's all your fault.

142
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,336
You made me drive.

143
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:33,486
It's been so long since I last drove.

144
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,617
That was terrifying.

145
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,417
Let's stop, then.

146
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,896
That was so terrifying.

147
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:45,246
Get in.

148
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,216
I'll drive.

149
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:14,806
(A buddy of mine, who fell out of love,)

150
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,845
(requested this song)

151
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:17,726
(for his ex-lover.)

152
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:18,686
(He wishes)

153
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,377
(that he and his ex-lover)

154
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:21,686
(can forgive each other)

155
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:24,456
(even if they do drift apart
on this long road called life.)

156
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,845
(Here's "Look Into My Eyes and Tell Me")

157
00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:27,566
(for all of our listeners.)

158
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,937
♪Can you look at me in the eyes?♪

159
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:36,297
♪When will you tell me?♪

160
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:39,337
♪Look into my eyes and tell me♪

161
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:44,296
♪Maybe I'm overthinking it♪

162
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:47,816
♪You said nothing♪

163
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:52,656
♪I acted nonchalantly♪

164
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,936
♪Forget it. Keep it to yourself♪

165
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,016
Why did you turn it off?

166
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,977
Did you request that song?

167
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:05,966
How could that be?

168
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,977
If not, why did you turn
on the radio for no reason?

169
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,617
Just now,

170
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,737
it was kind of awkward.

171
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:16,416
You know that it was awkward too, huh?

172
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,857
What do you mean by that?

173
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,765
I'll stop the car.

174
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:23,726
I'll get off.

175
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,176
You can drive yourself back, okay?

176
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,525
What did you mean by that?

177
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,565
Look at me.

178
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,217
It was awkward trying to chat...

179
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,337
Sorry.

180
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,097
I'm truly sorry.

181
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:43,977
I...

182
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:47,206
I was getting agitated.

183
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,697
That's why I started spouting nonsense.

184
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:51,337
Sorry.

185
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:52,726
I shouldn't have done so.

186
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:53,846
I'll take back my words.

187
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,337
I'll take all of my words back.

188
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,337
I'll take back the song request too.

189
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:00,936
Sorry about that.

190
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:13,776
You look so pretty when you smile.

191
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,737
You look even prettier when you don't.

192
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,497
Deng Haiyang, let me warn you.

193
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,486
I may be sitting in your car,

194
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:29,056
but that doesn't mean
I have certain intentions.

195
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:34,416
Agreed.

196
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,016
I don't have any intentions either.

197
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:40,565
Both of us don't have any intentions.

198
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:43,497
We have no intentions toward each other.

199
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:06,896
Xiang Nan,

200
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:09,776
what has Jiaqiao been busy
with all this while?

201
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,217
Why is she never home?

202
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:12,656
I don't know.

203
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,896
Did she get into another relationship?

204
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:22,217
What's the matter?

205
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:24,377
I don't know either.

206
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:28,405
Are you guys

207
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:29,816
hiding something from me?

208
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,737
That's not it. What's wrong?

209
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:33,097
It's nothing.

210
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:36,126
Rest early.

211
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,217
I'll go to sleep first.

212
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:38,257
Go ahead.

213
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:03,617
Zhong, what's wrong?

214
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,902
(Tenancy Agreement Party B: Xiang Zhijun)
What are you doing?

215
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,697
Why did you guys
join hands to deceive me?

216
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:13,206
The house we viewed last time,

217
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,936
Dad and Mom rented it for me.

218
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,416
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

219
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,217
Just stay there, won't you?

220
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,285
They gave me a mission.

221
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:22,857
It was to convince you
to stay in the unit.

222
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,377
They didn't want me
to tell you the truth.

223
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,136
Are you willing to stay there
if you were in my shoes?

224
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,126
They're no longer young.

225
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,697
It isn't easy for them to save money.

226
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:31,617
And now, they're renting
a house for me in Shanghai?

227
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:33,217
Aren't I sponging them off?

228
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,136
Just take it as me
renting the house, okay?

229
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:37,925
How are you renting it?

230
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:39,486
You still have a family to raise.

231
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,257
It's not like your fortune
was a windfall.

232
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:43,805
If you don't stay there,

233
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,697
Dad and Mom will be upset again.

234
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,377
They're upset about plenty of things.

235
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,536
Anyway, I won't be staying there.

236
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:52,885
In the future, just tell them

237
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:53,966
to find me directly.

238
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,296
Can you please stay out of my affairs?

239
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:56,246
Why didn't you

240
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:57,285
go and tell them about it?

241
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:58,377
Why did you come and find me instead?

242
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,737
I'm a busybody.

243
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,337
I'm wrong no matter what I do.

244
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,006
Listen up.

245
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,416
We've already paid the deposit.

246
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:05,685
If you cancel the rent now,

247
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:06,966
you'll be breaching the contract.

248
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:07,805
We won't get a single cent back.

249
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:08,816
You should think twice.

250
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,896
Miss, isn't the house great?

251
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,337
The rent is cheap too.

252
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:21,896
Everyone wants to rent it.

253
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,885
Yeah, I know that it's a great house.

254
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,925
If it's that popular,

255
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:26,377
just rent it out for me, okay?

256
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,525
There's no issue with that.

257
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:30,016
I can do that with a snap of my fingers.

258
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:30,885
However, we've already

259
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,086
signed a contract.

260
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,285
If you're renting it out,

261
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:34,816
it'll be considered
a breach of contract.

262
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,326
It's fine no matter what you do.

263
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,896
Anyway, I'll stop renting the place.

264
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,565
If you wish to stop renting the place,

265
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,246
we won't be able to refund you

266
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:45,416
the rent and the deposit.

267
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:46,685
I said, I'll stop renting the place.

268
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,217
Why can't I get a refund then?

269
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,165
Even so, we don't have a choice.

270
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,285
No one forced you guys

271
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:53,097
to sign the contract back then?

272
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:57,457
Miss,

273
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,206
this is a great house.

274
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:00,656
Why aren't you renting it?

275
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,136
I can't afford it.

276
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:07,097
Xiang Zhong.

277
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:08,296
Xiang Zhong.

278
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,016
What are you doing here?

279
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,656
I was planning to look for you.

280
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,296
What's wrong?

281
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:15,925
You crashed the car yesterday.

282
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:16,765
I need to file a claim.

283
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,257
I might need your ID card.

284
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,126
You didn't need to come here personally.

285
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:21,606
I can deliver it to you

286
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,377
with an online service.

287
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:24,925
I don't have any classes this afternoon.

288
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,326
And, I was free as well.

289
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,457
That's why I...

290
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:32,016
Alright.

291
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:33,577
Are you

292
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,337
renting a house?

293
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:36,285
That's not it.

294
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:36,977
Miss!

295
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:39,536
Miss,

296
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,097
you forgot to take the contract.

297
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:43,805
Don't you want to reconsider it?

298
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:44,925
I won't.

299
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,685
If you don't give me a refund,

300
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:46,656
I'll look for you every day.

301
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,136
Xiang Zhong.

302
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,136
Were you scammed
when you rented the house?

303
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:58,885
That's not it.

304
00:14:58,886 --> 00:14:59,805
Why don't you let me take a look

305
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:00,737
at the contract?

306
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,457
Mind your own business.

307
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:04,006
What about this?

308
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:04,966
One of Qian Feng's classmates

309
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,165
was a real estate agent.

310
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:06,606
Give it to me.

311
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,645
I'll tell him
to analyze it for you, okay?

312
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:08,457
No need for that.

313
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:09,606
You're so annoying.

314
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:10,936
Stop following me.

315
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:12,056
I...

316
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,776
(Jiaqiao is coming home
with her boyfriend tonight.)

317
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,176
(You should return early too.)

318
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,217
Hello, Xiang Nan?

319
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:58,337
Jiaqiao,

320
00:15:58,406 --> 00:15:59,726
are you going to bring Lv Liang

321
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:00,936
back home for dinner tonight?

322
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,925
Yeah.

323
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,846
My brother wants to conduct
a sudden inspection.

324
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,285
He asked me if I was in a relationship.

325
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:08,606
I thought that I had
to break the news to him eventually.

326
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:09,896
That's why I told him.

327
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,366
Did you tell him

328
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,416
about my relationship with him, then?

329
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,217
You don't say? You think I'm a fool?

330
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,217
In my opinion,

331
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:22,405
why don't you explain it

332
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:23,857
to your brother first?

333
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,497
If I do so, he'll never agree to it.

334
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:27,285
Xiang Nan,

335
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,326
don't tell him about it either.

336
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:29,606
If both of us keep quiet,

337
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:30,726
no one will find out.

338
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:31,446
Okay?

339
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:32,126
That's all for now.

340
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,126
I'm busy.

341
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:34,136
I'll hang up now.

342
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,536
Madam, you've returned.

343
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:49,857
Come.

344
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,326
Is Jiaqiao back?

345
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,377
She just came back.

346
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:55,497
Our guest is here too.

347
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:56,377
He's here?

348
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:59,136
Mr. Jiang said you should head
to the study room after your return.

349
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:05,056
Okay.

350
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,616
Which college did you graduate from?

351
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,886
Tokyo University of the Arts.

352
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:22,937
Was I talking to you?

353
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,616
So, you went to Japan long ago, huh?

354
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,056
I took my PhD in Japan.

355
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,206
I took my undergraduate

356
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,536
and postgraduate degrees in China.

357
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:35,296
Which local college did you go to?

358
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:40,257
Xiang Nan,

359
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:41,417
you're back.

360
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:44,856
Come.

361
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:49,657
Let me introduce someone to you.

362
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:51,056
This is Lv Liang.

363
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,177
He's Jiaqiao's boyfriend.

364
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:55,217
This is my wife,

365
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:56,177
Xiang Nan.

366
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:57,765
Nice to meet you.

367
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:58,536
Nice to meet you.

368
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,056
Have a seat.

369
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:02,657
Have a seat.

370
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,697
Where were we just now?

371
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,486
We held an exhibition.

372
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:12,816
It was a huge success.

373
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,816
Lv Liang can tell you about it.

374
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:17,257
Mr. Lv,

375
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,217
which local college did you go to?

376
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,816
China Academy of Arts.

377
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:32,937
What a coincidence.

378
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,016
Xiang Nan,

379
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,977
you and Mr. Lv studied
in the same college.

380
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:41,536
Have you two not met each other
before in school?

381
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:46,376
I think we're several years apart
in graduation.

382
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:48,016
Which batch are you from?

383
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:49,816
Batch 2006.

384
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,977
After graduation I worked
for a couple of years.

385
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:56,056
I started my postgraduate study in 2015.

386
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,856
2015, huh?

387
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:01,737
Xiang Nan,

388
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,536
I remember you told me

389
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:06,096
that you entered college in 2015, right?

390
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,257
That's right.

391
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:10,926
If that's the case,

392
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,246
I suppose you guys
studied in the same college

393
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:13,856
for three years,

394
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:15,056
am I right?

395
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:16,977
Have you two not met
each other in college before?

396
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:24,966
The college is huge.

397
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,006
There are plenty of students.

398
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:26,646
Even if they've met before,

399
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:28,085
they might not remember each other.

400
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:29,257
Not necessarily.

401
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:33,137
I think a handsome coursemate like Mr. Lv

402
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,257
will surely leave
a deep impression on other people.

403
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,096
Xiang Nan, don't you agree?

404
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:50,016
Jiaqiao.

405
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,616
Did you not tell Mr. Lv

406
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:55,605
that he and Xiang Nan

407
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:56,616
studied in the same college before?

408
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:57,616
I...

409
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,816
Of course I did.

410
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,285
When we first met,

411
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,325
we started chatting

412
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:04,765
precisely because

413
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:06,737
he studied in the same college
as Xiang Nan.

414
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:07,765
If so, why didn't you

415
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:09,257
tell me about it before?

416
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,576
You didn't ask me about it.

417
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:21,977
Jiaqiao,

418
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,816
go and see if dinner is ready.

419
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:25,206
I'll go.

420
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,056
Xiang Nan,

421
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,417
let Jiaqiao go.

422
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,056
You and Mr. Lv are alumni
from the same college.

423
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,697
You guys can catch up with each other.

424
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:35,296
Why are you still here?

425
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:41,217
Okay.

426
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:44,977
You guys can enjoy your chat.

427
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:57,897
Mr. Lv.

428
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:00,886
You've graduated for many years.

429
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:02,376
Why didn't you establish a family?

430
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:04,217
I was too busy.

431
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:05,257
I had no time.

432
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:11,336
Mr. Lv, you're dashing and talented.

433
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:13,616
I'm sure you have plenty of girlfriends.

434
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,576
Before Jiaqiao,

435
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:28,576
I only had two serious relationships.

436
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:30,816
That can't be.

437
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,406
I heard that people in the arts industry

438
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,177
have plenty of relationships.

439
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:40,616
I'm serious when it comes
to my relationships.

440
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:45,845
May I ask you something, then?

441
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,737
Please go ahead.

442
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,336
So,

443
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:52,096
the two girlfriends you had before this,

444
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:53,657
what were their occupations?

445
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:02,977
What's wrong?

446
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:04,816
Is it inconvenient for you to tell me?

447
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:07,257
It's nothing major, you know?

448
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:10,816
Xiang Nan.

449
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,016
Xiang Nan?

450
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:39,616
You knew about my relationship with him.

451
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,217
If so, why did you tell him to come?

452
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,565
I just wanted to see how you two

453
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:44,937
would act in front of me?

454
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:46,726
Fine. The act is over.

455
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:47,325
What do you think?

456
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:48,417
Are you satisfied?

457
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,177
What do you guys think?

458
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:54,576
Stop right there.

459
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,016
You knew about it long ago.

460
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:04,697
Why didn't you tell me?

461
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:07,085
Jiang Jiaqiao truly fancied him.

462
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:07,886
Would you agree to it

463
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:08,765
if I told you about it?

464
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,816
Jiang Jiaqiao is an idiot.

465
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:12,336
Are you an idiot too?

466
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,576
This is an awkward relationship.

467
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:19,125
How do you expect me

468
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:20,296
to get along with him in the future?

469
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:21,765
Don't you think that it's awkward?

470
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:24,525
No matter what had happened between us,

471
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:25,525
it's all in the past now.

472
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:26,565
It's been so many years.

473
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:27,856
Was it truly that simple?

474
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:32,056
You guys got together

475
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:33,897
right after you joined college, right?

476
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:36,536
And, you guys were
together for three years.

477
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:45,856
This should be
your first relationship, right?

478
00:23:46,846 --> 00:23:49,376
Does it truly carry no weight
in your heart?

479
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,137
How come you know everything about me?

480
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:57,816
You investigated my background,
didn't you?

481
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:02,336
I should've thought of it.

482
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:05,177
My college life, high school life,
primary school life,

483
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:06,446
including my family relationships,

484
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,006
my parents, and my biological parents,

485
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:08,886
did you conduct

486
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:10,365
an investigation on all of those?

487
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,776
I'm going to marry you.

488
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,056
Of course I have to know you well.

489
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,657
Xiang Nan,

490
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:22,096
I can choose to ignore your past.

491
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:24,886
But you and Jiang Jiaqiao

492
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:26,576
actually joined hands to deceive me.

493
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,006
And now, you guys even dare

494
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,457
to bring him back.

495
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,697
Who do you think I am?

496
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:33,497
I can pretend to be silly.

497
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,257
But you better don't take me for a fool!

498
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,856
What do you mean by that?

499
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:39,805
You think I'm still keeping
in touch with him?

500
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:40,886
You know what you've done the best.

501
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:41,765
I don't know.

502
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:43,206
Tell me, then. What have I done?

503
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:44,166
You went to find him in his studio once.

504
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:44,977
Am I right?

505
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,565
You guys broke up for a long time.

506
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:47,365
Even so, you two were still in touch.

507
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:48,897
You think I had no idea?

508
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:51,646
Were you spying on me?

509
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:52,325
I was just concerned about you.

510
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,726
The people I see every day,

511
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:54,726
the places I go to,

512
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,246
you've checked all of them thoroughly.

513
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:57,365
You call that being concerned?

514
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:57,926
Huh?

515
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:58,565
You're my wife.

516
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:00,457
I have the right
to know what you're doing.

517
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,457
You're terrifying.

518
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:05,616
- Stop right there.
-What are you doing?

519
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:06,977
Explain yourself.

520
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:08,765
Explain myself?

521
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:09,805
Is there even a need for that?

522
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:10,886
You already know everything about me.

523
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,016
What do you want me to say?

524
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:12,525
That's right.

525
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:13,765
Lv Liang and I were in a relationship.

526
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:14,737
It lasted for three years.

527
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:15,966
If you did do your research,

528
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,406
you should know that our relationship

529
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:18,816
was more than just a puppy love.

530
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:19,805
Do you need me

531
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:21,726
to tell you about the details
of our relationship?

532
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,697
Are you saying that
to gross me out on purpose?

533
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:25,776
Gross you out?

534
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:26,966
Why weren't you grossed out

535
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:27,805
by your own actions

536
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,177
when you investigated me?

537
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,977
What's wrong with me
having a relationship?

538
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:32,085
You had an ex-wife!

539
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:32,765
You were in a relationship with Ming Wei

540
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,765
and all those indecent women.

541
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,166
I've never asked you about them before.

542
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,006
Were you never grossed out

543
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:38,257
by your own actions?

544
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:44,417
Fine.

545
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,056
I'll gross you out right now.

546
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:50,457
You!

547
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,776
That was my graduation project.

548
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,457
That was also my first gift to you.

549
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:29,536
Has Lv Liang left?

550
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:33,776
He has.

551
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:37,336
Jiang Jiaqiao,

552
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:39,536
I know you're behind this prank.

553
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:43,536
In the future, you should never pull
such a prank again.

554
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:47,217
I'm serious about this relationship.

555
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:49,737
Don't blame Jiang Nan.

556
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:51,417
I told her to keep it from you.

557
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,137
It's because I know that you would

558
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,657
never let me be together with Lv Liang.

559
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,016
Jiang Jiaqiao.

560
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:01,576
Do you think you can hide this from me?

561
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:04,856
I'll try to hide it
for as long as I can.

562
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:06,726
The longer I hide it from you,

563
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,096
the longer my happiness will last.

564
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:15,016
Why did Lv Liang fall for you?

565
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,417
What exactly does he like about you?

566
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:21,217
Hongbin,

567
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:25,616
I always wanted to ask you this.

568
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:28,525
Am I, Jiang Jiaqiao,

569
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:29,856
always

570
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:32,977
a fool to you?

571
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:42,536
It's fine.

572
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:43,536
Forget it.

573
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,457
Anyway,

574
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:49,417
I feel elated
when I'm together with Lv Liang.

575
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:52,137
I'm very happy.

576
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:56,457
I've never been this happy
in my life before.

577
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:58,177
Fine.

578
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,776
I won't give you a single cent.

579
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,045
I'll see if he'll still come back for you.

580
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,096
Fine.

581
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:09,737
You can freeze my bank cards again.

582
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,296
Jiang Jiaqiao!

583
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:19,726
If you dare to take one step

584
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:20,856
out of the house,

585
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:23,497
you better don't come back again!

586
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:30,897
I'm serious.

587
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:38,576
Hongbin,

588
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:40,977
I'll be leaving now.

589
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:19,816
(Deng Haiyang: The real estate agent
agreed to give you a refund.)

590
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:39,296
Hello?

591
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:40,897
Xiang Zhong?

592
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:42,417
It's me.

593
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,257
Where's Deng Haiyang?

594
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,646
Haiyang was here just now.

595
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:50,016
Xiang Zhong, don't worry.

596
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:51,697
I'll look for him.

597
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,006
I don't know

598
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,257
what's wrong with him today.

599
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:55,365
He didn't drink much,

600
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:56,697
yet he had already
thrown up several times.

601
00:31:56,846 --> 00:31:57,897
Wait for a moment.

602
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:00,737
Haiyang?

603
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:02,177
Haiyang?

604
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:03,525
Are you okay?

605
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:04,616
Are you done?

606
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:05,765
Can you guys

607
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:07,616
stop drinking like this every day?

608
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,217
Xiang Zhong,

609
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,856
no one wants to do this, you know?

610
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,697
We were finally able

611
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:15,085
to ask

612
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:17,177
the real estate manager out.

613
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,336
And, he gave us
the refund for the rent.

614
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:22,937
We have to thank him.

615
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:24,246
Xiang Zhong,

616
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:25,166
you can tell me first

617
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,576
if you need anything.

618
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,056
I still need to keep him company.

619
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:34,536
It's nothing.

620
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,296
Don't drink that much.

621
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:37,616
Xiang Zhong,

622
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:38,646
you don't need to worry

623
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:40,536
when I'm here.

624
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,697
I'll definitely
take good care of Haiyang.

625
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,457
I'll drink as much

626
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:46,376
as what Haiyang drinks.

627
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,616
Haiyang,

628
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,576
come out when you're done throwing up.

629
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,457
Xiang Zhong, I'll hang up now.

630
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:11,336
(Xiang Zhong: Thank you.)

631
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,056
Mom.

632
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:26,417
We'll be heading
to Grandma's house tomorrow.

633
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:28,856
Will Dad come as well?

634
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,257
You miss Dad, huh?

635
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:34,897
Yeah.

636
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,376
He will come.

637
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:38,296
Go to sleep now.

638
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:40,246
Good night, Mom.

639
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:41,137
Good night.

640
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,045
(You should return to Kunshan)

641
00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:17,577
(after your thesis defense tomorrow.)

642
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,456
(Dad said we should
celebrate the occasion together.)

643
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,990
(Gao Ping)

644
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:38,856
(I wish you success.)

645
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,880
(Typing...)

646
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,520
(Qian Feng)

647
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,496
Qian Feng, what's wrong?

648
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:27,816
Xiang Zhong,

649
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,057
please come.

650
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,816
Haiyang won't make it!

651
00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:35,816
What's wrong with him?

652
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,190
(Emergency Department)

653
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:46,697
Qian Feng?

654
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:47,856
Qian Feng!

655
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:49,416
Qian Feng, wake up!

656
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:50,926
Where's Deng Haiyang?

657
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:51,936
What's going on?

658
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,165
I think he's undergoing surgery
right now.

659
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:55,846
I told you guys

660
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:57,006
to not drink that much.

661
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:57,725
Why must you guys drink

662
00:35:57,726 --> 00:35:58,605
so much?

663
00:35:58,606 --> 00:36:00,737
Xiang Zhong,
we didn't drink much this time.

664
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:04,296
I think Haiyang
was in a bad mood lately.

665
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:05,645
He threw up
after finishing his first glass.

666
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,685
Why did you still let him drink, then?

667
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:07,737
You should've kept an eye on him.

668
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:08,605
The manager said bottoms up.

669
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:10,137
We had to drink.

670
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:12,217
Which of you is
Deng Haiyang's family member?

671
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:13,045
Me.

672
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:13,936
Come with me.

673
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,376
Keep an eye on my bag.

674
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,160
(Critically Ill Notice)

675
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:25,125
It's this serious?

676
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:27,257
The patient had acute alcohol poisoning.

677
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,326
We have already performed gastric lavage

678
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:30,336
and administered some laxatives.

679
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,121
However, the patient

680
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:34,250
is still in a coma.

681
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,486
His serum PH level

682
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,697
is below 7.2.

683
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:39,846
His blood pressure is unstable as well.

684
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:40,806
The blood biochemistry indicators

685
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:42,177
are still not quite normal.

686
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:44,856
Look at the clauses below.

687
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:45,966
If urgent intervention

688
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,205
is needed,

689
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,165
it'll involve intubating the patient

690
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,537
or putting them on a ventilator.

691
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:53,456
We need the signature of his family members
to proceed with the procedures.

692
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:55,406
Doctor,

693
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:57,217
please try your best to save him.

694
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,456
I'm begging you here.

695
00:36:58,686 --> 00:36:59,446
Don't worry.

696
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:00,896
We'll try our best.

697
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:02,376
You should sign the paper first.

698
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,720
(Signature of Family: Xiang Zhong)

699
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:16,120
(Emergency Department)

700
00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:22,017
Xiang Zhong,

701
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:24,976
should we call

702
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,336
his mother and tell her about it?

703
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,097
We should.

704
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:35,896
You can call her.

705
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:36,926
I assume she has blocked

706
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:37,936
my contact number by now.

707
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,177
Her phone is always off
during nighttime.

708
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:41,537
Try and call her.

709
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:48,926
Sorry.

710
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:50,605
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

711
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:51,537
Xiang Zhong.

712
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:53,936
Her phone is switched off.

713
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:56,976
So,

714
00:37:57,847 --> 00:37:59,617
I suppose you're sober by now.

715
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:03,886
Sorry for the trouble.

716
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:05,257
Please look for his mother.

717
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,017
This incident

718
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,336
is quite serious.

719
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:13,017
We can't make the call here.

720
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:16,617
If anything does happen,

721
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:20,245
we have to tell his mother

722
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:21,326
to be mentally prepared.

723
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:23,057
Xiang Zhong, it's fine.

724
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,085
I'll go and find her.

725
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:25,017
Don't worry.

726
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:27,737
Take good care of yourself too.

727
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,966
I'll hire a cab. Don't worry.

728
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:30,657
See you.

729
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:31,806
Safety first.

730
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:33,137
Call me anytime if you need anything.

731
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,920
(Emergency Complex Building)

732
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:06,896
Doctor, how is he?

733
00:39:07,086 --> 00:39:08,766
He has regained consciousness.

734
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:09,565
His vital signs

735
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:10,605
are stable now.

736
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:11,376
This is great.

737
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:12,326
We can transfer him

738
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:13,137
to the Inpatient Department tomorrow.

739
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:14,125
Thank you.

740
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:15,006
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

741
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:16,137
Let's handle the paperwork first.

742
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:45,737
Hello, Xiang.

743
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:48,936
Hello.

744
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:49,846
Xiang.

745
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:50,205
Hello.

746
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:51,045
Xiang.

747
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:51,976
Nice to meet you all.

748
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:55,177
Xiang, come.

749
00:39:56,447 --> 00:39:57,296
Let's go and drink.

750
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:58,376
I have no time.

751
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,565
Today, Gao Ping

752
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,296
will be graduating from his PhD study.

753
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:05,856
That's an occasion worth celebrating.

754
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,165
Which restaurant
do you guys plan to go to?

755
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,416
Restaurant? We'll celebrate it at home.

756
00:40:08,487 --> 00:40:10,137
No restaurants out there
can compete with my cooking.

757
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:11,577
Xiang,

758
00:40:11,686 --> 00:40:13,286
you can't afford

759
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,697
to be stingy this time.

760
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,006
You shouldn't try to save money.

761
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:17,137
Go away.

762
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,137
What do you mean by stingy?

763
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:21,617
It only feels like a reunion
when we eat at home.

764
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,846
A reunion, huh? Great.

765
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:25,097
Alright.

766
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:26,217
See you.

767
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:36,296
Xiang Zhong?

768
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:37,776
Xiang Zhong!

769
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:39,217
Lower your volume.

770
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,657
You came here so early in the morning.

771
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:45,737
I'm still worried about Haiyang.

772
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,045
- By the way,
- You...

773
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:48,366
When I was on my way back yesterday,

774
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:50,006
you called me and said
Haiyang was awake.

775
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:51,617
I didn't look for his mother after that.

776
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:52,766
I was worried that she might

777
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,177
be worried after she found out.

778
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:55,577
You have a point.

779
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:56,966
Since you're here,

780
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:58,366
you should deliver

781
00:40:58,367 --> 00:40:59,366
the rice soup
I bought at the breakfast shop

782
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:00,125
to him.

783
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:01,697
Doctor said he could
only take liquid food.

784
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:03,336
Wait.

785
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:04,645
You guys should remember this.

786
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:05,685
Next time, no matter if
it's a drinking session

787
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:07,685
or an important appointment,

788
00:41:07,686 --> 00:41:08,286
you guys

789
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:09,565
mustn't drink that much again, okay?

790
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:10,645
It'll kill you.

791
00:41:10,646 --> 00:41:11,416
Xiang Zhong.

792
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,456
We didn't want to drink either.

793
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:15,006
But we had no choice.

794
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:16,097
We were asking them for a favor.

795
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,006
If he wanted to drink,

796
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,245
we had to drink with him.

797
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:19,486
Besides, there was a huge issue

798
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:21,137
with the house you rented.

799
00:41:21,206 --> 00:41:22,856
What issue?

800
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,286
I'll deliver this to him first.

801
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,376
Hey, I'm talking to you.

802
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:28,486
Xiang Zhong,

803
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,366
you can ask Haiyang about it

804
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:31,806
when he has recovered,

805
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:32,645
okay?

806
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,205
I won't ask him.
I'll only ask you about it.

807
00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:35,205
What's the issue here?

808
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,376
Explain yourself.

809
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:39,896
Tell me.

810
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,257
Xiang Zhong,

811
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:45,806
when Haiyang knew
that you wanted to cancel the rent,

812
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:47,165
he told me to find

813
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,936
my classmate,
who was a real estate agent.

814
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,657
When we analyzed the case,

815
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:52,776
we thought

816
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:54,936
that the house you rented
was too cheap to be true.

817
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:56,737
That's why we tried to inquire about it.

818
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,217
Xiang Zhong, do you know this?

819
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:01,697
Actually, the house was haunted.

820
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:03,286
Two years ago,

821
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,565
the female tenant

822
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:05,406
was murdered by her boyfriend

823
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:06,617
in it.

824
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:08,406
But Haiyang told me
not to tell you about it.

825
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:09,806
It's because he knew

826
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:11,137
that Uncle rented the house for you.

827
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:12,286
He was afraid that you two
might have a conflict

828
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:13,416
because of this.

829
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:19,896
Thank...

830
00:42:20,807 --> 00:42:21,486
Thank you.

831
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:22,776
You guys have done me a huge favor.

832
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:24,217
So,

833
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:27,816
head inside and look after him
on my behalf.

834
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:29,296
Call me if you need anything.

835
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:31,296
Xiang Zhong,

836
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:36,976
actually, Haiyang still sees you

837
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:39,165
as

838
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,617
