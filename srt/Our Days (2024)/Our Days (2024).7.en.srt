=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 7=

4
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:40,936
Mum lost her hair
and went to the hospital.

5
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:42,776
You knew that, right?

6
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:45,056
If you already knew,
why didn't you tell me?

7
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:49,017
I'm afraid that it will affect your promotion
and delay your promising future.

8
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,045
Xiang Zhong, why are you
speaking so sarcastically?

9
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,165
What do you mean by that?

10
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,177
I didn't mean anything.

11
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,337
It'd better be nothing.

12
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,617
Don't you think
you're being so selfish?

13
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,006
All of you left here

14
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,605
and kept me alone in Kunshan.

15
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:04,737
What do you mean?

16
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,805
They care about you
and Xiang Nan the most.

17
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:07,846
Why did looking after them

18
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,537
become my responsibility?

19
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:12,486
What do you mean by

20
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:14,337
becoming your responsibility?

21
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:15,897
Xiang Nan did go home.

22
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:17,376
And, I came back too.

23
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,845
Xiang Zhong, I don't have time
to argue about this with you right now.

24
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:22,206
Don't test my patience.

25
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:23,766
How can you say such selfish words?

26
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,086
Yes, I'm the most selfish.

27
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,680
Don't call me for
any family matter after this.

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,737
Don't ever call me!

29
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,216
You scared me!

30
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:44,926
How do you feel?

31
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:46,125
Nothing.

32
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,857
I'm fine now.

33
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,086
What happened to me this morning?

34
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,245
It felt like a huge lid

35
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:52,617
just slammed down.

36
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:54,486
I couldn't see or hear anything.

37
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,496
I thought I was going to die today.

38
00:02:57,126 --> 00:03:00,017
You're good at scaring yourself.

39
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,446
Look at yourself now,

40
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,725
having some issues
at your age is normal, okay?

41
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,737
You can just call us, and we may go to
the hospital for a check-up.

42
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:08,805
Look,

43
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:10,496
everything is okay now.

44
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:13,936
Alright, stop lecturing me.

45
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:16,936
Did you two argue outside?

46
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:21,297
She's your younger sister,
give her some leeway.

47
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,577
Even though she's younger,

48
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:25,617
she's thirty now.

49
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:26,886
How can someone in her thirties

50
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,656
still say whatever
she likes without filter?

51
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,337
She didn't mean it.

52
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,017
Don't take it seriously.

53
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:34,417
When you first

54
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,457
went off to university,

55
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:40,256
she would hide herself in the blanket
and cry at night.

56
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,886
The next morning
when I noticed her red and puffy eyes,

57
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,285
I would ask her if she missed you,

58
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:47,137
she would roll her eyes at me,

59
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,137
saying that she didn't.

60
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,137
Actually, she couldn't bear
to part with you.

61
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:02,617
Xiang Zhong.

62
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,177
Xiang Zhong!

63
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,457
Come over here.

64
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:11,897
There's something very important.

65
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,577
It's an important decision of the family.

66
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,216
You're the first one I tell it.

67
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:24,057
When I go to Shenzhen,
I'll take dad and mum with me.

68
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,656
Are you serious?

69
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:27,525
Yes.

70
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:29,377
I discussed it with mum just now.

71
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:30,817
But,

72
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,686
you know the old man's personality.

73
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,216
Will he be able
to adapt himself in Shenzhen?

74
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,937
Probably not.

75
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,377
But if he stays home, you'll be burdened.

76
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,206
If they come with me,

77
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,017
they won't be used to it.

78
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:50,856
It turns out to be an unsolvable issue.

79
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,536
What if I don't go to Shenzhen?

80
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:58,086
Go ahead!
It's such a great opportunity.

81
00:04:58,087 --> 00:04:59,497
Why wouldn't you?

82
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:04,457
So, why are you sulking there?

83
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,577
Is it because
you can't bear to leave me?

84
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:08,856
Who can't bear to leave you?

85
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,616
Mum told me that

86
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,405
when I left for university,

87
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,736
you missed me a lot

88
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:19,057
and used to hide and cry in the blanket.

89
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,216
She's just making things up.

90
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:25,776
It must be true, right?

91
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,000
Mum told me that
every time she asked you,

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,457
you'd always roll your eyes like this.

93
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:30,736
Am I right?

94
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,536
Did you speak to the lawyer?

95
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,216
Yes.

96
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:41,697
What did he say?

97
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,096
Just to gather more evidence.

98
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,257
If you do end up getting divorced,

99
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:50,616
what is your plan?

100
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:55,137
I don't know.

101
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:03,686
Alright.

102
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,137
Mum is awake. You go in first.

103
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:07,337
Qian, Zhong.

104
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:10,405
Forget it.

105
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:11,845
Our family's precious baby is here.

106
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:13,360
I'll come back
to take over in the afternoon.

107
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:14,697
I get to go.

108
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:16,566
Zhong, where are you going?

109
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:17,497
I have something to do.

110
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,337
What's wrong with Zhong?

111
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:24,405
Xiang Nan, I'll transfer this 30,000 yuan to you,
so you can transact it to Jiang Hongbin.

112
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:25,646
He covered

113
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,017
mum's deposit.

114
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:27,806
No need.

115
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,497
Don't transfer it.

116
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:30,886
Why not?

117
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:33,096
We can't trouble him with this.

118
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:35,646
We're getting married.

119
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:37,126
Then, we're practically family.

120
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:39,057
It's fine for him to help out a little.

121
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:40,365
But, you're not married yet.

122
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,616
This sort of thing should be kept clear.

123
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,416
Even if I give it to him,
he wouldn't accept it.

124
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,485
You find your own way.

125
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,697
When you're leaving later,
send Zhong a message.

126
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,616
Are you leaving too?

127
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,590
(Mogan Mountain, Hangzhou)

128
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:17,086
Could you help me check in?

129
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,337
Gao Ping!

130
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,137
Why are you here?

131
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,697
What a coincidence!

132
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:24,497
I came here with some friends.

133
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:27,856
I have two friends arriving later.

134
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:40,525
Li Shu,

135
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,365
these restaurants have high ratings.

136
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:43,736
Do you want to take a look?

137
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:45,246
Gao Ping, I...

138
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,296
Go on ahead.

139
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:49,536
Here's your room key.

140
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:50,216
Thank you.

141
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:52,377
Li Shu, look at this one.

142
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:55,937
This one looks good.

143
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:57,257
Keep this.

144
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,176
Gao Ping!

145
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:19,736
Good morning!

146
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:22,697
Morning.

147
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:24,656
Where are your friends?

148
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,176
Why didn't they come for breakfast?

149
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,736
They had something to do,
so they've left earlier.

150
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,416
Gao Ping,

151
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,616
do you like corn too?

152
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,457
I love eating it.

153
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,765
I think

154
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:47,177
you seem moody and unhappy.

155
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:49,616
Did you quarrel with your wife?

156
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:50,777
No.

157
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,136
Still saying no.

158
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,256
Gao Ping,

159
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,896
you've been lying.

160
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,057
You didn't come here with friends, right?

161
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:04,926
You just wanted some time alone,

162
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:08,657
and escaped from the fight, right?

163
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:12,976
A senior of mine at Hong Kong University's
Faculty of Medicine

164
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:14,645
helped me submit an application.

165
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:17,496
They seemed interested in my profile

166
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:20,136
and might offer me an interview.

167
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,896
I plan to go to Hong Kong, China in a few days.

168
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,896
You're right.

169
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,057
So, could you give me
some space to be alone?

170
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,496
Sure, no problem!

171
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:38,177
Gao Ping,

172
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,457
you know what the juniors say about you?

173
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,360
They say you're good-looking,

174
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,200
have a house and a car,
graduated with a PhD

175
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
and was assigned to work
at the Alma-mater after graduation.

176
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,216
But there's one downside.

177
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,537
You married at a very young age.

178
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,136
Here I come.

179
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,256
How is it going?

180
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,457
Is everything smooth?

181
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,376
Pretty good.

182
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:46,817
I'm going to take a shower.

183
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,177
Gao Ping, you have a phone call.

184
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,856
You pick it up for me.

185
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:08,657
Hello?

186
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,457
Is this Mr. Gao Ping?

187
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:13,616
Who is this speaking?

188
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:23,096
Who has just called me?

189
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,896
An innkeeper.

190
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:33,216
You left something behind,

191
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,697
and they're sending it back to you.

192
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,177
You didn't go to Hong Kong, China.

193
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,937
Why were you at Mogan Shan?

194
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,697
Actually,

195
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:49,016
there was no trial lecture.

196
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:52,200
The Faculty of Medicine
of Hong Kong University

197
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,616
didn't accept my application.

198
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,376
You could have just told me.

199
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,577
I didn't know how to tell you.

200
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,297
Your family hoped
you could go to Shenzhen.

201
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,577
And, your company
has set on you going there.

202
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,216
I didn't want to hold you back.

203
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:21,736
So, hiding out at Mogan Shan
will solve things?

204
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,457
I know it won't.

205
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:30,177
But, I don't know what to do

206
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:33,256
besides hiding myself for a few days.

207
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,537
You know I didn't start with much.

208
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,457
I never aimed for a grand lifestyle.

209
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:51,537
Having you,

210
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:54,577
Cong, and Qi with me now,

211
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:59,256
if I had a stable job

212
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,937
and live an ordinary life,

213
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,297
I would be satisfied.

214
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:05,926
In the past ten years,

215
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,736
I moved from Guizhou to Shanghai,

216
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,457
from a master's to a PhD.

217
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:15,256
My studies, life,
and friends are all here.

218
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,777
When I think of moving to Shenzhen,

219
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:24,177
I have no idea what I'll do
or if I'll even fit in.

220
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:30,297
I'm afraid I'll end up
being a burden on this family.

221
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,216
How come you are a burden to us?

222
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:47,817
Cong, Qi and I

223
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,337
all need you.

224
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:52,216
I think communication
between husband and wife is essential.

225
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:57,057
We can discuss everything together, right?

226
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,736
I'm also very content with our current life.

227
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:06,485
As long as our family of four is together,

228
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:08,177
although it is just an ordinary life,

229
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,496
I'm satisfied.

230
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:50,937
Gao Ping is back?

231
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,376
He's back.

232
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:53,976
How did it go?

233
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:55,937
Quite good.

234
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:59,256
So, when are you leaving?

235
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,216
It's not set yet.

236
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:05,297
In a new place,

237
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,485
you'll have to find housing,

238
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:08,965
a kindergarten for the kids, and a school.

239
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,937
You'll have to adjust
to a new position too.

240
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:14,136
I'm afraid it might be overwhelming.

241
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,496
Don't worry.

242
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,845
You often speak harshly.

243
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,245
Be kinder to Gao Ping.

244
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,765
He's making a big sacrifice
for you, right?

245
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:28,657
It's not easy for you
to have someone like him.

246
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,046
Got it.

247
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,736
Dad already talked to me.

248
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,206
You're coming back

249
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,686
several times a week now.

250
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,657
Now, you're moving so far away.

251
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,856
I'm worried you won't get used to it.

252
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:44,406
We're okay.

253
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:45,537
We'll be fine.

254
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,896
If anything comes up, we'll call you.

255
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:49,645
But if you're in a meeting,

256
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:51,777
put your phone on silent,
and don't reply instantly.

257
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:54,457
Answer us when you have time.

258
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:58,577
Mum.

259
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:00,736
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:06,577
What's there to be sorry for?

261
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,496
You're doing what you want,
working a job you love.

262
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,976
Your dad and I are happy for you.

263
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:20,086
If you're on a long or short holiday,

264
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,057
there's no rush to come back.

265
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:26,777
If we miss you too much,
we'll go visit you.

266
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,216
You just take the time to rest

267
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,376
and catch up on some sleep.

268
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:00,566
I want to go help you,

269
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,616
but I'm afraid of causing you trouble.

270
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,806
But, you're moving so far away suddenly,

271
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,256
I'll miss you a lot.

272
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:16,656
If you regret it, don't go.

273
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,737
I haven't left yet.

274
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,057
You've never been so far from home.

275
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:29,057
It's your first time.

276
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:33,616
Mum knows you're doing great.
You're awesome.

277
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,416
We're the ones who can't let you go.

278
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:52,777
Mum is pretty useless, right?

279
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:57,176
Who says so?

280
00:17:58,487 --> 00:17:59,526
You just stay at home

281
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:01,416
and be dad's little princess.

282
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,165
Sometimes, he says

283
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,537
I'm his daughter too.

284
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,760
We have a good understanding
of her condition now.

285
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,640
Other than a slightly high
cholesterol and blood pressure,

286
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,257
the other indexes are good.

287
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:19,645
There's a small nodule in the lungs

288
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:21,376
that needs regular check-ups.

289
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:23,405
She has some kidney stones,

290
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,497
but it's not a major concern.

291
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,605
The most important thing now is

292
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,337
she has a mild tendency
towards depression.

293
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,936
It's not severe, but it needs attention.

294
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:33,845
Family members should try
to spend more time accompanying her,

295
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,936
talking with her,
and offering encouragement.

296
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:39,136
Does she need any medication for that?

297
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:40,526
Let's observe for now.

298
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,896
For now, we'll focus on
psychological counseling.

299
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:46,656
Alright. Thank you, doctor.

300
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:03,645
It's so late now.

301
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,257
You're not home with the kids,

302
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:08,136
but hanging out with him?

303
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:09,577
Yeah.

304
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,856
Give the opportunity to Sun Ying.

305
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,086
After days of struggling,

306
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,645
I finally made a decision.

307
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:21,337
So I have to tell you now.

308
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,737
How much did Sun Ying bribe you?

309
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,286
How can I reveal it to you?

310
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:33,977
After all, it is a bribery.

311
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:39,577
I've finally made a decision.

312
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:42,577
After thinking it over,

313
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:48,696
I realized that for me,
family comes first.

314
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,656
This belief has been deeply ingrained

315
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:54,685
since childhood.

316
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:56,856
So I don't want to stay
too far away from my parents.

317
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,777
When I was choosing a university,
I wanted to go to Beijing,

318
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,246
but I ended up choosing

319
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:03,777
a university closer to Shanghai

320
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,000
because I don't wish to be
too far away from my parents

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,656
and my two younger sisters.

322
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:16,405
Have you already decided?

323
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,977
Yes, I've decided. I feel relieved now.

324
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,577
Then, I can only give you one word.

325
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:26,936
If it's negative, keep it to yourself.

326
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,936
I wish you happiness.

327
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,057
This is acceptable. Thank you.

328
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:40,645
You're back.

329
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,645
You are asleep.

330
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:43,217
Just get into bed now.

331
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:45,337
You go to sleep first.

332
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,456
I still need to revise my thesis.

333
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:53,096
With everything about my promotion,

334
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,777
it put a lot of pressure on you.

335
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:58,645
Now, let me formally announce,

336
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:00,017
I decided not to go to Shenzhen.

337
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:04,577
We'll stay here and live well.

338
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,497
It's not because of you.

339
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:09,856
It's because my parents
and aunty are getting older.

340
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,817
I don't want to be too far from them.

341
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:13,566
So from now on,

342
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,125
you can focus on your thesis

343
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:19,376
without any worries or pressure.

344
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,057
I won't disturb you, Dr. Gao.

345
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:25,337
Xiang Qian,

346
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:29,977
thank you

347
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,297
for considering me so much.

348
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:33,777
You don't need to thank me.

349
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:36,577
You always consider me too.

350
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,297
If you're tired, just sleep.

351
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:10,817
Our daughter looks very beautiful.

352
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,136
Yeah, very pretty.

353
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:21,856
(Congratulations!)

354
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:43,656
Xiang Qian.

355
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:45,977
Come on.

356
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:50,685
Thank you for coming.

357
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:52,125
What is the big deal

358
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:53,497
that makes you treat me to lunch?

359
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,777
It's not a big deal,
but it's not small either.

360
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:56,605
Xiang Nan says,

361
00:23:56,606 --> 00:24:00,456
tomorrow our whole family have to meet
with Jiang Hongbin's family.

362
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:01,896
That's it?

363
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:04,217
I know.

364
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,046
Now that they're engaged.

365
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,726
He's basically our son-in-law.

366
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,896
I should prepare a greeting gift for him.

367
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:13,656
I already have an idea of what to give.

368
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:15,777
Perfect!

369
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:19,656
I remember when Xiang Nan was born,

370
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:23,616
your uncle was very excited and told me,

371
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:27,577
when she grows up and gets married,

372
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,537
we would have to prepare her

373
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:33,696
a customized traditional cheongsam.

374
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:36,257
When Xiang Nan gets married later,

375
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,456
let's follow your uncle's wish

376
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:40,096
and have a cheongsam tailored for her.

377
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:41,896
Alright.

378
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:43,497
I'll look for it in Shanghai.

379
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:45,977
Sorry to make you tired.

380
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,656
You're so fake.

381
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:50,416
Xiang Qian,

382
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:53,365
your mum and I planned

383
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,566
on giving each of you kids

384
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,176
200,000 yuan

385
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:58,696
when you got married.

386
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,977
You didn't take your portion,

387
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:03,057
so we gave it to Xiang Zhong.

388
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:05,257
But now it's Xiang Nan's turn.

389
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:09,616
With our limited savings...

390
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,777
I get what you meant.

391
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:16,057
Leave it to me.

392
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,337
Don't worry about that.

393
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,456
I have already discussed it
with your mum.

394
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:29,096
Our old house is about to be demolished.

395
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:31,006
As for the compensation...

396
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,777
Why would I need that?

397
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:34,297
You keep it for yourselves.

398
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:37,456
Use it to take
your little princess on a trip.

399
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,297
Dad, you are really...

400
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:46,497
Xiang Nan is indeed
your precious sweetheart.

401
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,696
It's such a small matter,

402
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,376
but here you are
in this scorching hot day.

403
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:53,217
to talk to me about it.

404
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,057
Are you upset?

405
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:56,737
Seeing you here is a joy for me.

406
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,086
Alright.

407
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:01,616
Always assigning tasks
to your sweetheart, huh?

408
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,176
You're such a good kid.

409
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:04,896
I'm grateful to have you.

410
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:08,046
Since you're here,

411
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:09,896
let me tell you something about me.

412
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:10,856
Go ahead.

413
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:13,376
I'm not going to Shenzhen anymore.

414
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,257
I lost the competition with the others.

415
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:19,817
Anyway, I don't really want to go.

416
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:26,896
Dad knows you well enough.

417
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:30,403
You're not someone
who lose easily to others.

418
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:33,297
You do that because of your mum

419
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,297
and Gao Ping, right?

420
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,605
I really don't want to go,

421
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:40,057
to be so far from home.

422
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:41,966
I've never been that far away.

423
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,737
I'm afraid I wouldn't adapt well.

424
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,246
I've already promised
Xiang Nan and Xiang Zhong,

425
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:47,726
that we'll keep things as they are,

426
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,885
meeting every weekend
for a family reunion

427
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:51,896
to spend more time with you and mum.

428
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,656
The main thing is to spend
more time with your mum,

429
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:56,006
to avoid her from

430
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,656
- thinking about...
- Her hair loss.

431
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:00,486
That hair loss

432
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:02,165
has become her main worry.

433
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,726
If your mum knows
you're not going to Shenzhen anymore,

434
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:06,577
she must be very happy about it.

435
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:08,566
That's great!

436
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:09,817
I'm happy too.

437
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:10,737
Alright,

438
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,217
I'll head back then.

439
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:13,616
Hurry back to work.

440
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,376
You haven't treated me to lunch yet.

441
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:18,456
I'll treat you to something
even better next time.

442
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:19,977
You're interesting, huh!

443
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:22,257
Alright, I get to go.

444
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:23,526
Be careful.

445
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:24,726
Give me a call when you're home.

446
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:25,737
Don't worry.

447
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,577
Gao Ping!

448
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,700
Please wait for me for a while.
I'll come down to find you.

449
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,856
The faculty just issued a notice.

450
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:53,537
You're not shortlisted as the candidate
for the trial lecture this year.

451
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:01,057
I'm sorry, Gao Ping.

452
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:02,696
The faculty has a rule

453
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,616
that only PhD students
with their first degree

454
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:08,057
from a university
listed in Project 985 can stay.

455
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,817
Your undergraduate degree

456
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:12,176
doesn't quite meet the mark.

457
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,096
Prof. Yang,

458
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,096
is there...

459
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:21,165
Is there anything else I could try?

460
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,537
Could you help me think of a way,

461
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:25,566
or tell me what I could do for that?

462
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,737
I'll try anything.

463
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,337
I've done my best to help,

464
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:33,817
but it's the faculty's rule,

465
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:35,656
so there's nothing more I can do.

466
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,176
Don't be discouraged.

467
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,416
You have strong skills

468
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:43,376
and won't have trouble
finding a good place.

469
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:47,176
If you're interested
in the postdoctoral program,

470
00:28:47,206 --> 00:28:49,057
I could help you make connections there.

471
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:28,006
Have something sweet.

472
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:29,217
It might help lighten your mood.

473
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:47,376
Ms. Huang?

474
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:49,176
You're Cong's mother, right?

475
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:50,526
Your husband didn't come to pick

476
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,817
Cong and Qi today,

477
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:53,217
and we can't reach him.

478
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:55,456
This afternoon,
the teachers will have a study session,

479
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:58,297
which we informed all parents
about it in the group chat yesterday.

480
00:29:58,327 --> 00:29:59,125
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,656
I'll call him right now.

482
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,136
Mrs. Gao is calling you.
Could it be something important?

483
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:31,297
What could it be?
Probably just picking up the kids.

484
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:32,526
Hello,

485
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:35,656
the person you're calling
is currently unavailable.

486
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:40,165
Ms. Zhang,

487
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,337
could you please go
and pick up Qi and Cong?

488
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:44,685
Gao Ping has something going on

489
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,057
and couldn't make it in time.

490
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:47,176
Alright.

491
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:18,737
It's so absurd.

492
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,337
In everyone else's eyes,

493
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:36,136
I'm just a supporting role.

494
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,125
We may not be the ones

495
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:49,817
who make the rules,

496
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:51,966
but we're not here

497
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,977
just to make up the numbers either, right?

498
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:19,726
Why didn't you answer your phone

499
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:20,896
and pick up the kids?

500
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:22,817
I thought something happened to you.

501
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:33,080
The place for staying in the faculty
was given to Dayuan.

502
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,017
Why?

503
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:36,616
Prof. Yang said

504
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:39,656
the faculty found out I applied to Hong Kong
University's Faculty of Medicine.

505
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:41,896
So, they gave the quote
to Dayuan instead.

506
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:45,497
Didn't you explain things to Prof. Yang?

507
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:46,737
I did.

508
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:49,856
Maybe the faculty thinks
I'm not committed.

509
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:51,777
They might think even if I stayed,

510
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,017
I'd eventually apply abroad.

511
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,645
How is that possible?

512
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:58,577
Your faculty knows you're married
and have a family and kids.

513
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,605
How could they think
you'd take your whole family

514
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:02,497
overseas just like that?

515
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,537
Exactly.

516
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,696
That's what everyone knows.

517
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,577
Who knows what the faculty is thinking?

518
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:15,977
Where are you going?

519
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:19,696
I'm going to talk to Prof. Yang
that you intend to stay at the faculty

520
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:20,856
with no other plans.

521
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,376
That's useless. You don't have to go.

522
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:27,760
It'd be better for me to just focus
on graduating successfully.

523
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:30,577
You can't do that.

524
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:32,656
You went there with the goal
of staying at the faculty.

525
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,497
If there's even the slightest hope,

526
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,017
we have to try.

527
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,685
But there's no hope now.

528
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:39,845
Not even a little.

529
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:41,520
The official letter
has already been issued.

530
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,337
You've sacrificed so much for me,

531
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:52,656
and now you've lost your promotion,

532
00:33:54,606 --> 00:33:56,320
and I missed the chance
to stay at the faculty.

533
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,656
I don't even know what I can do next.

534
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:06,497
Let's go home and talk.

535
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:17,685
Madam, you're back.

536
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:18,416
Ms. He.

537
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:19,645
Here's your slippers.

538
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:21,896
Ms. He, you can just call me Xiang Nan.

539
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:22,856
Alright, madam.

540
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:25,016
Thank you.

541
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:27,976
Why did you come back so early?

542
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,685
Didn't your brother say
he was coming back for dinner tonight?

543
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:33,217
He asked me to come back early.

544
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:39,737
This afternoon, I met
with a fantastic wedding planner.

545
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:41,297
These are the details they left for us.

546
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:42,640
What is this for?

547
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,645
The wedding is going
to be held this month.

548
00:34:45,646 --> 00:34:47,617
so we have to prepare ahead of time.

549
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:48,737
Whose wedding?

550
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:50,657
Who else would it be?

551
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:52,456
Yours and my brother's.

552
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,777
How come I didn't know about this?

553
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,376
Hasn't he told you?

554
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,846
He consulted a fortune-teller
and chose this date,

555
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:03,217
which is said to be great for both of you.

556
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:04,645
He's coming home tonight

557
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,456
to discuss it with you maybe.

558
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:09,016
Ms. He,

559
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:11,137
what soup do we have today?

560
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:12,976
Stewed Pigeon with Hericium mushroom.

561
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:15,817
Didn't I mention before

562
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:18,217
that Xiang Nan doesn't
eat anything with wings?

563
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:21,086
I forgot to inform Ms. He.

564
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,416
Sorry.

565
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,137
It's alright.

566
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:25,657
It's just soup.

567
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:27,446
Jiang, you can have two servings.

568
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:28,297
You can have more.

569
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,016
Ms. He, you go make another soup
for Xiang Nan.

570
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:32,526
Alright.

571
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:33,846
It's okay. No need.

572
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:34,725
I'm fine without it.

573
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:35,496
Don't have to do that.

574
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:37,086
You can just tell Ms. He

575
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:38,376
what you want to eat.

576
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:42,536
Jiang,

577
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:43,846
I heard

578
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,657
we're having our wedding this month.

579
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,177
I haven't had a chance
to discuss it with Xiang Nan yet.

580
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:51,486
Why did you mention it?

581
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:52,406
I didn't know

582
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:53,976
you hadn't told her yet.

583
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,137
What's going on?

584
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:57,976
Xiang Nan,

585
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:00,856
how about we hold
the wedding this month?

586
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:03,016
I've already chosen the date.

587
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:04,737
I know it's a bit rushed,

588
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:08,097
but with several projects starting
in the company later this year,

589
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,496
I'm afraid I won't be able to juggle.
It might be better to do it sooner.

590
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,245
I think it's a bit too rushed.

591
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:16,125
Besides, even if I agree,

592
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:17,846
I'd need to discuss it with my parents.

593
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:19,737
It's a matter for both families.

594
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,817
We first need to know
if you're okay with the date.

595
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:23,496
Only then we can talk to them.

596
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:28,496
What's wrong?

597
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:29,936
Any problem?

598
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,685
What if I disagree?

599
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:33,177
What is the problem?

600
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:34,297
Stop it, Jiaqiao.

601
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:41,966
Jiang, this wedding
is between you and me.

602
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:45,526
You two set the date
and made arrangements,

603
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,097
only informing me afterwards.

604
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,376
I think that's inappropriate.

605
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:50,205
We put a lot of...

606
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:50,976
Enough.

607
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:53,297
Xiang Nan,

608
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:55,777
it's my mistake
for not handling this well.

609
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:57,297
I'll do better next time.

610
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:00,737
There won't be a next time.
I'm not planning on getting married twice.

611
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:02,016
In the future,

612
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,297
I promise

613
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:05,856
to discuss everything with you first, okay?

614
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,097
Well, let's eat.

615
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,765
Stop reading the newspaper.

616
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:31,297
Look at me.
Do I look okay in this outfit?

617
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:31,886
Alright.

618
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:33,006
How about with this bag?

619
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:34,205
You look good.

620
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:35,056
Mum.

621
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,337
That's nice.

622
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,046
Xiang Qian is here.

623
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:37,697
Mum.

624
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:38,245
Grandpa.

625
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:39,006
Look who's here!

626
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:39,605
Look who's here!

627
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:40,846
Thank you for all you do, Grandpa.

628
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:43,016
Thank you for all you do, Grandpa.

629
00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:44,936
When did you get so polite?

630
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,840
Recently, the kindergarten has been
teaching them to be filial to their parents.

631
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,777
You've worked so hard too, my darlings.

632
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:54,777
Gao Ping, how's the condition
with staying at the faculty?

633
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:56,896
It's... almost settled.

634
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:01,817
Dad, mum.

635
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:03,576
Xiang Zhong.

636
00:38:03,576 --> 00:38:05,000
Brother-in-law, it's been
some time since I saw you.

637
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,406
- Where's my mum?
- She's inside.

638
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:07,125
Here I am.

639
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:08,976
This outfit looks great on you!

640
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:09,846
Look at your mum.

641
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,217
Qi and Cong are here too!

642
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:12,137
You two...

643
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:13,805
Did you two greet Aunt?

644
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:14,576
Haiyang!

645
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:16,886
Why did you bring the things?

646
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:17,936
Why are you here?

647
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,006
What do you mean, why?

648
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,376
I invited Haiyang here.

649
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:23,337
If he is going, I won't go.

650
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:24,217
Xiang Zhong.

651
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:26,737
Today is an important day for Xiang Nan.

652
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:28,446
Our whole family has to be there,

653
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:29,456
no exceptions.

654
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:32,777
Xiang Zhong!

655
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,097
You see this person!

656
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,817
Come on, Haiyang.

657
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:37,905
Take a seat. Don't mind her.

658
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,856
Have your seat.

659
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:43,536
Xiang Zhong!

660
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,046
Our dad has already invited him.

661
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:47,685
You know

662
00:38:47,686 --> 00:38:48,936
his temper well.

663
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,217
Can't you sit through one meal together?

664
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,486
Just seeing him irritates me.

665
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:53,720
I don't want to go
for this lunch anymore.

666
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,040
I even have to pretend to be
a loving couple in front of others.

667
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,125
I can't keep up the act.

668
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,805
Otherwise, I'll be sitting there
looking unhappy,

669
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:01,016
and Jiang Hongbin misunderstood me
having a problem with him.

670
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,777
How can he be so oblivious?

671
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:07,456
If he isn't thick-skinned,

672
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:09,376
he wouldn't be Deng Haiyang.

673
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:16,257
The car is here. Don't mess around.

674
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:18,337
Xiang Nan even arranged a car for us.

675
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:20,337
The car has only seven seats, right?

676
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,840
You handle the seating, please.

677
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:27,657
Dad, mum, the car is here.

678
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,886
Sis, you sit with the kids
in the back row.

679
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:30,765
It'll be tight for you.

680
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:31,526
That's fine. Let's go.

681
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:33,125
Be careful. Get in the car.

682
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:35,496
Uncle, thank you for fetching us.

683
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:37,526
Such a smart kid!

684
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:38,725
My sister is even smarter.

685
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:40,337
She knows everything!

686
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:42,025
Can you two sit in the middle?
And let me sit...

687
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:42,886
You can sit here.

688
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:43,576
Alright.

689
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,016
One for each.

690
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:46,617
Get in.

691
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:49,697
Haiyang,

692
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,046
you should get on too!

693
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:52,086
- Come on.
- Wait.

694
00:39:52,087 --> 00:39:54,137
- I'll squeeze in with your mum.
- Deng Haiyang, get down!

695
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:56,285
- Dad asked me to get in.
- Get down. Why are you getting in?

696
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:57,406
Don't make him get down.

697
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:58,165
Don't squeeze.

698
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,325
I can sit with your mum.

699
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:01,600
The car is overloaded.
You two just sit properly. Don't worry.

700
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,366
Driver, everyone's here. Let's depart.

701
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,046
I'll drive myself there.
It's just convenient.

702
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:06,376
It's no problem at all. Look!

703
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:09,016
Let's depart.

704
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:11,416
Stay safe!

705
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:27,697
(Xiang Zhong: Don't come!)

706
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,486
Dad, mum.

707
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:44,056
Look!

708
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:45,526
Come on, dad.

709
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,406
Welcome, uncle.

710
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:47,297
Hi, nice to meet you.

711
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:48,406
Nice to meet you too.

712
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,765
Let me introduce you.

713
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:51,486
This is Hongbin's younger sister,

714
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:52,456
Jiang Jiaqiao.

715
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:53,496
Hi, uncle, aunt.

716
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:54,737
Hi.

717
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:55,886
Zhong, come over here.

718
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:56,960
This is my second sister.

719
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,217
Hello, I didn't meet you last time.

720
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,040
I've seen you several times
on the billboard.

721
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,685
Hi, aunt and uncle.

722
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:01,725
Aunt and uncle,

723
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,896
thank you for your hospitality.

724
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,046
You're so adorable, little ones.

725
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:06,896
Where is Brother-in-law?

726
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:09,205
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:09,206 --> 00:41:09,896
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,976
This is my husband, Gao Ping.

729
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,040
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, PhD in biology.

730
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:14,257
Welcome.

731
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:15,566
Big Sis, Big Brother-in-law.

732
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:16,446
Hello, Jiaqiao.

733
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:17,257
This is my sister.

734
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:18,685
Alright, let's head inside

735
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:19,725
and chat over some tea.

736
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:20,325
Come on.

737
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:21,657
Let's go in.

738
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:25,205
This is my brother's favorite

739
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:26,657
kind of English tea.

740
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:27,406
Please try it.

741
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:28,765
Let us know

742
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:29,920
if you'd like anything else.

743
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:30,926
Enjoy, everyone.

744
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:31,737
Dad, mum.

745
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:32,697
Don't worry.

746
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:33,926
We don't have many particulars

747
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:35,217
about drinking wine in our family.

748
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:37,337
It's tea.

749
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:38,257
It's tea.

750
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:40,976
You said wine.

751
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:45,496
This is the second sister, right?
Here's some tea for you.

752
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:54,856
Thank you.

753
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,737
My coffee.

754
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,016
Oh, right, Jiang,

755
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:05,016
we wonder how's the plan
for the wedding.

756
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:06,765
I've discussed it with Xiang Nan,

757
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:09,097
and we'd like to keep it low-key.

758
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,406
Xiang Nan doesn't like

759
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:11,777
anything too extravagant.

760
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:14,376
How low-key will it be?

761
00:42:14,527 --> 00:42:14,886
Mum,

762
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:16,725
I'd like it a simple one.

763
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:17,936
Nothing too complicated.

764
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,446
We're thinking of finding

765
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:20,976
a nice place in Suzhou,

766
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,846
inviting only close relatives and friends.

767
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:26,337
Not having too many people.
Just a small gathering.

768
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:27,725
Low-key is good.

769
00:42:27,726 --> 00:42:29,896
But, low-key

770
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:31,737
shouldn't mean plain.

771
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:34,125
Uncle, I don't understand

772
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:36,376
why you think low-key equates to plain.

773
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:40,496
Dad, don't worry.

774
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:41,685
With Boss Jiang here,

775
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:43,765
how could it possibly be plain?

776
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:45,817
He cares so much
about the prestige, right?

777
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:47,817
When are you planning to hold it?

778
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:49,456
In two weeks.

779
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:50,657
Yeah.

780
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:52,376
So soon?

781
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:54,896
