00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 11=

4
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:40,177
Weiwei, you're here.

5
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:41,566
Sorry

6
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,018
for making all of you wait.

7
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:46,206
Weiwei, this is...

8
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,617
Sorry for being late.

9
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:48,446
Not at all.

10
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,097
We were just looking around.

11
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:55,537
"A single man
in possession of good fortune

12
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,457
must be in want of a wife."

13
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,218
I didn't expect it to be you, though.

14
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:03,058
Jiang is no Mr. Darcy.

15
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:06,566
Pride and Prejudice

16
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,366
is Weiwei's

17
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,737
favorite novel.

18
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:10,817
I didn't know
you're familiar with it too.

19
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:11,807
Not at all.

20
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:13,097
I don't know the story at all.

21
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,967
I only remember

22
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,218
the first sentence.

23
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:17,697
Me too.

24
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:18,898
Jiaqiao.

25
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:21,498
Mrs. Jiang is so much
more interesting than you are.

26
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,218
I...

27
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:24,726
Excuse me

28
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,097
for not attending your wedding

29
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:28,178
because I was on
a trip with my children.

30
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,778
It was a classy wedding, though.

31
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:32,378
Thank you.

32
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:33,807
Let's begin.

33
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,058
Very well, this way, please.

34
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,087
I love this.

35
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,417
It suits you.

36
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:15,738
Weiwei.

37
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,367
We will be exhibiting

38
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:19,378
this series for the first time globally.

39
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,367
Our first stop is Shanghai.

40
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,058
Yes.

41
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:24,297
It's inspired by ancient folklore

42
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:26,087
of a mysterious goddess

43
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:27,886
from the forest

44
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,857
clothed in ivy braids.

45
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:32,046
She held a precious jewel,

46
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,647
and when she threw it up to the sky,

47
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,817
it broke down into millions of stars.

48
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:36,967
This luminous gem

49
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,058
is our signature piece this time.

50
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:41,647
What is it?

51
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:42,647
You knew I've always wanted

52
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:43,687
to add

53
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:46,006
a good imperial green
jade necklace to my collection

54
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,817
to pair with my ring.

55
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,726
What do you think?

56
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:51,097
This is a splendid necklace.

57
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,338
It suits you well.

58
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:54,286
Does it make me

59
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:55,817
look older?

60
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,537
Of course not, Weiwei.

61
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,537
You're worrying for nothing.

62
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:00,606
Then, do you think

63
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,738
I should get this set?

64
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:02,898
It looks wonderful.

65
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:03,967
Manager,

66
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,127
can you let Weiwei here

67
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:05,687
try them on?

68
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:06,857
Of course.

69
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,417
Let me help you.

70
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:19,977
Mrs. Jiang.

71
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,538
Let me put this on you.

72
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:24,017
Try it on.

73
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:26,777
It's beautiful.

74
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:29,897
You look nice.

75
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,406
My brother has talked to the bank.

76
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:33,697
About what?

77
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:34,966
Buy whatever you want.

78
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,257
There's no credit limit.

79
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,418
It suits you well.

80
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,687
Everyone thinks that imperial green

81
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:41,807
is the most expensive kind of jade,

82
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:42,646
but imperial purple jade

83
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:43,966
is actually the rarest.

84
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:44,886
Furthermore, purple

85
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:46,378
is truly a royal color.

86
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:48,337
Why don't you buy this, Weiwei?

87
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,058
This is the one and only set
there is in this world.

88
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:53,098
Buy it.

89
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,098
Buy it.

90
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,137
How much for this?

91
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:09,607
This necklace is priced at

92
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:10,697
1.2 million.

93
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,657
1.2 million...

94
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:13,697
Renminbi?

95
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:14,697
No.

96
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,418
It's 1.2 million US dollars.

97
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,697
Shut up.

98
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,178
Okay, I'll keep quiet.

99
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:26,646
Miss, you're back.

100
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:27,446
Where's my brother?

101
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,498
He's resting upstairs.

102
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,607
Miss, are you hungry?

103
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,847
Let me heat up some food for you.

104
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:32,657
No, I'm too angry to eat.

105
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:33,646
Ma'am, you're back too.

106
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:34,886
What a petty

107
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:36,378
and ignorant woman.

108
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:38,178
Jiang Jiaqiao, stand right there.

109
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:40,766
Make yourself clear.

110
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,287
Do you think our family is that poor?

111
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,766
Must you ask about the price

112
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,127
right there and then?

113
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,247
It's normal to inquire prices

114
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:47,406
when you're shopping.

115
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:48,927
You haven't been listening

116
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,738
to everything I've said.

117
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,978
Who do you think Weiwei is?

118
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,607
Take a look at
any international luxury store

119
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,047
and their VIP list.

120
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,766
Try finding one without her name on it.

121
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:58,938
What's it got to do with me?

122
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,098
You...

123
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:00,886
Wait,

124
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,367
I thought you're supposed to be smart.

125
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:04,086
You don't understand?

126
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,526
Weiwei looks down on people

127
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,287
who cares about the price

128
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,566
when they go shopping,

129
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,326
understand?

130
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,897
Do we really need
to put on a facade like that?

131
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:13,566
My dear brother,

132
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,777
what kind of wife have you gotten?

133
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,457
You're back.

134
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:33,577
What is it?

135
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,017
You're upset?

136
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,577
Jiang,

137
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,858
Is it true that special people like you

138
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:40,727
never look at the price

139
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,098
when you go shopping?

140
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:44,978
What do you mean by special?

141
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:47,298
Are you really that rich?

142
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:50,298
What are you trying to say?

143
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:53,538
You people wouldn't even bat an eye

144
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,098
when you spend
a million to buy some jewelry.

145
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:58,178
A million?

146
00:06:58,647 --> 00:06:59,807
That is a little pricey.

147
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:01,257
A little?

148
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,406
It's a million,

149
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,938
not a hundred.

150
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,178
I'm talking millions,

151
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:07,938
and in US dollars.

152
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:09,817
That's what you don't understand.

153
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,337
We call this an entrance ticket.

154
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,337
What do you mean?

155
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,378
A million dollars

156
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,526
is also

157
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,098
a large sum of money to me.

158
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:27,047
But, if you're hanging out

159
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,378
with Xu Weiwei,

160
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,697
you should have bought it.

161
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,498
If you don't,

162
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,697
she'd assume that you can't afford it,

163
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,017
which also implies

164
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:37,858
that I can't afford it too.

165
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:40,167
I'm in the middle

166
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,897
of an investment deal with her husband.

167
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,418
Now, if I can't afford it,
what else would it imply?

168
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:45,777
It means I don't have
the financial capability.

169
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:47,257
That's what

170
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,418
the entrance ticket means.

171
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:51,966
I don't understand.

172
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,217
That just sounds like
a ridiculously expensive ticket.

173
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:55,047
Right now,

174
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,897
you're not just representing yourself,

175
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:58,697
but also me.

176
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:01,098
Mrs. Jiang,

177
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,657
you need to take part

178
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,418
in this performance as well.

179
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,058
Come on, don't be angry.

180
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,137
Xu Weiwei's
birthday party is in two days.

181
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,086
You should bring

182
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:12,697
something valuable as a ticket.

183
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,498
But, Jiang.

184
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,287
Wearing such an

185
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,577
expensive necklace

186
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,367
would really stress me out.

187
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,127
Just its weight alone
is enough to petrify me.

188
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:22,006
My neck would be

189
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,337
frozen in place.

190
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:25,807
Thank you for your hard work,

191
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:26,538
Mrs. Jiang.

192
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:27,487
Here,

193
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,017
I'm at your service.

194
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,406
But, I really don't like

195
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:34,897
going to such events.

196
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:36,217
I know, I know.

197
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:38,338
Please do it for me.

198
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:46,487
Push harder, here.

199
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:47,218
Okay.

200
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,006
Well, are you happy with my service?

201
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,057
I guess it's okay.

202
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,730
(Daming Smart Home)

203
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,046
(Mom: When are you coming home?)

204
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:09,806
(You weren't back last week,)

205
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,257
(and your dad is upset.)

206
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:12,937
(Remember to talk to him.)

207
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,286
(Xiang Qian:
We didn't go home last week,)

208
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,537
(and the old guy is mad.)

209
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,218
(We have to go home this weekend.)

210
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:25,978
(Xiang Nan: Forced socialization.)

211
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,057
(How exhausting.)

212
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,567
(Xiang Qian: Saturday or Sunday?)

213
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:34,487
(You guys choose first.)

214
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:35,698
(No skipping this time.)

215
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:46,338
Here.

216
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:47,378
Try this.

217
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,137
You girls are always so busy.

218
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:51,886
I'm so excited

219
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:52,567
to see you home.

220
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:53,378
Thank you, Dad.

221
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,926
I simply whipped up some quick dishes.

222
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,607
"Simply"?

223
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:57,367
I thought

224
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,006
a Michelin-starred chef came over

225
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:00,087
to cook for us.

226
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,367
Your cooking has really

227
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,207
improved a lot.

228
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,498
It's delicious.

229
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,646
The ribs are fantastic.

230
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,886
You knew we're on a diet,

231
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:08,458
and that sugar is just on spot.

232
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:10,006
You must have been

233
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:11,098
really famished

234
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:13,297
out there, haven't you?

235
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:14,967
They're just flattering you.

236
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:16,937
Are you really taking it seriously?

237
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,406
Your mother can be a wet blanket.

238
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:19,297
Yes, you.

239
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:20,487
It does taste good.

240
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,766
It does.

241
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,498
Dad,

242
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:24,578
even when there's no one visiting,

243
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,327
you can serve your signature dishes

244
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:27,858
like wine chicken,

245
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,286
drunken prawns, and drunken crabs,

246
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:30,567
can't you?

247
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:31,458
Agreed.

248
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,257
Of course.

249
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:34,526
If you'd come back home,

250
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:35,618
I'll cook them every day.

251
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:37,447
I don't see them today, though.

252
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:38,406
I can't see them.

253
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:38,686
I can't see them.

254
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:39,526
I haven't had any.

255
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:40,006
Where are they?

256
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,177
The crabs are not drunk yet.

257
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:43,657
They're still drinking.

258
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:48,207
Dad, listen.

259
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,978
Don't hang out with Gu too often

260
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:50,967
and blabber too much.

261
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,286
He loves collecting gossip

262
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,046
and spreading them everywhere.

263
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:54,646
Yeah.

264
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,487
Mom is good at knitting.

265
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,367
You should learn how to knit from her.

266
00:10:58,368 --> 00:10:59,526
You want me to learn how to knit?

267
00:10:59,527 --> 00:10:59,847
Yeah.

268
00:10:59,848 --> 00:11:00,806
That's what Xiang Zhong said, too.

269
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,897
He said knitting can prevent dementia.

270
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,978
He also said that

271
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,567
it can prevent

272
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:08,417
some disease called

273
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,458
"meddling around
other people's business".

274
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,127
That's an important benefit.

275
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:13,417
Who's meddling around?

276
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,257
Listen,

277
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:17,698
just come home often, will you?

278
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,526
When we get to see you,

279
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:21,137
we'd stay happy every day,

280
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,297
and we'd be free of dementia.

281
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:24,458
Understood?

282
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,338
My mother wouldn't get dementia.

283
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:27,686
You don't have to worry, Mom.

284
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,858
Only me, then?

285
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:30,177
That's hard to say.

286
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:31,858
If you keep hanging out with Gu,

287
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:33,057
that'd be a bad idea.

288
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:34,286
You'd be limiting
your mind to trivial matters.

289
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:35,607
Wait, whose phone is that?

290
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,618
Mine.

291
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,498
Whoever leaves first
has to wash the plates.

292
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,338
That's a marvelous suggestion.

293
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:42,406
I caught her red-handed, didn't I?

294
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:43,537
Good job.

295
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:44,937
Hello?

296
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:45,777
Hello.

297
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:47,338
I'm from the Criminal Department.

298
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:48,537
My name is Jia Zhiqiang.

299
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,006
Are you hiring a nanny

300
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:50,978
called Zhang Hui?

301
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,218
Yes.

302
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,458
Is she with you now?

303
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:55,458
No.

304
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:57,017
Are your kids with you now?

305
00:11:57,807 --> 00:11:58,937
No.

306
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,098
We're currently investigating a suspect,

307
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:02,578
and your nanny might be involved.

308
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:03,327
We suspect

309
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:04,567
that she may be related

310
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:06,177
to a human trafficking case.

311
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:07,686
If you have any clues,

312
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,098
please contact us immediately.

313
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:09,978
Okay.

314
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,417
Okay, goodbye.

315
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:41,487
Eat more of this.

316
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:42,417
Eat more.

317
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,447
This is delicious.

318
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:45,578
Mom, try some.

319
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,378
The sweet and sour ribs are fantastic.

320
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:52,526
Gao Ping,

321
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:53,937
are you with Ms. Zhang now?

322
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:55,406
Are you

323
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,327
bringing the kids

324
00:12:56,328 --> 00:12:57,006
to the trial class?

325
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:57,967
Why aren't you picking up?

326
00:12:57,968 --> 00:12:59,218
She's not picking up either.

327
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:03,967
That's a long phone call.

328
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,327
So, I'm not eating anymore.

329
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,417
I have to go.

330
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:07,087
What happened?

331
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,327
The nanny has something on.

332
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,257
I need to look after the kids.

333
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:10,378
Take some food with you.

334
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,498
Gao Ping is with the kids, right?

335
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:13,286
She just left in a huff.

336
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,498
No one's doing the dishes.

337
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:15,686
No one's doing the dishes.

338
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:16,657
What's going on?

339
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,406
(Xiang Qian: Gao Ping, where are you?)

340
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,218
(Are you with the kids?)

341
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:30,367
(Shouldn't you be bringing them)

342
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:31,327
(to the trial class?)

343
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:31,926
(Why is your car)

344
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,378
(still parked downstairs?)

345
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,937
(Xiang Qian: Boss, I need a favor.)

346
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,570
(Police Station)

347
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:47,537
Here's what happened.

348
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:48,607
We've checked through

349
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,218
your apartment's surveillance footage.

350
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:51,847
We have confirmed that
Zhang Hui has left your house

351
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:52,818
with the kids.

352
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,818
Right now, we are unable to contact her.

353
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,046
Wait, didn't you tell me

354
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,327
that Gao Ping is bringing the kids

355
00:13:58,328 --> 00:13:59,498
to the trial class?

356
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,166
Yes,

357
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,378
that should be the case,

358
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,137
but I can't reach him now.

359
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,338
Did you see Gao Ping in the footage?

360
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:06,537
No.

361
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,458
While you were on your way here,

362
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:09,967
our colleagues have also visited

363
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,417
the learning center,

364
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:12,897
but the kids aren't there.

365
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:15,777
Wait, sir.

366
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,967
What's exactly going on now?

367
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:19,087
This nanny has been

368
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,006
working for them

369
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:20,886
for quite some time,

370
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:21,526
and they hired her

371
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,017
through a housekeeping agency.

372
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,646
How is she related

373
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:25,657
to human trafficking?

374
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:26,806
Regarding the details,

375
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,257
it's related to another case,

376
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:29,937
and we can't divulge too much.

377
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:31,378
To put it simply,

378
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:32,578
we are

379
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:33,766
investigating

380
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,526
a human trafficking case
from over 10 years ago.

381
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:36,818
The suspect has been arrested,

382
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:37,967
and Zhang Hui

383
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,057
may also be involved.

384
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:42,207
She and the suspect used to be

385
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,897
close friends coming from the same town.

386
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,526
We contacted you

387
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:46,247
because we wanted

388
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:48,177
to contact Zhang Hui
for further investigation.

389
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,646
Is it possible that Gao Ping

390
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,487
may have been

391
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:53,818
kidnapped by those guys too?

392
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:55,578
What do you mean?

393
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,607
So, is Zhang Hui really involved

394
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:00,177
in human trafficking?

395
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:02,777
Since we have no evidence now,

396
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,057
we can't say for certain.

397
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,098
However,

398
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:06,526
we cannot deny

399
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:07,698
the possibility.

400
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:10,006
We are still checking

401
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,087
the surveillance footage nearby

402
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,766
with our facial recognition system.

403
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,657
We hope to obtain results soon.

404
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:16,806
As for you,

405
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:17,926
don't worry too much.

406
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:19,006
Why don't you stay here a while

407
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:19,727
while we

408
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:20,818
continue our search?

409
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:21,698
Sure.

410
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:22,897
Thank you very much.

411
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:38,498
Well?

412
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,006
We have detected a face match.

413
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,607
She's found in a mall near Hongqiao.

414
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,738
We're going there now.

415
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:43,646
Okay, let's go.

416
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:43,967
Let's follow them.

417
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:44,537
Okay.

418
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:45,967
This is official police business.

419
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:47,738
It's not appropriate for you to join.

420
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:48,926
I'm the kids' mother.

421
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,257
Why can't I go?

422
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:51,177
I'm sorry.

423
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:53,137
Please understand.

424
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:55,657
Are the kids alright?

425
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:56,806
We're not sure

426
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:57,886
of the details yet.

427
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,378
We need to go there to confirm.

428
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,498
Wait, sir.

429
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,618
If you need to talk to the kids,

430
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,417
talk to the sister.

431
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,498
Her brother can be timid.

432
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:09,738
Alright, rest assured.

433
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:11,618
Thank you.

434
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:16,698
Everything's okay.

435
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:18,098
It'll be fine.

436
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,618
Relax.

437
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,537
He said

438
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,098
they'll be back soon.

439
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:30,417
Here you go.

440
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,047
Cong, Qi!

441
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:36,697
Mom!

442
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,338
- Mom!
- My baby!

443
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,018
Mom!

444
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:42,807
We sat in a police car today.

445
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:44,886
The policeman drove us here.

446
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:45,527
Mom,

447
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:47,166
we lost our way today,

448
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,886
but we got to eat some cream puffs.

449
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,417
That sounds delightful.

450
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:54,018
Didn't Daddy
take you to the trial class?

451
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:06,007
Thank you, sir.

452
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:06,778
Not at all.

453
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:08,166
Zhang Hui lost her way

454
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,298
while bringing the kids to class.

455
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:11,527
Then, the kids were craving

456
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:12,737
for some cream puffs,

457
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:13,406
so she

458
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,258
brought the kids

459
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:16,527
to a mall around Hongqiao

460
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,417
to buy some.

461
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:18,886
As for whether

462
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:21,166
she intended to escape
through the train station,

463
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,646
we're still not sure yet,

464
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,298
and we'll have to investigate.

465
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:25,646
I understand.

466
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,098
I guess that's just a false alarm.

467
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:28,858
Sorry for bothering you.

468
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:29,607
We're just doing our job.

469
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,578
Thank you.

470
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,726
Let me untie it for you.

471
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:38,818
There you go.

472
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:40,298
Cong, Qi.

473
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,047
Daddy!

474
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:44,137
I'm so sorry.

475
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,697
I'm so sorry.

476
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,847
I'm so sorry, it's all my fault.

477
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:49,127
It's all my fault.

478
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,327
I shouldn't have left you

479
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:51,246
alone in the house.

480
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:52,217
I'd never do that again.

481
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:53,246
I'd never do that again.

482
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:54,206
I'd never do that again.

483
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,578
I'm so sorry.

484
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,018
I'm so sorry.

485
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:58,657
It's getting late.

486
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,258
I should go back now.

487
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:01,378
Thank you so much.

488
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:03,098
It's okay.

489
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:04,538
Get some rest.

490
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:05,778
I'll give you two days off.

491
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,217
You little rascals.

492
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:11,697
I'm off.

493
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:12,966
Bye.

494
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:13,886
Bye, Godfather.

495
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:14,567
Bye, Godfather.

496
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:14,807
Bye.

497
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:15,847
Come back in now.

498
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:16,646
Time to wash up and bath.

499
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,018
I'll take you to the bathroom.

500
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:19,047
Come on.

501
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:19,897
Back inside.

502
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:25,538
Here.

503
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:31,258
"Let me wash some pears for you,"

504
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:33,137
said Mom.

505
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,098
She then picked up
Kong Rong's brother and headed inside.

506
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,607
Mom put the washed pears

507
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,378
on a plate

508
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:44,457
for the children.

509
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,937
The elder brothers were courteous

510
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:50,217
and let Kong Rong and
their youngest brother pick first.

511
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:52,737
They're asleep?

512
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:58,217
I'm keeping the kids company tonight.

513
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:00,737
Sure.

514
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:02,098
Good night.

515
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:47,599
(L: Are you asleep?)

516
00:20:47,600 --> 00:21:04,679
(Gao Ping: About to.)

517
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,919
(L: I had fun today, thank you.)

518
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:24,639
(Gao Ping: Me too.)

519
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,570
(L: Good night.)

520
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,298
The kids are asleep?

521
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:43,058
Where did you go this afternoon?

522
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,246
Prof. Yang arranged me

523
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:48,527
to have lunch with Prof. Lu

524
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:50,098
from the postdoctorate program.

525
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:51,847
Prof. Lu wanted to have a few drinks,

526
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,818
so I joined them

527
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:55,098
and got drunk.

528
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,497
This isn't the first time.

529
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:00,578
Why is it so difficult

530
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:02,778
for me to reach you recently?

531
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:05,497
I didn't want this,

532
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,406
but I need Prof. Lu's help

533
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,018
to enter the postdoctorate program.

534
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:11,177
I can't say no to him.

535
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,497
But I...

536
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:14,578
You know I can't drink much.

537
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:17,578
Shouldn't you have

538
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:19,018
told me in advance

539
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:20,457
and called me

540
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:21,807
to say that you're going out

541
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,177
for lunch and drinking?

542
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,858
I wasn't even busy today.

543
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:26,417
How could you

544
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,686
throw the kids to Ms. Zhang

545
00:22:28,687 --> 00:22:29,977
and let her bring them out?

546
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:31,807
I wanted to tell you,

547
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,807
but it's been so long

548
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:33,886
since you went back to Kunshan.

549
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:34,847
If I called you to come back,

550
00:22:34,848 --> 00:22:36,538
your dad would be unhappy.

551
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:37,338
Plus,

552
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,446
this isn't the first time

553
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:40,166
we let Ms. Zhang

554
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:41,646
babysit the kids.

555
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:42,287
I didn't expect

556
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:43,538
something so serious.

557
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:45,258
This is different.

558
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:51,538
I'm sorry.

559
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:00,298
Is she directly involved
in human trafficking?

560
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:01,618
I don't know.

561
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:04,217
The police are still investigating.

562
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:07,018
They'll inform me
as soon as they're done.

563
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:11,538
Xiang Qian.

564
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,206
The children may not

565
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:16,778
be related to me by blood,

566
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:20,618
but I watched them grow up.

567
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:24,327
This incident

568
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:26,538
upsets me as well.

569
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:30,737
I'm sorry.

570
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:33,858
It's my fault.

571
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,087
This wouldn't have happened

572
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:37,338
if I didn't go out.

573
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:40,538
Sorry.

574
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:58,697
What are you...

575
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,417
What are you doing?

576
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:08,818
You're not sleeping?

577
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:11,217
You...

578
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:13,686
Say, why do you think Xiang Qian

579
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,378
left in a rush today?

580
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:18,177
I'll call her and ask.

581
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:20,137
She said everything's fine now.

582
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:23,058
You can visit her in Shanghai tomorrow.

583
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,618
Turn the lights off.

584
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:43,298
I'm just so worried about her.

585
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,807
This tastes awful.

586
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:03,618
What's wrong?

587
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:09,686
I thought I added soy sauce.

588
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:11,007
It's okay, leave it here.

589
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:11,847
I'll cook another one.

590
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:12,926
Forget it, we don't have time.

591
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:13,818
Let's eat something else.

592
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:15,417
Porridge will be ready soon.

593
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:18,578
Oh my.

594
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:25,287
Qi "spelled" her milk.

595
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:26,258
Let me help you.

596
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:28,977
My...

597
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:30,047
Mom,

598
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:32,937
I "spelled" my milk too.

599
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:34,378
Both of you...

600
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:37,047
It's not "spelled".

601
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:37,886
It's "spilled".

602
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:38,646
I'll get the door.

603
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,137
"Spelled".

604
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:41,166
"Spilled".

605
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,926
"Spill"...

606
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:44,417
Mom, what brings you here?

607
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,897
Don't even mention it.

608
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,807
"Spelled".

609
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:48,646
"Spelled".

610
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,246
Eat your breakfast.

611
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,246
"Spelled".

612
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:51,098
What are they doing?

613
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:51,886
Quiet.

614
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:52,618
The usual antics.

615
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:55,527
Mom,

616
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:56,858
what brings you here so early?

617
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:57,567
Don't even mention it.

618
00:25:57,568 --> 00:25:58,646
I was supposed to meet

619
00:25:58,647 --> 00:25:59,926
my friends for shopping,

620
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,406
but I misread the time

621
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:03,127
and left home an hour early.

622
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,457
What's going on here?

623
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:06,338
Where's Zhang?

624
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:08,217
She quit.

625
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,338
She had to go home, so she quit.

626
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,298
That sounds troublesome.

627
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:14,807
Let me call my friends

628
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:15,446
to tell them I'm not joining.

629
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:16,367
I'll stay here and help.

630
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,206
No.

631
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:18,446
Just go.

632
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:19,686
Tell them you'll join later.

633
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:20,367
Help me send the kids

634
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:20,767
to school.

635
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:22,137
But you don't have a nanny now.

636
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:24,127
We'll find another one soon.

637
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,417
We'll find an agency.

638
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:28,206
You don't need me here?

639
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:28,567
No.

640
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:29,726
Just take them to school

641
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:30,246
after this.

642
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:31,206
I'm taking them to school,

643
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:31,646
right?

644
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:33,166
Okay, pack everything they need

645
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,737
in school later.

646
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:35,977
Their bags.

647
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:37,897
Eat up.

648
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:40,338
Bai, eat up.

649
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:41,966
What's wrong?

650
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,486
I haven't seen you for days.

651
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:44,897
Are you feeling unwell?

652
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,098
You seem tired.

653
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,298
You don't feel like eating?

654
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,018
You should eat something.

655
00:26:58,808 --> 00:26:59,657
Bai.

656
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:08,098
It's here to say goodbye.

657
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:13,137
I came here a few days ago to feed it,

658
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,417
and I didn't see it.

659
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:16,737
Why did you say so?

660
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:20,166
Cats can usually sense it

661
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:21,417
when they're about to die.

662
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:23,417
It knew its days are almost over,

663
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,258
so it came back to see you one last time

664
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:26,686
before finding

665
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,018
a quiet spot to leave.

666
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,338
Don't be too sad.

667
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:33,977
You were so nice to it.

668
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:35,697
It will remember you.

669
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:45,246
Next time, you can use my bowl

670
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,578
to feed the cats.

671
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:48,737
It's more convenient and less wasteful.

672
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:52,018
This is my home.

673
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:53,246
You live here?

674
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,657
Yes, this is my backyard.

675
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:56,417
What a coincidence.

676
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:57,327
I'm staying on the second floor

677
00:27:57,328 --> 00:27:58,618
right across the street.

678
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:01,897
That is a coincidence.

679
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,258
I'm going home, then.

680
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:05,047
Bye.

681
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:05,737
Bye.

682
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:18,977
Okay, thank you.

683
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,177
Goodbye.

684
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,538
What did the police say?

685
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,847
When the police

686
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:33,137
found them yesterday,

687
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:34,406
the kids did ask her

688
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:36,007
to buy some cream puffs,

689
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:37,778
and Zhang Hui bought some for them

690
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,567
before heading to

691
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:40,206
the learning center,

692
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,778
but they lost their way.

693
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:43,137
However,

694
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:45,697
the police has also found out

695
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,007
that Zhang Hui's husband

696
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:48,538
has racked up a lot of debts.

697
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:50,937
Was she intending to steal our kids?

698
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:53,406
We don't know for sure.

699
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:54,858
Of course she wouldn't admit it.

700
00:28:56,887 --> 00:28:57,646
We simply cannot

701
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:58,937
hire her anymore.

702
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,697
Yes, we can't.

703
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:07,137
What is this?

704
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,417
So, are you going to tell your parents?

705
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:12,807
It was

706
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,018
a false alarm,

707
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:15,897
so let's not tell them.

708
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:19,767
Wait.

709
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,937
You can't keep it a secret forever.

710
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,486
Your mom just came over and saw

711
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:25,657
how messy things were.

712
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:27,646
What if

713
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:28,977
the kids blurt it out

714
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:31,298
before the new nanny arrives?

715
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,258
How do we even look for a new nanny now?

716
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,007
Every nanny I see

717
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:39,818
looks like a human trafficker now.

718
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:52,538
My youngest aunt

719
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,246
called me lately

720
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:56,417
and said she's got a lot of free time.

721
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:58,166
If we need any help,

722
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,087
she could come over

723
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,457
and help out.

724
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:04,367
My aunt is part

725
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:05,807
of our family, right?

726
00:30:05,808 --> 00:30:08,217
It's better than
getting someone outside.

727
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:09,697
Of course.

728
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:11,618
But

729
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:13,697
she's your aunt.

730
00:30:13,927 --> 00:30:15,977
Do you think it's appropriate for her

731
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:17,778
to be our nanny?

732
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,166
When I asked her, she said

733
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,417
she's fine with it,

734
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:24,737
and it depends on you.

735
00:30:27,768 --> 00:30:28,657
What do you think?

736
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,457
I...

737
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,977
I don't really have any thoughts.

738
00:30:43,247 --> 00:30:44,897
I won't insist on it, either.

739
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:47,778
You call the shots.

740
00:30:58,247 --> 00:30:59,497
Let me think about it.

741
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:02,618
Go ahead.

742
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,726
Is this dead cat supposed
to be in the garbage dump?

743
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:22,047
I guess it's not considered

744
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,246
kitchen waste,

745
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:24,657
but it's not recyclable either.

746
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:26,457
Put it in the others section, then.

747
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:27,567
What if it rots?

748
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:28,618
It'd stink.

749
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:29,697
Or hazardous waste?

750
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,527
What should we do?

751
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:32,497
I'll handle it.

752
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,098
Thank you, young man.

753
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:36,137
Let's go.

754
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,298
Poor cat.

755
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:42,378
How are you going to handle it?

756
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,177
I'll take it to a pet cremation center.

757
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,177
It came to say goodbye to us,

758
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,858
so we should repay it with kindness.

759
00:31:51,128 --> 00:31:52,858
Sure, I'll search online.

760
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:54,926
I guess most taxis won't be happy

761
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:56,567
carrying a dead cat in their car.

762
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,217
Yeah.

763
00:31:58,568 --> 00:31:59,578
Do you have a car?

764
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,497
Yes, but I'm not a good driver.

765
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,098
I'll drive.

766
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:11,977
Just continue straight.

767
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:17,087
I haven't seen you

768
00:32:17,088 --> 00:32:18,457
around the neighborhood before.

769
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:22,778
I'm just house-sitting for my cousin

770
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:26,098
while taking care of his cats.

771
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,378
How many cats does he have?

772
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:29,977
Three.

773
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:42,378
Why?

774
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:44,618
Sorry,

775
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,618
but the air here kind of stinks.

776
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:53,047
I should be the one apologizing.

777
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:54,446
This is my ex-husband's car.

778
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:55,646
He's not very particular

779
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:56,367
about hygiene.

780
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,646
That's why it's so dirty and messy.

781
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:58,937
I rarely use this car, too.

782
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,338
I'm a bit of a clean freak.

783
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:04,298
Sorry about that.

784
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:26,486
I guess you'll have to make do

785
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:27,897
with this tissue here.

786
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:29,897
Thank you.

787
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:42,457
You're divorced?

788
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,618
Still in the cooling off period.

789
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:50,818
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

790
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,457
I'm Wang Yuxi.

791
00:33:57,887 --> 00:33:58,977
I'm Xiang Zhong.

792
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:51,258
Let's go.

793
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,457
Have you ever had any pets?

794
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:01,577
No.

795
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:03,778
When I was a kid,

796
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,258
I used to have a miniature pinscher,

797
00:35:06,528 --> 00:35:08,338
but it was born with heart disease,

798
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,457
and it succumbed to a heart attack.

799
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:12,858
Then,

800
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,206
I kept a cat in Shanghai

801
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:16,487
with my girlfriend.

802
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:18,298
We took care of it together.

803
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:20,286
After we broke up,

804
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,738
she left me the cat.

805
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:27,378
The cat later caught an infection

806
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,537
and died.

807
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,218
I guess

808
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:37,097
you're not suited to keep pets.

809
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:42,658
Was your cat

810
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:44,806
buried here

811
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:46,698
like the cat earlier?

812
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,206
I brought its ashes with me

813
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:51,378
and traveled around.

814
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:53,897
We visited many places

815
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:56,457
and stopped in Hainan in the end.

816
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,017
Why Hainan?

817
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:10,338
My ex.

818
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:15,527
Last month,
she went back to the Northeast

819
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:16,698
and got married.

820
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,017
Are you from the Northeast, too?

821
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:21,897
I'm from Changchun.

822
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:23,778
I went to college in Changchun.

823
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:25,537
What a coincidence.

824
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:27,326
Still,

825
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:29,138
I'd always wanted to leave that place.

826
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,178
It's too cold in winter.

827
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:35,617
I've always wanted to leave here.

828
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:43,698
But in the end,

829
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:45,097

When I left this morning,

the humidity level

865
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:24,246
was already at 80%,

866
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:25,778
with heavy storm clouds.

I'm not.

Actually, I love rain.

871
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:39,057
Especially during spring.

872
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:41,087
It rains slow and steady,

873
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,457
and I find that relaxing.

874
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,658
Sometimes, when I can't sleep,

875
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,206
I'd go online and play

876
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:49,617
some rain sound effects,

877
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,617
and I'd calm down quickly.

No matter how stable I look,

884
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:09,338

00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,097
No problem.
