=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,080
=Episode 3=

4
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,739
- Xiang.
- Hey, Xiang.

5
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,400
- Xiang.
- Hey, Xiang.

6
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:42,578
Please accept this.

7
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:44,000
What are you doing?

8
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,018
What is this about?

9
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:45,719
Xiang.

10
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,498
What's going on?

11
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,159
Stay here. I'll check it out.

12
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,200
What is this about?

13
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,640
A letter of apologies.

14
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,120
Sorry.

15
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:57,938
All of us

16
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,159
were too rash.

17
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,858
We came

18
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,200
to apologize in person.

19
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,539
We will not come here

20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,938
and cause further trouble.

21
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:04,938
We will not spread rumors

22
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,899
to slander you.

23
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,200
We were wrong.

24
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,179
Sorry.

25
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,480
What...

26
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:10,959
Xiang, we were wrong.

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,200
I was...

28
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:12,858
Forget it.

29
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:14,179
We were too rash.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,739
Sorry.

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,258
Sorry. We didn't mean it.

32
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,378
- All right.
- We are sorry.

33
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,218
Forget it.

34
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:18,698
Forget it.

35
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:19,818
Take the gifts back.

36
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:20,579
We must get going.

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,299
Keep it.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,059
It's meant for you.

39
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,160
Don't leave it here!

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,778
What now?

41
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:30,399
They already came here to apologize?

42
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,720
That didn't take long.

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,679
You knew this'd happen?
What is this about?

44
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,859
I guess Jiang Hongbin

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,419
sent them the legal notice.

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,658
If they hadn't apologized,

47
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,579
we would've sued

48
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,600
all of them.

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,218
What?

50
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,440
How does Jiang Hongbin know about this?

51
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,899
Xiang Nan, they are our neighbors.

52
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,258
That was uncalled for.

53
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,019
Unbelievable.

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,299
Neighbors?

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,378
When they caused us trouble,

56
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,459
why didn't they see us
as their neighbors?

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,519
Yeah.

58
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,778
Mum and Dad,

59
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:59,538
we should use the law
to protect ourselves.

60
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:01,119
We can't let them pick on us.

61
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,579
Didn't I tell you

62
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,399
not to tell Jiang Hongbin?

63
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,658
Relax, I didn't go into the details.

64
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,200
He doesn't know much.

65
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:09,619
Mum and Dad,

66
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,200
don't be afraid.

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,139
If anyone

68
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,459
wants to disrupt our peaceful life,

69
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,920
we'll put up a fight.

70
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,258
Why should we be afraid?

71
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,698
Forget it. Don't do it.

72
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,200
Yeah. Xiang Nan is right.

73
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,799
Yeah. They don't scare us.

74
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,899
Mum and Dad, stop worrying.

75
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,440
The problem has been solved.

76
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,720
I'll slice some fruit for you.

77
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,040
Some cherries.

78
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,698
Never mind. You just got discharged.

79
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,818
You are still recovering.

80
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,720
Go inside, drink some water,
and rest well.

81
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,778
Don't worry.

82
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:37,720
I'll carry the stuff inside.

83
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,399
Okay.

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,538
Keep it down. The kids are asleep.

85
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,258
How are Mum and Dad?

86
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,160
Problem solved?

87
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:20,959
It's over now.

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,239
It was my fault.

89
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,999
I should've brought them
to our home instead.

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,879
Sorry.

91
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,840
It's all right.

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,840
It ended on a good note.

93
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,559
No one got hurt.

94
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,239
Good to know that.

95
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,559
Get some rest.

96
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:40,539
Take a hot shower.

97
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,219
I'll ready the water.

98
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,999
Thanks.

99
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,818
(Xiang Nan: I hired someone to renovate)

100
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,999
(Aunty's salon.)

101
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,018
(Come here and check it out,)

102
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,400
(or get your hair done.)

103
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,239
(Xiang Zhong: Who would want her service?)

104
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,739
(According to
the latest weather update,)

105
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,898
(strong winds are expected in Kunshan.)

106
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,859
(Near Dianshan Lake,)

107
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,578
(wind speeds may reach up to level six)

108
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,979
(with occasional showers.)

109
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,480
(Please prepare rain gear.)

110
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,360
Miss Xiang,

111
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,818
We have a blue alert for gale.

112
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:15,879
Should we still stream?

113
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,258
We posted the trailer.

114
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,400
We must do the stream.

115
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,119
Wait until the wind dies down.

116
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,059
You could ask your husband

117
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,520
to bring some warm clothes.

118
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,280
Never mind.

119
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:31,979
Miss Xiang,

120
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,439
I'll fetch a battery from the car.

121
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,600
Come on!

122
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,520
Cheers.

123
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,160
Cheers.

124
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,040
Drink up.

125
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,119
Don't drink and drive.

126
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,160
(Bring me a pair of pants and a coat.)

127
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,258
(But you are too far away.)

128
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,099
We finally

129
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,099
got Deng to hand out with us.

130
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,360
You know what?

131
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,179
If you want the most authentic

132
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,639
Yangcheng Lake Hairy Crab,

133
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,338
you can count on Deng.

134
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,239
Trust me.

135
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,480
Xiang Qian. Visiting your aunty?

136
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,458
Everything on your phone

137
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,179
can be synched up

138
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,080
and watched on the TV.

139
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,480
I see the image now.

140
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,338
Who is stealing my job?

141
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,458
Sister, you're here.

142
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:48,859
Welcome.

143
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,219
Aunty.

144
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,779
She was showing me
how to cast from the phone.

145
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,739
You know what?

146
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,338
The renovator she brought

147
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:59,818
did all kinds of things
and renovated the place inside out.

148
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,960
What do you think?

149
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,480
See the differences?

150
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,138
Yeah.

151
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,498
I walked down the old street

152
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,160
and came here.

153
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,319
When I got here...

154
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:09,559
The shop

155
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,040
totally caught my attention.

156
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,960
I thought it was a cafe.

157
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,759
Cut it out.

158
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,799
We did it!

159
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,080
You know what?

160
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,018
Have you noticed?

161
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,999
The tone and the lighting

162
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,299
are so elegant.

163
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,419
It looks French in here.

164
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,659
Do you feel the vibe?

165
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,639
Yeah.

166
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,859
You dyed your hair blue for that?

167
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,698
Don't you think

168
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,759
my outfit matches the color?

169
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,119
I see it.

170
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,679
Mission success.

171
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,160
Of course.

172
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,767
(Bring me a pair of pants and a coat.)

173
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,439
In my workplace,

174
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,840
my words carry weight.

175
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,560
(Wife)

176
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,040
Deng, what now?

177
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,360
We'll get the female crabs.

178
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,960
Same here.

179
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,199
I'll get the male crabs.

180
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,699
(Qian Feng)

181
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,560
(Xiang Zhong)

182
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,818
Deng,

183
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,099
your wife is calling me.

184
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,040
Don't answer it.

185
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,080
Don't do it.

186
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm hanging up.

187
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,319
Hello, Mrs. Deng.

188
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,659
Are you

189
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,960
with Deng Haiyang?

190
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,259
He's not with me.

191
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,059
I would've told you

192
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,480
if he was hanging out with me.

193
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:41,919
Pass him the phone.

194
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:43,800
Pass me the opener.

195
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,499
Mrs. Deng, he is opening a bottle.

196
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,279
He can't talk.
Let me relay the message.

197
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,519
Tell him to send me a pair of pants.

198
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,039
She wants you to send her
a pair of pants.

199
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,299
Leave it.

200
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,259
We are having a drink.

201
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,680
We can't leave now.

202
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,480
I should...

203
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,159
I'm hanging up now.

204
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:09,259
Why did you tell her I was drinking?

205
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,720
Have you lost your mind?

206
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:11,759
Deng.

207
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,360
In my eyes, you are the real man.

208
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,218
What?

209
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:16,159
To your health.

210
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,919
This is how we deal with women.

211
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,858
My pals,

212
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,840
let's raise a toast.

213
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:21,299
At Yangcheng Lake,

214
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,499
Deng's rules

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,039
are absolute!

216
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,200
Cheers!

217
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,600
Cheers!

218
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,759
Raising you was worth it.

219
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,618
Our family finally has someone

220
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,080
who can help me with work.

221
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,960
Who helped you out?

222
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:37,080
Was it Jiang Hongbin?

223
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:38,899
That's inadequate.

224
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,279
You are not married yet.

225
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,519
Sister.

226
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:45,179
I want to help our family as well.

227
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,978
But I don't know the right people.

228
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,299
I happened to mention it

229
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,858
in a conversation.

230
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:50,338
I didn't know

231
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,159
he'd take it so seriously.

232
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,539
The next day,

233
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,338
he got me a construction crew

234
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,139
and prepared

235
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,960
the entire renovation design.

236
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,698
It means he takes my words

237
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,159
seriously.

238
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,279
Don't you think

239
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,560
he is thoughtful and reliable?

240
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,239
Actually,

241
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,999
I have my own schemes.

242
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,159
I am giving him more chances

243
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,480
to prove himself.

244
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,419
Then, you and our parents

245
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,840
just might see his worth.

246
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,978
Then, you can accept him sooner.

247
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,320
- And then...
- Enough.

248
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,818
There's no need for schemes.

249
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,379
Dad gave us a new instruction.

250
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,239
What is it?

251
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,239
He wants me to get to know the man.

252
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:35,858
That is great.

253
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:36,578
Let's get it done.

254
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:37,539
I'll tell him.

255
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,458
How about tonight?

256
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,539
What's the hurry?

257
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,399
Are you so eager to get married?

258
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm not in a hurry,

259
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,379
but clearly someone is.

260
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,239
He thinks I might give up on him
due to his age.

261
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,960
Who would?

262
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,379
His face is on the billboard.

263
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,899
Who would look down on him?

264
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,960
Hello!

265
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,499
What we see here is

266
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,299
the greenery layout

267
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,059
in the Wetland Park.

268
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,179
It not only highlights

269
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,080
the features of the Jiangnan water town

270
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,698
but also places a strong emphasis

271
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:02,978
on enhancing the ecological functions

272
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,440
of the wetland environment.

273
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:07,759
Look, Xiang Zhong is
doing a live stream.

274
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,818
Xiang Zhong is streaming.

275
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:11,618
There is a gale alert.
Why is she streaming?

276
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,578
It's her job.

277
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,239
No wind can stop her.

278
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,858
Based on the changing seasons...

279
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:17,540
The wind is strong.

280
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,059
Many flowers grow here.

281
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,200
She shouldn't be streaming.

282
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,360
Please have a look.

283
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,720
It's a blue alert.

284
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:32,360
This place...

285
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,840
This place...

286
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,919
It has...

287
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,919
Ms. Xiang Zhong!

288
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,200
Miss Xiang Zhong!

289
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:42,480
Where did she go?

290
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:43,800
Make it horizontal.

291
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:44,840
Reach for my hand.

292
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:46,578
Reach out.

293
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:47,919
How did she get down there?

294
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,259
The wind blew her away.

295
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,279
- It's too risky.
- Shut it!

296
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,800
Slowly.

297
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:57,759
What's wrong, Mum?

298
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,139
Xiang Qian, listen up.

299
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,200
Xiang Zhong was blown away by the wind.

300
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,098
She wasn't.

301
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,499
Stop spewing nonsense.

302
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,919
Her colleague pulled her back up.

303
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,618
The wind?

304
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,738
She is not that thin.

305
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,320
She was blown away.

306
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,019
Where is she now?

307
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,960
She is back.

308
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,279
Welcome back.

309
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,059
She seems all right now.

310
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,159
It looks like it.

311
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,019
So, why are you calling me?

312
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,239
What is this about?

313
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:26,999
Something didn't feel right.

314
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,899
Just not long ago,

315
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,960
your aunty was almost
at Death's doorstep.

316
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,720
It wasn't normal.

317
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:34,080
And now, your father.

318
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,299
He's been getting

319
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,840
too ill-tempered lately.

320
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,618
He gets annoyed by the slightest things.

321
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:39,818
Nothing we say

322
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,039
can keep him calm.

323
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,800
That doesn't seem right.

324
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,299
I am worried.

325
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,059
Maybe you could talk to Gao Ping about it.

326
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,539
Isn't he a researcher?

327
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,578
Ask him to find out

328
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,639
what's going on.

329
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,919
What should he study?

330
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,578
Study if there's something wrong

331
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,600
with the Xiang family's gene.

332
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:02,840
Seriously?

333
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:06,279
Don't be ridiculous.

334
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,680
Mum, don't stay at home and be paranoid.

335
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:10,919
I'm hanging up now.

336
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,818
Trust me,

337
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,600
being paranoid will make you sick.

338
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,039
What's wrong?

339
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,879
What should I study now?

340
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,279
Mum thinks

341
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,899
there's something wrong

342
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
with the family gene.

343
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,738
She is overthinking.

344
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:33,960
This is good.

345
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,539
It sounds like

346
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,840
you are brushing me off.

347
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,360
Maybe we should get it examined.

348
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:45,159
Sure. No harm will come out of it.

349
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,179
Prof. Yang knows some people.

350
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,200
I'll ask for his help.

351
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:51,919
I bought my parents the massagers.

352
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,360
You could

353
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,039
give it to Prof. Yang.

354
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:56,600
You are a researcher.

355
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,440
Don't forget the gestures.

356
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:02,200
Right?

357
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:03,938
Results are not everything.

358
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm washing my hands. Sleep on it.

359
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,360
(Emergency)

360
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:28,440
All right.

361
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,399
Press on it.

362
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:33,720
Where is your family?

363
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,159
They aren't here.

364
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:37,938
Observe it for a while.

365
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:38,858
You may go

366
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:39,879
if all goes well.

367
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,239
What is it for?

368
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,800
It's best to stay a while.

369
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:43,419
If you feel

370
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,578
dizzy or nauseous,

371
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:45,960
inform us at once.

372
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,239
Deng Haiyang.

373
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,360
Deng Haiyang.

374
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm here. What is it?

375
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,539
You didn't reply

376
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,159
or answer my calls.

377
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,978
I spent the night at the hospital

378
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,218
while you were having fun!

379
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:31,639
How could you call yourself a man?

380
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,259
I am. Shut up.

381
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,858
Stop yelling. Keep it down.

382
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:38,960
Get up now.

383
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,080
Get up!

384
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:42,618
Cut it out.

385
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,818
- Get up!
- Cut it out!

386
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:45,960
Get up now!

387
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,480
You want to lie down?

388
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,759
Is that it?

389
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:50,399
You won't listen to me!

390
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,978
Get up, Deng Haiyang!

391
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,399
Get up, Deng Haiyang!

392
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,818
What's the deal with you?

393
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:57,818
I went to bed in the morning.

394
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:58,698
I'm tired!

395
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,440
Can't you let me sleep?

396
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,818
Why are you yelling
so early in the morning?

397
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:04,919
Have you lost your mind?

398
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:06,680
Cut it out.

399
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,279
Yeah.

400
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,439
I lost my mind.

401
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,919
I'm out of my mind.

402
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:24,639
I've had enough of this.

403
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,800
I want a divorce.

404
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,280
Didn't catch that?

405
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,760
Divorce! I want a divorce!

406
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,080
Mrs. Deng.

407
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,280
Sorry.

408
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,719
Nature calls.

409
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,459
Hi, Gao Ping.

410
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,199
Hi.

411
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:17,760
Gao Ping?

412
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,520
What are you doing here?

413
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,199
Come on.

414
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,959
Come in.

415
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:22,818
What's wrong?

416
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,760
I highly recommend this chair.

417
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:27,138
It's awesome.
This chair is so comfortable.

418
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:27,979
Try it out now.

419
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,779
Sit down.

420
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,679
What chair is this?

421
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,219
It's an ergonomic chair.

422
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,178
Ergonomic?

423
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,360
Yeah. Sit down.

424
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,000
Sounds cool.

425
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,059
Feel it.

426
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,959
What's different?

427
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,280
The waist is supported.

428
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,418
Feels nice, right?

429
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:41,320
Yeah.

430
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,578
The neck is also supported.

431
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:43,800
Can you feel it?

432
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:44,600
You're right.

433
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,679
One more thing.

434
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,939
Sit tight.

435
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,979
Lie back.

436
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,840
Lie back.

437
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,719
What's wrong?

438
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:52,479
Well?

439
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,178
This chair is incredible.

440
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,119
You can lie down and sit on it.

441
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,338
That old chair is

442
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,199
a piece of junk.

443
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,439
For Prof. Yang?

444
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:01,979
Not bad.

445
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,320
Not bad.

446
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,699
You should get one too.

447
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,040
Me?

448
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,898
You know what?

449
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,459
My friend is a dealer.

450
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,520
I can get you a discount.

451
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,040
Are you a salesperson now?

452
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:11,898
Don't be silly.

453
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,399
I am serious about this.

454
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:14,499
It cost ten grand,

455
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,679
I can get it for six grand.

456
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,479
How much was it?

457
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,560
Six grand.

458
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,520
Give it some thought.

459
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,919
Just six grand? That's a huge discount.

460
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,159
Not bad.

461
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,040
It feels nice.

462
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,019
I know.

463
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,439
Are you really a salesperson?

464
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,338
Come on.

465
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:33,199
Stop

466
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,578
calling me that.

467
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:35,979
Fine. It's good.

468
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,539
I'll consider it.

469
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,639
Prof. Yang will love it.

470
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:39,818
I have to get going.

471
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:42,378
I'll let you know if I need one.

472
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:42,979
Sure.

473
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,338
Bye.

474
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,119
Six grands.

475
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,760
Nice.

476
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,120
(Daming Smart Home
Quality Life with Technology)

477
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,320
Come in.

478
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,178
Why are you still using

479
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,719
the echo system?

480
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,098
No, there is only one.

481
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:04,098
Just one.

482
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:05,479
Miss Xiang, the file you wanted.

483
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,159
I asked for two copies.

484
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,280
Sorry, I'll get another copy.

485
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:17,000
Your intern is always

486
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,280
so scatterbrained.

487
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,739
What do you mean?

488
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,520
Are you saying I didn't train her well?

489
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:23,840
Forget I said anything.

490
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,618
Take a look at this.

491
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,898
This is a comparison
between our company's Alice series

492
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:28,739
and the Echo company's

493
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,679
voice-control system.

494
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:32,818
Products that are portable

495
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,959
and can be swapped anytime.

496
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,939
I included

497
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,658
only our Alice series

498
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,959
in my proposal,

499
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,939
but honestly,

500
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,459
I really hope we can stick
with the Echo company's

501
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,000
voice-control system.

502
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,639
That's the issue, isn't it?

503
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,080
You know

504
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,459
the headquarters is prioritizing

505
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,658
our Alice series this year.

506
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:55,679
I know,

507
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,760
but just look at the data.

508
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:59,299
Whether it's emergency calls,

509
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,178
real-time communication,

510
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,059
or voice announcements,

511
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,919
Echo's system performs better.

512
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:04,299
And their "Call Assistant"

513
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,338
can communicate directly

514
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:07,499
with a central hub

515
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,840
to request help in real time.

516
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,219
For an elderly person
in their 70s or 80s,

517
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,578
living alone at home,

518
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:13,800
that's crucial.

519
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:16,378
Telling me

520
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:17,840
all this is fine,

521
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,138
but headquarters won't approve it.

522
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:22,439
Won't all your hard work
these past six months go to waste?

523
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,499
Think about

524
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,739
your team at least,

525
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,259
if not

526
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,919
for yourself.

527
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,939
I have. I've thought about it all.

528
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,539
But shouldn't I also think
about why we took on this project

529
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,080
in the first place?

530
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,658
Isn't it to provide

531
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,959
the best possible care for the elderly?

532
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,480
You know, just the other day,
my second aunt was talking about

533
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,919
"leaving this world."

534
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,898
She said she wanted
to go while she still could

535
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:50,578
manage on her own,
without needing anyone's help.

536
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,280
She didn't want to be a burden.

537
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,800
That made me think even more

538
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,178
about the purpose of this project.

539
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,779
To provide the best convenience
for the elderly.

540
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,600
So, I want to choose the best product.

541
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:05,760
Isn't that right, Boss?

542
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,360
Alright, alright.

543
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,240
You've got a big vision.

544
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,059
I'll try to discuss it
with headquarters again.

545
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,040
Thank you, Mr. Chai.

546
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,959
How will you thank me?

547
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,378
I'll treat you to a meal.

548
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,399
Your choice of place.

549
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,560
You've got a family to feed.

550
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,639
I wouldn't dare let you splurge.

551
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,479
Thanks, Boss.

552
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:44,852
Haiyang.

553
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,959
Xiang Zhong, your husband's here.

554
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:00,040
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

555
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,040
I need to talk to you. Step outside.

556
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,840
Can't you see I'm busy?

557
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,679
It'll be quick. Won't take much time.

558
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,439
Come on.

559
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:17,299
What is it? Out with it.

560
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,879
I still have documents to send.

561
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,919
Look, yesterday I didn't know
you were at the hospital.

562
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:26,800
If I had known,
I would've been there for you.

563
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,879
Spare me the empty words.

564
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:31,219
It's my fault.

565
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,159
I shouldn't have had
any expectations of you.

566
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,539
I was just out drinking with the guys.

567
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,658
With Qian Feng and the others.

568
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,479
We were just hanging out and drinking.

569
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,939
Then you called
and asked me to bring you pants.

570
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,360
Isn't that just weird?

571
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,360
What's weird about that?

572
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,138
What's so embarrassing
about bringing some pants for your wife?

573
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,578
It's not about embarrassment.

574
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,658
I couldn't just leave

575
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,280
my friends there, right?

576
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,719
Besides, why would you

577
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,919
go live streaming in such a windy place?

578
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,360
Are you crazy?

579
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,399
What's your point? Spit it out. I'm busy.

580
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,959
Well...

581
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,000
Do you really want me to call the police?

582
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,679
That's not the real problem between us.

583
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:23,879
All these years.

584
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,059
Every time we argue,
you say you'll change, but here we are.

585
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,520
You never change.

586
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,080
Did you go to that technical exam
I asked you to take? No.

587
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,760
Did you stop wasting time on drinking,
barbecue, and gaming? No.

588
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,338
I'm done talking. I'm exhausted.

589
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,320
I'm tired.

590
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:43,560
No one signs up

591
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,338
for that exam.

592
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,080
Why should I be the only one?

593
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:47,840
Right?

594
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,898
Isn't hanging out with friends
about drinking, eating, and singing?

595
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:54,618
Isn't that what everyone does? Why do I
have to be different from everyone else?

596
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:55,739
So, you've had enough, huh?

597
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,338
I haven't.

598
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,539
Then let's get divorced.

599
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,520
No one will bother you
about exams anymore.

600
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,138
You let me go, I'll let you go.

601
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:01,939
Alright?

602
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,879
I'm not divorcing.

603
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,159
Staying doesn't change anything.

604
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:05,919
What kind of life is this? It's meaningless.

605
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,879
No matter what, I won't divorce.

606
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:17,259
Mr. Lin.

607
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,818
Heading home?

608
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:18,600
Gao Ping.

609
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:19,959
Gao Ping.

610
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,719
Gao Ping!

611
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,378
Li Shu.

612
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:24,898
I called your name so many times.

613
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,199
Why didn't you respond?

614
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,159
I didn't hear you.

615
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,919
What's up?

616
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,459
Nothing.

617
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,399
It's just been a while
since I last saw you.

618
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:37,760
I've been holed up at home
writing my thesis.

619
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,280
Gao Ping, there's something
I'd like to ask you about.

620
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,800
Go ahead.

621
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,199
Is it hard to get accepted
as Prof. Yang's PhD student?

622
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:48,080
Are you planning to apply?

623
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,658
What's with that reaction?

624
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:54,658
You think I can't do it?

625
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:55,479
No, of course not.

626
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,019
If you prepare well,

627
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,000
you should be fine.

628
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,459
Well,

629
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,299
if there's something I don't understand,

630
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,479
could I ask you?

631
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:05,979
Ask Dayuan.

632
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,000
He's more knowledgeable.

633
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,760
Who says?

634
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,560
In our research institute,
you're the top expert.

635
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,920
Not only are you knowledgeable,

636
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,760
but you're also good-looking
and have a great personality.

637
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,979
All the female grad students

638
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,320
are your fans.

639
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,000
How are you getting home?

640
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,199
I'm taking the metro.

641
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,499
My car's right here.

642
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,080
Why don't I give you a ride
to the metro station?

643
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:37,639
Is that alright?

644
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:38,399
It's no trouble.

645
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,719
I'll accept the free ride then.

646
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,600
Hop in.

647
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:45,178
Oh, right.

648
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,600
There's a baby seat in the back.

649
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:47,639
You can sit up front.

650
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,699
Are you sure it's appropriate for me

651
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,418
to sit in the front?

652
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,879
It's fine. Go ahead.

653
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:17,840
It smells so nice in here.

654
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,280
Is it this air freshener?

655
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,040
It's lovely.

656
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,760
Gao Ping, what's this scent?

657
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:27,898
I'm not sure.

658
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,000
My wife picked it out.

659
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:32,299
Your wife has a taste

660
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,040
for quality living.

661
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,520
Has Dayuan been visiting often lately?

662
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,439
Yes, he's been coming
to see Professor Yang a lot.

663
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,818
Did Professor Yang

664
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,719
give him a project?

665
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,159
No, not really.

666
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,299
I heard Dayuan gave up

667
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,879
applying to overseas institutions.

668
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:05,439
That's good.

669
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:08,520
Gao Ping,

670
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,539
we all hope

671
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,679
you'll stay.

672
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:13,459
That way,

673
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,719
we can see you every day!

674
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:25,739
You took off your glasses.

675
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,159
Can you even see anything?

676
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,578
I can see everything

677
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:30,600
I want to see.

678
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,959
Wait!

679
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,719
If you lose a bit more weight,
you might squeeze in.

680
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,098
I'm too average a person to follow trends.

681
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,199
No diet for me.

682
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:05,639
By the way,

683
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,600
did you find anything
on that guy Jiang Hongbin,

684
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,959
Xiang Nan's boyfriend?

685
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,600
Is she really set

686
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,119
on marrying him?

687
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,560
Well, they're dating.

688
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:24,679
Listen to this.

689
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,578
Jiang Hongbin has been divorced
for over five years.

690
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:32,639
His ex-wife and child are in Canada.

691
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:35,600
And?

692
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,600
Seems he's kept busy over the years,

693
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,080
especially with a woman named Ming Wei.

694
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:47,578
But recently, he's found a young,

695
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:48,800
sweet girl to marry.

696
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,858
This "young, sweet girl"

697
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,479
must be Xiang Nan, right?

698
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,818
Our Xiang Nan

699
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,399
is definitely not just a "sweet girl."

700
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,040
He's a successful entrepreneur.

701
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:04,639
He has a bit of a wild streak,

702
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,760
so don't hold it against him.

703
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:08,578
No hard feelings?

704
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:09,919
You should marry him yourself.

705
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,898
If he doesn't mind,

706
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:12,159
I'm fine with it.

707
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,840
Alright. Congrats on your wedding.

708
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,199
Dad.

709
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,858
Xiang Nan said Jiang Hongbin

710
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,618
wants to come over this Saturday.

711
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:24,818
Shouldn't we

712
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:25,979
meet him?

713
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,439
Of course, if it's the right time.

714
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,199
Xiang Zhong.

715
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:33,539
Why are you here?

716
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,840
- Xiang Zhong.
- Slow down.

717
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,499
Listen to this!

718
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,639
Big news!

719
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,800
Xiang Nan wants

720
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,080
to bring Jiang Hongbin over

721
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,360
to the house on Saturday.

722
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,480
He's divorced and has a child,
and you're okay with that?

723
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,800
What else can I do if I'm not?

724
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,919
It seems money still matters in the end.

725
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,178
I'm not someone

726
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,600
who cares about money alone.

727
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:56,479
Xiang Nan has genuine feelings for him.

728
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,439
Xiang Zhong.

729
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,719
At home, we can say whatever we like.

730
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,939
We're family.

731
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,739
But Jiang Hongbin isn't family yet.

732
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,739
He's still an outsider.

733
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,240
It'll be his first time visiting,

734
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,019
so, please.

735
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,399
Be careful what you say.

736
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,240
I have plans Saturday. I won't be there.

737
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:16,979
Plans?

738
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,360
Can't you reschedule?

739
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,760
This is a big deal for Xiang Nan.

740
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:24,178
And why should I make time for that?

741
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,879
How is her business my business?

742
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,760
Xiang Zhong,

743
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,178
you can't be against everyone!

744
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:31,138
You're implying I shouldn't go, right?

745
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,578
Fine, I just won't go.

746
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,818
Where did you get that idea?

747
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,800
I'm not saying you shouldn't go!

748
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,539
I'm just saying watch what you say.

749
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,425
This is how I talk.

750
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:41,527
I can't change it.

751
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:43,600
You...

752
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:53,240
Xiang Zhong.

753
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,520
Your mother and I watched the video.

754
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,840
I'm a viral star.
What's so bad about that?

755
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,439
Don't take it too seriously.

756
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,280
In a few days, people will forget.

757
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,578
Remember your mother's big scandal?

758
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,600
And now?

759
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,040
Nobody talks about it anymore.

760
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,119
It's over.

761
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,000
Got it?

762
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:14,640
Stop bringing up bad memories.

763
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:16,760
If you don't know what to say,
don't say anything, okay?

764
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,479
- I'm just trying to comfort you.
- I'm leaving now.

765
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,298
Move.

766
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:19,578
No.

767
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:20,939
Move.

768
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,658
Just remember what I said.

769
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,879
I don't have time. I'm not going.

770
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,120
Xiang Zhong!

771
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,499
Don't say you're too busy!

772
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,738
You have to go!

773
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,760
I won't be there! I'm busy!

774
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,439
The conversation didn't go well, huh?

775
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,720
It soured
after barely a few sentences in.

776
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,360
That girl.

777
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,339
If we hadn't sent her

778
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,280
to the countryside when she was young,

779
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,439
would she have turned
out like this, you reckon?

780
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,539
We didn't have a choice.

781
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,939
It was the one-child policy.

782
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,840
And you held a government position.

783
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:25,959
True, but we are also at fault.

784
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,959
When the girls were young,

785
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,160
all our attention

786
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,680
went to Xiang Nan

787
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,079
and Xiang Qian.

788
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,200
We didn't think about her enough.

789
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,320
I blame you.
Your favoritism was too obvious.

790
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,819
Oh, so you're blaming it all on me now?

791
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,240
Is it all my fault?

792
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,200
You didn't do anything? Really?

793
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:55,240
Good grief.

794
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,879
Enough. Let's stop arguing.

795
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:19,039
Qian.

796
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,200
What's up, Xiang Nan?

797
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,959
Qian, what are you doing here?

798
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:27,939
Our company

799
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,519
has a project in Suzhou,

800
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,218
so I stopped by the site

801
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,640
and thought I'd check on you.

802
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,480
I figured you probably haven't eaten yet,

803
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,120
so I brought you some
pan-fried soup dumplings.

804
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:39,840
Perfect! I'm starving.

805
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,399
Let me see.

806
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,680
I can save this for breakfast tomorrow.

807
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,800
How thoughtful of you.

808
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,178
Where are the chopsticks?

809
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,039
Right here.

810
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,200
Here you go.

811
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,258
Did you eat?

812
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:54,499
I did. You go ahead.

813
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,919
Okay, I'm digging in.

814
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,240
Delicious!

815
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,800
There's soup too.

816
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,999
You're the best.

817
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,599
Oh, yeah.

818
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,578
This Saturday,

819
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,320
Jiang's coming over for dinner.

820
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:20,640
Did Dad tell you?

821
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:23,559
Yeah, he called this morning.

822
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,320
You two have only been dating
for a bit over six months. In that time,

823
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,280
has he told you everything about himself?

824
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,120
Why? Heard something?

825
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:35,419
No,

826
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,280
I just thought I'd hear it from you.

827
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,178
He's already told me

828
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:42,720
about his past relationships.

829
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,039
He said he's settled things and moved on.

830
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,959
Worried?

831
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,680
Can I not?

832
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,680
He's a lot older than you.

833
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,640
I actually think

834
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,859
he's a very serious man.

835
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,859
When it comes to work,

836
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,959
he's very diligent.

837
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:02,640
He's constantly working overtime
and going to meetings.

838
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:04,800
He doesn't spend
much time on relationships,

839
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,399
and he doesn't treat them lightly.

840
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,819
Over the years,
he's only had a few relationships,

841
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,280
and he's told me about each one.

842
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,879
I know how to judge a character.

843
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:16,840
I think as long as he's good to me,

844
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,539
that's all that matters.

845
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,098
I don't care about his past.

846
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,640
Who doesn't have a past?

847
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:27,640
Ah, the young and in love.

848
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:31,519
Alright.

849
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,479
If you're happy, that's what counts.

850
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:39,079
What do people say about you two?

851
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,800
Old man with a young girl.

852
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,840
That's it?

853
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,360
Beauty and the Beast.

854
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,499
Or that I'm a "naive, sweet girl."

855
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,640
Oh, so you know?

856
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:50,559
People really say that?

857
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,200
Well, that suits me just fine.

858
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,800
I like being a "naive, sweet girl."

859
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:57,919
What's so bad about that?

860
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:00,999
Simple, happy, and worry-free.

861
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,919
At least I'm sweet and cute.

862
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:05,379
Glad we paid for college.

863
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,399
Eat your dumplings.

864
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,098
Want some?

865
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,120
Not a bit.

866
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,720
You should watch her.

867
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:51,959
Her posture is excellent.

868
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,800
Look. It's her.

869
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,280
The instructor
was just praising her posture.

870
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,698
But look, one gust of wind
and she's blown away!

871
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,298
Isn't she a stick figure?

872
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:18,178
Right?

873
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:19,019
Look at her.

874
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,939
Look at how pathetic she is.

875
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,419
What is that? Hilarious.

876
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,258
Well, the wind certainly

877
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:24,879
wouldn't blow you guys away.

878
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,640
Wait a minute.
What did she mean by that?

879
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:35,578
Is she calling us fat?

880
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,939
She must be talking about you.

881
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,800
I'm not nearly as fat as you.

882
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,120
I...

883
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,959
What are you looking at?

884
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:01,840
Reading a book.

885
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,778
A book?

886
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:03,959
What's so funny in that book?

887
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:04,999
An e-book.

888
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,658
Let me see.

889
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:06,479
Don't look.

890
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:08,739
- What's so funny? Let me see it.
- Don't...

891
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,275
Xiang Zhong.

892
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:11,282
Xiang Zhong!

893
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,200
Qian Feng sent it to me.

894
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:17,819
What?

895
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,760
Are you happy now
that I got blown away by the wind?

896
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,019
Is it my fault? You insisted
on live streaming

897
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,640
despite the strong wind warning.

898
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,218
What use are you?

899
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:27,479
Deng Haiyang!

900
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:29,098
Get off my blanket!

901
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,738
I just finished drying it,
and it smells fresh.

902
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:32,480
- What's the big deal?
- It's not even fully dry yet.

903
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,178
Well, I'm just warming it up for you.

904
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:35,899
Nothing like
a little human drying service!

905
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,499
You stink!

906
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,200
Why are you on my blanket?

907
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,339
What are you doing?
Are you planning to sleep here?

908
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,979
I've told you a million times.

909
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,419
This is a shared space.

910
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,879
You can't just lounge around here.

911
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,200
Go back to your room!

912
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,320
My room's too small.

913
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,138
It's cramped, and it has no airflow.

914
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:51,320
It's so much nicer here.

915
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,339
Alright, if you're not moving,

916
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,240
then watch this.

917
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,459
I'll take a picture of you

918
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,218
and post it

919
00:42:57,219 --> 00:42:57,778
on social media

920
00:42:57,779 --> 00:42:59,079
