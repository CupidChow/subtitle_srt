=Our Days=

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 2=

4
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,493
You gave me a fright.

5
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:40,893
What... What are you doing?

6
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:41,996
Gave you a fright?

7
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,389
You're back early today.

8
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,456
You're still up.

9
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,601
I want to ask you something.

10
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,460
Where did the money

11
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:49,640
from our joint account go?

12
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,879
That?

13
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:59,840
Why do you ask?

14
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,160
Why?

15
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,539
My parents lost their savings
because they were scammed, remember?

16
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,658
I want to give them some money,

17
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,440
so they can feel more reassured.

18
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,899
Well...

19
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,859
Your family is more well-off than us.

20
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,360
Shouldn't they be handling
the matter themselves?

21
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,018
There's no comparison.

22
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,098
She is she, I am me.

23
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:17,938
My mom is in trouble

24
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,280
and you're not at all anxious?

25
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:20,778
Where is the money?

26
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:21,759
What did you do with it?

27
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,240
What money do you mean?

28
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,319
Stop pretending, you heard me.

29
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,240
The money in the card?

30
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeah.

31
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,319
I... I lent it to Qian Feng.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,819
Hey, the money in the card

33
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,699
is not yours alone.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,578
Why didn't you

35
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,079
ask me before you lent the money?

36
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:39,618
Qian Feng

37
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:40,498
said he's

38
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:41,738
just borrowing it for a few days

39
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:42,859
and will pay back soon.

40
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,939
So I figured it's simple enough, right?

41
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,539
Nonsense. He's not buying a car or house.

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,240
Why does he need so much money?

43
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:52,018
How did it end up like this?

44
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,079
Gosh.

45
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,599
It hurts.

46
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,599
Not so hard...

47
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,599
How is Mom doing?

48
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,560
I don't know.

49
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,079
Chai Jin is helping too look too.

50
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,498
Stop dabbing at it.

51
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,440
Just put it on.

52
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,058
Smear it.

53
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:12,659
Just smear it.

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,458
Okay, I'll be gentle.

55
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,359
Hang in there.

56
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:17,898
Just do it.

57
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:18,879
Okay, okay.

58
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,498
Those gray-haired

59
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:22,919
elderly people.

60
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,280
Why are there still so naughty?

61
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,219
When I heard it,

62
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,919
I was shocked too.

63
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,298
Why didn't you call me

64
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,759
immediately?

65
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:40,699
My phone fell and broke.

66
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,319
I couldn't remember the number.

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,659
But you remembered

68
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,039
Chai Jin's phone number.

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,898
I told you.

70
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:48,539
Because the last two digits

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,219
of his number

72
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,458
is different from mine.

73
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,919
The front part is the same.

74
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:56,840
What are you doing?

75
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,079
Revenge.

76
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,440
You're so petty.

77
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,680
I was never that generous.

78
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,879
I must have been blind.

79
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,120
Ask him now?

80
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,539
You want me to ask him?

81
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,898
I'm not kidding with you. Ask him, quick.

82
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:10,458
I'm not kidding.

83
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,178
Listen to me.

84
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,178
I just lent it to him,

85
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:12,979
and now I'm asking

86
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,240
when he's paying me back?

87
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,379
That's not very nice.

88
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,139
What does that make me?

89
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,359
That's no good.

90
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:19,039
What do you mean no good?

91
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,178
Just tell him,

92
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,699
that I need the money.

93
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,840
It's urgent.

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,778
Look, I lent him

95
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:27,498
the money.

96
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,258
I'm not the one asking,

97
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,479
but you are.

98
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,459
What does that make us,

99
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,298
right?

100
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:34,498
That's ridiculous.

101
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:37,039
It's being unreasonable.

102
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,280
So you won't ask?

103
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,659
Fine.

104
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,618
I'll ask.

105
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,640
It's fine.

106
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,919
It's no big deal.

107
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,320
How about tomorrow?

108
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,280
Will tomorrow make a difference?

109
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,160
It's late.

110
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,339
You won't call?

111
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,899
I'll call.

112
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,698
Okay, I'll do it.

113
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,200
I'll ask him.

114
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,539
I'll call him.

115
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,080
It's nothing, really.

116
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,200
It's ringing.

117
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,400
Why aren't you answering?

118
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,899
Scam calls.

119
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,160
I get so many.

120
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,138
(Haiyang,)

121
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:28,520
(why aren't you picking up?)

122
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,979
Deng Haiyang,

123
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,298
what

124
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:31,419
show are you putting on?

125
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,760
I'm not.

126
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,919
I'm not.

127
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,119
Is it so hard to ask for the money back?

128
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,378
It's not. I'll do it tomorrow.

129
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,058
It's late.

130
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:39,859
I'll ask tomorrow.

131
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,899
Tomorrow, I promise.

132
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,298
You better do it tomorrow.

133
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:43,520
Okay, I will.

134
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:45,979
Remember to ask Xiaosi

135
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,479
to find out about Mom's case.

136
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,099
If you don't settle it,

137
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,378
I'm going to call him tomorrow.

138
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,520
I will ask tomorrow, yes.

139
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,099
I'll ask him out for a meal

140
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,799
and get him to add it to his agenda.

141
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,280
Okay.

142
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,799
All done.

143
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,239
By the way,

144
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,498
about the milk tea.

145
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,280
I checked with Dayuan.

146
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,760
I ordered it for him.

147
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,258
He helped me gather some materials

148
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:20,818
and then insisted

149
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,280
I buy him milk tea as thanks.

150
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,618
I saw it while doing bookkeeping
for the household's monthly expenses,

151
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:28,698
so I asked about it.

152
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:29,919
That's all.

153
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:32,058
We're using your money.

154
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,599
I should tell you.

155
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,439
Anyway,

156
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,459
um...

157
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,178
next time

158
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:41,419
anything happens at home,

159
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,859
could you maybe consider

160
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,039
my plans for a bit?

161
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,498
I was supposed

162
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:49,720
to meet Mr. Yang in the afternoon.

163
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:50,979
But because of your emergency,

164
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,339
I had to go pick up the kid

165
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,840
and stood Mr. Yang up.

166
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,219
When I called him just now,

167
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,640
he seemed quite pissed.

168
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,938
What happened at home today

169
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,080
was totally unexpected.

170
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,659
The Xiang family has three daughters.

171
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,840
How come you have to handle everything?

172
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,720
Because I'm the eldest.

173
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,138
Okay, okay.

174
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,080
Got it.

175
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,439
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,599
It's fine.

177
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,919
You've worked hard, Big Sister Xiang.

178
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:09,618
Dad.

179
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,099
I was trying not to wake you.

180
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,960
Let me.

181
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,400
All good.

182
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,160
Did you stay here overnight?

183
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,339
It's fine, Dad.
Are you feeling any discomfort?

184
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,938
No.

185
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:20,698
Let me get you water.

186
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,439
No need.

187
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,459
I'm fine.

188
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,960
Nothing's wrong.

189
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,400
Where is Xiang Zhong?

190
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,058
Zhong has a live streaming

191
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:31,818
this morning.

192
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:32,738
So she went back already.

193
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:33,339
She said

194
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,258
she'll come pick us up

195
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,640
when you're discharged.

196
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,280
What about Xiang Qian?

197
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,019
She's gone back to rest too.

198
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,138
She made several trips
to and fro yesterday.

199
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,400
Let her rest.

200
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,120
Those two older sisters of yours

201
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,880
just left you here.

202
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,859
It's okay.

203
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,699
I should

204
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,240
stay here and keep you company.

205
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,400
You've suffered.

206
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,000
Not at all.

207
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,199
But I got scared yesterday.

208
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:07,360
Who are you calling, Dad?

209
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:09,199
I'm calling Xiang Qian.

210
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,179
Don't.

211
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,819
It's not even six.

212
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,979
I bet she hasn't slept a wink

213
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,480
because of Mom.

214
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,439
Let her rest.

215
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,199
I want to ask her

216
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,258
if Mom's medicine has been delivered.

217
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,299
Yes, it was delivered yesterday.

218
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,439
Don't worry.

219
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,480
I'll get you some breakfast in a bit.

220
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:31,679
Dad.

221
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:37,799
Why?

223
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,640
About my boyfriend,

224
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,039
I should've told you sooner.

225
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,880
I didn't want you to worry.

226
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,179
You've always spoiled me,

227
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,520
doted on me.

228
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:55,138
I'm sure you wouldn't want me

229
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,439
to end up with a divorced man with kids.

230
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,520
I know you were thinking for my sake.

231
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,360
Dad.

232
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,640
He's good to me.

233
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,959
He's thoughtful and considerate.

234
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,179
When there's time,

235
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,819
I'll ask him to visit you.

236
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,339
You can get to know him

237
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,179
and then maybe

238
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,600
you'll like him.

239
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,240
Dad.

240
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,439
Tell me.

241
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,839
Are you set on him?

242
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,859
The gist of the matter is...

243
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,699
You know...

244
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,219
The Public Security Bureau

245
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,538
arrest more than thirty

246
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,658
elderly people

247
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,000
from that place.

248
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,719
The reason being...

249
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,760
They were just swept in.

250
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,059
What do you mean swept?

251
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,138
Swept what?

252
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,400
Wait, Deng Haiyang.
Can you be more specific?

253
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,600
I mean, swept...

254
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,600
What?

255
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:27,258
What happened to your mom?

256
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,439
Swept what?

257
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:29,679
Okay.

258
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,839
Two words.

259
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,079
First world.

260
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,378
"Sweep," right?

261
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,258
Yes, sweep.

262
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,679
Second word is...

263
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:37,778
The second word is this...

264
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,079
This thing.

265
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,378
What exactly are you trying to say,

266
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,018
Haiyang?

267
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,418
Just spit it out.

268
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,219
Yeah,

269
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,618
you're wasting my time here.

270
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,400
A bottle?

271
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:46,699
Sweep, yellow. Yellow!

272
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,618
Sweep yellow?

273
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:48,738
Do you know Chinese?

274
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,299
Yellow, the color yellow?

275
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,360
Pornography?

276
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,219
What does my mom
have anything to do with pornography?

277
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,099
Yeah, what is...

278
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,778
What are you saying?

279
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,819
Xiang Qian. Haiyang said something
about sweeping pornography.

280
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,459
What...

281
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,299
What's that got to do with your mom?

282
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,099
What's the connection?
We're totally confused.

283
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,640
You tell your sister.

284
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:05,760
Deng Haiyang.

285
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,658
What nonsense are you spouting?

286
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,179
Where did you hear such crazy news?

287
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,059
It's not crazy news.

288
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,658
Xiang Zhong

289
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:11,339
asked me to find out.

290
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,778
So I asked

291
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,738
my friend who's a cop.

292
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,778
They said it was

293
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,079
an anti-pornography operation.

294
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,258
And how is Mom
related to anti-pornography?

295
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:21,719
You mean prostitution?

296
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,418
Don't be ridiculous, you.

297
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:23,979
No, no.

298
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,199
It's okay, Dad.

299
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,299
It's because of that...

300
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,258
That Lin Shufen.

301
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,199
She opened a beauty salon.

302
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,378
At the salon,

303
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,240
she did in fact offered

304
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:37,160
the older men there...

305
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,039
special services.

306
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,099
What? What services?

307
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,839
Mom became a pander?

308
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,459
Stop yapping nonsense.

309
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,538
Gosh, you.

310
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:46,418
Mom did introduce customers to her.

311
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:47,658
But she introduced them

312
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:48,898
to go for beauty treatments.

313
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,059
As for the other stuff,

314
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,939
Mom had no idea.

315
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,819
That's for sure,

316
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,738
without you saying.

317
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,459
Right.

318
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,640
The point now

319
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,939
is convincing the bureau

320
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,618
that your mom is innocent.

321
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:00,859
She was in the dark.

322
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,400
You know your mom.

323
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,199
She's simple-minded.

324
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,839
Now what?

325
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,880
Haiyang.

326
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,339
Your cop friend.

327
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,738
Go... Go ask him.

328
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:13,039
Ask him for a favor.

329
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,459
Okay, yeah.

330
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,738
I will think of a way

331
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:17,658
to find out more.

332
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:20,039
No need to ask for favors.

333
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,880
They're already in the midst
of investigation.

334
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,378
We already asked them

335
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,959
to please investigate my mom first.

336
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,120
What should we do then?

337
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,099
Dad just got discharged
from the hospital.

338
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,979
Can you tell

339
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,240
your Deng Haiyang to shut up?

340
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:37,219
Why tell him

341
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,538
to go and find news?

342
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:39,418
Even if you did,

343
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,480
you should've told me first.

344
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,600
You didn't tell me either.

345
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:44,658
Who knows

346
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,799
when you're being real?

347
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:48,799
What did I say?

348
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,039
What did I tell you about
what happened to Mom?

349
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,679
What did I tell everyone?

350
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,600
If it's in fact true,

351
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,400
less than five years
if it's not serious.

352
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,898
If it is, it's a minimum of five,

353
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,079
maybe more.

354
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:01,459
But the fact is,

355
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,600
the investigation is still ongoing.

356
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:05,219
Mom must have been tricked,

357
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,760
or misled.

358
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,400
I...

359
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,299
Should I have made

360
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,240
the whole family worry?

361
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:12,579
I'm trying to bear the burden

362
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,459
for the family,

363
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,719
and that's wrong?

364
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,378
Family?

365
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:17,778
Don't kid yourself.

366
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:18,538
Since when

367
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,000
have you all treated me like family?

368
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,579
Mom got arrested

369
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,520
and no one called me to tell me.

370
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,760
If not because Xiang Nan couldn't find
the American Ginseng,

371
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,959
would you guys have called me?

372
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,658
I'm a Xiang too. I'm a member
of the Xiang family.

373
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:33,138
Why is it

374
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,299
that when Mom got arrested,

375
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,018
I don't deserve

376
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,600
to be informed immediately?

377
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:37,898
Enough

378
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:38,898
with your tantrums,

379
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:39,760
you hear?

380
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,799
If you're really so eager

381
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,360
to help out the family,

382
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,898
you must have known

383
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,079
that Dad was hospitalized.

384
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:48,719
Where were you?

385
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,819
How come Xiang Nan

386
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,000
stayed the whole night?

387
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,538
Dad favored Xiang Nan the most.

388
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,319
It's only right for her to stay
and keep him company.

389
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,240
What...

390
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:03,439
Hello?

391
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:04,618
Xiang Qian.

392
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:05,959
This is Mr. Gao.

393
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,538
About what we discussed,

394
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,640
I gave it some thought.

395
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,378
We can...

396
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,059
Mr. Gao,

397
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,299
you don't have to bother with it.

398
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,360
I'll handle it myself.

399
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,059
(Pudong District Detention Center, Shanghai)

400
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,699
Thank you. Goodbye.

401
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,679
No problem.

402
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:38,719
Attorney Wu.

403
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,400
Hello, Xiang Qian?

404
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,640
It's alright.

405
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,339
The investigation is over.

406
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,160
Mrs. Xiang has been cleared.

407
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,400
She didn't know anything.

408
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,000
That's... great.

409
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,378
So they've questioned her

410
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:54,520
and came to the conclusion, yes?

411
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,658
When can we go

412
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,959
and get her?

413
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,179
Probably tomorrow morning

414
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,400
at the soonest.

415
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:00,919
Okay, thank you.

416
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,120
Thanks, Attorney Wu.

417
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:03,559
Okay.

418
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,839
What did he say?

419
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,120
Mom didn't know anything.

420
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,919
That's great.

421
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,979
I better tell Zhong

422
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,799
about it.

423
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,240
She must be worried too.

424
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,959
The lawyer just called.

425
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,099
They finished the probe on Mom.

426
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,280
She's fine.

427
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,000
She didn't know anything.

428
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,719
We can go get her on Monday.

429
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,880
Good to hear.

430
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm glad.

431
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,600
I need to tell you

432
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,339
where all the money went.

433
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,418
Mom's friend, Lin Chufen,

434
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:47,559
Madam Lin.

435
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:48,819
Mom lent her the money.

436
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,939
She didn't tell you

437
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,699
because she knew

438
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,039
you would never agree.

439
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,418
Of course I wouldn't.

440
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:54,059
That money

441
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,018
is for Xiang Nan's marriage.

442
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:56,538
How could you...

443
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:58,459
Okay, okay. Cool down.

444
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,219
Don't get upset.

445
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,299
How can I not be?

446
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,280
We can get the money back.

447
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,240
We can sue her.

448
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,240
If that doesn't work,
we'll do it by force.

449
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,400
By force?

450
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,919
Forget about suing.

451
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,679
Just look at Uncle Cui.

452
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,280
He's gravely ill.

453
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,400
So if he can't pay,

454
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,320
are you going to take over their house?

455
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:19,800
That's not right.

456
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:21,218
When they were

457
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,178
doing well in the past,

458
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:23,800
we were beneficiaries.

459
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,160
We accepted their help.

460
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,439
Let's just think of this
as returning their kindness.

461
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,719
Okay.

462
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,418
As long as you've thought it through,

463
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,600
accepted it,

464
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,178
and move on.

465
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,479
Don't worry.

466
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,679
I'm not that foolish.

467
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,099
But your mom?

468
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,880
Who knows what's wrong with her?

469
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,199
Look what happened.

470
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:53,279
She got herself in trouble.

471
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,080
Let me remind you.

472
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:56,938
When you see Mom,

473
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:59,040
don't mention about my hospitalization.

474
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,679
I don't want her to overthink.

475
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,138
Did you hear me?

476
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:06,279
Yes.

477
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:07,739
When Mom is back,

478
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,360
we won't mention anything.

479
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,400
It's all in the past.

480
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,458
I've prepared the vegetable.

481
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,698
Who's cooking? You or me?

482
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:14,458
I'll do it.

483
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,400
Let me.

484
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:16,499
I know you're tired.

485
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,378
Don't cook.

486
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,959
Go and rest up.

487
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,479
Goodness me.

488
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,479
Are the kids asleep?

489
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,400
Did they ask about me?

490
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,819
I'll go and get Mom tomorrow.

491
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,239
So I'm staying at theirs tonight.

492
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:37,759
Tell the kids for me.

493
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:48,400
(Gao Ping: Alright. They were just
asking me about you.)

494
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:49,640
Qian.

495
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,759
You're still awake.

496
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,560
I'm already sleeping.

497
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,439
Chatting with brother-in-law?

498
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,239
How sweet.

499
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:00,600
Scoot over.

500
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,658
What are you doing?

501
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,120
I want to sleep with you.

502
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:06,859
You're a grown adult.

503
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,019
The bed won't fit.

504
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,779
It will.

505
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,579
We'll just squeeze a little.

506
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,579
I think this bed

507
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,320
is more comfortable than mine.

508
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,138
How am I supposed to sleep like this?

509
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:16,400
I thought I could finally

510
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,880
have a good sleep.

511
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,199
Just make do.

512
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,120
I came to chat with you.

513
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:22,959
I'm already asleep.

514
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,579
Do you think

515
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,239
Mom and Dad are still doing that?

516
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,218
I thought you're asleep.

517
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:33,938
Doing what?

518
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,800
You have to spell it out.

519
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,499
You know, that.

520
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,719
What do you think?

521
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,479
You want to talk to me
about Mom and Dad?

522
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,959
They're doing just fine.

523
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,239
We should be talking about you.

524
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,579
I've been so busy lately

525
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,418
so I didn't have time

526
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:51,519
to ask you.

527
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,458
How did you meet

528
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,999
that Jiang Hongbin?

529
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,499
After I finished

530
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,279
my Master's degree,

531
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,040
I went to his company

532
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:02,178
to apply for a gift design tender.

533
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:03,439
That's where I met him.

534
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,019
At the time,

535
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,199
I didn't have any other thoughts.

536
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,978
Judging from his age,

537
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:10,618
he must be married

538
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:12,080
and has kids.

539
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,679
Later,

540
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,360
a coincidence happened one day.

541
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,978
I went to an animal shelter

542
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,560
to do volunteer work

543
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,080
and I saw him.

544
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,938
(When I asked him,)

545
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:55,040
(I learned)

546
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,499
(that he's been donating)

547
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,339
(to that animal shelter)

548
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,439
(for charity.)

549
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:01,539
(So I thought)

550
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,919
(he was pretty loving and kind.)

551
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,840
(Later, we exchanged numbers.)

552
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:09,259
Then, he started

553
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,218
texting me like crazy.

554
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,378
He asked me out to eat,

555
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,019
and invited me to exhibitions
and what not.

556
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,919
That's how we got close.

557
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:18,059
Well, if you weren't

558
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,819
a pretty face with long, slender legs,

559
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,499
would he have been so forward
in asking you out

560
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,859
for meals and exhibitions?

561
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,819
Well, at first,

562
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,698
it's natural to be attracted by looks.

563
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:26,339
Am I right?

564
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,218
I'm sure he thought

565
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,138
I was pretty.

566
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:30,059
But later we started talking more

567
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,360
and got to know each other.

568
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,299
I learned that

569
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,080
he's actually an orphan.

570
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,840
When he was 13,

571
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,400
his parents died in an accident too.

572
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,759
They left behind

573
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:44,999
a sister who's five years younger.

574
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,199
They didn't have it easy.

575
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,418
So I thought it's pretty similar

576
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:50,840
to my own experience.

577
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:53,320
After hearing that,

578
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,640
I felt kind of sad for him.

579
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,919
It birthed in me

580
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,840
a feeling of wanting to protect him.

581
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,880
Stop right there.

582
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:09,579
You can tell me

583
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,579
when you've calmed down.

584
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,080
You sound a little excited.

585
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,199
I am calm.

586
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,259
Birthed in you

587
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,320
the feeling of wanting to protect him?

588
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,919
But it's true.

589
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,160
He looked so pitiful

590
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,759
when he said that.

591
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,400
Wait.

592
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,719
Does he look old

593
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,539
in person?

594
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,299
The posters

595
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,178
you showed us

596
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,458
must have been edited.

597
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:33,658
He's alright.

598
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:34,819
I mean it.

599
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,800
Because he works out.

600
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:39,978
How long have you two

601
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:41,120
been dating?

602
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,739
About half a year.

603
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,320
Only half a year?

604
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:44,819
Okay.

605
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,320
You can talk to me again
when it's one year.

606
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,919
Time won't clear away doubts.

607
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,499
Go to sleep.

608
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,679
Sleep.

609
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,120
(Pudong District Detention Center, Shanghai)

610
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,919
Come on out.

611
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,479
- Thanks.
- Mom!

612
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,840
Mom.

613
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,279
Had a fright, huh?

614
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,959
It's alright.

615
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,999
That felt like forever.

616
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:28,259
Let's go home.

617
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,360
Let's go home.

618
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,725
Mom, let's go and clean up
at my place first,

619
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:34,894
take a nap,

620
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,547
then we'll go home.

621
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,978
In the afternoon,

622
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:50,819
submit this test report

623
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,938
and you're done.

624
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:52,800
Okay, got it.

625
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,560
Miss Xiang.

626
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,880
Step out for a minute.

627
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,040
I'm working.

628
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,999
I'll wait downstairs.

629
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,218
Why did you peek at my statement?

630
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,479
Explain this.

631
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:13,698
You said

632
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:15,479
you lent the money to Qian Feng.

633
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:17,400
So what's this?

634
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,400
5,000, 10,000, 20,000.

635
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,120
Who's this person?

636
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,898
Are you gambling?

637
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:24,978
No.

638
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:25,739
I...

639
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,059
I can't explain it right now.

640
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,859
But you will.

641
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,859
Listen up.

642
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,400
Half of this money belonged to me.

643
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,059
I can't explain it right now!

644
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,360
Stop right there, Deng Haiyang!

645
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,658
Why is the door locked?

646
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,360
Get the key.

647
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,560
This is odd.
Dad knew Mom is coming home.

648
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:04,759
Where is he?

649
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,880
Maybe he doesn't want to see me.

650
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,279
No way.

651
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,178
You're back?

652
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:16,999
We're back.

653
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,819
Where's your mom?

654
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,120
Don't run. She's inside.

655
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:19,618
She's back?

656
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,719
I'm right here.

657
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,499
Why are you hiding?

658
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,658
Come out and let me look at you.

659
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:23,218
You come inside.

660
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:24,539
Let me take a look at you.

661
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,938
- You...
- What's wrong?

662
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:27,099
You've been cleared.

663
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,978
Dad.

664
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,099
- Dad.
- Come on.

665
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,739
Go inside.

666
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,898
Keep your voice down.

667
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:31,978
What's this?

668
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:33,959
Are you trying to tell the whole world?

669
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,539
You're fine.

670
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,479
Why are you so scared?
Let me look at you.

671
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,739
Had a tough time, huh?

672
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,099
I'm okay.

673
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,779
Sit down.

674
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,080
Come and sit.

675
00:25:56,899 --> 00:25:57,840
What's the matter?

676
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,040
I'm sorry.

677
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,040
No need to say sorry.

678
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:02,819
You love eating nuts, right?

679
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,479
There weren't much left at home

680
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,279
so I went to buy more.

681
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:07,779
I started running back after

682
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,739
because I knew,

683
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,378
if you didn't see me at home,

684
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:11,539
you'd feel anxious.

685
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,539
When I came in

686
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,299
and didn't see you,

687
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,880
I really got worried.

688
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,099
Gosh,

689
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,739
such a worry-wart.

690
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,218
You know,

691
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:20,339
while you were away these few days,

692
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,779
I was feeling so uneasy.

693
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,800
Really.

694
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,859
So next time,

695
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,978
don't be so naughty.

696
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:28,840
This home cannot be without you.

697
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,040
I've embarrassed you.

698
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,800
No such thing.

699
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,059
Tell me how you were in there.

700
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,439
I really knew nothing.

701
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,418
I know you didn't.

702
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:39,279
Come, now.

703
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,840
I really didn't know anything.

704
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,938
Okay, okay.

705
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,759
You've suffered.

706
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,279
Okay, don't feel bad.

707
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,279
Don't feel bad. Come here.

708
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,780
Xiang Zhong and Xiang Nan tidied up
the cupboards spick and span.

709
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,118
They said the oil used wasn't healthy.

710
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,419
So they switched to rapeseed oil.

711
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,999
Look. Everything is spanking clean.

712
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,260
How nice.

713
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,340
Look at this.

714
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,358
The bottom has rice, flour, foodstuff.

715
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,099
On the top are miscellaneous items.

716
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,580
Everything is labelled.

717
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,158
Fish, prawns, seafood.

718
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:26,638
The legumes are here.

719
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:28,838
They're all packed in containers.

720
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,679
Awesome, right?

721
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,459
Our two daughters.

722
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,500
They thought of everything, see?

723
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,318
Lamb, ribs, pork.

724
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,039
Yeah.

725
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,540
I didn't expect it.

726
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,479
I didn't expect it

727
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,220
to end up like this.

728
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,279
That Lin Shufen

729
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,398
did so much for our family.

730
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,859
Okay, enough.

731
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,699
Dad, Mom, I'm leaving.

732
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,540
We'll walk you out.

733
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,439
Sis, we must confront her

734
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,318
today,

735
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:53,999
okay?

736
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,619
We have to settle it today.

737
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,598
- There she is.
- Where are you going?

738
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,619
Stop right there!

739
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,999
What's going on?

740
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,899
Don't you dare go anywhere!

741
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,558
Stop!

742
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,899
What's going on?

743
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,999
What's up, madams?

744
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,179
Is there a problem?

745
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,199
Mrs. Xiang,

746
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,519
why are you hiding at the back?

747
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,040
Come out.

748
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,439
You think you can fix the problem
by hiding at the back? Get out here.

749
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,078
Yeah, come out.

750
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,318
Get out here, you!

751
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,318
Hang on.

752
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,279
Calm down.

753
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,199
Explain it to me.

754
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,719
Madams,

755
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,759
my mom just went through an ordeal.

756
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,838
I'm the oldest of the family.

757
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,598
You can talk to me

758
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,598
if there's a problem.

759
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,838
My husband

760
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,318
is an honest man.

761
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,439
After meeting your mom,

762
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,199
he's constantly

763
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,820
running off to that salon.

764
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,279
Now the whole street

765
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,039
knows.

766
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,878
Tell me. How am I

767
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:31,099
supposed to live?

768
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,398
How is she going to live?

769
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:32,919
Yeah.

770
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,158
I...

771
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:34,439
Friends, family, strangers.

772
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,519
I've lived a good, honest life.

773
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,439
I'm 60.

774
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,199
How am I

775
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,798
supposed to explain it
to my daughter?

776
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,558
That's right.

777
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,558
My sister

778
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,999
is close to 60.

779
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,679
I mean,

780
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,598
she is a little extravagant.

781
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,638
But not to the extent

782
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:46,479
of visiting those places.

783
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,318
That's right.

784
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,820
After getting to know your mom,

785
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,279
she ended up...

786
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,759
I feel embarrassed
just thinking about it.

787
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,638
You know what?

788
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:53,939
The kids at home

789
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,719
keep asking where grandaunt
is off to every day.

790
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,798
How do I explain

791
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,479
to a six-year-old?

792
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,638
What am I supposed to say?

793
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,400
The kid is so young.
What is she supposed to say?

794
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,838
Wait, listen, madams. Please calm down.

795
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,179
I get it.

796
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,318
Your husband

797
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,039
goes out and spends money every day.

798
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,158
Your sister goes out
to make money every day.

799
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:10,479
That's their private affairs.

800
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,638
Why don't you go back and ask them?

801
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:13,118
What has this got to do with my mom?

802
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,878
- Why are you shoving the blame on my mom?
- This has everything to do with her.

803
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,519
- Don't shirk responsibilities!
- Yeah.

804
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,820
They're all victims here.

805
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:19,239
Yes.

806
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,699
Your mom is a pander, no doubt about it!

807
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,980
She should be ashamed of herself!

808
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:23,759
Who are you accusing?

809
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,318
How dare you!

810
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,239
Don't simply accuse!

811
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,580
Who should be ashamed?

812
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,260
Get away!

813
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,598
What?

814
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,300
You people are blocking the entrance
and causing a scene!

815
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,780
You want to get physical?

816
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,439
What your family members do every day,

817
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,439
where they spend their time,
what mental support they need,

818
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,580
you can find out back home!

819
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,459
They're not blameless!

820
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,099
Okay.

821
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,398
Trying to reason with us,

822
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,300
huh?

823
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,260
Well, I don't have any reason.

824
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,078
My reputation has been ruined anyway.

825
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:00,519
From now on,

826
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,798
I'll make sure you guys suffer as well.

827
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,999
Yes! We'll suffer together!

828
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,999
Enough with the ruckus!

829
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,199
I'll say this one last time.

830
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,859
My mom is also a victim.

831
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,199
If you people

832
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,078
dare come make trouble
at our house again,

833
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,679
punching, splashing dirty water,

834
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,959
then I'm calling the police.

835
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,260
We can settle this in court.

836
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,798
Settle in court?

837
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,659
How about it?

838
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,020
Fine, you're not scaring us.

839
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:40,772
Are the kids asleep?

840
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:41,452
Yes.

841
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,340
Any instructions?

842
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,598
I'd like to get my parents

843
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,139
to stay here a few days.

844
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:52,959
Because their neighbors

845
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,260
and village folks

846
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,139
have all heard about what happened.

847
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,519
I can't have Mom

848
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,139
hole up at home day in, day out.

849
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,260
Get them here then.

850
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,580
Why?

851
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,300
I wanted to ask you.

852
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,740
Since when have I been the one to decide?

853
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:14,099
It's your call.

854
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,500
Why don't I go fetch them tomorrow?

855
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,358
You're busy with work.

856
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,859
It's not good to keep taking days off.

857
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:30,379
I'm free anyway.

858
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,060
Love you.

859
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,619
Love you.

860
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,020
Mom.

861
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,959
Gao Ping.

862
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,558
I'm here.

863
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,519
Gosh,

864
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,838
you must be busy with your thesis.

865
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,358
We shouldn't have made you come.

866
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,358
It's okay, I insisted.

867
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,260
Where's Dad?

868
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:57,239
He went out for a morning drink.

869
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,340
Gu and the rest started asking all sorts

870
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,459
and it made him upset.

871
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,859
He's inside.

872
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,060
Have you packed everything?

873
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,878
Yes. We finished packing in the morning.

874
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:07,439
Go and grab them,

875
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,358
then we can go.

876
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,619
Xiang.

877
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,899
Gao Ping is here.

878
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,199
Gao Ping is here?

879
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,099
Dad.

880
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,279
Gao Ping.

881
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,398
Come, sit down.

882
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,020
Okay.

883
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,638
Here's some tea.

884
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:21,459
Feel free.

885
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,318
Okay.

886
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,179
Have tea.

887
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,919
It's okay,

888
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,699
I'll do it.

889
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,740
What's the matter?
You seem to be in a bad mood.

890
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,659
It's just gossip.

891
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,939
You know what?

892
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,260
My cousin in Kunshan, her husband

893
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:42,099
almost died from eating lamb.

894
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,199
He died?

895
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,318
He's at the brink of death.

896
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,580
They're giving him emergency treatment
at the hospital.

897
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,220
Right.

898
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,099
Funny how news travel so fast.

899
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,780
Last night, the old ladies
at the neighborhood were talking about it.

900
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,919
You know what?

901
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,078
My cousin in Kunshan, her husband

902
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,838
got arrested for pornography.

903
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,300
Arrested for pornography?

904
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,039
The worst thing is that the perpetrators

905
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,939
are elderly people.

906
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,959
They're mostly

907
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,679
retired workers from the silk factory.

908
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,740
Retired workers from the silk factory?

909
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,279
So they're about our age?

910
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,671
How could they do such a thing?

911
00:33:14,672 --> 00:33:16,999
I heard them mention
about the retired silk factory workers.

912
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,886
She cried her eyes out.

913
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:19,279
And it somehow reminded me
of this incident.

914
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,398
At such a ripe age,

915
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,099
they should have more self-love.

916
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,659
The news spread to your neighborhood?

917
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,239
Yeah,

918
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,439
I don't know how.

919
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,679
Was it that serious?

920
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,780
It's spreading like...

921
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,439
It's okay though.

922
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,279
Don't let it get to you.

923
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,959
We're a family.

924
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,260
We're tough.

925
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,659
You wait here.

926
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,740
Xiaolan.

927
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,400
- Come here.
- Coming.

928
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,039
- Help me look for something.
- What is it?

929
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,340
Help me look for something.

930
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,279
I've packed all the things.

931
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,340
They're here.

932
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,580
Listen to me.

933
00:33:59,079 --> 00:33:59,798
I don't think

934
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,580
we should go stay at Xiang Qian's.

935
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,980
Why?

936
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:03,980
Why?

937
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,820
People here point fingers
and talk about us, that's fine.

938
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,679
If we go to their place,

939
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,540
people might talk bad about

940
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,118
Xiang Qian and Gao Ping

941
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,959
behind their backs.

942
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,180
That's not right, is it?

943
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,379
Their two kids are young.

944
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,959
You can't expect her to take the flak

945
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,519
because of us,

946
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,158
right?

947
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,100
Okay.

948
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,439
Gao Ping.

949
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,300
Dad.

950
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,519
I spoke

951
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,820
with your mom.

952
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,340
We've decided

953
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,419
not to stay at your place.

954
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,899
We'll stay here.

955
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,499
What's the matter?

956
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,598
It's nothing.

957
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,260
Our own house is more comfortable.

958
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,278
No, Dad.

959
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,558
Xiang Qian is concerned about you.

960
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,799
Besides, you've already agreed.

961
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,638
If you don't go,

962
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,919
how am I supposed to explain?

963
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,100
Thank you both.

964
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,238
Just tell her

965
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,439
we've decided not to go.

966
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,379
We can discuss another time, okay?

967
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,620
There.

968
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,220
How come Mom and Dad didn't come?

969
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,019
They decided not to.

970
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,780
From their words, it sounded like
they didn't want to implicate the kids.

971
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,598
The matter is being investigated.

972
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,019
It's not some social news.

973
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,379
How would that implicate the kids?

974
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,479
I mean,

975
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,479
it makes sense that

976
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,700
they're concerned.

977
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,839
You rarely hear of good things,

978
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,919
but bad news travel fast.

979
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,839
People downstairs are already talking.
Don't forget about the neighborhood children.

980
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,519
What if Cong and Qi

981
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,039
overheard while playing downstairs?

982
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,419
That's hurtful to the kids.

983
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,758
That's odd.

984
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,959
Why would people in our neighborhood

985
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,340
know about the incident?

986
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,260
I'll go and see them tomorrow.

987
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,059
So,

988
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,100
I bought vegetarian buns for you.

989
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,140
No thanks.

990
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,939
About the money,

991
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,278
I'll find a way to resolve it.

992
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,799
Don't ask me how.

993
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,620
Just give me some time, okay?

994
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,979
Am I not supposed to ask even when

995
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,539
you used it on fun and games?

996
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,238
I didn't drink, eat,

997
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,999
get a prostitute, gamble nor smoke.

998
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,100
Okay?

999
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,220
Then why did you send them so much money?

1000
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,539
For charity?

1001
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:50,859
I need the bathroom.

1002
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,059
What do you want this time?
Stop calling me!

1003
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,078
But I miss you.

1004
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,899
I can't help but call you.

1005
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,539
Listen up.

1006
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,220
I have no more money.

1007
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,939
Bro,

1008
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,140
is your wife named Xiang Zhong?

1009
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,158
If you don't pay up,

1010
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,799
I'll send the photos to your wife.

1011
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,939
I'm warning you.

1012
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,340
Don't you force me.

1013
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,539
(You dare hang up on me?)

1014
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,479
(Deng Haiyang.)

1015
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,740
(You think I'm a pushover?)

1016
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,979
(Just you wait.)

1017
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,300
(You got yourself into this crap.)

1018
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,539
So this is where
you spent all the money?

1019
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,579
It was one time, I swear.

1020
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,399
Last year, Qian Feng

1021
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,758
and a few buddies,

1022
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:09,399
we went out

1023
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,678
and drank too much.

1024
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,379
We couldn't sleep that night
and so I simply downloaded an APP.

1025
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,479
I had a little chat.

1026
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,359
I didn't know that the APP

1027
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,839
was a phishing APP.

1028
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,238
I was drunk so I went to the bathroom
and then all my video clips,

1029
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,439
photos in the phone,

1030
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,039
call records and chat logs got copied.

1031
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,278
They used it to threaten me.

1032
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:30,399
And if I didn't pay them,

1033
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,319
they'd post my photos

1034
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,999
and my data on the Internet.

1035
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,758
So I panicked.

1036
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:35,519
I was scared.

1037
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,019
I thought a few thousand yuan
would settle it.

1038
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:39,879
I mean, it's quite embarrassing.

1039
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,758
But then,

1040
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:41,839
they kept going at it.

1041
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,340
I didn't have any choice.

1042
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,100
Do you think I'd believe you again?

1043
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:51,078
If you don't believe me,

1044
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,919
next time he calls, you can answer it.

1045
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,340
You ask him.

1046
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,718
Okay. We'll make
a police report tomorrow.

1047
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,740
Don't do that.

1048
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,100
Xiaosi is a cop.

1049
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,198
If he learns about this...

1050
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,319
This stuff about me,

1051
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,620
and see my photos...

1052
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,399
That's just embarrassing.
How am I supposed to face my friends?

1053
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,180
Now you care about your face?

1054
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,300
What about when
you were chatting them up?

1055
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,078
Listen, Xiang Zhong.

1056
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,479
You're being really unreasonable,

1057
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,419
you know?

1058
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,078
Why did I chat people up?

1059
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,278
At home, you're always

1060
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:28,558
giving me the cold shoulder.

1061
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,419
As if I'm invisible.

1062
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,558
You never did your part as the good wife.

1063
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,278
I'm over 30, a grown man,
and I'm like a mute when I come home.

1064
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:37,479
So I wanted someone to talk to.

1065
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,799
What's wrong with that?

1066
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,660
Do you really not know your own problem?

1067
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,979
You don't brush your teeth, you don't shower,
and you expect us to be lovey-dovey?

1068
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,419
What do you take me for?

1069
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,220
A garbage disposer?

1070
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,220
What about Qian Feng and Skinny?

1071
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,319
They're married too and have kids.

1072
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,118
They don't complain.

1073
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,278
How come their wives

1074
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:55,439
aren't as picky?

1075
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,260
Fine.

1076
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,319
Go ahead and be with whoever you want.

1077
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,118
I'm done.

1078
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,780
I'm so done with you.

1079
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,758
Better yet

1080
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,220
if they can give you a kid.

1081
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,479
Deng Haiyang, I don't care
that you treat yourself horribly,

1082
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,100
But don't expect me to be horrible too.

1083
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:45,080
♪A sleepless night
watching the fishing lights♪

1084
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,140
I prepared this for you.

1085
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,019
What is it?

1086
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,700
Next year is your full cycle year.

1087
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,100
You can give it to me next year.

1088
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,700
And this.

1089
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,859
These are your dad's and my savings,

1090
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,140
together with the passcodes.

1091
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,678
Keep them well.

1092
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,638
There's not much money,

1093
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,319
but I figured if we did move

1094
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,340
and this house gets sold,

1095
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,100
I'll save the money in here.

1096
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,700
Your father

1097
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,579
has a soft spot for Xiang Nan.

1098
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,558
That's because

1099
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,459
she had a bad start in life, no?

1100
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,780
Don't think too much.

1101
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,220
As for Xiang Zhong,

1102
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,939
she has a bad temper.

1103
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,780
No need to argue with her.

1104
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,399
It's just that, when I'm gone,

1105
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,419
she's the one I'm worried about.

1106
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,740
Hang on, where are you going?

1107
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,678
Recently,

1108
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,340
I can't seem to fall asleep.

1109
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,198
When I think I'm asleep,

1110
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,899
I suddenly wake up again.

1111
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:00,379
I feel like...

1112
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,700
Your dad has always

1113
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,220
been a prideful man.

1114
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,638
Because of what happened with me,

1115
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,078
he can't even hold his head up

1116
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,740
in front of others.

1117
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:14,140
I've caused you guys shame too.

1118
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,479
Such a good family

1119
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,620
is in a mess because of me.

1120
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,859
Stop talking nonsense.

1121
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,919
The incident happened

1122
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,260
and it's already been resolved.

1123
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,198
Yeah, I never expected

1124
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,598
things to turn out

1125
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,660
like this.

1126
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,238
What's happened has happened.
Just let it go.

1127
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:33,919
Everybody knows

1128
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,359
about the situation.

1129
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,238
I can't explain it

1130
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,979
to everyone.

1131
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,019
There's no need to explain.

1132
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,180
Maybe I should die.

1133
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,198
Stop talking nonsense,

1134
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,660
will you?
