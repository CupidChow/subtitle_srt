=Episode 19=

4
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:00,666
Got it, it's open.

5
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,306
Okay, thanks.

6
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:03,347
There's someone at home.

7
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:04,826
This elderly has dementia.

8
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:05,386
She can't open the door.

9
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:06,466
Who did you say have dementia?

10
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:06,906
You.

11
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:07,707
Okay, since you paid,

12
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:08,307
I'm going to go.

13
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,027
Thanks.

14
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:10,586
Hey, you...

15
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,546
Pretty strong, huh?

16
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,907
That darn old witch.

17
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,627
Bai Lifang, you have two choices.

18
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,027
One, I throw your things out.

19
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,027
Or two, you move out of here.

20
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:36,266
Put my things back in the room.

21
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,347
I'm sleeping there.

22
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:41,227
What are you doing?

23
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:42,586
I'm telling you right now.

24
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:43,747
Get out of my house!

25
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,187
This house belongs to Deng Haiyang.

26
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:47,546
I have every right to stay.

27
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:48,866
Why does it belong to Deng Haiyang?

28
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,706
My parents paid 60 percent

29
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:51,586
of the down payment.

30
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,347
I paid more than half
of the monthly payments.

31
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:54,546
With Deng Haiyang's lousy salary,

32
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:55,826
he couldn't even afford
half the bathroom!

33
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,106
Tell me, how does that
make it your house?

34
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,067
You paid the monthly payments, huh?

35
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,266
If I hadn't helped you get the job,

36
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:01,227
where would you have the money to pay?

37
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,067
That lousy job?

38
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:03,067
You think I'm happy to do it?

39
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:04,227
Do it then.

40
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:06,266
Right now, this moment, quit the job.

41
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:07,347
Okay, I will.

42
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:08,067
Get out.

43
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:08,747
I...

44
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:09,907
In your dreams.

45
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:10,947
If I leave,

46
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,546
you're going to hog this house.

47
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:13,706
Listen up, Xiang Zhong.

48
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:14,666
I don't care if you quit your job.

49
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:15,826
As long as you want a divorce,

50
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,386
it's not up to you to decide

51
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:19,027
who gets the house.

52
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:20,146
It's also not up to you

53
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:21,706
whether I stay

54
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:22,426
or leave.

55
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:23,146
Okay.

56
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,586
You listen to me.

57
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,386
Very soon,

58
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,467
someone's going to help you leave.

59
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:27,666
Sure, I'm waiting for it.

60
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:29,507
Let me see what you have.

61
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:37,826
Hello, officers.

62
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:38,586
Who's Xiang Zhong?

63
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:39,507
That's me.

64
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:40,586
Did you call the police?

65
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,307
Yes, I did.

66
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:42,467
What's the situation?

67
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:43,187
Let's talk inside.

68
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:44,787
Look.

69
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:45,467
There's this old lady in my house,

70
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:46,546
but I don't know her.

71
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:47,627
She seems to be mad

72
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:48,546
and refuses to leave.

73
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:49,106
Okay.

74
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:50,027
Wait a second, please.

75
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,467
Mr. Officer.

76
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:53,666
Listen,

77
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,067
you can't take her word for it.

78
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:55,787
You know,

79
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:57,266
you have to investigate
the truth, right?

80
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:58,467
Let's be reasonable.

81
00:03:58,507 --> 00:03:59,227
- It's about reason.
- Yes.

82
00:03:59,347 --> 00:03:59,866
Right?

83
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:00,507
Officers.

84
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:01,986
Look, this is my ID card,

85
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,067
household registration permit
and my house ownership card.

86
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:03,586
My name

87
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:04,546
is written on the ownership card.

88
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:05,347
This is my house.

89
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,266
Officer,

90
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,666
don't listen to her nonsense.

91
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:09,907
I am her mother-in-law.

92
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:10,826
I'm here to see my son.

93
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,187
I have a right to be here.

94
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:14,266
Please show us your ID.

95
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:21,706
Here.

96
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:22,627
My name.

97
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,786
My ID card.

98
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:33,146
The household registration permit
only has the names

99
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,026
Xiang Zhong and Deng Haiyang.

100
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,226
Your name isn't on it.

101
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:36,427
How can you prove

102
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,187
you two's relationship?

103
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:38,107
Deng Haiyang.

104
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:39,466
That's my son.

105
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,026
Where is he?

106
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:42,307
He... He's in the hospital.

107
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:43,067
We need proof

108
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:43,906
to show he's your son.

109
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:44,826
Wait.

110
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:45,987
I gave birth to him.

111
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:47,826
How do you want me to prove it?

112
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,466
Ma'am,

113
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:49,747
this is normal

114
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:50,386
police procedure.

115
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:51,667
Please understand.

116
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:54,307
I'll call him.

117
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:57,266
Make a record.

118
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:02,627
I'm calling him now.

119
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:10,947
Pick up.

120
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,627
He's not answering.

121
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:15,307
Hello.

122
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:16,187
The number you have dialed

123
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,786
cannot be reached.

124
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:30,146
(Bai Lifang)
Mr. Officer.

125
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:31,466
Why would I have her number

126
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:33,107
if I didn't know her?

127
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:35,107
You have Xiang Zhong's number,

128
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:36,266
but that doesn't prove

129
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:37,466
you're Deng Haiyang's mother.

130
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:38,427
What?

131
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:39,747
Officer,

132
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,067
are you telling me to go home

133
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:42,706
and look for my son's birth certificate?

134
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:43,627
Is that what you're saying?

135
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:44,906
Go on then.

136
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:46,667
Officer,

137
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,547
take a look at this.

138
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:50,187
You want to make a scene?
Talking nonsense,

139
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,867
writing posters, are you? Fine.

140
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:52,706
Head to the streets,...

141
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,146
That's you two in the video, right?

142
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,947
That's me, yes.

143
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:57,947
If what the video shows is true,

144
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:58,667
and

145
00:05:58,706 --> 00:05:59,466
you can prove

146
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,586
that you're Deng Haiyang's mother,

147
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:01,627
then this will be

148
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,466
considered as a domestic dispute.

149
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:03,867
The solution is for you two

150
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:04,826
to calm yourselves down

151
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,026
and have a proper talk.

152
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:07,107
I can't talk to her.

153
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,187
Is either of you hurt?

154
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:11,547
Hurt? Who got hurt?

155
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:13,226
No one is hurt. Everybody's fine.

156
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:14,627
Are you hurt?

157
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,346
No.

158
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,466
In this situation,

159
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,226
we're hoping you two

160
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:21,386
could sit down

161
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,747
and sort through the misunderstandings.

162
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:25,346
If need be,

163
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:27,146
you could ask other family members
or friends

164
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,146
to be the facilitator.

165
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:29,307
There are also social workers

166
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:30,586
or neighborhood committee

167
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,466
that can provide counseling.

168
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:33,427
Yes,

169
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:34,586
feel free to approach us.

170
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:35,826
As for

171
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:36,867
the house occupation,

172
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,067
we hope you two

173
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:39,667
can resolve it reasonably.

174
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,187
In such a case,

175
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,026
we can't simply

176
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:42,706
apprehend anyone.

177
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:43,466
Right?

178
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:44,826
Here, have a read.

179
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:45,627
If it's okay,

180
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:46,826
please sign your name.

181
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,346
Here is your ID card.

182
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:51,466
I'll say it again.

183
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:52,586
You're family.

184
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,346
Why make the relationship so awkward,

185
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:55,346
right?

186
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,586
Talk to each other.

187
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:57,906
That wraps it up.

188
00:06:57,987 --> 00:06:58,786
We'll go now.

189
00:06:59,146 --> 00:06:59,786
Thank you.

190
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:00,867
Your things are here.

191
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:01,987
Thanks for coming.

192
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:06,226
Victory.

193
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,067
You're still too green to beat me.

194
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:14,947
Let's see who beats who in the end.

195
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:31,667
Lock it.

196
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:33,307
Lock it properly.

197
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:35,507
Lock all the doors.

198
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,547
Every single one.

199
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:37,906
I'm going to stay here

200
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:38,906
even if you look everything.

201
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:40,906
Let's see how long you can last.

202
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:03,146
Driver! Driver!

203
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,346
Li Shu.

204
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,067
Mrs. Gao.

205
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:39,027
You just got off work?

206
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,067
I can take you to
the subway station on the way.

207
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:44,346
It's okay.

208
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,147
The bus will be here soon.

209
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,226
Get in.

210
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:49,506
I'd like to talk to you.

211
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:07,187
Mrs. Gao.

212
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,027
I know you're busy with work.

213
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:10,106
I just want to say,

214
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:11,466
if you have the time,

215
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:12,746
you should show more concern

216
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:13,626
to Gao Ping.

217
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,027
Did he

218
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:16,826
drink a lot last night?

219
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,427
Last night, Dayuan treated us to dinner.

220
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,106
He officially signed

221
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,626
a tripartite residency agreement.

222
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:30,706
I mean, Dayuan

223
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,187
isn't as skilled as Gao Ping,

224
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,466
nor is he as nice.

225
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:35,267
We all thought

226
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,267
it was unfair.

227
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,586
Our department is well equipped
with both hardware

228
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,466
and software.

229
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,787
For someone as talented as Gao Ping,

230
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:41,667
if he had gotten the residency,

231
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,106
he would've achieved a lot more.

232
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:46,106
It's too bad.

233
00:09:48,106 --> 00:09:49,667
Gao Ping might say it doesn't matter.

234
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:50,706
But I'm sure

235
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,027
he's upset about it.

236
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:55,547
Mrs. Gao,

237
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,866
you can drop me by the roadside.

238
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,626
I can cross the road.

239
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:17,626
Xiang Qian.

240
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,307
Did you want to talk to me

241
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:23,506
because you wanted me to leave?

242
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:25,586
Li Shu,

243
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,387
I'd like to thank you

244
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,187
for tutoring my kids.

245
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,427
Thank you for your concern for Gao Ping.

246
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,586
And thank you for liking the kids.

247
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,106
But for me,

248
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:39,986
I don't really like it

249
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,826
when there are
too many surprises in my life.

250
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:43,547
I'm just

251
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,027
a very normal person.

252
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:47,746
What I want is a quiet, uneventful life.

253
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,746
Do you understand?

254
00:10:59,226 --> 00:10:59,947
Yes.

255
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:01,506
Just the same,

256
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:02,706
I'd like to thank you.

257
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,986
Thank you for accepting me.

258
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:06,826
I really enjoyed

259
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:07,907
the time I spent at your house.

260
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,626
I really like your family.

261
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:13,466
I'll be off then, Mrs. Gao.

262
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:14,506
Bye-bye.

263
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:15,147
Thank you.

264
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:43,866
You spoke to Li Shu?

265
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:48,866
I'll look for a male junior

266
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:49,746
after this.

267
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:52,427
Less problems.

268
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,506
Why did you look

269
00:11:58,547 --> 00:11:59,746
for Li Shu in the first place then?

270
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:03,466
Because she showed a lot of interest.

271
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,187
And she was serious.

272
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,267
But most importantly,

273
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,547
I thought she was a lot like me.

274
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:15,547
We're trying to change our destiny

275
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:16,787
with our own hands.

276
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:20,267
Maybe that's the reason why

277
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,106
I'm biased toward her.

278
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:27,307
More importantly,

279
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:30,427
I hope...

280
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:33,427
I don't want you to pity her.

281
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:34,986
Because I believe

282
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,106
she's like me.

283
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,346
We hate being pitied.

284
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:46,267
Xiang Qian.

285
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:50,586
I'm already over 30.

286
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:53,947
I know the kind of person I am.

287
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,466
And I know what it is I want.

288
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,626
Have a bit more trust in me, okay?

289
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:22,346
Yu, I need a bucket of sand!

290
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:26,947
I need more bricks too.

291
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:27,947
Coming!

292
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:37,586
What are you people doing?

293
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,226
This is my house.

294
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:39,267
Who asked you to do this?

295
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:39,907
Stop it!

296
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:40,387
Give way.

297
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,027
- Mister.
- Stop building!

298
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:42,907
Stop the work.

299
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:43,547
Stop.

300
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:45,947
This is the boundary wall,

301
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,147
clear as day.

302
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,147
You won't let me use the bathroom

303
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:49,947
and kitchen, right?

304
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:51,387
Then you can forget leaving
through the main door.

305
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:53,706
Tear it down!

306
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,067
Are you superwoman?

307
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:56,787
Just you wait.

308
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:57,706
You think I can't climb

309
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:58,307
over it?

310
00:13:59,387 --> 00:13:59,986
Are you coming out?

311
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,427
Very good.

312
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:03,346
Come, I'll give you a hand.

313
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:03,986
Come out.

314
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:04,506
Get out of my way!

315
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:04,947
Look.

316
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:06,947
See how nice it is to be out here?

317
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:07,986
You could jump.

318
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:08,986
But if you jumped and got hurt,

319
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:10,547
you'd have to pay
for the medical bills yourself.

320
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,626
It's none of my business.

321
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,267
Come on, I'll help you.

322
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:16,346
Listen.

323
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:17,387
If you don't come out,

324
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,626
you'll be walled in.

325
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,307
You can't blame me

326
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,346
for not telling you sooner.

327
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:21,667
Are you stuck?

328
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:22,346
Okay.

329
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:23,187
If you're so smart,

330
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:24,626
I suppose you don't have
to use the bathroom, ever.

331
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:25,667
I can hold it in.

332
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:27,106
Come on

333
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,267
Right,

334
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,307
you could try

335
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,226
and call 110 again.

336
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,147
Call the police to come.

337
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:32,427
See what they'd do about it.

338
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,586
You old hag.

339
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,907
You're despicable!

340
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,506
Stop building the wall!
This is my house!

341
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:37,267
I'm filing a complaint!

342
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,226
Go ahead.

343
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:40,706
Better watch your backs!

344
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:45,466
Misters, continue.

345
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:50,787
Hold on, mister.

346
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:51,187
Yes.

347
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:52,106
Here's what to do.

348
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,267
After you finish...

349
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:54,226
After you break the window,

350
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,466
I need you to build me some steps.

351
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:56,067
Okay, no problem.

352
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,187
If you could add an awning on top,

353
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,267
that would make it easier for me.

354
00:14:58,387 --> 00:14:58,947
Thanks.

355
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,307
Stop the work!

356
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:01,427
- Miss!
- Stop the work!

357
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:02,147
What's wrong?

358
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:03,187
Any renovations

359
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,626
must be submitted
to the building management.

360
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:05,387
Then submit a request

361
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:06,187
for me.

362
00:15:06,387 --> 00:15:07,307
It has to be approved first

363
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,187
before work can commence.

364
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,346
But this is my courtyard.

365
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:10,626
It's not affecting other people.

366
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,547
Someone's building a wall in my house.

367
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:12,506
Why aren't you checking that?

368
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:15,226
We'll go and take a look in front.

369
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:15,907
Hurry up then.

370
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:16,427
Let's go.

371
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:17,307
Please continue, mister. Thanks.

372
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:18,307
Okay, will do.

373
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:19,147
Do a good job, please.

374
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:19,866
Sure, no problem.

375
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:20,506
Take care.

376
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,626
I'm building a wall in my own house.

377
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:25,626
That's not against the rules, right?

378
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:26,547
No, it's not.

379
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,986
If there's a problem between you two,

380
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:28,986
you can ask the neighborhood committee

381
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,027
to conduct mediation.

382
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:31,986
There's no need to go to such extreme.

383
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:33,466
If I'm being extreme,

384
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:34,506
it's because she made me.

385
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:36,667
She called the police the last time.

386
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:37,626
You were here too, right?

387
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:39,226
This can't be mediated.

388
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:40,027
Besides,

389
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,427
she locked the bathroom
and kitchen doors

390
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:42,027
to prevent me

391
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:42,746
from using.

392
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,387
So why should I let her use
the main door?

393
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:45,027
No way.

394
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:45,907
Mister.

395
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:46,826
Please stack it up

396
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:47,706
all the way to this height.

397
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:48,746
Block it completely.

398
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:50,826
Hang on a minute, ma'am.

399
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,187
Let me talk to her.

400
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:54,826
Come on.

401
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:58,187
Hey.

402
00:15:58,547 --> 00:15:59,067
Miss.

403
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,706
Your mother-in-law said she couldn't use

404
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,226
the bathroom and kitchen

405
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,027
because you locked them.

406
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:04,746
That's not very nice.

407
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:05,746
You do know

408
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:07,106
that my name is on the ownership card.

409
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:08,106
This is my house.

410
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,307
She's the one refusing to leave.

411
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:10,427
She even changed the lock.

412
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:11,267
You tell her.

413
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:12,626
Yes, okay.

414
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:13,826
I'll talk to her.

415
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:17,866
Your daughter-in-law said

416
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:19,106
her name is on the ownership card.

417
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:20,027
This is her house.

418
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:21,866
So... she has the right to stay.

419
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:23,547
This is my son's house.

420
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:24,947
Why can't I stay here?

421
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:27,187
Right, okay.

422
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,387
Go ask her.

423
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,826
What kind of mother-in-law
stays with the son

424
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,346
without first asking
the daughter-in-law?

425
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:33,907
It's not like I didn't want

426
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:35,067
to ask the daughter-in-law.

427
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:35,866
But look at her.

428
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:37,787
Is she a qualified daughter-in-law?

429
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,427
Sure, I'm not qualified.

430
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:41,106
In her eyes, no one is qualified.

431
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:42,667
No one is good enough for his son.

432
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:45,226
Are you a qualified mother-in-law then?

433
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:46,826
Gosh...

434
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,506
This is between you two.

435
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,427
Don't make it difficult for us.

436
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,346
Go tell her.

437
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:52,427
If she tears down the wall,

438
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,307
I'll stop the construction.

439
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:54,387
Ask her to move out.

440
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:55,387
Then I'll tear it down.

441
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:55,986
There's no way.

442
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:57,187
If anyone is to move, it'd be her.

443
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:57,986
This is my house.

444
00:16:58,787 --> 00:16:59,586
No way.

445
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:00,947
I'm not moving.

446
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,106
I will never move.

447
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:11,706
Wait, I need a break.

448
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:15,147
Here.

449
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:16,786
Thanks.

450
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:19,387
Are you married?

451
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:20,746
No.

452
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:21,827
You still want to?

453
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:24,546
Yes.

454
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,066
Morning, pretties.

455
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:32,706
Good morning.

456
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:33,306
Morning.

457
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:34,187
Xiang Nan.

458
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:36,546
I went to my rent today

459
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,066
but the management said it's been paid.

460
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,387
Jiang probably paid it.

461
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:42,587
That's great.

462
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:43,827
But, Xiang Nan,

463
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:44,947
aren't you going to double down

464
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,026
on your stance

465
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:46,867
with Jiang?

466
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:47,466
Double down?

467
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:48,947
Why would she do that?

468
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:50,387
Why be enemies with money?

469
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:51,506
Am I right?

470
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:59,347
Alright, don't let it get to you.

471
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:00,427
Just accept reality.

472
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:02,427
Time to work.

473
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:11,907
Xiang Nan.

474
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:12,627
Hello?

475
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,427
Your dad left the hospital again.

476
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,427
I happened to run into him.

477
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:16,706
He said he's going to Xiang Zhong's.

478
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,266
I got Wang to go pick you up.

479
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:19,947
We should go and take a look.

480
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:25,827
Okay.

481
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:31,827
Excuse me, please make way. Thanks.

482
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:32,986
We are from the TV station.

483
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:34,506
Cameraman!

484
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,706
Why are there so many people?

485
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,026
What's going on?

486
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:42,947
Even a TV reporter

487
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:43,546
showed up?

488
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,587
Is Xiang Zhong inside?

489
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:46,907
I'll... I'll call her.

490
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:48,627
You two, wait for me here.

491
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,066
I'll go check it out.

492
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:49,627
No, stop.

493
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:50,867
Stay put.

494
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,466
I'll go and take a look, okay?

495
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,427
I'll check it out first.

496
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:54,306
You can't go by yourself.

497
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:54,746
We came...

498
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:55,387
We're already here.

499
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,466
No, don't. Listen to me.

500
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,587
Let me get a hold of Zhong

501
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:58,306
and find out

502
00:18:58,306 --> 00:18:59,226
what's going on.

503
00:18:59,466 --> 00:18:59,986
Okay, Mom?

504
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:01,546
Look after Dad.

505
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:02,827
Make sure he doesn't get involved

506
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:03,546
in case he hurt his back again.

507
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:04,627
I'll go and take a look.

508
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:05,226
You two stay here.

509
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:06,546
Be careful, you hear?

510
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,187
Zhong, what's going on?

511
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:14,026
There's a crowd

512
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:14,867
in front of your house.

513
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,107
I'm going over.

514
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:16,706
Stay here!

515
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:17,986
I'm going to take a look.

516
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,387
Xiang Nan told you to stay put.

517
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:19,907
Just listen to her.

518
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:20,466
You listen up.

519
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:21,387
I have to see what's up.

520
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,306
What is your problem? Hey!

521
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:24,627
Did you just hit me?

522
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:25,226
You...

523
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:25,667
Listen.

524
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:28,147
Call Xiang Qian.

525
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,667
Ask her to come. You stay here.

526
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,587
Fine, okay.

527
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:33,066
I'll call her.

528
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:33,907
Stop shooting.

529
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:34,746
Sorry, excuse me.

530
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:35,786
Excuse me.

531
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:36,587
This is my place.

532
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,187
Stop shooting!

533
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:38,947
Sorry.

534
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:40,306
The number you've dialed cannot...

535
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:41,667
Don't pass it to me.

536
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,827
Just leave her a message.

537
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:46,986
Okay, here.

538
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,746
Xiang Qian. Xiang Qian!

539
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:49,587
Call us back.

540
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:50,266
No.

541
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:51,387
Xiang Qian.

542
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,147
We are at Xiang Zhong's.

543
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:54,066
No need to call back.

544
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:54,587
Just get over here.

545
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,187
Right away.

546
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:56,986
Call us back. Call us!

547
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:57,907
Get over here!

548
00:19:58,107 --> 00:19:58,986
Call us back!

549
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:00,587
Call us, okay.

550
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,266
Stop shooting. Break it up.

551
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:03,107
As you were, people.

552
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:04,026
Go back home and eat.

553
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:05,347
Stop shooting. There's nothing to see.

554
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:06,427
Are you people

555
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,786
that interested
in such a trivial matter?

556
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:09,107
Break it up.

557
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:10,706
You there, stop filming.

558
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:11,506
Please leave.

559
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:12,986
Thanks for your cooperation.

560
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:14,306
Go on, break it up.

561
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:15,026
This is a family matter.

562
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:15,746
Don't be a busybody.

563
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,947
Go, leave, stop shooting.

564
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,587
According to the "Residential Interior
Design and Renovation Measures,"

565
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,226
Article 5, Clause 3,

566
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,546
It is prohibited to expand
the original door

567
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,986
and window sizes
on the load-bearing wall,

568
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,587
or demolish the brick balcony

569
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:30,746
and concrete walls.

570
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:32,026
If there is any violation,

571
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,427
the competent department
may order rectification

572
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,026
in accordance with Article 69

573
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:35,947
of the "Construction Project Quality

574
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:36,587
Management Regulations"

575
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:37,907
and impose a fine of not less

576
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:39,026
than 50,000 yuan
and not more than 100,000 yuan.

577
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,827
She only demolished a wall.

578
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:42,147
Isn't the fine too much?

579
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:43,587
It's against the rules,

580
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:44,867
hence the fine.

581
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,427
Okay, okay, no need
to lay it out for me.

582
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:47,706
I'll just close it back up.

583
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:48,466
Xiang Zhong,

584
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:50,266
come back and stay with us for now.

585
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:51,187
No thanks.

586
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,066
That's my house.

587
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:53,266
Why should I let
someone else stay in it?

588
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:55,627
So you're you going
to climb up and down every day?

589
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:57,306
I can climb. Treat it like a workout.

590
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:57,827
Listen.

591
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:58,827
Your divorce case

592
00:20:58,907 --> 00:20:59,827
and property dispute

593
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:00,947
will take another half a year.

594
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:02,306
Are you going to climb through windows
for six months?

595
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:03,466
I can climb for six months.

596
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:04,387
Even years.

597
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:05,026
I'm sure

598
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:06,107
I can take that old hag down.

599
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:07,026
That's enough.

600
00:21:07,026 --> 00:21:07,827
No taking down anyone.

601
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:09,026
Anyway,

602
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:11,266
since Xiang Qian and Xiang Nan are here,

603
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:13,066
I have something I'd like

604
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:14,306
to discuss with you all.

605
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:16,147
If Haiyang's family

606
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,147
insist on getting the house,

607
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:20,026
we'll let them have it.

608
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,387
I don't agree.

609
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:23,667
That's my house.

610
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:24,347
No...

611
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:25,867
Let me speak.

612
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:28,026
That old hag is a lunatic.

613
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:29,427
We won't be like her.

614
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:30,827
Just get the divorce formalized.

615
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,506
Previously, she caused a scene
at your office.

616
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,867
Now she's making a mess

617
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:34,466
of the house.

618
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:35,546
Who knows

619
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:36,746
what she's going to do tomorrow?

620
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:37,867
She's a lunatic? So am I.

621
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:38,667
Let's see who bests who.

622
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:39,347
Okay, okay.

623
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:39,947
Don't be crazy now.

624
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:40,746
Don't be crazy, you hear?

625
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:41,667
You keep doing this,

626
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:42,986
who...

627
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,427
who's going to marry you next time?

628
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:45,907
Do you care about having a family?

629
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:46,506
I mean,

630
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:47,907
how do you expect to continue
living in Kunshan?

631
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:48,427
Hang on.

632
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:49,667
Why do I have to get married again?

633
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:50,827
Can I not be married?

634
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:52,587
Must I stay in Kunshan?

635
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:53,827
Where do you want to go then?

636
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:55,907
I have something

637
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:56,667
to tell you guys too.

638
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,066
I submitted my resignation letter.

639
00:21:58,466 --> 00:21:59,266
Deng Haiyang's mom

640
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:00,746
kept using the job as a reason
to cut me down,

641
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:02,187
saying she's the one who got me the job.

642
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,387
I got in because I passed the interview.

643
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,587
What did it have to do with her?

644
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:05,506
Xiang Zhong,

645
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,147
don't you ever think of the outcome

646
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:08,667
before you do something?

647
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:09,786
Of course I do.

648
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,066
You're quitting

649
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:12,746
such a good job.

650
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:13,786
Where else do you expect

651
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:14,786
to find something better?

652
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:16,506
I've long been tired of this job.

653
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:17,187
What?

654
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:18,226
You think I can't find another job?

655
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:19,266
Am I that lousy?

656
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:20,147
You're over 30 years old.

657
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:20,627
Are you...

658
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,786
You need to have a backup plan!

659
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,187
Okay, let's all calm down.

660
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:24,706
Calm yourselves down.

661
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:25,066
You listen to me!

662
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:25,786
Go back there

663
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:26,746
and take back

664
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:27,427
the resignation letter!

665
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:29,147
You just think I'm incapable.

666
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,147
I'm not well educated,

667
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:31,066
I have no skills.

668
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:32,587
I'm just a good-for-nothing, right?

669
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:33,266
Don't say that.

670
00:22:33,546 --> 00:22:35,387
Dad is just thinking for your sake.

671
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,026
None of you are putting yourself

672
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:38,387
in my shoes.

673
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:39,706
Why can't you

674
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:40,667
respect my decision?

675
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,347
Why can't you support me?

676
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,347
It's like you're forcing me
to stay in Kunshan.

677
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:45,107
Hey,

678
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:45,947
watch what you're saying.

679
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:47,627
No one is forcing you
to stay in Kunshan.

680
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,026
You went to university

681
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:50,107
in Changchun, didn't you?

682
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:51,347
After graduating,

683
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:52,347
you wanted to work in Beijing,

684
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:53,706
and we all supported you.

685
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:54,867
It was your choice

686
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:55,907
to come back to Kunshan.

687
00:22:56,187 --> 00:22:56,786
I...

688
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:58,667
It's Deng Haiyang's fault.

689
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:00,506
Let's not start
shifting blame, Xiang Zhong.

690
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:02,306
Right now, you're not

691
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:03,387
a fresh graduate.

692
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:04,466
You're not starting from zero.

693
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:07,347
You've been working for years.

694
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:08,427
Now suddenly

695
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:10,827
you say you're quitting
and want to try other things?

696
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:12,466
The society is cruel.

697
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,266
You're going to have
to face so many challenges.

698
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:15,907
Dad is just worried for you, you know?

699
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:18,786
Fine.

700
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:20,226
Don't you worry.

701
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:21,627
Even if I get a job outside,

702
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:22,466
become a dishwasher,

703
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:23,147
I won't ask you guys

704
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:24,147
for money.

705
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:24,706
Zhong,

706
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,266
nowadays there are dishwashers.

707
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:27,546
They don't need you.

708
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:33,947
Shut your trap!

709
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,546
I just don't want her
to go wash dishes...

710
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:36,867
- Xiang Zhong!
- Hey...

711
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:37,587
Xiang Zhong!

712
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:39,066
Xiang...

713
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,147
Xiang Qian, this is...

714
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:42,466
I know, I know.

715
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:43,306
Xiang Qian.

716
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:44,387
Xiang Qian.

717
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,266
I'll go. Oh, right.

718
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:47,907
Xiang Nan, come with me.

719
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:49,147
Bring your bag.

720
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:51,466
Wait...

721
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:52,466
Hurry up, Xiang Nan.

722
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:53,266
I didn't get to eat.

723
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:10,587
Zhong.

724
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,066
Are you sure you want to quit?

725
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,347
Yeah,

726
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:16,107
even if Deng Haiyang's mom
didn't complain,

727
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,187
I would've still resigned.

728
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:20,107
The work just feels meaningless.

729
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:22,226
There's no future.

730
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:24,387
I don't want to just get by.

731
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:29,066
Xiang Zhong.

732
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:32,506
How much do you have in your savings?

733
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:34,627
Why?

734
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:35,786
You know,

735
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:37,387
just wanted to remind you.

736
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:39,746
That mother-in-law of yours.

737
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:41,506
She's an elderly woman.

738
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,867
She's a retiree living off her pension.

739
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:46,907
As for you?

740
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:48,266
You're quitting your job,

741
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,986
and you want to hold the fort at home.

742
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:51,627
How long can you last?

743
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:54,107
I'm not dumb.

744
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:55,746
I'm going to start applying for jobs.

745
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,306
Where at?

746
00:24:58,347 --> 00:24:59,187
I'm thinking

747
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,506
to do we-media that is related

748
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:02,907
to geography.

749
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,427
I don't really get it,

750
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:06,706
but I think you'll be good at it.

751
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:08,827
At least, it's better
than the current job.

752
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:13,387
Go then. Just do it.

753
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,147
Xiang Nan, help your second sister

754
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:18,746
prepare an eye-catching resume.

755
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:21,347
Didn't someone say something about

756
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:23,706
the immense work pressure

757
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:25,026
in the current society?

758
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:26,147
A person my age

759
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:27,147
would have trouble finding a job.

760
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:28,746
Xiang Zhong,

761
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,746
could you maybe take into consideration

762
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:33,347
my position in the family?

763
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:35,867
You want me to stand on your side
and argue with Dad?

764
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,827
What if they get a heart attack?

765
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:41,827
Whatever it is,

766
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:43,746
go forth and prosper, Zhong.

767
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:46,147
I'll take care of the resume for you.

768
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:47,226
Thanks.

769
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:48,986
You're welcome.

770
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:56,947
Zhong.

771
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:00,746
I'm not sure if you remember.

772
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:02,587
The day

773
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:04,107
Mom and Dad brought you home.

774
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,107
I got home from school,

775
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:07,907
reached the front door,

776
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,387
and saw Dad and Mom

777
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,107
holding a little skinny

778
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:12,066
and dark girl

779
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:13,427
waiting for me at the door.

780
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:15,986
When I went over,

781
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,026
Dad said,

782
00:26:17,907 --> 00:26:19,587
go on, call her big sister.

783
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:21,066
But she refused.

784
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:23,187
Really?

785
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:25,466
Then, he turned to me and said,

786
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:26,466
Xiang Qian.

787
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:27,867
From now on, you are the big sister

788
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:28,907
in this household.

789
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:30,387
You're responsible

790
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,506
in looking after
your two younger sisters.

791
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:33,546
When I heard that...

792
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:36,387
I was only a teenager.

793
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,706
I never said I wanted to take on
the responsibility.

794
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,347
The second year after you came home,

795
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,187
I'm not sure if you remember it.

796
00:26:46,427 --> 00:26:47,187
You definitely won't remember.

797
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:48,786
You were still suckling at the time.

798
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:50,986
Dad and Mom

799
00:26:51,187 --> 00:26:53,306
worked Monday to Friday.

800
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:55,147
On the weekends,

801
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:57,587
they'd set up a stall
at the park entrance.

802
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:00,107
They'd sell gloves, scarves

803
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:00,947
and what not.

804
00:27:01,907 --> 00:27:02,786
Just so that

805
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:04,627
they could give us a better life.

806
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:06,827
One dark, cloudy day,

807
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,746
I brought umbrellas for them.

808
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:11,786
Then whoosh,

809
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:12,667
a strong gust of wind.

810
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:13,706
And I saw

811
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,466
Mom and Dad frantically

812
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:17,746
grabbing at the scarves

813
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:19,187
and gloves,

814
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:20,627
worried about losing one.

815
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:27,667
It was...

816
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,147
When I saw that scene,

817
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:32,306
I thought to myself.

818
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,546
What can I do

819
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,107
to help lighten their load?

820
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:46,667
That's why

821
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,786
you turned into a little class monitor

822
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:48,907
keeping us in check.

823
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:50,266
After we finished school,

824
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,867
you'd plan our daily rosters,

825
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:52,907
- remember that?
- Yeah.

826
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:54,147
Qian, you might not know.

827
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,947
Back then, Zhong and I

828
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:57,387
were pretty scared of you.

829
00:27:57,746 --> 00:27:59,427
Mostly because you were so strict.

830
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:01,907
You'd check our homework every day.

831
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:03,226
You were more strict

832
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,347
than our teachers in school.

833
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:08,827
It's my first time
being the oldest sibling,

834
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:09,587
okay?

835
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,466
Who likes being the oldest?

836
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:13,427
How am I supposed to know
how to be the oldest?

837
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,026
The most common phrase

838
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:15,786
I hear is,

839
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:16,867
you're the oldest.

840
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,506
You have to be the role model.

841
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:19,427
You're the oldest.

842
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:20,187
You have to be

843
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:21,226
a role model for the other two.

844
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,187
What kind of role model?

845
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:22,907
No idea.

846
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:23,907
Seriously,

847
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:25,147
if not for you two,

848
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:25,986
I doubt

849
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:27,506
I would've studied as hard
when I was young.

850
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:29,187
Back then, I even took part

851
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:31,387
in the class leader election.

852
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:33,827
So,

853
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:35,066
you should thank us.

854
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:37,107
We were the ones who inspired you

855
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:38,867
to become a better version of yourself.

856
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:41,226
Thank you.

857
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,187
Yeah, thank you guys so much.

858
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,466
You're welcome.

859
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:45,147
It's what we do.

860
00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:48,187
It was exhausting.

861
00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:50,706
Why am I

862
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:52,066
telling you two this?

863
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:55,107
It's mainly spoken to Xiang Zhong.

864
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:57,107
Seriously,

865
00:28:57,827 --> 00:28:58,947
if you two had seen

866
00:28:59,066 --> 00:28:59,947
with me

867
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:01,066
how Dad and Mom were scrambling

868
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,107
in the wind,

869
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:03,226
you'd understand.

870
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:05,387
Now, you.

871
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:07,827
You're impatient and stubborn.

872
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:09,187
Who did you take after?

873
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:11,466
None other than Dad.

874
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,026
You've known him for 30 over years.

875
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:15,226
You should know how he is.

876
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,827
When he gets triggered
and starts nagging,

877
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,427
just keep quiet.

878
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,107
Right? He's only doing it for your sake.

879
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,427
Once he calms down,

880
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:23,546
it's all good, no?

881
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:25,187
Why must you talk back?

882
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,026
There's no point

883
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:27,746
in arguing,

884
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:28,627
am I right?

885
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:29,667
Besides,

886
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:30,706
they're worried

887
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:32,986
you resigned out of spite.

888
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:33,947
You know?

889
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,347
That you're digging your own grave.

890
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:37,786
But to me,

891
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,387
whether or not it's irrational,
just go ahead.

892
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:41,587
This time,

893
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,546
I have your back.

894
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:45,387
I support you.

895
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:47,466
I support you too.

896
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:55,706
You're a copycat.

897
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:56,867
Am I?

898
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,160
(Dearest, give me a bit more time. Very soon, I'll be divorced.)
(It'll be too late if it's not done by July. It won't take that long!)

899
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:25,107
What's the matter, Aunty?

900
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:28,986
Be careful.

901
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:42,387
I'm going to a resort

902
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,667
in Suzhou with my mentor

903
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:44,947
to go over my research.

904
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:46,506
Okay.

905
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:49,306
So...

906
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:52,506
Is Li Shu, that young lady, going too?

907
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:56,026
Gao Ping.

908
00:30:59,986 --> 00:31:01,627
Despite my lack of education,

909
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:02,827
I know that

910
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:05,066
people can't be without conscience.

911
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:05,986
What are you talking about?

912
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:09,466
I'm just joking around with a friend.

913
00:31:09,546 --> 00:31:10,587
Don't take it seriously.

914
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:12,187
And don't mention this

915
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:12,986
to Xiang Qian.

916
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,706
I know what I'm doing.

917
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:52,187
Mommy.

918
00:31:53,147 --> 00:31:54,306
Mommy.

919
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:55,266
I did really well

920
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,627
in school today.

921
00:31:56,746 --> 00:31:57,506
Teacher gave us

922
00:31:57,627 --> 00:31:58,546
a little star.

923
00:31:58,706 --> 00:31:59,427
Mommy.

924
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:00,786
I also did really well

925
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,986
in school today.

926
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,107
Teacher also praised me

927
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:05,827
and gave me a star.

928
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:06,746
Really?

929
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:07,867
Good job, you two.

930
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,466
Let Mommy wash my hands first.

931
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:10,786
There are germs outside.

932
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:11,907
Once I'm clean,

933
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,306
you can show me your stars,

934
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:14,786
okay? Come on then.

935
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:15,226
Okay.

936
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,627
What's that smell, Aunty?

937
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:24,907
I forgot.

938
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,546
I couldn't smell it at all.

939
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:30,427
You should keep watch

940
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:31,546
when you're boiling soup.

941
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:32,827
Or use the timer?

942
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,306
You don't seem to use it much.

943
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:35,066
Right.

944
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:36,506
I'll pay more attention next time.

945
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:37,387
My nose

946
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:38,746
couldn't pick up the smell.

947
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:41,466
It'd be too late if there was a smell.

948
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,786
The pot would've burned.

949
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:43,627
Yes.

950
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:45,947
What are we having tonight?

951
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,587
I cooked rice.

952
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:56,226
I forgot to plug it in.

953
00:32:57,986 --> 00:32:59,587
Why am I so absent-minded?

954
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:08,466
Aunty.

955
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:09,786
Did something happen

956
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:10,746
back home?

957
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:13,387
You're not usually this careless.

958
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:14,546
It's nothing.

959
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:15,706
If you need anything,

960
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,546
don't hesitate to tell me or Gao Ping.

961
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,506
We'll do our best to help.

962
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,506
Gao Ping is...

963
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:26,107
What's up with Gao Ping?

964
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:30,226
Xiang Qian,

965
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,187
I want to go back.

966
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,706
Fang Yuan can't look after himself.

967
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:36,986
He has stomach problems.

968
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:38,947
I was going to talk to you

969
00:33:38,986 --> 00:33:39,867
about it.

970
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:40,947
But I know

971
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,306
you need a caretaker,

972
00:33:42,427 --> 00:33:43,867
someone to help out at home.

973
00:33:44,226 --> 00:33:45,587
I felt bad about bringing it up.

974
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,107
Is it serious?

975
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:53,066
We don't know yet.

976
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:54,867
We're waiting for the report.

977
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:56,387
When you get the report,

978
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:57,427
and if it's serious,

979
00:33:57,627 --> 00:33:59,066
maybe you can get him treated
in Shanghai.

980
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:01,587
There's no need.

981
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,147
Aunty, look.

982
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:09,227
We just started finding our rhythm

983
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,427
but you're leaving.

984
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:13,387
I'm quite sad about it.

985
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:15,506
But if...

986
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,907
you really want to go back,

987
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:19,466
let me talk to Gao Ping

988
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:20,427
tonight first.

989
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:21,827
And give us a few days

990
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:22,787
to find a replacement.

991
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:23,827
Okay?

992
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:25,307
Because the day after tomorrow...

993
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:26,666
Tomorrow and the day after,

994
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:27,707
I have to go meet clients.

995
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:28,546
I'll be busy.

996
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:31,787
It's okay with me.

997
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:34,106
Okay.

998
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:36,586
Would be best if you didn't leave.

999
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:41,707
Let me see your little stars.

1000
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,787
There are three more here.

1001
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:46,626
Here too.

1002
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:49,747
Yes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1003
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:56,347
Ms. Liu.

1004
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:58,947
Whose luggage are those?

1005
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:00,787
They're...

1006
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:04,747
Whose? Tell me.

1007
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,307
We're not sure.

1008
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:08,947
You're not sure?

1009
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:11,427
Li.

1010
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:13,227
Is someone coming?

1011
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:15,186
Mavis' mother is here.

1012
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,747
Looks better than in photos.

1013
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:21,626
What?

1014
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:31,986
Too many gold elements.

1015
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:35,106
The color of the curtains is not right.

1016
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:38,787
Are you

1017
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:39,506
Mavis' mother?

1018
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,586
I'm Xu Sumin.

1019
00:36:42,186 --> 00:36:43,186
You can call me Elena.

1020
00:36:43,506 --> 00:36:43,986
Okay.

1021
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:45,666
Ms. Xu,

1022
00:36:46,347 --> 00:36:48,347
are you planning to stay here?

1023
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,546
Jiang didn't mention it to me.

1024
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:51,427
He's been informed.

1025
00:36:57,626 --> 00:36:58,347
Ms. He.

1026
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,626
Don't leave the luggage around.

1027
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:01,546
Put them away.

1028
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:05,626
Where should we put the luggage, madam?

1029
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:07,267
In the bedroom.

1030
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:13,947
Yeah, put them away
in the guest bedroom.

1031
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,427
In the master bedroom.

1032
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:20,227
Wait, I'm sorry.

1033
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:21,947
The master bedroom

1034
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,387
is where Jiang Hongbin and I stay.

1035
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:26,186
I don't think it's appropriate
for you to use.

1036
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:27,026
Young lady.

1037
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:28,787
Without me,

1038
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:30,747
Jiang Hongbin wouldn't be
where he is today.

1039
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:31,986
And there wouldn't even be you.

1040
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:35,066
So tell me,

1041
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,707
is it appropriate for me
to use the master bedroom?

1042
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:41,546
Bring my things up.

1043
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:51,026
You guys wait here.

1044
00:37:58,947 --> 00:37:59,427
Hello.

1045
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:01,787
The number you've dialed
is currently in use.

1046
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:09,267
Jiang, what's the deal?

1047
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:10,586
Your ex-wife is here.

1048
00:38:10,827 --> 00:38:12,146
You never said anything to me.

1049
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,506
The cuckoo is taking over
the magpie's nest.

1050
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:15,787
You need to get back home.

1051
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:22,146
What do we do with the bags?

1052
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:22,986
Yeah.

1053
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:24,347
Take the lift to the second floor.

1054
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:25,347
Go.

1055
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:33,387
Good views.

1056
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:35,307
Ample sunlight.

1057
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,666
Pretty wife.

1058
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:41,506
Pretty good for Jiang Hongbin.

1059
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,626
Seems like he has

1060
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:46,506
his life under control.

1061
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:47,986
Ms. Xu.

1062
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:49,307
Ms. He.

1063
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,827
Come here, I'll tell you what to do.

1064
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:53,227
I want all new bedding.

1065
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:56,626
Clear the bathroom and closet

1066
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,546
of all miscellaneous items.

1067
00:38:58,347 --> 00:38:59,347
You worked for me a long time.

1068
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:00,307
You know what I'm like.

1069
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:01,827
I'm a germaphobe.

1070
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:04,747
Ms. He,

1071
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:05,907
take the bags down.

1072
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,267
To where exactly?

1073
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:11,626
If you're unsure

1074
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:12,707
how to address me,

1075
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:14,106
you don't have to force yourself.

1076
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,867
Go downstairs and make yourself
a cup of coffee

1077
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,146
to cool off.

1078
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,146
Ms. Xu,

1079
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,227
let me remind you.

1080
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,066
I don't care about your past

1081
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:25,907
with Jiang Hongbin.

1082
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:27,186
You two are divorced.

1083
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:28,387
This

1084
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,307
is my house, my property.

1085
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:31,506
Where you are now

1086
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,227
is my bedroom.

1087
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:33,026
Please leave.

1088
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:33,907
Are you sure?

1089
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:38,186
Are you sure this is your house?

1090
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:39,267
Are you sure

1091
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:40,907
your name is on the ownership card?

1092
00:39:41,227 --> 00:39:42,026
My guess is...

1093
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,026
it's not.

1094
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,227
So what right do you have

1095
00:39:46,227 --> 00:39:47,787
to be giving orders?

1096
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:52,546
Stop gawking, Ms. He.

1097
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:53,867
Put my things away.

1098
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:55,387
I said, take the bags downstairs.

1099
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,267
Put them away.

1100
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:57,106
Don't move anything.

1101
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:02,146
I'm cooking soup in the kitchen.

1102
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:03,387
I better go check on it.

1103
00:40:03,506 --> 00:40:04,227
Stop right there!

1104
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:14,227
Okay.

1105
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:15,506
It's fine.

1106
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,106
I'll remove your bags

1107
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:17,986
myself.

1108
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,106
I dare you to do it.

1109
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:22,026
Watch me then.

1110
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:26,666
Let go.

1111
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:27,666
No.

1112
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:28,186
Let go!

1113
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:28,707
You let go.

1114
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:29,466
I said, let go!

1115
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:30,387
Do you hear me?

1116
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:34,026
I told you. Don't touch my stuff!

1117
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,466
You're in trouble now, you hear?

1118
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:00,347
I'll make you

1119
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:02,066
and Jiang Hongbin

1120
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,267
grovel in the mud for what happened.

1121
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:04,747
If you want to cause trouble,

1122
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:05,506
I'm going to call the police.

1123
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,586
We can settle this
in the police station.

1124
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:07,907
The neighborhood committee

1125
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:09,867
is more useful than the police
in family disputes.

1126
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:11,146
You could even ask
the property management.

1127
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:13,347
Make them come, the more the merrier.

1128
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:14,506
I'd like to see

1129
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:16,106
what that'd do to your dear Jiang.

1130
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:18,466
I'm not scared.

1131
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:27,707
Crazy woman.

1132
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:32,066
It works.

1133
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:33,267
I left the manual

1134
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:34,227
in the house.

1135
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:35,227
You can re-set

1136
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:36,066
the passcode on your own.

1137
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:37,106
Okay, got it. Thanks, mister.

1138
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:37,986
You're welcome.

1139
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:39,066
Call me

1140
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:40,186
if there's any problem.

1141
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:41,787
Will do, thanks.

1142
00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:42,626
You're welcome.

1143
00:41:47,867 --> 00:41:48,506
Xiang Zhong.

1144
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:56,546
I heard

1145
00:41:57,747 --> 00:41:58,986
you submitted your resignation.

1146
00:42:01,546 --> 00:42:02,066
I had wanted to quit.

1147
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:02,747
Now your mom

1148
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:03,586
can stop nagging.

1149
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:04,626
I don't want

1150
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:05,506
to owe your family anything.

1151
00:42:08,186 --> 00:42:09,586
This thing blew up to this extent.

1152
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:10,427
Why didn't you

1153
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,466
call me and tell me?

1154
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,546
Why should I call you?

1155
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:14,867
Would telling you do any good?

1156
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,267
If it did,

1157
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:17,626
would the drama have lasted so long?

1158
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:20,427
Okay.

1159
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:23,787
What about this?

1160
00:42:24,427 --> 00:42:25,267
Why don't you...

1161
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,106
Why don't you go back home
for a few days.

1162
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:28,827
I'll talk to my mom.

1163
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:30,787
Once this matter is resolved,

1164
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:32,227
I'll call you, okay?

1165
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:33,907
What?

1166
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:35,546
Are you helping your mom lure the tiger
out of the den?

1167
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:36,827
What are you talking about?

1168
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:43,227
I'm not after the house.

1169
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:44,666
I won't give it even if you asked.

1170
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:46,347
Tell your mom.

1171
00:42:46,427 --> 00:42:47,146
She's over 60,

1172
00:42:47,186 --> 00:42:48,347
and I'm in my early 30s.

1173
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:50,307
Who does she think can last longer?

1174
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:53,707
Must you drag this out?

1175
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:54,867
I'm not the one dragging this out.

1176
00:42:55,267 --> 00:42:56,106
It's because your mom

1177
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:56,986
won't stop pestering me.

1178
00:42:58,267 --> 00:42:58,787
Zhong.

1179
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:00,707
Xiang Zhong!

1180
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:01,747
