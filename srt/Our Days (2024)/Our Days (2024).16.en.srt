00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 16=

4
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,175
Who are you looking for?

5
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:42,455
Is Wang Yuxi here?

6
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:43,856
Dear,

7
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:44,856
someone's looking for Yuxi.

8
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:45,975
Who is it?

9
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,375
Hello, you are...?

10
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,815
I am Wang Yuxi's friend.

11
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:52,535
He went back to Shanghai.

12
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:57,535
When did he leave?

13
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:58,975
It's been a few days.

14
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,656
Sorry for the intrusion.

15
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:03,416
Thanks.

16
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,016
No problem.

17
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,016
Sorry.

18
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,136
The number you have dialed

19
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:20,376
cannot be reached.

20
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:21,775
Please try again later.

21
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,416
I'm giving myself one month.

22
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,096
I might go back to Shanghai

23
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:32,935
or go somewhere else.

24
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:34,495
The point is,

25
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,016
I don't know whom I'm going to meet,

26
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,016
or what kind.

27
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:40,976
(The person you meet)

28
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,376
(is going to decide where you go?)

29
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:44,735
(Most likely.)

30
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,136
(Just like what you like.)

31
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,335
(There's no need)

32
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,735
(to be concerned
with what others think.)

33
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:55,256
(Xiang Zhong: Why aren't you replying?)

34
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,096
(I know you went back to Shanghai.)

35
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,136
(I want to talk to you face to face.)

36
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:11,495
Eat up.

37
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,775
Do you want the prawns?

38
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:16,416
No thanks.

39
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:17,856
Have the veges then.

40
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:20,096
Aunty.

41
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,735
Come and eat first.

42
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:23,536
Coming.

43
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:25,655
Coming.

44
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,536
I learned a new recipe today.

45
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,136
Try it and tell me how it is.

46
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,175
What's the filling in the mushroom?

47
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,536
I know you don't like meat.

48
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:36,376
So I used shrimp

49
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,696
for the filling.

50
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,376
Do you like it?

51
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:39,175
It's really good.

52
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:39,935
Is it?

53
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:40,696
I want one too.

54
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:41,775
- Here you go.
- It's good.

55
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:42,856
I want one too.

56
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:43,376
It's good?

57
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:44,416
There's more.

58
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:45,615
But I haven't steamed them.

59
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:46,696
Let me go do it now.

60
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:47,856
Don't worry about it, Aunty.

61
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:48,495
I'll be quick.

62
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,096
Do it and come back to eat, okay?

63
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:50,895
Grandaunt,

64
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:52,296
it's so delicious.

65
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:53,696
I really like it.

66
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,296
It's really good, right?

67
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:55,976
Is it?

68
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:56,816
Yes.

69
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:58,175
We'll ask grandaunt to make more.

70
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:01,296
Your relationship suddenly improved.

71
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,136
It's the power of communication.

72
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:10,376
Prof. Yang assigned me

73
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,696
two more new projects.

74
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,016
I haven't joined the postdoctoral program

75
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:14,615
but I'm already exhausted.

76
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:15,895
I see it now.

77
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:16,775
The role of a post-doc

78
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:17,855
is just cheap labor.

79
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:20,295
It's not that bad.

80
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,736
Being busy is a good thing.

81
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:23,816
Don't complain, be content.

82
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:25,295
I'm not complaining.

83
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:27,736
I was thinking,

84
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:28,455
since Cong and Qi

85
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:29,895
are starting primary school soon,

86
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:31,215
I could handle

87
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:32,376
their pre-school tutoring myself.

88
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:33,496
But,

89
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:34,616
now it looks like

90
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:35,335
I won't have

91
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,655
a lot of free time moving forward.

92
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:39,895
Having a post-doc student

93
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:41,176
to tutor

94
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:42,576
two pre-school children,

95
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,616
isn't that a waste of talent?

96
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:47,295
It's okay.

97
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,176
I'll find an agency

98
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,176
to help look for a private tutor.

99
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:53,576
Actually,

100
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,736
there's no need for that.

101
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,176
No, don't touch that.

102
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,136
I'm putting them in groups.

103
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,136
This is what I'm thinking.

104
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:04,056
Instead of hiring a tutor outside,

105
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,696
why don't I head to the research center
and see if

106
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:06,696
there are any juniors willing
to do part-time work

107
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:08,256
to support their studies?

108
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,176
Firstly,

109
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:11,576
I know them better.

110
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,176
Secondly,

111
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:14,696
it's cheaper than hiring
a private tutor.

112
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:15,975
We can save some money too.

113
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,016
What do you think?

114
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:19,816
What did you say just now?

115
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:21,176
Something about labor.

116
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:22,775
Cheap labor, wasn't it?

117
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,095
You sure picked it up quickly.

118
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,415
Well, the apple doesn't fall
far away from the tree.

119
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:31,295
Are there any kids

120
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:32,816
younger than Cong and Qi

121
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,616
in your hometown?

122
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:35,775
Clothes

123
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:36,895
that our kids no longer wear...

124
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,535
I mean, which they've outgrown,

125
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:39,855
are still in good condition.

126
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,215
We can send them back.

127
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:44,616
I'll ask around.

128
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,016
I take it that you're okay

129
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:48,056
about my looking for a tutor.

130
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,496
Here, come in.

131
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:02,736
You can wear these.

132
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:03,855
Okay, thanks, Gao Ping.

133
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:04,576
Xiang Qian.

134
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:06,256
Xiang Qian.

135
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:08,775
The tutor is here.

136
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:09,816
Come and meet her.

137
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:15,895
Hello, Mrs. Gao.

138
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:16,496
Hello.

139
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,256
This is Li Shu,

140
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:18,335
one of our research students.

141
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:19,016
She does

142
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:19,936
most of the administrative work.

143
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:21,095
Nice to meet you.

144
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,176
Come, take a seat.

145
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,696
Go sit, I'll get water.

146
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:24,455
Sit.

147
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:30,016
- Here, water.
- Thanks.

148
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,616
Water for you.

149
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:32,335
Thanks.

150
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:35,415
What a pretty glass.

151
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,295
My younger sister made it.

152
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:40,535
Mrs. Gao,

153
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:41,936
before coming here,

154
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:43,576
I did a lot of research.

155
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:45,936
I believe that
for pre-school-aged children,

156
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:46,775
the most important thing

157
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:47,736
is to be happy.

158
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:49,535
So my idea is

159
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,455
to conduct handicraft lessons

160
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:53,576
to nurture their ability to focus

161
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:54,455
and concentrate.

162
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:55,855
Personally,

163
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:57,095
my hobby is clay baking.

164
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:58,056
I think

165
00:06:58,095 --> 00:06:59,136
I can do that with the kids.

166
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,936
As for study materials,

167
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:01,895
I prepared these.

168
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,816
You can take a look.

169
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:05,736
First of all,

170
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:07,016
there are some

171
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,095
easy pinyin lessons.

172
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:11,696
For math, there's addition

173
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,295
and subtraction within 10

174
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:14,136
and applied problems.

175
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:15,975
For English,

176
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,256
I prepared

177
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:18,415
some fables.

178
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:20,775
Also,

179
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:22,616
for reading, I have

180
00:07:22,696 --> 00:07:23,655
the Nineteen Ancient Poems,

181
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:24,975
and some introductory

182
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,295
Song and Tang poems.

183
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:28,616
Because I think

184
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,616
for pre-school children,

185
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,376
the learning content

186
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:32,335
isn't that important.

187
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,095
What matters is

188
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:35,816
stimulating an interest in learning.

189
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:38,016
So the materials I have

190
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,176
aren't that complicated.

191
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,616
Is there anything particular you need,

192
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:41,616
Mr. and Mrs. Gao?

193
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:46,616
I think it's quite good.

194
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:48,655
Let's go ahead and give it a try.

195
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:50,215
Okay.

196
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:54,975
We are back.

197
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:56,696
You're back, my babies?

198
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,176
Come, Cong and Qi.

199
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:00,736
Come here.

200
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:02,696
Greet Ms. Li.

201
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,736
Hello, Ms. Li.

202
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,295
Hello, Qi and Cong.

203
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:07,376
I brought

204
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:09,136
some gifts for you two.

205
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:11,576
This little boy is for Cong.

206
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:13,215
Thank you, Ms. Li.

207
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,616
The little girl is for Qi.

208
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,655
Thanks, Ms. Li.

209
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:17,895
Do you like it?

210
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:18,936
Yes.

211
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:20,496
Let's make some handicrafts

212
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:21,696
together next time, okay?

213
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:23,016
Okay.

214
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:25,136
Xiang Qian.

215
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:26,215
Ms. Li

216
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,295
will be eating dinner with us, right?

217
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:28,415
I'll prepare more.

218
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:29,616
It's okay, Aunty.

219
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,256
I have an English class later.

220
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:33,976
I briefly told her

221
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,216
about our family condition.

222
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:39,935
You're still attending classes?

223
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:42,415
Are you preparing to go abroad?

224
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:44,295
Cong.

225
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,055
I'm thinking,

226
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:47,976
since the current job market is...

227
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:49,295
Go and wash your hands.

228
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,096
Go wash your hands.

229
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:54,575
I'm thinking

230
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:57,175
I should give myself more options.

231
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,456
Because currently,

232
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,856
the local job market is not promising.

233
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:02,096
Gao Ping should know that too, right?

234
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,016
Don't you guys have any plans
to go abroad?

235
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,775
No, we're not thinking of that.

236
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,695
When Cong and Qi are older,

237
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:10,856
they can decide for themselves.

238
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,376
Yeah, we are
a multi-generational family.

239
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:13,575
It's not that easy to move.

240
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:17,216
Got it.

241
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:18,496
Okay, Mrs. Gao.

242
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:19,456
I'll get going.

243
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,895
I'll take these with me first.

244
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:21,736
I'll bring them again

245
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:22,736
the next time I come.

246
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:23,336
Okay.

247
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,216
Thank you.

248
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,096
Oh, Gao Ping.

249
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,016
Is it easy to get a taxi here?

250
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,055
Yeah, I think so.

251
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,336
Where are you headed?

252
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,295
To the subway station.

253
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,216
You can drive her, Gao Ping.

254
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:37,736
No, it's okay. Mrs. Gao.

255
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:38,695
I don't want to trouble you.

256
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:39,496
I can find a way.

257
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:40,815
No, the subway station

258
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:41,856
is a distance away from here.

259
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:43,415
Better to take her, Gao Ping.

260
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,736
Okay, I'll drive you. Let's go.

261
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:47,376
Okay.

262
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:48,175
I'll be off, Mrs. Gao.

263
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:49,136
See you next time.

264
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:49,736
See you.

265
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:50,336
Bye-bye.

266
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:50,935
Bye.

267
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,136
Thanks for coming.

268
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:54,295
I'll drive her.

269
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,415
Bye, Cong and Qi.

270
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,336
Bye-bye, Ms. Li.

271
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:01,655
Aunty, see you.

272
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:08,736
I look

273
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:09,775
better without glasses, right?

274
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,016
When did you get engaged?

275
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:14,736
You mean this?

276
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,535
I borrowed it from my housemate.

277
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:19,216
I was thinking,

278
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,856
if I look like I'm engaged,

279
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:21,775
your wife would

280
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,096
probably lower her guard a little.

281
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:24,976
There's no need for that.

282
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,295
Xiang Qian has quite a lot of trust

283
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,336
in our relationship.

284
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:29,336
Is that so?

285
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,016
I don't buy it.

286
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:32,616
You're a standout.

287
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,175
How can she be so confident?

288
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:36,655
Can I ask you

289
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,016
not to make such cringey remarks?

290
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,096
Which one? A standout?

291
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:41,856
Gao Ping,

292
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:44,175
you're a ray of light in my eyes.

293
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:45,535
I'll get you a pair of sunglasses then.

294
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,216
I'll be waiting.

295
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:03,935
I bet you and your wife

296
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:05,055
can both control this smart car

297
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:06,456
from your phones, right?

298
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:10,856
Do you guys also use

299
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,456
the same Alipay account?

300
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,016
Don't look at me like that.

301
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,376
I'm not the one who said so.

302
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:21,695
Everyone in the department knows.

303
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:23,535
People love to gossip.

304
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:29,336
So,

305
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,815
no matter how much money you spend,

306
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:31,856
or where you go,

307
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,456
your wife has to know?

308
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,655
From my understanding,

309
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,695
this is a form of trust
and companionship.

310
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:40,415
From my understanding,

311
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:41,655
that's controlling.

312
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:49,856
What are you trying to say?

313
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:55,496
I wanted to ask you.

314
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,815
Did you ask me to go to your house

315
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,695
only

316
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:01,935
to tutor your kids?

317
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:04,175
So far,

318
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:05,175
yes.

319
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:14,815
The way you said it

320
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,055
makes me look forward to more.

321
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:27,456
Why is she always
borrowing things from you?

322
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:28,535
Last time it was your bag,

323
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:29,496
now it's your ring.

324
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,175
Stop pretending to be rich if she's not.

325
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:33,256
We live in the same dorm.

326
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:34,456
I can't really say no, can I?

327
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:35,736
What's wrong with that?

328
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,096
If she said she lost it,

329
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,535
would you be okay asking her to pay?

330
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,096
She's wearing it on her hand.
She won't lose it.

331
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,256
What if she did?

332
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:43,496
It cost 3,800.

333
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:44,856
Even if you asked her to pay,

334
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:45,976
she might not be able to.

335
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,336
Well... You can't expect me to...

336
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,856
It's just a ring.

337
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,376
Are you really arguing over that?

338
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:02,016
Thank you.

339
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:03,175
It's fine.

340
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:06,496
I can

341
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:07,895
still afford to pay 3,800.

342
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,616
I need to change.

343
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,376
Hey.

344
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:35,736
Sorry about that, Li Shu.

345
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,856
He can be quite annoying.

346
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:39,216
Please don't mind him.

347
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:42,575
And yet you're enduring it.

348
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,456
If it were me, I'd have broken up.

349
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,415
I'm not as ambitious as you.

350
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:51,096
His background is so-so,

351
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,216
but at least

352
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,376
he wants to be good to me.

353
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,815
Aunty prepared two types of melons.

354
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:18,376
Appreciate it.

355
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:23,496
What do you think of Li Shu?

356
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,415
Not bad.

357
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:28,895
She's polite.

358
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:31,376
And quite pretty.

359
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:34,456
Is she?

360
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:35,775
I never noticed.

361
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:38,096
I saw her

362
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,376
wearing a wedding ring.

363
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,575
What does her husband do?

364
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:43,976
I've never asked.

365
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:45,175
Why? Are you curious?

366
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:45,895
I can ask her for you.

367
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,175
Do you actually

368
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,096
know her well or not?

369
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,856
I don't know her that well. Why?

370
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,336
Well, you said you'll look

371
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,736
for a home tutor among your juniors

372
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,216
and you found one so quickly.

373
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,415
We're both busy people.

374
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:04,175
Better to get
the job done sooner, right?

375
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:07,535
Alright.

376
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:08,775
We'll use her then.

377
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,295
Are you sure?

378
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,415
If you're not satisfied,
I can look again.

379
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:37,895
Xiang Zhong.

380
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:42,456
Qing, how come you're here?

381
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:44,415
Where's Wang Yuxi?

382
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:46,856

387
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:56,655

542
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,456

00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:36,696
(Xiang Nan: What's the theme?)

572
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:41,055
(Xiang Qian: Shanghai's hottest chick.)

573
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:49,535
This place is buzzing.

574
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:50,696
So many people.

575
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:53,016
Wait,

576
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,775
is my outfit appropriate?

577
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:56,055
Better than mine.

578
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,416
I've not been
to such places in a long time.

579
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:58,696
I don't know what to wear.

580
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,095
ID, please.

581
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,736
Why do we have to show you our ID?

582
00:23:10,095 --> 00:23:11,256
Today's theme is,

583
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,375
Sleepless Night
for the Post-'95 Singles.

584
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:14,855
What does that mean?

585
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,535
It literally means what it says.

586
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:17,535
So?

587
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:18,855
So,

588
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:20,855
mature ladies can't enter.

589
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,936
Are you saying we're old?

590
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:25,496
Forget it.

591
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:27,055
They won't allow us in.

592
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:29,976
We still have to wait for Xiang Nan

593
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:31,256
since we told her.

594
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:33,815
Post-'95.

595
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,815
It will be kind of hard
for us to pretend.

596
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:37,976
Post-'90 should be doable.

597
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:39,696
Post-'90 means 30s, right?

598
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:40,936
Have fun.

599
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:41,815
Thanks.

600
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:45,135
Qian, Zhong.

601
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:46,016
You're here.

602
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:46,696
Let's go.

603
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:48,216
- We're not allowed in.
- How long have you been waiting?

604
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,256
Xiang Zhong.

605
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,335
Zhong, where are you going?

606
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:51,295
We can't enter.

607
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,656
We've been standing out here.

608
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:53,976
Why are you...

609
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:55,815
What are you wearing?

610
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:56,656
You're wearing a tank top.

611
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:57,496
You two...

612
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:59,216
You two are wearing different styles.

613
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:00,416
You're too covered up.

614
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:01,535
We didn't know what to wear

615
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:02,656
- to a pub.
- Stop teasing.

616
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,335
Come on, let's go in.

617
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:04,936
Where are you going?

618
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:06,295
The bouncer said

619
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,936
it's Sleepless Night
for the Post-'95 Singles.

620
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:09,016
We're over the age.

621
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,535
I'm post-'95.

622
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:11,936
You try then.

623
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:12,976
Yes, I will.

624
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:21,855
I'm allowed in, right?

625
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,216
Of course.

626
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,335
But first,

627
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,375
I need to see your ID.

628
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,696
You still need to check my ID?

629
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:30,335
It's okay now.

630
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:31,736
Hang on.

631
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,375
What's wrong?

632
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:34,575
You're married.

633
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:37,976
Our theme today is,

634
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:40,456
Sleepless Night
for the Post-'95 Singles.

635
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:42,375
I am born after '95.

636
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,575
You have to be single.

637
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:48,815
I'll just take it off.

638
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:55,095
I'm sorry.

639
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:55,896
A no go?

640
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:56,575
No.

641
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:57,656
You're so strict.

642
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:03,135
Who asked you to get married so young?

643
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:04,936
Told you it won't work.

644
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:05,535
You should've said so

645
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:06,736
and I would've taken off the ring.

646
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:08,135
That was embarrassing.

647
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:09,216
My excitement is gone now.

648
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:10,416
What now?

649
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:11,295
We can't enter.

650
00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:13,176
We're already here.

651
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,775
Let's find some place else then.

652
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:15,815
Hang out with Zhong.

653
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:16,696
Alright.

654
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:17,416
Let's...

655
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:18,216
go drink.

656
00:25:18,295 --> 00:25:19,135
Let's have some drinks, come on.

657
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:19,855
Xiang Zhong can decide where to go.

658
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:21,016
Let's drink.

659
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:23,256
Yeah, we'll drink with you.

660
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,256
Why are you unhappy?

661
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:27,055
Why?

662
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:29,016
Your second sister thinks she's too old.

663
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,615
You'll bloom again after a few drinks.

♪Maybe I'm overthinking♪

669
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:50,216
We three sat together

670
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:51,456
drinking like this.

671
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:53,496
When was the last time we did that?

672
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:56,575
The last time...

673
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:58,254
♪Forget it. Don't say it♪

674
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,295

676
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:04,736
was when Xiang Nan
just entered university in Hangzhou.

677
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:06,295
She was back

678
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:08,295
for National Day holiday.

679
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:12,055
I had rushed back to Kunshan
from Beijing.

680
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,456
That was...

681
00:26:15,855 --> 00:26:16,775
Seven years ago.

682
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:17,736
Seven years?

683
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:18,775
That long ago?

684
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:20,216
I remember the street

685
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:21,855
looked similar to this one.

686
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,095
This is the street.

687
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:23,855
Is it?

688
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:25,615
And this is the same pub.

689
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:26,775
Really?

690
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:27,656
No way.

691
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:28,295
This is the pub?

692
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,535
I don't remember if it's the same one.

693
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:30,976
But this is the same street.

694
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:32,375
This is the one.

695
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:33,295
I remember it clearly.

696
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:34,615
I don't.

697
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:36,615
You two have good memory.

698
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:37,575
You remember it.

699
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:39,135
I don't remember anything.

700
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:41,295
I'm good at remembering trivial stuff.

701
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:43,055
Someone's got to do it.

702
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:44,055
Come.

703
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:49,176
It's been too long.

704
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:51,696
Seven years, my gosh.

705
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:54,375
Come, let's take a photo.

706
00:26:57,775 --> 00:26:58,535
Come closer.

707
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:00,575
Xiang Nan, come forward more.

708
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:01,416
Come forward.

709
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:02,656
Your face is so small.

710
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,896
Three, two, one.

711
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:08,496
I didn't get it.

712
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,216
You pressed on the video button.

713
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:13,855
Do you know how to do it?

714
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,176
Again, again.

715
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:16,095
- Again.
- Stop moving backward.

716
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:17,456
Okay, okay.

717
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:18,375
I won't.

718
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:22,016
Three, two, one.

719
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,095
You're a nuisance.

720
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:25,855
You can only see

721
00:27:25,855 --> 00:27:27,375
my big face in the front.

722
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:28,656
Hello, pretty ladies.

723
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:29,775
Let me take one for you.

724
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:31,176
My photography skill is top notch.

725
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,416
Trust me.

726
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,216
Come, look at the camera.

727
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:37,416
One, two, three.

728
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:38,456
Cheese.

729
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,575
How is the photo?

730
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:42,216
Okay?

731
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:43,815
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

732
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:44,615
It's good.

733
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:46,575
Are you ladies visiting

734
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:47,736
or working here?

735
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:49,936
We...

736
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,535
We're visiting.

737
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,496
Anything to recommend?

738
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,456
I'm the right guy to ask.

739
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:57,176
Sorry, excuse me.

740
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:00,775
I know this area the best.

741
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:05,575
Sorry.

742
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:06,815
I dropped my keys.

743
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:14,335
There are plenty of good spots here.

744
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:16,896
Pretty ladies,

745
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,696
would you like to see
the tourist attractions

746
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,416
or meet some

747
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,176
new friends?

748
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:27,256
He's asking you.

749
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:28,936
Don't look at me.

750
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:30,575
Anyone can answer.

751
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:33,775
Sorry, I need to go to the bathroom.

752
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:35,456
Okay.

753
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:39,295
A toast to you pretty ladies.

754
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,095
Very glad

755
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:41,815
to meet you all.

756
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:46,375
(Xiang Qian: Don't pay the bill.)

757
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:47,736
(I'll call you guys later.)

758
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:49,135
(We'll meet at the junction outside.)

759
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:50,575
(Xiang Zhong: Got it.)

760
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:51,535
(Xiang Nan: Okay.)

761
00:28:53,055 --> 00:28:54,256
Why so mysterious, ladies?

762
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:55,855
I... I got a call.

763
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,135
Okay.

764
00:28:57,295 --> 00:28:58,095
Excuse me.

765
00:28:58,615 --> 00:28:59,216
Hello?

766
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,855
My signal is not so great.

767
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:03,176
Okay.

768
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:06,256
Let's drink.

769
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:10,295
Why is it taking so long?

770
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:11,736
Is it that hard

771
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:13,775
to get rid of the guy?

772
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,295
Your second sister

773
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,535
probably wanted
to show off a little today.

774
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:19,016
Got the feel, huh?

775
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:21,335
There she is.

776
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:23,256
How did it go?

777
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:24,736
Did it work?

778
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:27,055
He was no match for me at all.

779
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:28,775
Gosh, that greaseball.

780
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:30,016
Let's go.

781
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:31,256
He might come looking for us.

782
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:32,095
Go.

783
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:37,055
He touched your shoulder.

784
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:38,216
He did.

785
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:38,696
For real,

786
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:39,335
really.

787
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,256
He touched you twice.

788
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:40,815
Yeah,

789
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:41,656
I wanted to hit him.

790
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,095
How dare he touch my little puppy.

791
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,656
(I used to have a lot of complaints)

792
00:29:53,656 --> 00:29:55,055
(about this family.)

793
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:57,815
(Hence why I ran far away)

794
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,135
(to Changchun.)

795
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,736
(I used to have plenty of dreams.)

796
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:07,815
(But at last,
I still ended back in Kunshan.)

797
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,095
(I always thought that life was a pain.)

798
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:15,936
(But I didn't know where else to go.)

799
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:19,416
(I had)

800
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,375
(more family members around me,)

801
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,976
(but I still felt so lonely.)

802
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,456
(I always thought)

803
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,095
(the problem was with other people.)

804
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,095
(It was because Dad and Mom
didn't pay enough attention to me.)

805
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:34,815
(Because Deng Haiyang was a loser.)

806
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,256
(Because Xiang Qian
settled down in Shanghai.)

807
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,135
(Because Xiang Nan married a good man.)

808
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:47,135
(But this time, it dawned on me.)

809
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,256
(Perhaps it's because
I asked for too much.)

810
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:51,936
(I didn't know what life is.)

811
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:03,375
(When I was lost,)

812
00:31:04,016 --> 00:31:05,535
(having two sisters by my side)

813
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,416
(made it okay.)

814
00:32:05,815 --> 00:32:06,575
You're back.

815
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,135
Our cooling period ends tomorrow.

816
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:20,855
We can sign the final divorce agreement.

817
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:23,016
I know.

818
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:26,295
So...

819
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:27,896
I...

820
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:30,016
I came to take some clothes.

821
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:08,575
I have quite a lot of things.

822
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:10,256
So, I'll come back and pack

823
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:11,615
some other time.

824
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:34,976
Hey...

825
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:37,615
What time is it tomorrow?

826
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:41,256
Is 10 AM okay?

827
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,456
Yeah.

828
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:51,216

00:40:25,535 --> 00:40:26,215
Okay, thank you.

949
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:27,856
No need to thank me.

950
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,776
It's what I should do.

951
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,016
I brought him to the ER last night

952
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:34,255
and stayed overnight.

953
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,095
The Orthopedics

954
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:36,016
only saw him this morning.

955
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:37,296
So I've been keeping watch.

956
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:39,655
I haven't had a wink of sleep.

957
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:40,336
Since you're here,

958
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:40,976
I reckon there's no point

959
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:41,575
in me staying.

960
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:42,416
Here.

961
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:43,496
This is the patient card.

962
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:44,416
His medical record.

963
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:46,296
The file contains the x-ray too.

964
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,296
I'll leave Haiyang in your care then.

965
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:49,296
I'm going back.

966
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:50,296
You can call me

967
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:51,575
if anything happens.

968
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:52,936
If I don't answer the call,

969
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,135
it means I'm still sleeping.

970
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,615
I'll call you back the moment I wake up.

971
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:56,655
Please look after Haiyang.

972
00:40:56,776 --> 00:40:57,496
See you.

973
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:58,456
My heart...

974
00:40:58,615 --> 00:40:59,695
My heart feels kind of...

975
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:00,856
Please take good care of Haiyang.

976
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:01,655
I'll leave you to it.

977
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:02,655
Bye-bye, Xiang Zhong.

978
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:04,016
Why is my heart

979
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:05,376
suddenly beating so fast?

980
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,296
Qian Feng went home.

981
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:51,896
He told me what happened.

982
00:42:02,776 --> 00:42:03,695
Why didn't you

983
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:04,575
call me?

984
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,575
Because it's nothing serious.

985
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:19,496
You knew we had to sign the papers,

986
00:42:19,615 --> 00:42:21,215
so why did you drink so much?

987
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:26,535
Hey.

988
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:28,535
What... What are you saying?

989
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:29,456
Are you saying

990
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:30,856
that I did it on purpose?

991
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:31,896
I said no such thing.

992
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:35,496
Okay.

993
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:36,816
What are you doing?

994
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,456
I'm getting up, that's what.

995
00:42:38,615 --> 00:42:39,776
Stop making trouble, Deng Haiyang!

996
00:42:39,896 --> 00:42:40,376
I'm not making trouble.

997
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:40,856
Listen.

998
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:41,575
You said I did it on purpose?

999
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:42,575
I'll get up and get it done.

1000
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:43,896
I'll get all the paperwork done

1001
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:44,976
even if I have to crawl there!

1002
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:45,856
Stop causing a scene!

1003
00:42:45,936 --> 00:42:46,496
I'm not!

1004
00:42:46,535 --> 00:42:47,655
Just lie back down, will you?

1005
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:48,695
Nurse, I need a nurse!

1006
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:49,695
Nurse, help!

1007
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:50,336
Nurse!

1008
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:51,255
Nurse!

1009
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:52,416
Stop it, Deng Haiyang.

1010
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:53,095
I'll do it myself.

1011
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:53,816
Just lie down!

1012
00:42:53,816 --> 00:42:54,336
Nurse!

1013
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:54,776
That's enough.

1014
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:55,255
What is your problem?

1015
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:55,735
Stop shouting!

1016
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:58,976
Mom?

1017
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:01,055
Mom.

1018
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:02,615
