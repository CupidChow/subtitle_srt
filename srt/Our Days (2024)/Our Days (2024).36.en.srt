00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 36=

4
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:39,734
Hello, Xiang Nan.

5
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:41,175
Hey, Qian.

6
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:42,734
We got out.

7
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:44,255
Zhong is driving.

8
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:45,055
We're on our way back.

9
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:47,574
How are things on your end?

10
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,775
I'll call you guys later.

11
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:51,934
How did Mavis

12
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:53,094
get hurt?

13
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:55,535
Just tell her honestly,

14
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:56,535
and take care of yourself.

15
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,695
Alright, I know.

16
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,374
That's all about it.

17
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:09,214
Jiang Hongbin

18
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,335
has character flaws.

19
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:12,775
You've lived with him for so many years,

20
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:14,415
so you should know better than I do.

21
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:16,734
As you saw,

22
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,095
Xiang Nan risked possibly

23
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,854
getting hurt by Jiang Hongbin again

24
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,215
to find Jiang Xiaotong.

25
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,294
It wasn't just for her own sake.

26
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,815
She's genuinely concerned about Xiaotong

27
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,655
and hoped

28
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,815
Xiaotong could see you

29
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:31,774
in the video

30
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:33,695
for some comfort.

31
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:35,655
Can you bear to leave such a kind

32
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:37,095
and brave daughter

33
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,095
in the hands of someone

34
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,294
like Jiang Hongbin?

35
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:42,014
Yes,

36
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:44,375
I came to Canada

37
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,495
for my sister,

38
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,255
but I believe

39
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,014
I can also help your daughter and you.

40
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,535
Shall we discuss more?

41
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:00,535
Go ahead.

42
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,215
You've returned there multiple times

43
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:07,574
asking Jiang Hongbin for money.

44
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:10,695
Do you have anything on him

45
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,334
that could hold him accountable?

46
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,655
If you do,

47
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,975
I hope you can help us.

48
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:30,255
Whether I have something

49
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,174
that could hold
Jiang Hongbin accountable

50
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,774
is none of your business.

51
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:37,135
Even if I did,

52
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,255
why would I give it to you?

53
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,294
Do you think just

54
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:42,255
by flying to Canada,

55
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,535
throwing a fit in front of me,

56
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,495
and I'll side with you

57
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,535
and help you?

58
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:51,815
You're too naive.

59
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:53,215
Just go back.

60
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,495
The Chinese community
here in Canada is small.

61
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,495
I looked you up before I came.

62
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:01,774
You're a person with no credibility

63
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,095
and can't leave Canada.

64
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,375
In your battle with Jiang Hongbin,

65
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,014
you have already

66
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:09,255
completely lost to him.

67
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:11,215
If you still hope

68
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:12,894
to get something from Jiang Hongbin,

69
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,854
your only option may be through us.

70
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,415
Through you?

71
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,094
I want one hundred million.

72
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:23,815
Can you give me?

73
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:29,214
Jiang Hongbin is a very arrogant person.

74
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:32,135
Before marrying Xiang Nan,

75
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:33,774
he didn't sign a prenuptial agreement.

76
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,574
Do you know what that means?

77
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,815
I checked with a lawyer.

78
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,654
If they divorce through litigation,

79
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:43,615
Xiang Nan could get

80
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:44,815
half of Jiang Hongbin's total income

81
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:47,295
during their marriage,

82
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,014
or even more.

83
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:52,454
We don't want any of it.

84
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:54,855
We'll give all of it to you.

85
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:08,894
Jiang Hongbin didn't
just hurt Xiang Nan.

86
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:11,454
He hurt my family,

87
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:15,135
and someone

88
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:16,654
incredibly important to me.

89
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:18,214
I'm sure he's hurt

90
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:19,534
you deeply too.

91
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:30,695
You hate Jiang Hongbin,

92
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,375
and I hate him even more.

93
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,534
He reported my dual nationality,

94
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,175
sending me back to Canada.

95
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:42,695
He promised me money

96
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,375
but only gave me a third of it.

97
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,574
I was sued when I got back.

98
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:48,214
I'm stuck

99
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:50,454
in this godforsaken place,

100
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:54,974
which is nothing different
from being imprisoned.

101
00:05:58,094 --> 00:05:59,014
But,

102
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,135
no matter how terrible he is,

103
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,574
he's still my daughter's father.

104
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:07,495
I...

105
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:11,375
I have no choice

106
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:12,855
but to rely on him.

107
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:20,574
Look,

108
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:23,855
I can't even trust

109
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,414
the closest people in my life.

110
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:27,574
Why would I trust you,

111
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:28,974
someone who has no relationship with me?

112
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:32,214
What if you lose

113
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:32,935
the divorce case?

114
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:33,894
Well.

115
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:35,695
Let's say you win the case.

116
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,295
How do I know you won't back out

117
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,615
and refuse to give me the money?

118
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:40,974
I don't trust things

119
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,815
that can't be seen.

120
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:45,414
Who knows I will have

121
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:47,375
to argue over this with you
across the Pacific?

122
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,334
I don't have the energy.

123
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:53,334
So,

124
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:57,055
I can't help you.

125
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,815
Don't come looking for me again,

126
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:00,574
okay?

127
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,295
Even if you come, I won't meet you.

128
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:04,414
Ms. Li,

129
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:06,414
send the guest off.

130
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:09,735
Xu Sumin,

131
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,375
if you can't pay back the money,

132
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:13,055
you won't be able to leave Canada.

133
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:14,574
Your daughter will remain

134
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:15,935
under Jian Hongbin's control in China.

135
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,414
Do you think he'll ever let Xiaotong

136
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:19,375
come back?

137
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:20,894
Are you okay

138
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:22,495
with never seeing your daughter again?

139
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,375
Please leave.

140
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,440
(Jiang Hongbin)

141
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,375
What's the matter? Speak.

142
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:17,574
When are you going to give me

143
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,094
the rest of the money?

144
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:20,774
As soon as possible.

145
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:22,815
How soon?

146
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,815
Can you stop pushing me?

147
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,534
You never intend

148
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:29,935
to give it to me,

149
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:31,135
right?

150
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:34,214
It's not that I don't want to.

151
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:35,534
It's that I really

152
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,454
don't have that much right now.

153
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:37,934
You're not going

154
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,615
to give me the rest, right?

155
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:45,774
Xu Sumin,

156
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:49,615
are you asking for too much?

157
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:07,255
Madam,

158
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,014
the lady left a note

159
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:10,654
on the door.

160
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:26,294
(This is my hotel address
and contact number.)

161
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:29,135
(I have a 180-day stay in Canada.)

162
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:30,735
(Once you make up your mind,)

163
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:31,814
(you can come find me anytime.)

164
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,255
(If you couldn't make it this time,)

165
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:35,975
(I will come back again next time.)

166
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,894
(If we lose the divorce case,)

167
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,255
(regarding the money,)

168
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:43,534
(even if we have to sell
our house and car,)

169
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:45,095
(we may not meet)

170
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:46,294
(all your demands.)

171
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,975
(But, it's still be
a significant sum of money.)

172
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,135
(For the sake of Xiang Nan,)

173
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:54,534
(my family will go all out.)

174
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,654
(Even if there's only a slim chance,)

175
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,054
(I'll fight for my family.)

176
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:20,095
Ms. Li.

177
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:22,774
Ms. Li!

178
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:25,495
Madam.

179
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,135
Tomorrow, please deliver
something for me

180
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:35,774
to this address.

181
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,540
(Arrivals)

182
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:20,654
Attorney Wu,

183
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:21,735
I currently have

184
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,054
a very important document.

185
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:24,654
If you're still awake,

186
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:25,855
I can bring them to you right now.

187
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:26,575
Is that okay?

188
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:32,654
Happy birthday.

189
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:35,894
♪Happy birthday to you♪

190
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:39,455
♪Happy birthday to you♪

191
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:43,335
♪Happy birthday to you♪

192

Happy birthday, Mum.

193
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,174
Come on.

194
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,174
Mum.

195
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:52,694
Mum, I love you the most.

196
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,534
Mum, I wish you to stay young forever,

197
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,215
always eighteen!

198
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:57,575
Okay.

199
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:58,575
I also wish for Mum

200
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:00,934
to always stay with us,

201
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,135
happy every day.

202
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:02,774
Alright.

203
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:04,414
Happy.

204
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:05,934
Qian, come make a wish!

205
00:13:06,174 --> 00:13:06,694
Make a wish.

206
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:07,455
Come on, hurry up!

207
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:08,694
Make a wish!

208
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:09,654
Thank you for all you do.

209
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:10,774
Our family never celebrates birthdays.

210
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,894
- We should celebrate it.
- That's right.

211
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,095
Everyone has a chance
to change luck then.

212
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,495
So, I'm the one
to change everyone's luck.

213
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:18,814
You're right.

214
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,294
We're using you to bring good fortune.

215
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:21,735
Hurry up.

216
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:22,694
Make a wish.

217
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:31,294
I'm done. Let's blow the candle.

218
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:39,014
Happy birthday.

219
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,135
Shall we take a group photo?

220
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,455
- Who's holding it?
- I'll do it.

221
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,255
Come on.

222
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,615
Come here.

223
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:49,814
Three, two, one...

224
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,135
Happy birthday!

225
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,095
Happy birthday!

226
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:54,534
I want to eat cake.

227
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,135
You're having it now.

228
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,294
You can't be that greedy.

229
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:00,455
Here's the longevity noodles for you!

230
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:01,215
Here you go!

231
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,455
Here, Xiang Qian.

232
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:03,215
Thank you, Dad.

233
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:03,814
Here you go.

234
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:06,414
Dad has never

235
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:07,375
celebrated your birthday.

236
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,054
Don't blame Dad.

237
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:10,375
Happy birthday.

238
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:11,534
Thank you, Dad.

239
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,615
From now on,
whenever it's someone's birthday,

240
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:15,894
we'll all gather

241
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:17,135
to celebrate together.

242
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,534
Remember what your dad said,

243
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:20,455
otherwise he will forget it next year.

244
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,335
The same goes for Cong and Qi.

245
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:23,375
I want to have eggs too.

246
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:25,174
- Sure!
- I want it too.

247
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,654
Everyone will have it.

248
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:28,375
Aren't you going to let us eat already?

249
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,215
Everyone will have it.

250
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,375
Come on.

251
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:35,495
I'm digging in.

252
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:36,375
How is it?

253
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,174
Eat up.

254
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:39,575
So delicious.

255
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:41,054
Mum,

256
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,495
isn't there a saying
that goes like this,

257
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:45,054
"Dumplings before leaving,
noodles after coming back"?

258
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:47,934
"Noodles after coming back,
dumplings before leaving"?

259
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,615
Yes, you're right.

260
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,774
I said it the other way round.

261
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,135
It just so happened that I've returned.

262
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:56,814
Before leaving...

263
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:58,855
Eating dumplings before leaving

264
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,014
denotes a smooth journey.

265
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,975
And, eating noodles after coming back

266
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:04,975
means you're staying longer,

267
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:05,814
getting grounded here.

268
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,615
Then, we still owe Qian a dumpling meal.

269
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:09,174
You're right.

270
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:11,934
I'm not leaving anymore.

271
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,774
I want some too.

272
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,414
I want some too.

273
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:16,495
I want some too.

274
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:17,135
Is there more?

275
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:17,814
There is.

276
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:18,934
I'll get a bowl for you.

277
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:19,894
That's great.

278
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:20,654
Do you want it too?

279
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:21,294
Yeah, I can have some noodles!

280
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:22,014
Anyone else want it?

281
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:23,455
Me!

282
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:24,335
Everyone will get it.

283
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:25,375
I want to eat eggs.

284
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,335
Everyone will get it.

285
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:28,135
Come.

286
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,735
How annoying!

287
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:12,135
What's going on?

288
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,095
Get up!

289
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,455
Let me read you a message.

290
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:20,495
After I got off the plane yesterday,

291
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:21,735
I passed the materials

292
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:22,735
Xu Sumin gave me

293
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:23,975
to Attorney Wu.

294
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:26,827
He probably

295
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:28,927
read them last night.

296
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:31,261
This is what he replied.

297
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:33,208
He said that he and his colleagues

298
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,330
analyzed

299
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:35,774
the materials.

300
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:38,534
The evidence is sufficient

301
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,575
and he's already reported the case to
the Economic Crime Investigation Bureau.

302
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:48,495
God is watching!

303
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:52,654
I just woke up too suddenly.

304
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:04,534
Don't cry anymore.

305
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,815
I love my sisters.

306
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:20,934
It's okay.

307
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:22,815
I'm okay.

308
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,295
I'm just too happy.

309
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,454
Zhong, you smell so good.

310
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,375
Do you like it?

311
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:50,934
Cheers! It's my pleasure
to cooperate with you.

312
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:51,855
Cheers! It's my pleasure
to cooperate with you.

313
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:52,494
Thank you so much

314
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:53,174
for your support, Mr. Jiang.

315
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:54,694
I look forward to more
collaboration in the future, Mr. Jiang.

316
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,934
Let's work together.

317
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:56,494
Here you go.

318
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:58,535
Mr. Jiang!

319
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:00,095
Don't you know how to knock?

320
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:00,894
No...

321
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:01,775
Outside...

322
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:06,974
Are you Jiang Hongbin?

323
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:08,734
What's up?

324
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,615
We're from Suzhou
Public Security Bureau,

325
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:11,734
Economic Crime Investigation Unit.

326
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:13,095
You're suspected of tax evasion,

327
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:13,815
money laundering,

328
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,654
illegal transfer and resale
of land use rights,

329
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,654
bid-rigging, and multiple other charges.

330
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:18,615
We are now legally

331
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:19,494
summoning you.

332
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:20,734
This is the summons.

333
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:22,095
Please cooperate with our investigation.

334
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:28,974
All the amateur players

335
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:30,015
are gathering around again.

336
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:31,615
Don't gamble.

337
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:35,295
Hello.

338
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:39,815
You're so comfortable, huh!

339
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,615
Finally I came to see you.

340
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:04,615
How are you?

341
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,454
I'm doing well.

342
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:10,734
I've got food and drinks here,

343
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,734
and not so much to worry about.

344
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:13,934
It's like I'm taking

345
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:14,894
a long holiday for myself.

346
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:18,615
Thank you for all you do.

347
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,055
You sound so formal.

348
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,575
I heard

349
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:30,335
Jiang Hongbin got arrested.

350
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,375
He has serious

351
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:35,375
economic issues.

352
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:38,535
I knew it.

353
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:40,095
If we look into it closely,

354
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:41,894
we'd find his weaknesses.

355
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,454
Too bad it wasn't you who found them.

356
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,454
But, I was the one who hinted at it.

357
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:58,214
Is your family doing well?

358
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:01,974
Xiang Nan got divorced.

359
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,335
She's with friends in Jingdezhen now.

360
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:07,174
Xiang Zhong and Deng Haiyang

361
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:09,015
are still taking their time,

362
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,375
but I think they're moving

363
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,575
in a good direction.

364
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:17,855
How about you?

365
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:21,615
I...

366
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:23,894
I just focus on working hard

367
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:26,254
and seriously every day,

368
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,615
to keep our company alive.

369
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:31,694
Anyway, we haven't gone bankrupt yet.

370
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:34,974
That's great.

371
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:37,095
As long as everything is stable,
that's good.

372
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:38,894
When I get out later,

373
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:40,615
I'll turn things around.

374
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,135
Take care.

375
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:49,055
Hmm...

376
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:53,254
I wanted to ask you something.

377
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:55,335
Go ahead, I'm listening.

378
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:00,815
Five years ago.

379
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:03,694
No, it's six years ago now.

380
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:07,894
You didn't attend my wedding.

00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:56,414
have been in Jingdezhen for so long

572
00:30:56,575 --> 00:30:57,855
and only made this much?

573
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,575
One big box and one small luggage,

574
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:00,654
isn't that enough?

575
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:01,894
How can this be enough?

576
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:02,615
Do you know

577
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,095
how popular your art piece is?

578
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:05,335
Oh my goodness!

579
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:06,174
Do you know that a few of us

580
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:07,535
are in the studio working non-stop?

581
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,254
Our eyes are practically going blind.

582
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:10,535
Can't you have some sympathy for us?

583
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:11,535
You've really worked hard for it.

584
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:12,494
You're so heartless!

585
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:13,654
Come on, take a seat.

586
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:15,135
Whether you care about me or not,

587
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,494
you should at least care
about your man, Lv Liang,

588
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:17,375
okay?

589
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:19,974
How's he doing?

590
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:21,375
He's fine.

591
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,295
Still in the 'workaholic' phase.

592
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:26,454
When will he be back?

593
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:27,775
I miss him.

594
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:29,894
You talk every day on the phone.

595
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:31,414
Isn't that enough?

596
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:33,615
It's not the same
as seeing him in person.

597
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:35,254
Here you go.

598
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,654
I pass this ticket to you first.

599
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:39,855
Xiaotong will be back
in Shanghai next week

600
00:31:39,894 --> 00:31:40,815
for a boxing match.

601
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,615
This is a VIP ticket
she saved just for you.

602
00:31:43,095 --> 00:31:44,335
Such a good girl!

603
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:46,135
We'll go together then

604
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:47,174
to support her.

605
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:47,734
Sure!

606
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:51,894
How are you doing lately?

607
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,615
I'm doing great, and busy with the shop.

608
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:55,894
Oh yeah,

609
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,055
I visited my brother last week.

610
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,535
How is he?

611
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:05,335
He's getting old,

612
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:06,974
and his hair turns gray.

613
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,375
But, he is in a good state.

614
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,414
He told me something.

615
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:14,214
He told me

616
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:15,135
that my parents

617
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,414
didn't actually die in a car accident.

618
00:32:19,174 --> 00:32:21,214
My dad used to hit my mum,

619
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:22,535
and my mum can't take it anymore.

620
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:25,135
One day,

621
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:27,015
she got my dad drunk

622
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,654
and turned on the gas.

623
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,335
He hid it from me all these years,

624
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,775
because he worried
that I couldn't take it.

625
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:45,974
At least your brother

626
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:48,295
genuinely cares for you.

627
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,535
I know.

628
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:55,615
How about you?

629
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:57,934
Do you still resent him?

630
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:03,894
To be honest,

631
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:05,855
I don't even think about hating

632
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,015
or not.

633
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:10,295
Now, I just want

634
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,174
to live my own life well,

635
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:14,974
focus on my career,

636
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:17,055
and take care of my family.

637
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:19,734
I hope that all of us

638
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:21,055
can keep moving forward.

639
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,734
Well said. Moving forward.

640
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,934
There'll be regular
checkups every month.

641
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:48,055
Xiang Zhong is twelve weeks along now
and needs to create a pregnancy profile.

642
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:49,214
After that,

643
00:33:49,335 --> 00:33:50,454
she'll have to do monthly checkups.

644
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:50,934
Look.

645
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:51,575
That's great.

646
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:53,214
What is this?

647
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:54,494
Xiang Zhiying is having fun.

648
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:55,815
A postcard.

649
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:56,694
Look.

650
00:33:57,694 --> 00:33:58,734
This is from Yichang.

651
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:00,015
In Sichuan, right?

652
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:01,414
This place looks pretty nice.

653
00:34:01,454 --> 00:34:02,295
What Sichuan?

654
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:03,454
That's Yibin, right?

655
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:05,174
Where is Yichang again, Dad?

656
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:08,095
In Hubei, where the
Gezhouba Dam is located.

657
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:08,494
Oh, you...

658
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:09,295
Gezhouba Dam.

659
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:10,775
That's right.

660
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,615
Yibin is known for its wine.

661
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:15,654
Alright.

662
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,135
I didn't learn it well.

663
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:18,055
My geography is poor.

664
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:18,935
I'm not good at geography.

665
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:19,694
Xiang Qian.

666
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:22,975
Will Chai Jin have time to come over?

667
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,575
I bought a coral grouper.

668
00:34:25,174 --> 00:34:26,294
Chai Jin went on
a business trip to Beijing.

669
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:27,174
He's not back yet.

670
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:28,455
He's just got freedom,

671
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:29,654
and you let him go on a business trip?

672
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:31,174
He's my leader.

673
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:32,615
I have no control over him.

674
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:34,254
When he returns,

675
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:35,254
have him come over.

676
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:36,254
He has helped our family

677
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:37,334
so much,

678
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:38,814
we should thank him.

679
00:34:39,095 --> 00:34:39,654
Tell him

680
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:41,615
that I'll drink with him.

681
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:42,254
Just let him come over.

682
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,854
It should be him drinking with you.

683
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:49,535
Can you please let me save some face?

684
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:51,734
See, your daughter knows you well.

685
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:52,694
Oh no!

686
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,294
This girl is too much.

687
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,174
She's really your daughter!

688
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:58,174
For the coral grouper,

689
00:34:58,294 --> 00:34:59,374
I can eat too.

690
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:00,654
What should I do now?

691
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:02,615
You two are really...

692
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:05,455
(Chai Jin: Safely landed, don't worry.)

693
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:10,975
My dad said when you get back
from the business trip,

694
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:12,294
come over for dinner at my home.

695
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:14,015
He wants to have a drink-off with you.

696
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:19,895
(Chai Jin: Yes, madam.)

697
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:22,895
Do you need my help?

698
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:24,095
No, no.

699
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:26,575
I have to be diligent
in getting good food.

700
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:33,774
Driver,

701
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:35,495
could you please go a little faster?

702
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:44,615
Wait.

703
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:45,814
I still feel like eating something.

704
00:35:46,015 --> 00:35:46,935
Don't eat anymore, it's too late.

705
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:47,734
Still awake?

706
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:48,615
Who's this?

707
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:49,455
Both of you haven't slept yet.

708
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:51,214
You have a big room with a big bed,

709
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:52,374
but coming here to squeeze with us.

710
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,135
I'm here to chat
with the pregnant mummy.

711
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:56,015
Zhong,

712
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:57,174
when's your due date?

713
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:00,254
It should be March 10th,

714
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:00,854
next year.

715
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:01,774
Zhong,

716
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:03,935
have you ever thought

717
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:05,055
about what would you do

718
00:36:05,055 --> 00:36:06,334
if one day Deng Haiyang

719
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,214
reverted to his old ways?

720
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,135
I really haven't thought about it.

721
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:10,015
If it happens, it happens.

722
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,455
I can't control it.

723
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:12,814
As long as I'm happy.

724
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:15,254
Now you sound

725
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:17,135
both confident and carefree.

726
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:18,935
I've completely

727
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:19,935
made peace with myself.

728
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,575
I completely accept myself.

729
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,455
I feel like, right now,

730
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,694
I can choose to be pregnant,

731
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:26,734
I can choose

732
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:27,814
a job I like,

733
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,015
and I can choose

734
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,734
to go where I want to go.

735
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,895
In short, as long as

736
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:35,214
we have a choice, we don't have
to be afraid of anything.

737
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:37,374
Yeah, not afraid of anything.

738
00:36:37,814 --> 00:36:38,535
I tell you,

739
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:40,415
Deng Haiyang is good.

740
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:40,935
Yeah.

741
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:41,654
But, no matter how,

742
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:43,334
he just has a few quirks.

743
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,254
You need to keep reminding him

744
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:46,814
and make sure you don't do

745
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:48,734
all the parenting alone.

746
00:36:49,015 --> 00:36:50,294
You have to let him help you

747
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:50,935
with the kid.

748
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:51,694
That's right.

749
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:53,575
Whether he turns over a new leaf or not,

750
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,615
I feel you should influence him.

751
00:36:55,975 --> 00:36:57,214
Alright, I'll

752
00:36:58,654 --> 00:36:59,455
educate him bit by bit.

753
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:00,854
With you two,

754
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:01,814
no matter what,

755
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:02,935
Deng Haiyang

756
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:03,895
doesn't want to leave you.

757
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:04,615
That's right.

758
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:05,654
If he doesn't change himself,

759
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:06,615
I wouldn't want to stay either.

760
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:07,455
That's right.

761
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:09,374
Having kids later

762
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:10,214
is another chapter,

763
00:37:10,254 --> 00:37:11,895
and new problems might arise.

764
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:13,535
Yes.

765
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:15,854
Just think of him like a kid.

766
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:16,495
Deng Haiyang

767
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:17,535
is like a kid.

768
00:37:17,895 --> 00:37:18,495
You need

769
00:37:18,495 --> 00:37:19,455
to educate him too.

770
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,174
Oh my goodness.

771
00:37:20,294 --> 00:37:21,575
It's like having two kids at home now.

772
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,055
Look at our mum and dad.

773
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:23,854
On the surface,

774
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:25,015
it looks like Dad is pampering Mum,

775
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:25,975
but actually,

776
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:26,935
Mum is the one giving in to him.

777
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:27,495
That's true.

778
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,455
She just let him feel like
he's pampering her,

779
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:31,895
right?

780
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,135
Our mum is wise.

781
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:34,095
You're right.

782
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,455
Who left these three cards here?

783
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:36,455
Here, this is for you.

784
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:37,774
"Go to bed early, and get up early".

785
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:39,895
Who left this here?

786
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,095
I really go to bed early,
and get up early recently.

787
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,095
"Life is like an ocean.",
here's one for you.

788
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:43,694
"Life is like an ocean"?

789
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:45,415
You've still got
a long journey ahead of you.

790
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:46,415

Haiyang,

802
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,055
household registration booklet, ID card,

803
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:22,895
and birth permit,

804
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:23,975
did you bring everything?

805
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:25,334
Yes, yes.

806
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:25,975
I've got everything.

807
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:26,774
You have to check carefully.

808
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:27,334
I tell you,

809
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:28,294
after the child is born,

810
00:38:28,535 --> 00:38:29,774
you'll need all of them
for the birth certificate.

811
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,214
You can't miss even one thing.

812
00:38:31,415 --> 00:38:31,895
Don't worry.

813
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:32,654
I checked

814
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:33,615
over eighty times last night.

815
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:34,615
Nothing's missing.

816
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:35,214
Here, here.

817
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:36,174
I'll carry it.

818
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:36,975
You stay at home.

819
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:38,055
The car can't accommodate more.

820
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:38,975
I'll lend a hand.

821
00:38:40,495 --> 00:38:41,214
Xiang Qian,

822
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:42,814
are you going to the hospital too?

823
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:43,575
Yes, I'm going.

824
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:44,575
That's great then.

825
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,374
If you didn't go,

826
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:46,975
we couldn't rest assured.

827
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:47,975
That's great.

828
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:48,415
I'll go. I'll go.

829
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:49,135
We both will be there.

830
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:49,895
Great!

831
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:52,015
Have you taken the maternity bag?

832
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:53,694
Mum, it's over here!

833
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:54,374
We got it all.

834
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,095
Check again carefully

835
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:56,214
to see if anything is missed.

836
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:57,694
So, you don't have to rush
back later for anything.

837
00:38:57,734 --> 00:38:58,734
It's fine if they miss anything,

838
00:38:58,734 --> 00:38:59,654
I'll just come back to take it.

839
00:38:59,694 --> 00:39:00,694
Alright then.

840
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:03,774
Where's my wife?

841
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:05,174
Oh yeah!

842
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:06,254
Oh right!

843
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:07,935
We're all busy here.

844
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:09,214
You guys forgot me huh?

845
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:10,734
Oh my goodness!

846
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:11,895
Sorry, sorry.

847
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:14,455
We forgot the most important person.

848
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:15,415
Hey,

849
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:16,854
what were you doing?

850
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:19,095
Be careful.

851
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,135
I'm so clumsy now.

852
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:21,135
Here you go.

853
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:23,495
Be careful.

854
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:24,495
When I delivered Xiang Zhong back then,

855
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:25,615
I brought along Xiang Qian's

856
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:26,935
auspicious lock charm with me.

857
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:28,174
I'll go get it and put it on her.

858
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,095
That's alright.

859
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:29,734
Don't go anymore.

860
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:30,455
Leave it to me.

861
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,575
Wearing it helps the birth
to go on smoothly.

862
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:32,935
I really can't tolerate you.

863
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:33,975
Look at your mum.

864
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:34,975
Hold this car key for me.

865
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:36,015
Where are you going?

866
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:37,135
I need to help Mum find it.

867
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,015
She might not be able to find it.

868
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:39,374
Mum, where did you put it?

869
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:40,415
I can find it.

870
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:42,095
I can find it.

871
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:44,214
Do you think Zhong

872
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:46,214
will have a boy or a girl?

873
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,854
Wait, I need to go to the washroom.

874
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:50,774
What's wrong with her?

875
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:51,415
She needs to go to the washroom.

876
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:52,615
I'll go with her.

877
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:54,055
Let me do it.

878
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:56,814
- She needs to go.
- She has to go.

879
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:58,015
Let's go.

880
00:39:58,774 --> 00:39:59,415
Walk slowly.

881
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:00,334
Not too worried.

882
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:01,374
Of course, I have to.

883
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:03,415
This is a crucial moment.

884
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:05,174
Don't hold me like this.

885
00:40:05,254 --> 00:40:06,615
Of course, I have to hold you.

886
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:07,975
Let's go.

887
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:13,334
You go too.

888
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,575
Go help your mum.

889
00:40:14,734 --> 00:40:16,095
Dad, they just went inside.

890
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:17,935
They'll be here in a while. No rush.

891
00:40:18,535 --> 00:40:19,575
You this child...

892
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:23,254
Alright, I'll go then.

893
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:37,734
I'll go too.

894
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,654
Dad, Mum,

895
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:52,294
aren't you leaving?

896
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:56,055
You all...

897
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,174
Why are you all up there?

898
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:00,774
Come upstairs.

899
00:41:01,615 --> 00:41:02,575
What's going on?

900
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:07,774
Why is everyone here?

901
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:09,654
What are you looking at?

902
00:41:10,774 --> 00:41:11,254
Look.

903
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:12,055
What happens?

904
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:13,975
What are you looking at?

905
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:15,095
That big flower,

906
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:16,214
didn't you see it?

907
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:22,135
When did that flower bloom?

908
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,254
It's beautiful.

909
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:24,535
Look, the sun is coming out.

910
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:25,294
It smells so fragrant.

911
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:26,135
Let's record a video.

912
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:27,654
Record a video?

913
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:28,455
Yeah, take one.

914
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:30,814
Such a memorable moment.

915
00:41:30,814 --> 00:41:31,615
This is wonderful.

916
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:37,654
(Looking at my parents,)

917
00:41:38,575 --> 00:41:39,615
(my two sisters,)

918
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:42,294
(and thinking of my two little)

919
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,615
(innocent children,)

920
00:41:45,055 --> 00:41:46,654
(I suddenly feel so content.)

921
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:49,575
(My parents are healthy,)

922
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:51,615
(the kids are growing up happily.)

923
00:41:53,254 --> 00:41:54,694
(So, despite all the hurt)

924
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:55,935
(and betrayals,)

925
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:58,455
(the kindness and gentleness,)

926
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:00,694
(it all makes each of us)

927
00:42:00,774 --> 00:42:02,055
(stronger)

928
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:05,654
(and cherish our
family members even more.)

929
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,294
(Seeing the magnolias bloom)

930
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:12,575
(and awaiting the arrival
of our little angel)

931
00:42:13,694 --> 00:42:15,495
(are the wonderful moments for us.)

932
00:42:18,854 --> 00:42:20,174
(Perhaps, to you,)

933
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:21,495
(this maybe just)

934
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:23,015
(another ordinary day.)

935
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:25,615
(But, to our family,)

936
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:27,575
(today)

937
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:30,254
