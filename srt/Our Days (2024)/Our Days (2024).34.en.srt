00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 34=

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
Xiang Nan is home alone?

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
Xiang Zhong got off work

6
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,361
and went back to keep her company.

7
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:50,760
Your parents

8
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,721
must've found out about this, right?

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,760
My dad's reaction was extremely intense.

10
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:00,081
Did he go to Jiang Hongbin

11
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:00,921
to teach him a lesson?

12
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:02,641
He went,

13
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:03,721
but he didn't do much.

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,521
Boss,

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,761
thank you for always taking care of me

16
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:16,880
all these years.

17
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,840
Not to mention, you take care of

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,201
my family matters, too.

19
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,481
I'll still have to trouble you

20
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,481
to keep taking care of me in the future.

21
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:30,840
Why do I feel like

22
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,400
there's a hidden meaning in your words?

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,720
What's the meaning of this?

24
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:37,801
You're not thinking of

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,321
taking the fall for me, are you?

26
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,440
I won't.

27
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,601
Xiang Qian, I know you too well.

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,440
You care about Xiang Nan very much

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,321
and you don't want to hurt me.

30
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,641
You are the person
who would do such a thing.

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Listen,

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not a freeloader.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,840
Do you think I can't settle this matter?

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,921
You are underestimating me.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,280
If Xiang Nan wants a divorce,

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,481
just let her.

37
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:02,960
You don't have to

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,120
worry about me at all.

39
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,921
How are you going to settle it?

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,440
Well, he...

41
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:09,521
Jiang Hongbin

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,481
has been a businessman
for half his life.

43
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,720
There's no way he doesn't have
some weaknesses.

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,081
Yes, he definitely has weaknesses,

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,241
but he also extremely capable.

46
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:17,840
When will we find out

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,880
his weakness?

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,201
If you want to find his weaknesses,

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
there's no way you can't find any.

50
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,361
I'm a grown man.

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,601
I take responsibility
for my own actions.

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,280
Do you really need
to take the fall for me?

53
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:39,601
If the two of us

54
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:41,400
didn't start a business together,

55
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,160
if I didn't

56
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:44,400
go to Jiang Hongbin...

57
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,801
If?

58
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,000
There are no ifs.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,361
I'll repeat.

60
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:50,880
Xiang Qian,

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,120
I take responsibility
for my own actions.

62
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,321
You're supporting a family,

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,761
your parents,

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,361
your two sisters,

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,201
and your two children.

66
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,241
Don't be dumb,

67
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:01,960
listen to me.

68
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,361
Aren't you going to treat me to dinner?

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
Are we eating or not?

70
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,880
I finally get to take advantage of you.

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,641
Come,

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,761
let's order food.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,200
(Xiang Zhong)

74
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,081
That's enough.

75
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,840
Let's not talk about this during dinner.

76
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,320
This...

77
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,000
Hello, Zhong?

78
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:25,361
Hello, Qian.

79
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:26,320
Xiang Nan is missing.

80
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:27,520
What?

81
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,961
Wasn't she home with you?

82
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes,

83
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,161
I went downstairs to take out the trash

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,481
and as soon as I came up, she was gone.

85
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,120
I got it.

86
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:36,440
Who's missing?

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,041
What's wrong?

88
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,000
You can't take advantage of me today.

89
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,801
Xiang Nan is missing,

90
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:40,481
I need to go find her.

91
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,041
Then I'll go with you.

92
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:42,880
No need.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,721
Why not?

94
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:45,241
Wait,

95
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:45,880
you still owe me a meal.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,281
There will be interest, I'm telling you.

97
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,841
Hello, any news?

98
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:27,161
No.

99
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,080
She's not answering my call.

100
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,880
I'm worried that she...

101
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,320
I hope she's not
looking for Jiang Hongbin.

102
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm driving to Suzhou

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
to take a look.

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
Fine, I'll be there right away too.

105
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,080
What for?

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,841
Just wait at home.

107
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,000
What if she comes back?

108
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:43,680
Fine.

109
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,640
Anyway, just let me know

110
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,601
when there's news.

111
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:46,640
I'm hanging up.

112
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,640
Call me when she's back.

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,440
Sure.

114
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,760
Madam, you are back.

115
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,041
I'll get you slippers.

116
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:05,801
Ms. Liu.

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,801
Why is there no one at home?

118
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:14,401
Mr. Jiang hasn't come back yet.

119
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:15,520
Ms. He is still taking care of Miss

120
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,640
at the hospital.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
Xiaotong is not home either.

122
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,200
Alright.

123
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,161
I'll go upstairs first.

124
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:00,880
Hello.

125
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:01,841
Mr. Jiang,

126
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,841
Madam is back.

127
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:03,560
I got it.

128
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,200
Who is it?

129
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:03,401
Madam,

130
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,520
I made you bird's nest porridge.

131
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,281
I'll eat it downstairs later.

132
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:09,880
Thanks.

133
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,640
OK.

134
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:49,400
Mr. Jiang,

135
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,400
Madam is in the bedroom upstairs.

136
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,000
You are back.

137
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,321
Jiang, we need to talk.

138
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:15,961
Fine.

139
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,601
Jiang,

140
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,400
honestly, before we got married,

141
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
I always thought you were

142
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,481
the person who loves me the most.

143
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,280
You were so good to me.

144
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,961
You were so gentle and considerate,

145
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:39,760
and you treated my family well too.

146
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,760
I really don't understand

147
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,400
why we are in this state today.

148
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:44,880
You...

149
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,400
Why did you do so many things

150
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,601
that hurt me?

151
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:55,841
I don't know why

152
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,241
things are in this state now,

153
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:03,441
but Xiang Nan,

154
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,760
I still love you very much.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,040
I hope we can

156
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:11,961
forget the past

157
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,760
and restart.

158
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,040
Jiang, I can't just forget.

159
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:17,841
When I look at you,

160
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,640
all I can think about is

161
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,160
the image of you hitting me.

162
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:22,201
I... I really can't forget it,

163
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,841
I keep thinking about you
strangling my neck.

164
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,561
Xiang Nan,

165
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,681
I know.

166
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,481
I know that it's my fault.

167
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,241
I was too impulsive.

168
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:31,800
Give me a chance.

169
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,760
Can you forgive me?

170
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,040
We can have a baby.

171
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,640
When we have a child,

172
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:39,361
everything will pass,

173
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:40,841
alright?

174
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,920
Xiang Nan, give me a chance,

175
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,601
I'm begging you.

176
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:46,361
Give me a chance,

177
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:48,120
please?

178
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,280
This is a letter of commitment.

179
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,201
Sign this,

180
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,201
(Anti-domestic Violence Agreement)
and you have to promise me

181
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,081
to never hit me, scold me,

182
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,241
and rape me again.

183
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,800
Rape?

184
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,601
We are husband and wife.

185
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,561
But you hit me that day.

186
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,561
You choked me,

187
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:24,561
pressed me on the bed,

188
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:25,841
and forced me to have sex.

189
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,561
That is rape.

190
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:27,241
Enough!

191
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,681
I'll say it again.

192
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,000
I didn't rape you.

193
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,520
Yes,

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,561
I was a little impulsive at the time,

195
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,280
I...

196
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,241
But we are protected by law.

197
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,961
I didn't rape you.

198
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,120
Rape also means
forced sexual intercourse.

199
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,241
It is a coercive act

200
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,441
of forcibly engaging

201
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,601
in sexual intercourse with the victim

202
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,601
against their will using violence,

203
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,601
threats, or other means.

204
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:55,601
Forcing anyone into a sexual act

205
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,601
against their will

206
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,481
is called rape.

207
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,241
It has nothing to do
with whether you are married or not.

208
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,561
Have you gone to a lawyer?

209
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:10,681
You seem very well prepared.

210
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:12,721
Yes.

211
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,640
I have consulted a lawyer,

212
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:18,520
because I was too fearful.

213
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,321
I can't just believe

214
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:22,721
your verbal promise.

215
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,201
Sign the agreement,

216
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,400
so I can trust you

217
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,760
to never hit me

218
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,561
or do anything to harm me again,

219
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,601
can you?

220
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
(Anti-domestic Violence Agreement)

221
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,681
You came back

222
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:53,601
just to talk to me about this?

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,081
You want a promise, right?

224
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,160
Fine,

225
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,321
I'll give it to you.

226
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,040
Here!

227
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:22,561
Xiang Nan,

228
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,721
I love you so much,

229
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,081
and this is how you treat me?

230
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:51,441
Qian,

231
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,601
I can't wait here any longer.

232
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,681
I went downstairs

233
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,321
and searched around the area

234
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,280
but I couldn't find her.

235
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,321
How about I go to Kunshan

236
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,280
to see

237
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:00,481
if she's at Dad and Mum's place?

238
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:01,561
Let me know

239
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:02,481
when there's any update.

240
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,560
Xiang Nan?

241
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:39,641
What are you doing in here?

242
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,600
Xiang Nan, how are you feeling?

243
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,280
Get out.

244
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:45,201
Get out!

245
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,721
Slowly.

246
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,520
Slowly.

247
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:55,080
I told you to get out,

248
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,121
can't you hear me?

249
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,401
You must be Madam's eldest sister.

250
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,560
Where is Xiang Nan?

251
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:15,000
An ambulance

252
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:16,481
just took her away.

253
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:18,881
Go to the hospital now.

254
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:23,401
I'll follow you.

255
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:24,161
Alright.

256
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,440
(Emergency)

257
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,600
That's it.

258
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:32,520
Make sure not to let the wound get wet

259
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,641
when you return.

260
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Alright, thank you.

261
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,040
You're welcome.

262
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,401
Here.

263
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:09,121
Xiang Nan.

264
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,441
Xiang Nan.

265
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:11,320
Qian.

266
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,320
Why did you go home?

267
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:14,320
What's going on?

268
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:14,881
Qian.

269
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:15,641
Let me look at this.

270
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,441
I...

271
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,441
I wanted to go back

272
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,881
to record the evidence of Jiang Hongbin

273
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:21,840
admitting in person

274
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,201
that he hit me and assaulted me

275
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:24,721
but

276
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:26,000
he found out

277
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,520
and lost all control

278
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,881
after that.

279
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,600
He started hitting me.

280
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,921
He actually dares to commit violence?

281
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,721
All my injuries are just external

282
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,881
and they are all treated.

283
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,441
The serious part is
that Jiang Xiaotong discovered

284
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
that Jiang Hongbin was hitting me.

285
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,161
Then...

286
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,520
Then, she came to save me

287
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,681
but she fell

288
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:44,921
to the bottom of the stairs.

289
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:47,080
She's still in the emergency room.

290
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,800
What am I going to do?

291
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,080
I don't know her condition now.

292
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:53,600
Let's take Xiang Nan home first.

293
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:53,961
Yes.

294
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's not stay here anymore.

295
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,800
Slowly.

296
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:04,681
The doctor has already
treated your wounds,

297
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,121
right?

298
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:07,520
It's alright.

299
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,360
Are your legs alright?

300
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,520
Yes,

301
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,721
I just have some bruises.

302
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,000
Jiang Hongbin is really something,

303
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,080
not even his daughter is spared.

304
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,560
Boss,

305
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,401
well,

306
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:24,441
please

307
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,600
take Xiang Nan to the car.

308
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:27,280
I need to use the washroom.

309
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:27,800
Sure.

310
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:28,641
Wait for me in the car.

311
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,719
(Emergency room)

312
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:43,921
How is your daughter?

313
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,881
I actually don't care

314
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,600
about your daughter
for the slightest bit.

315
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:55,641
Xiang Nan is the one who actually

316
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,401
cares about her.

317
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,320
Don't you fear retribution

318
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
for treating her this way?

319
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:04,961
Jiang Hongbin, listen.

320
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,320
This is your last time

321
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,401
hurting my sister.

322
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:10,161
Just wait and pay the price.

323
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,641
I'm not in the mood
to talk to you right now.

324
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:14,921
You should hurry up and get Chai Jin

325
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:15,921
a good lawyer.

326
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,280
There's no need.

327
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,560
Whether it's me or Chai Jin,

328
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:23,201
we are both willing to pay any price

329
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,641
for Xiang Nan.

330
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,481
You, on the other hand,

331
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,840
should turn around to see
if anyone has your back.

332
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:02,401
Hello.

333
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:04,800
Alright.

334
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:11,840
Stop eating.

335
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,360
Time to work.

336
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,241
Crew Cut,

337
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:16,121
go gather some men.

338
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:17,760
What do you mean?

339
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,121
I'm not asking you to hurt anyone,

340
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,520
just scaring them will suffice.

341
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,760
What if I get caught?

342
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,721
Who's going to get caught?

343
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:25,560
Besides,

344
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,360
if you get locked up,

345
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,800
everyone gets extra 20,000 each.

346
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:33,441
Go.

347
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,121
Fortunately, my camera

348
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,800
caught what happened

349
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,320
and simultaneously

350
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,760
uploaded the footage
to the cloud server.

351
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,481
I guess this counts

352
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:51,721
as a part of the evidence.

353
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,560
Xiang Nan is in your sister's car.

354
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:08,760
They are safe.

355
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't worry.

356
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,560
I am right behind them.

357
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:13,000
I see.

358
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,481
How is Xiang Nan now?

359
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:15,681
Her injuries are examined

360
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,800
and treated.

361
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:18,201
Her emotions

362
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:20,320
are stable.

363
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,121
By the way,

364
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:25,320
she planted a camera

365
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:26,441
and caught the footage of Jiang Hongbin

366
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,241
hitting her.

367
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,121
Besides, it is uploaded

368
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,201
to the cloud server simultaneously.

369
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,681
It must have been
really difficult for her.

370
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,921
This counts

371
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:36,080
as evidence, right?

372
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,921
That could also be helpful
for the lawsuit.

373
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,800
Yes.

374
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,961
We are now

375
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,560
on our way

376
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:45,760
to send Xiang Nan home to rest.

377
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:47,360
We should reach soon.

378
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,600
You should stop worrying.

379
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,080
Alright.

380
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,721
Thank you.

381
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,401
I will

382
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
take care of my parents here.

383
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:54,080
Alright.

384
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,241
Are you home? I'll come find you.

385
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,520
I'm not home.

386
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,921
What's the matter?

387
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,961
My mother seemed to be

388
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:30,641
very clear-minded today

389
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,121
and she asked me to
send something to you.

390
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,360
It's fine. I'm not home.

391
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:36,360
Well,

392
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:37,080
where are you?

393
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm at my parents' place.

394
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:39,881
It's fine. I'll send it to you.

395
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,161
Don't come here.

396
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,080
It's late at night.

397
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:42,681
Stop traveling.

398
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:43,641
It's fine.

399
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:44,921
I'll be there in a moment.

400
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,881
Smash them!

401
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,121
Who is that? It's late at night.

402
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:00,320
Who are you?

403
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,760
Stop!

404
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,121
Did you hear that?

405
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:04,641
What are you doing?

406
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,881
Get out of my way!

407
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:07,800
What are you doing?

408
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,760
Stop!

409
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:09,641
Stop!

410
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,721
What are you doing?

411
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,600
Stop it!

412
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Shut up!

413
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:15,280
Get inside!

414
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,520
Dad!

415
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:21,560
Grandma!

416
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,360
Smash everything!

417
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:26,681
Call now.

418
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,121
I can't believe this.

419
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:36,121
What are you doing?

420
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,040
Do you have a death wish?

421
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,161
Grandma,

422
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,921
I want Mum.

423
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:50,681
I want to go home.

424
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,360
Xiang Zhong.

425
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,721
Xiang Zhong!

426
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,280
Stop!

427
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:57,881
Haiyang?

428
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:58,560
What are you doing?

429
00:26:58,721 --> 00:26:59,241
Deng Haiyang?

430
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:00,000
Deng Haiyang!

431
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,401
Don't.

432
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:02,201
Deng Haiyang!

433
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,201
Deng Haiyang, are you alright?

434
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:04,800
Are you injured?

435
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:05,600
Are you alright?

436
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,760
Get out of the way!

437
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:11,921
Stop!

438
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,721
Don't move!

439
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,560
Get down!

440
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:14,040
Stand still!

441
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:14,600
On your knees!

442
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:15,121
Don't move!

443
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,961
I'm fine.

444
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,241
Dad, listen to me.

445
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:29,760
Take the medicine.

446
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Oh, don't bother.

447
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:32,481
Just put it aside.

448
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:32,961
I'll eat it later.

449
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:33,600
It's not about that.

450
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:34,241
Tell me,

451
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,881
if your condition worsens

452
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,800
because of not taking it,

453
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,921
what is our family going to do?

454
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:37,921
Dad.

455
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:40,000
Look at him,
he's refusing to take medicine.

456
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,000
Xiang Qian.

457
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:41,881
Uncle,

458
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:43,040
this...

459
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,760
Look at all this.

460
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
What the heck happened here?

461
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,520
A group of hooligans rushed inside

462
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,481
and smashed the house into this state.

463
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,280
I...

464
00:27:51,441 --> 00:27:52,560
I don't even know the reason.

465
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,320
Haiyang was injured by them.

466
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,760
What do you think we should do?

467
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:56,560
Calm down first,

468
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,320
take the medicine.

469
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:58,800
Don't upset your heart again.

470
00:27:59,121 --> 00:27:59,881
This...

471
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,241
I... I'll make a call

472
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,201
to a housekeeping service company

473
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:02,840
to clean up

474
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:04,280
this mess.

475
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,721
Xiang Qian,

476
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:12,520
is this happening

477
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:14,441
because Jiang Hongbin

478
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:15,121
got someone to do it?

479
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,921
If it's really him,

480
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,681
How...

481
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,320
How can we deal with them?

482
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:21,961
If it is really Jiang Hongbin's doing,

483
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,881
he only has one purpose,

484
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,840
to not divorce Xiang Nan.

485
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:27,800
Even so, he can't do this.

486
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:29,280
Isn't this a gangster's doing? This...

487
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,481
I know.

488
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,921
Dad,

489
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,961
don't worry,

490
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,481
really.

491
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:33,641
Don't worry, don't yell.

492
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:34,280
Have a seat first.

493
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:40,320
I said I'd take care of it,

494
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,760
and so I will.

495
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,921
I'll go tomorrow.

496
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:46,721
The kids are inside.

497
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:59,040
Uncle, it's alright.

498
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,760
The housekeeping service

499
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,800
will be here

500
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:01,840
to clean this up

501
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,241
soon.

502
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:05,161
It's fine.

503
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,840
Please help me

504
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,560
to take care of Dad.

505
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:08,161
Well,

506
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:09,800
Deng Haiyang's rib is fractured,

507
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,721
I have to go see him.

508
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,600
Xiang Nan is still in Shanghai.

509
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,481
Will that Jiang send someone

510
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,121
to Shanghai?

511
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,760
She'll be in grave danger.

512
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,320
Uncle,

513
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:20,201
don't worry.

514
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,800
Don't worry.

515
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:22,320
Me and Xiang Qian

516
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,481
just came from Xiang Nan's place.

517
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,560
She is now

518
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,161
resting at home.

519
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:25,721
We also

520
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:26,961
got some friends to keep her company,

521
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,520
she'll be fine.

522
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,560
Here,

523
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,520
you should take the medicine.

524
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,481
Chai,

525
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:34,241
it's good that you're here.

526
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,241
You have to help us think of a way

527
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,481
to deal with

528
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,921
that Jiang. We have to...

529
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:40,641
Uncle,

530
00:29:40,961 --> 00:29:42,040
you should relax a little.

531
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:44,560
If Jiang Hongbin really did this,

532
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:46,121
we are now a society
governed by the rule of law,

533
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:47,280
the law will not spare him.

534
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,401
You can rest assured.

535
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:49,961
If your body breaks down,

536
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,040
tell me, what's going to happen

537
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:51,760
to your family?

538
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:53,040
Here, take the medicine first.

539
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,441
Chai,

540
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,000
that Jiang

541
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,360
is very influential.

542
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:00,921
We have our connections, too.

543
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:03,080
It's fine, don't worry.

544
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:04,201
How do you take this medicine?

545
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,080
I'll do it.

546
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:06,201
Give it to me.

547
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,800
Alright.

548
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:25,760
(Emergency)

549
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,921
What are you doing here so late?

550
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,201
Don't move.

551
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,320
What are you doing here so late?

552
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:04,121
To see you, of course.

553
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,641
Qian Feng and the others left?

554
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,121
They went back to help me get my things.

555
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:10,320
They just went back,

556
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,441
they'll be back soon.

557
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,760
Gosh.

558
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,080
By the way,

559
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:19,560
Xiaosi

560
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,800
gave me a call,

561
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,881
he said those troublemaking thugs

562
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,360
are the workers
from the construction site.

563
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:28,121
Because we disagreed

564
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:29,560
with the demolition, right?

565
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,800
Apparently,

566
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,520
they lost their work

567
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,800
so they drank

568
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:36,881
and caused trouble.

569
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:39,840
I don't think it's that simple.

570
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,560
Anyway, those gangsters

571
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,360
said they caused trouble

572
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:45,040
because they were drunk.

573
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,921
Does it hurt?

574
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,760
It hurt quite badly just now

575
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,760
but it got better

576
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:00,121
as soon as you came here.

577
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,760
Tell me,

578
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,881
every time

579
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,921
we get a little closer to each other,

580
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,721
I get hurt.

581
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,840
Should we find someone to

582
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,280
check if our birth charts

583
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,721
don't match?

584
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:28,721
What if that's actually true?

585
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,360
If our birth charts don't match,

586
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:35,760
I will change mine.

587
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,921
That's enough.

588
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,040
Stop laughing.

589
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,800
Just stay still.

590
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,241
You should sit.

591
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:49,401
Fine, I'll sit.

592
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:49,881
Fine.

593
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:51,360
Make yourself at home.

594
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:58,721
You came here at such late hour,

595
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,161
what did your mother wanted

596
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:00,921
to pass to me?

597
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,681
The bush roses in the yard

598
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:05,881
bloomed beautifully

599
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,481
so she told me

600
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,401
to pick a few for you
and bring them over.

601
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,721
Who would have thought
that as soon as I entered the door,

602
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,560
I'd get beaten?

603
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:16,560
You have to remember

604
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,161
that you owe me bush roses then.

605
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,760
Xiang Zhong,

606
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,121

I did a lot of bad things.

613
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
I also think

614
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,280
it is understandable

615
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:54,961

Alright, Ms. Wang.

Ms. Wang,

640
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:22,960
that's enough.

641
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,001
So sorry,

642
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,121
it's quite late now.

643
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:28,641
We have a special situation tonight.

644
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:30,561
Sure, young lad.

645
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:31,280
I have already

646
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,161
talked to Mr. Liu.

647
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:32,840
For tonight's work,

648
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,201
we will

649
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,960
double the wage.

650
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,320
Thank you, Mr. Chai.

651
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,840
Thanks for your hard work.

652
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,360
Sorry to trouble you.

653
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:37,960
Thanks.

654
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:38,721
Thanks.

655
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:39,480
Alright.

656
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:40,521
Take care.

657
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:46,201
It's all cleaned up.

658
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,001
Thanks, Boss Chai.

659
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,521
What for?

660
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:50,561
Are Mum and Dad asleep?

661
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,561
Yes.

662
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,201
Good.

663
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,960
It's getting late,

664
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,800
you should also go to bed.

665
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,840
I'll leave now.

666
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,760
You guys should go,

667
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,400
I'm right here.

668
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:58,721
I'll send you home.

669
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,840
Sure.

670
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:00,840
I have to take your car.

671
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,480
Let me have a few words
with Xiang Zhong.

672
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:04,400
Sure.

673
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:05,521
I'll wait for you in the car.

674
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,400
Zhong,

675
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:15,440
thank you.

676
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:16,880
Isn't this what I should do?

677
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:18,601
Take care of Mum and Dad.

678
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:23,041
Have a good rest.

679
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,960
Boss,

680
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:39,480
thank you.

681
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
You are always so polite.

682
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:46,241
Is this fun to you?

683
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,601
It seems that human

684
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,201
really does evolve.

685
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,681
Thinking back,

686
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:00,880
when I first met you,

687
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,721
you just graduated from college

688
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,521
not long ago

689
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,001
and you came to the company
for an interview

690
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:08,721
with a huge ponytail

691
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,521
that showed your big forehead.

692
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,241
You have cut your hair now,

693
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:15,400
you now have bangs in front.

694
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,960
Is it because you tied your hair

695
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,320
too tightly back then

696
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,721
and caused receding hairline?

697
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,280
That's nonsense.

698
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,521
That's right.

699
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,360
Aren't we back?

700
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,641
At that time, as soon as
you entered the door

701
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,480
and found out that I was
the interviewer,

702
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,320
not only was you not afraid,

703
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,001
you even smiled at me,

704
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:39,320
exposing a total of

705
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:41,241
eight big white teeth.

706
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,001
What a sycophantic smile.

707
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,121
It was a bright smile.

708
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:47,521
Later we chatted

709
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,280
and found out that we actually

710
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,760
studied in the same school.

711
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,561
You said this was fate,

712
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,121
and I was thinking

713
00:37:58,121 --> 00:37:58,920
that surprisingly,

714
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,800
our school actually cultivated

715
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,201
such a thick-skinned person

716
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,241
who is perfect for sales.

717
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,241
You must think you have

718
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,440
pretty good eye
for things now, don't you?

719
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:15,800
In my impression,

720
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,201
you are still that young woman
in her twenties,

721
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,161
a fresh flower.

722
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,920
In the blink of an eye,

723
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,641
it's almost time

724
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,641
for your babies to go to school.

725
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,561
They both need to grow slower.

726
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:31,480
When they are both grown up,

727
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:33,121
I... I will be old then.

728
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,641
That's one thing,

729
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,641
but we won't be withered yet.

730
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,559
(New email)
(Recipient: Chai Jin)

731
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:55,960
(It's almost dawn.)

732
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,241
(The night has finally passed.)

733
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:00,521
(Truthfully, when I went to find you)

734
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,081
(yesterday evening,)

735
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:04,041
(I saw the way you were working,)

736
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,960
(and I felt a sudden relief.)

737
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
(I made a decision)

738
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,521
(for the question weighing on my heart.)

739
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:12,480
(No matter how we look at it,)

740
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,760
(our company is definitely affected)

741
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,800
(because of Xiang Nan's divorce)

742
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,721
(so I think)

743
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,400
(I should be the one)

744
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,800
(taking all the responsibility.)

745
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:22,760
(You will definitely hold on)

746
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,241
(in our Qianjin company.)

747
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,601
(I'll be waiting for you to give me
my bonus when I come out.)

748
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,041
(I've sorted out all the evidence)

749
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,081
(of Xiang Nan getting harmed
by Jiang Hongbin.)

750
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,360
(The injury reports, images, and videos)

751
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
(are all in the hard drive.)

752
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:39,721
(And Attorney Wu)

753
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:40,880
(also has all the information.)

754
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,161
(Xiang Nan's divorce proceedings,)

755
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,280
(I'll leave to you.)

756
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,840
(I am the most at ease)

757
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,320
(when you're around.)

758
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
(Send this at the scheduled time?)
(Send.)

Qian?

761
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:26,880
Why are you sleeping here?

762
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:29,601
You didn't sleep all night?

763
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,121
I woke up.

764
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:31,880
I just woke up

765
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,480
and lied here before I fell back asleep.

766
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,601
Why don't you go back to the bedroom?

767
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:36,641
You should sleep a little longer.

768
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,280
No, I'm awake.

769
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:39,561
You go and sleep.

770
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,601
Alright, I'll sleep a while more.

771
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,320
Xiang Nan,

772
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,121
what do you want for breakfast?

773
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:00,681
I have no appetite.

774
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:01,561
How about

775
00:42:01,681 --> 00:42:02,721
you make whatever you want?

776
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,880
I'll eat whatever you make.

777
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,201
Let's just take some small bites.

778
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,800
Sure.

779
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,400
Go get some more sleep.

780
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:10,561
I'll wake you up when breakfast's ready.

781
00:42:11,521 --> 00:42:12,041
Sure.

782
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,161
(Dad and Mum,)

783
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:03,241
(there are some things
that I can't say in person,)

784
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,641
(so I'll just say them
in this chat group.)
