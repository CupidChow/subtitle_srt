(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 27=

4
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:39,667
Why isn't she letting him go home?

5
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:45,227
Mrs. Deng,

6
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,387
I shouldn't have said that.

7
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:48,108
Can you just pretend

8
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,867
I didn't say anything?

9
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:50,307
Why?

10
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,587
Where will he stay, then?

11
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:52,507
At your place?

12
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:54,108
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

13
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,068
So I won't

14
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:55,988
say another word.

15
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:58,108
What do you mean?

16
00:01:58,147 --> 00:01:58,748
You can't just

17
00:01:58,748 --> 00:01:59,348
stop halfway.

18
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:00,628
Please don't push me.

19
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:01,387
Haiyang has already

20
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,387
fallen out with me over this.

21
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:03,108
He said

22
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:05,027
I'm always revealing

23
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,628
things about him to you,

24
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:08,468
as though I'm trying to
make him look pitiful

25
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,828
in front of you.

26
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:12,507
What's really going on?

27
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,267
Tell me.

28
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:14,148
No.

29
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:15,267
I've already said enough.

30
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:17,107
I'm not saying another word,
no matter what.

31
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:18,667
- Not a word?
- That's right.

32
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:20,348
Alright.

33
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:22,987
Mrs. Deng...

34
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:24,707
Didn't his mother

35
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:25,868
go to your workplace

36
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:27,428
and put up a big poster?

37
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,348
Haiyang got really upset
when he found out.

38
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:31,387
After he went home,

39
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:32,227
he had a huge fight with his mother.

40
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:33,267
Then he packed up and left.

41
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:35,267
He's been staying in my wife's warehouse
all this time.

42
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:40,468
Living in the warehouse?

43
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:42,028
Are you serious?

44
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:45,148
I told Haiyang,

45
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,987
just spend a little money
and rent a place.

46
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,748
He said he's saving up

47
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:51,987
to pay you back.

48
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:53,308
Renting a place

49
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:54,748
is too wasteful.

50
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,308
Why isn't it boiling?

51
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,628
What kind of stove is this?

52
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:13,748
What's going on?

53
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:17,188
Deng Haiyang.

54
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:32,788
Why are you here?

55
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:33,748
I...

56
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:35,188
No...

57
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:36,347
You...

58
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:36,907
Hang on.

59
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:37,467
Hang on.

60
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:38,027
Wait.

61
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:38,548
Wait right there.

62
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:39,347
Don't go anywhere.

63
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:41,748
Just give me a second.

64
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:42,748
Why didn't you tell me

65
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,267
you were coming?

66
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:45,228
I...

67
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:47,947
I wasn't prepared at all.

68
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:48,387
Look,

69
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,188
it's so messy here.

70
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,907
It's so hot today. Are you hot?

71
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:53,907
No worries, I have a fan.

72
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:55,467
I'll move it over for you.

73
00:04:58,147 --> 00:04:59,387
Alright, stop fussing around.

74
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:05,108
It's fine.

75
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:07,907
It's fine.

76
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:09,748
The cord's too short.

77
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,707
Come, have a seat.

78
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:12,507
Sit down for a bit.

79
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:13,628
Take a rest.

80
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,587
I'll get you a glass of water, alright?

81
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:17,827
Water...

82
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:20,988
It's so hot here.

83
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:29,108
Here.

84
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:29,947
Thank you.

85
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:30,827
Don't mention it.

86
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:39,147
Why didn't you tell me?

87
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:41,147
Tell you what?

88
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:42,748
That you had a fight with your mom

89
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:43,788
and had nowhere to stay.

90
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,228
Why didn't you let me know?

91
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,108
It's...

92
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:48,027
It's not a big deal,

93
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:48,827
right?

94
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:56,347
Don't torture yourself.

95
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:57,587
Just rent a place.

96
00:05:59,308 --> 00:05:59,827
But...

97
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:00,988
Isn't this place fine?

98
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:02,947
Look at this place.

99
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:04,628
It's so spacious.

100
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:06,108
Right? And besides,

101
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:07,587
renting is too wasteful.

102
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,027
I can live with this.

103
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:18,228
About our savings,

104
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,147
you don't have to pay me back.

105
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:20,188
Even if you do, I won't take it.

106
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,188
No way.

107
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:24,267
I said I'd pay it back,

108
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:26,907
whether you like it or not.

109
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:47,188
Here, I got you something to eat.

110
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:49,587
Goodbye.

00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:51,188

I'm going to interview a new nanny.

133
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,188
I'm just grabbing a few essentials today.

134
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,587
Once I rent a place,

135
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,388
I'll move the rest of the stuff out.

It's yours, you know the PIN.

138
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:12,587
Ms. Xiang.

139
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:15,068
Jiaqiao.

140
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:16,947
You're back?

141
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:20,388
I broke up with Lv Liang.

142
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,068
What happened?

143
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,268
We had

144
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:27,908
set up the studio,

145
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:29,188
registered the company,

146
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:30,347
and even had talks
with investors.

147
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,148
We were almost ready to sign contracts.

148
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,188
But suddenly,

149
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:35,188
all the investors backed out,

150
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:36,467
and all the previous clients

151
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,467
gave us the red light.

152
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,148
There's nothing I can do now.

153
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:45,347
I became a burden to him.

154
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:49,508
Xiang Nan,

155
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:51,668
come down here for a second.

156
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:55,068
He's been in a bad mood
ever since he came back.

157
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:06,827
What's this?

158
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:08,028
Look.

159
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,548
Isn't this

160
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:11,668
what you asked me to make?

161
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:13,388
Do you know

162
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:14,508
what a three-legged toad is?

163
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:17,788
What is this?

164
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:20,068
This is just

165
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:21,388
a normal toad.

166
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,827
Are you messing with me?

167
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:26,347
Look it up online.

168
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:28,347
They're the same thing.

169
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:29,867
Do you know how I felt today

170
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:30,827
at Biao's restaurant?

171
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,467
Everyone was calling me an idiot

172
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:34,867
behind my back.

173
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:37,268
Are you happy

174
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:38,388
that I looked like a fool?

175
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:42,707
You call this a three-legged toad?

176
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:58,227
Why do you have to

177
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,747
always confront my brother head-on?

178
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,867
I've learned something recently.

179
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:05,788
In the past,

180
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:07,467
I would butt heads with him.

181
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:08,707
Like an egg striking a stone,

182
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,388
I ended up hurting myself.

183
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,227
But what if I

184
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:14,227
take a roundabout approach?

185
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:16,548
For example,

186
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,388
I've broken up with Lv Liang.

187
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,587
Then all the funds and clients

188
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:24,947
are back in play.

189
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:26,827
Once he's doing well,

190
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,467
we can get back together.

191
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:30,947
Then no one can stop us.

192
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,867
But how do you know

193
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:36,508
he'll wait for you?

194
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:37,908
Because the two of us

195
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:39,548
have always been together.

196
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:44,308
We're going underground now.

197
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:45,668
So from now on,

198
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:46,987
you'll have to cover for me.

199
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,308
Aren't you afraid I'll snitch?

200
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,148
I know you won't.

201
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:54,627
Otherwise,

202
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,508
you wouldn't have helped me

203
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:56,627
hide it from my brother

204
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:57,707
when we first got together.

205
00:12:58,428 --> 00:12:59,548
I regret it.

206
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:02,707
When your brother finds out

207
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:04,107
that we've both been hiding it from him,

208
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,788
he's going to punish me again.

209
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:08,668
That's why

210
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,308
we need to use this kind of

211
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:13,627
roundabout strategy.

212
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:15,148
Right?

213
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,987
Strategy.

214
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,587
You're using strategies now?

215
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:21,347
I've become wiser now.

216
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,668
I've grown up.

217
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,508
But Jiaqiao,

218
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:30,227
if family members

219
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:32,268
have to play mind games like this,

220
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:34,347
are they really family?

221
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:37,947
Family...

222
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:41,388
Xiang Nan,

223
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,347
tell me honestly,

224
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,188
are you happy with him?

225
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:03,587
Let's eat.

226
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:11,707
Ms. Xiang,

227
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:12,867
all done.

228
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,107
Thank you, Ms. Zhong.

229
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:16,908
Can you come

230
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,188
to work tomorrow?

231
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,587
Of course.

232
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:21,428
Don't worry.

233
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,668
I worked with my previous employer

234
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:23,707
for over ten years.

235
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,908
He told me that you were
college classmates.

236
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:27,467
He even asked me

237
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,388
to take good care

238
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,428
of your two kids.

239
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:31,308
I really

240
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:32,627
enjoy working with kids.

241
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:33,587
I'll be sure

242
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,148
to do my best.

243
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:36,388
That's great.

244
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,947
For the first couple of days,

245
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:40,268
someone will accompany you

246
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,107
to pick up the kids.

247
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:42,107
Either I

248
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:43,587
or someone else from the family.

249
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:44,587
Alright.

250
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:46,308
Great, see you tomorrow.

251
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:46,908
Alright.

252
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:47,788
See you tomorrow.

253
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:48,467
See you tomorrow.

254
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:49,627
No need to see me out.

255
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:50,947
You know the way out, right?

256
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:51,788
Yes.

257
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:52,347
I know the way.

258
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:53,068
Alright, goodbye.

259
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:53,467
Bye-bye.

260
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:54,188
Bye-bye.

261
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:57,548
Here, this is for you.

262
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:01,148
And this too.

263
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:04,148
(Chai Jin: Are you home?)

264
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,467
(I'll come over in a bit.)

265
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:06,627
(Xiang Qian: Yes, I'm here.)

266
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:15,707
I've made up my mind.

267
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:16,707
What do you two

268
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,107
think of this caretaker?

269
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,987
She's alright.

270
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,587
What about her cooking?

271
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:25,028
Is it good?

272
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:27,388
It's okay.

273
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,347
What about you?

274
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:32,268
It's alright.

275
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:35,148
Alright.

276
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:36,467
Mommy will tell her

277
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:38,148
what foods you both like.

278
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:46,627
Who's this?

279
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:48,827
Keep sliding.

280
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:55,788
What's this about?

281
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:58,148
His name is Liu Wei.

282
00:15:58,548 --> 00:15:59,987
He's Li Shu's boyfriend.

283
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:02,227
Actually, to be precise,

284
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:03,068
it's Li Shu

285
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,467
who intruded his family

286
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,148
and became the mistress.

287
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:07,627
So?

288
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:10,268
So,

289
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:11,268
Li Shu is pregnant

290
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,548
with Liu Wei's child.

291
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,508
The one who gave me these photos

292
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:15,707
is Liu Wei's wife.

293
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,148
It was also her who wrote
the anonymous letter

294
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,308
to the research institute.

295
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:21,508
Even though it was supposed
to be anonymous,

296
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:23,068
most people already knew

297
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:23,827
who wrote it.

298
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,188
Because last year,

299
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:28,028
his wife went to Li Shu's institute

300
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:28,827
and made a scene there.

301
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:31,388
So here's the question,

302
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:33,428
Li Shu is well aware of

303
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:35,347
who wrote

304
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:36,788
the anonymous letter,

305
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:37,508
right?

306
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:38,747
Then why did she

307
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:40,068
frame you for it?

308
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,148
Besides,

309
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,428
most people at the institute

310
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:46,467
likely know

311
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,947
who wrote that anonymous letter.

312
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:50,068
Gao Ping surely must know.

313
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,347
If he knows,

314
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:53,467
then why did he still

315
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:54,707
dump the blame on you?

316
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:12,427
Xiang Zhong,

317
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:13,907
are you in Shanghai?

318
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:15,788
Yes, I am.

319
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:18,427
Come over and watch the kids for a bit.

320
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:20,187
What's up?

321
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,147
I need to rush out.

322
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:34,708
Li Shu.

323
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:36,827
Li Shu.

324
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:38,308
Ms. Zhang.

325
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:44,187
Ms. Zhang, what's up?

326
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:46,107
There's someone downstairs
looking for you.

327
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:47,988
Who?

328
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:50,548
A woman named Xiang.

329
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:52,107
And there's a man too.

330
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:54,748
Ms. Zhang,

331
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:56,587
please tell them I'm not here.

332
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:57,867
Alright.

333
00:17:58,508 --> 00:17:59,667
I'll let them know.

334
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:36,788
(Xiang Qian: Li Shu, I know you're there.)

335
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,468
(I need to talk to you.)

336
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,907
(I'll wait for you at the café
across the street.)

337
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:42,867
(No matter how late it is,
we need to meet.)

338
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:10,228
Thank you.

339
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:14,867
So you still insist

340
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:16,548
that no one else

341
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:17,988
besides you,

342
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:19,308
your boyfriend,

343
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:20,468
Gao Ping

344
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:21,347
and me

345
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:22,948
knows about your pregnancy?

346
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:24,187
Of course.

347
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:26,187
It's not exactly something
to brag about.

348
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,347
Does Liu Wei's wife know?

349
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,788
You know very well that
the anonymous letter

350
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,147
was written by Liu Wei's wife.

351
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:36,748
Why did you frame me?

352
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:38,788
Why are you dumping all this dirt on me?

353
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,268
The car air freshener,

354
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:48,948
the lipstick at home,

355
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:50,028
your ultrasound report,

356
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:51,187
you deliberately left them

357
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:52,228
for me to see, right?

358
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:53,827
To create a false impression

359
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:54,867
of intimacy between you and Gao Ping,

360
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,827
and to stir up conflict
between Gao Ping and me.

361
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:57,708
Li Shu,

362
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:59,347
you've already destroyed one family.

363
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,387
Why do you still want

364
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,907
to sabotage my relationship
with Gao Ping?

365
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,587
Don't look at me like that.

366
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:18,068
Go ask Gao Ping.

367
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:21,748
Right now,

368
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:24,387
I want to hear your explanation.

369
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:25,627
I have nothing to explain.

370
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,387
Li Shu, listen,

371
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:28,988
asking you to meet me here

372
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:30,587
is to give you

373
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,068
a chance to explain yourself.

374
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,907
I have certified recordings

375
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:37,028
that I can use to sue you

376
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:37,948
for defamation.

377
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:40,948
Sue me?

378
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,708
How amusing.

379
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:45,028
Why don't you sue Gao Ping?

380
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,387
He's the one who wants to divorce you.

381
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,268
He's the one who wants to go abroad.

382
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,508
He wants to go abroad alone.

383
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,988
He doesn't want his whole family

384
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:59,827
to be a burden to him.

385
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:07,667
In truth, it's Gao Ping

386
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,187
who's setting you up, isn't that right?

387
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,627
He's the one who's responsible.

388
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:13,107
You should confront him.

389
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:25,948
And you're helping him

390
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:27,708
by playing the mistress,

391
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:29,587
making me suspicious,

392
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:30,147
and leading me

393
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:31,427
on a wild goose chase.

394
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,427
How could you be so awful?

395
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,748
You even came to my office,

396
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:36,187
crying like a helpless victim,

397
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:37,748
saying how difficult it was

398
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:39,028
to get into the research institute.

399
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:40,347
All you wanted was

400
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:41,228
a chance to stay on

401
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:42,107
as an assistant instructor.

402
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:43,627
Someone like you as an instructor?

403
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:44,667
What would you teach?

404
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:46,587
How to be a homewrecker?

405
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:51,708
What are you trying to get out of this?

406
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,468
Can Gao Ping help you apply for a PhD?

407
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,228
Or take you abroad?

408
00:21:57,627 --> 00:21:58,827
Or do you, Li Shu, just enjoy

409
00:21:58,827 --> 00:21:59,708
ruining other people's families

410
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:00,667
and can't stand others' happiness?

411
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,788
What I want is none of your business.

412
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:02,548
Whether I like

413
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:03,268
ruining others' families

414
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:04,347
isn't your concern either.

415
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:05,268
I just can't stand

416
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:06,308
someone like you being happy.

417
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:08,268
All I can say is, Gao Ping
and I are alike.

418
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:09,347
Why can't we

419
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:10,107
be pragmatic?

420
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,147
Why can't we

421
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:12,107
take the shortcut?

422
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,187
We're just trying

423
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:16,587
to create better opportunities
for ourselves.

424
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,427
You're despicable.

425
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:25,548
You have no conscience.

426
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,068
Shortcuts

427
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,587
come with a price.

428
00:23:16,387 --> 00:23:17,308
Hello, Gao Ping?

429
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:19,667
I need to talk

430
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:21,068
to you urgently.

431
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:24,948
Can we speak in person?

432
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,827
Yes, right now.

433
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:30,308
Alright,

434
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:31,748
let's meet at the café downstairs.

435
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:35,508
Alright, I'll be there.

436
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,187
Going out this late?

437
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:55,028
Yes, Mr. Lu suddenly

438
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:56,228
asked to meet me.

439
00:23:56,387 --> 00:23:57,187
I'm going out for a while.

440
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:00,107
Come back soon.

441
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:02,028
Okay, you get some sleep,

442
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:02,748
baby.

443
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,028
Drop me off

444
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:12,028
at the entrance

445
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:13,788
of the café at my place.

446
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:17,667
Will you be alright on your own?

447
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:18,867
Yes, I'll be fine.

448
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:21,827
I want to talk to him alone.

449
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:54,827
Hello?

450
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:09,627
(Xiang Qian: Gao Ping, where are you?)

451
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:11,508
Thanks.

452
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:44,667
Not now, Jiang.

453
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:49,427
I said not now.

454
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:53,347
Are you an alien?

455
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,107
I'm not in the mood.

456
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,068
I don't want to, okay?

457
00:25:58,587 --> 00:25:59,187
No, Jiang.

458
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:00,627
I said no.

459
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,187
Get your hands off me.

460
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:07,147
Must you reject me like this?

461
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:12,587
I'll sleep downstairs.

462
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,107
Gao Ping probably won't come.

463
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,708
How do you know?

464
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:10,708
I asked someone to check

465
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:13,387
with his postdoctoral advisor, Mr. Lu.

466
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,948
There was never a Fujian project.

467
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:21,827
He's been deceiving you.

468
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,560
(Your real-time position)

469
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:37,867
He's here.

470
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:39,308
His car is nearby.

471
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,028
Have you been waiting by the roadside?

472
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,308
Yes.

473
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:12,748
Did you see

474
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:14,107
when this car

475
00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:14,948
pulled in?

476
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,147
Sorry, I was

477
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:19,867
too focused on watching you.

478
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,308
Sorry.

479
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:29,107
The subscriber you have dialed
is powered off.

480
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:30,147
Sorry.

481
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:32,627
The subscriber you have dialed
is powered off.

482
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:35,308
His phone is off.

483
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:39,427
Why don't we go home and rest?

484
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,268
My stomach hurts.

485
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,667
Heaven is watching.

486
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:44,948
Just wait and see.

487
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:46,708
Heaven won't let him get away with this.

488
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:47,907
What nonsense.

489
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:06,867
You're back.

490
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,788
She has a stomachache.

491
00:29:11,907 --> 00:29:12,907
Let her rest early.

492
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:14,867
Alright, I'll get you a glass of water

493
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,387
Don't worry too much.

494
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:19,907
Just get a good night's sleep.

495
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:22,468
I'll find him for you,

496
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,948
and we'll ask him

497
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,308
face-to-face.

498
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:26,788
Thank you

499
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:28,228
for staying with me so late.

500
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:30,028
You should get some rest too.

501
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:31,387
Get some sleep.

529
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:03,788
Hello, Xiang Nan.

530
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,468
Are you awake?

531
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,427
Almost, what's up?

532
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:08,548
I need a favor.

533
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:09,788
Sure.

534
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:11,187
I want you to

535
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,708
ask Jiang Hongbin to help me
find someone.

536
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:15,988
Who?

537
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,387
Gao Ping.

538
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:19,187
Gao Ping?

539
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:20,347
What happened?

540
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:21,667
Don't tell Mom and Dad

541
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,068
what I'm about to tell you, okay?

542
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:26,667
Xiang Qian and Gao Ping got divorced.

543
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:30,028
What? Why?

544
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:32,587
Gao Ping set Xiang Qian up
and tricked her.

545
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:33,748
Now he's nowhere to be found.

546
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:35,228
Even his phone is turned off.

547
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,587
Ask Jiang Hongbin

548
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:37,427
to find him.

549
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:38,028
Hurry.

550
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,068
Got it.

551
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:41,187
Thanks.

552
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:41,907
Okay.

553
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:56,667
The one you bought last time

554
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:57,508
was not fresh.

555
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:59,347
Make sure to check
the manufacturing date.

556
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:00,427
Did you bring your reading glasses?

557
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:01,508
Yes, don't worry.

558
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:02,228
I'll check carefully.

559
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:02,907
That's right.

560
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:03,867
Be sure to buy the fresh ones,

561
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:04,867
not like the ones from yesterday.

562
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:06,187
Ms. He.

563
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:06,827
Miss.

564
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:07,627
Get on it.

565
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:08,308
Alright, I'm off.

566
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:09,988
Has Mr. Jiang gone out?

567
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:11,347
Mr. Jiang left early in the morning.

568
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,028
Alright, no problem.

569
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:13,587
Okay.

570
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,840
(Xiang Nan)

571
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:34,347
Hello?

572
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:38,548
Jiang, where are you?

573
00:33:39,788 --> 00:33:40,468
What's up?

574
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:42,427
It's like this.

575
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:43,427
Gao Ping is missing.

576
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:46,468
Can't you report it

577
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:47,587
to the police?

578
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:51,347
He's intentionally avoiding my sister.

579
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:52,988
He even turned off his phone.

580
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:57,107
Come find me first.

581
00:33:58,508 --> 00:33:59,107
I'll…

582
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:00,427
I…

583
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,107
(Deng Haiyang: Did you oversleep?)

584
00:34:42,468 --> 00:34:43,187
(Xiang Zhong: What's the matter?)

585
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:45,707
(Deng Haiyang: Your ID card)

586
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:46,587
(is still with me.)

587
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:49,468
(Xiang Zhong: Something happened
with Xiang Qian.)

588
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,667
(I left early in the morning.)

589
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:53,508
(Deng Haiyang: What happened?)

590
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,548
(Xiang Zhong: Xiang Qian had a conflict
with Gao Ping.)

591
00:34:57,707 --> 00:34:58,747
(Gao Ping disappeared.)

592
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:15,868
You're up already?

593
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:17,107
Are you hungry?

594
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:18,227
I made congee. It'll be ready soon.

595
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:18,988
Want some?

596
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:20,908
I'm not hungry.
I just want a glass of water.

597
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:33,868
Here.

598
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,348
It's time to wake up Cong and Qi.

599
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:38,107
Don't worry about it.

600
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:38,948
I'll take care of the kids.

601
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:40,187
I'll drop them off
at kindergarten later.

602
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:42,587
Why aren't you going to work?

603
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:43,747
I took the day off.

604
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:45,548
Why did you take a day off?

605
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:46,627
Don't worry about it.

606
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:47,428
I told Chai Jin

607
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:48,068
you needed

608
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:49,307
a day off as well.

609
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:50,707
Chai Jin gave me a rundown

610
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:51,787
of the situation.

611
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:53,787
What are you planning to do?

612
00:35:58,428 --> 00:35:59,428
I don't need time off.

613
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:00,988
Stop being stubborn.

614
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:02,187
The most important thing for you now

615
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:02,908
is to get a good rest

616
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:03,828
and get yourself together

617
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:05,068
so you can handle
this situation properly.

618
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:07,948
Go back and rest.

619
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:09,587
Get up.

620
00:36:10,227 --> 00:36:11,707
Cong and Qi's utensils

621
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:12,508
are in the top drawer.

622
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:13,627
Got it.

623
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:15,828
I'll call you if I need anything, okay?

624
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:49,707
If you didn't need my help,

625
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,107
you wouldn't have come looking for me.

626
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:58,267
Xiang Nan, take a look.

627
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:01,348
At what?

628
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:04,348
Construction stopped today.

629
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:06,307
Stopped?

630
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:07,227
Yes.

631
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:09,587
The company's finances

632
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:10,508
have been tight recently.

633
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:11,828
We had no choice but to stop.

634
00:37:16,627 --> 00:37:17,267
Xiang Nan,

635
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:19,348
do you know

636
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:21,147
what it takes

637
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:22,028
to develop a property

638
00:37:23,227 --> 00:37:24,627
or build a residential complex?

639
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:27,627
Do you know how many departments

640
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:28,667
are involved on a construction site

641
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:31,348
and how many teams

642
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:32,828
and workers there are?

643
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:34,548
What exactly are you trying to say?

644
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:39,587
Just because you willfully

645
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,627
added an extra leg to the toad,

646
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:43,988
Biao suddenly pulled out the funding

647
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:45,548
he promised me.

648
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:50,068
Yes.

649
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,147
The golden three-legged toad is tacky.

650
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,187
Maybe you felt insulted.

651
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,787
Maybe you felt a little wronged.

652
00:38:03,587 --> 00:38:04,828
But Xiang Nan, do you know?

653
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,428
A small compromise on your part

654
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:09,267
could have helped my company,

655
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:10,548
and the workers here

656
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:11,587
to support

657
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:12,868
their families.

658
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:16,627
Xiang Nan,

659
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:20,068
is your artistic pride

660
00:38:20,107 --> 00:38:20,787
or everyone's livelihood

661
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:22,828
more important?

662
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:28,868
I'm sorry.

663
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:32,068
I was wrong.

664
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:34,747
I was too impulsive.

665
00:38:43,107 --> 00:38:43,747
Never mind.

666
00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:46,627
Forget it, Xiang Nan.

667
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:48,948
Here's the plan.

668
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:50,468
Biao and his wife

669
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:52,068
are having a gathering tonight.

670
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:53,587
We'll go over

671
00:38:53,787 --> 00:38:54,747
and apologize to him in person.

672
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:56,828
No, not tonight.

673
00:38:56,988 --> 00:38:57,428
Look,

674
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:58,707
Gao Ping is missing

675
00:38:58,707 --> 00:38:59,227
and we still...

676
00:38:59,227 --> 00:38:59,747
I'm already trying

677
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:01,107
to find a solution for Gao Ping.

678
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:13,587
Fine.

679
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:16,908
I just didn't expect...

680
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:17,627
Alright.

681
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:20,428
Let's not talk about it.

682
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,426
(Yu Yue: Sis, we just finished the meeting.
Our topic is up today.)

683
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:35,747
(Yu Yue: Sis, we just finished the meeting.)

684
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:37,428
(Our topic is up today.)

685
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:40,787
(Xiang Zhong: Proofing in progress.)

686
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:41,667
(I will send it to you soon.)

687
00:39:49,147 --> 00:39:49,868
Ms. Zhong.

688
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:51,828
Could you do the laundry later?

689
00:39:51,948 --> 00:39:53,107
Xiang Qian is sleeping.

690
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:54,107
Okay.

691
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:54,388
Thanks.

692
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:54,948
No problem.

693
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:03,787
(Shanghai Huoguang Farmhouse)
(Xiang Qian: This is Gao Ping's location.)

694
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:06,988
(Xiang Zhong: We'll head there right away.)

695
00:40:07,348 --> 00:40:08,828
(Let's meet up over there.)

696
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:17,548
Chai Jin,

697
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,787
I was just about to call you.

698
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:20,508
Where's Xiang Qian?

699
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:22,107
Still resting.

700
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:23,787
Tell her

701
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:25,468
that I found him.

702
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:27,267
I'll send the location

703
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:28,028
to you shortly.

704
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:29,667
Xiang Nan found him as well.

705
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:30,667
Let's meet there.

706
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:31,587
Okay.

707
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,267
Qian.

708
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:38,787
Qian.

709
00:40:39,068 --> 00:40:39,667
Wake up.

710
00:40:40,868 --> 00:40:41,787
They found Gao Ping.

711
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,107
Where is he?

712
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:01,548
You look so beautiful
with straight hair.

713
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,267
Keep it straight from now on.

714
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:07,147
It makes you look

715
00:41:07,587 --> 00:41:08,908
gentle and sweet.

716
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:14,828
Jiang, can I not go?

717
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:18,227
I still feel a bit uneasy.

718
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:20,468
I want to go see my sister.

719
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:23,227
I already asked someone

720
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:24,787
to check on your
brother-in-law's situation.

721
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:27,348
Besides, Biao and the others

722
00:41:27,428 --> 00:41:28,787
are waiting for us.

723
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,508
Alright, be good.

724
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:45,747
(Xiang Nan: I won't be able
to make it today.)

725
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:47,428
(There's an urgent matter
on Jiang's side.)

726
00:41:47,828 --> 00:41:48,828
Give me the keys.

727
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:50,068
You take it easy. I'll drive.

728
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:14,388
It's over there.

729
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:23,388
Hello.

730
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,227
Is 3031 up ahead?

731
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:26,147
It's that room.

732
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:27,267
Thank you.

733
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:36,828
3031.

734
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:37,828
This is it.

735
00:42:55,428 --> 00:42:56,227
Gao Ping.

736
00:42:59,068 --> 00:42:59,787
Gao Ping.
