00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,000
=Our Days=

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 23=

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,721
I didn't harbor any ill intentions
toward you, right?

5
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,281
Why are you harming me?

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,760
Li Shu.

7
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,441
Firstly, I have no idea

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,801
about the anonymous letter
you talked about.

9
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,120
I won't jump

10
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,600
to such conclusions easily

11
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,480
before I can confirm

12
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:57,880
that you've become

13
00:01:57,921 --> 00:01:58,960
the third wheel
between me and my husband.

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,441
Secondly,

15
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,921
if you did shatter my family,

16
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,040
I would write an open letter
about your deeds

17
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:10,040
instead of an anonymous letter.

18
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,281
I'm not that cheap.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,040
You're not that cheap, huh?

20
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:14,841
If so, why did you install

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,080
a surveillance camera at home
after hiring me back?

22
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:19,121
Why did you monitor Gao Ping
on apps, then?

23
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,001
Are you done?

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,281
Now, you're talking about
my family affair?

25
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:26,961
I can even install

26
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,200
100 surveillance cameras in my house

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,961
as long as I'm happy.

28
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,480
That's my house.

29
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,600
As for Gao Ping, he's mine.

30
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:36,640
He's my husband.

31
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,401
I have the right to know where he is

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,961
when I want to.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,080
As for what you guys think about me,

34
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:45,281
that's your own business.

35
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,961
You're still using that term, huh?

36
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,800
That means you suspect

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,561
that Gao Ping
and I have an affair, am I right?

38
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,721
It's best if that's not true.

39
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:53,841
Li Shu, if you two do have an affair,

40
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,161
I'll surely investigate it thoroughly.

41
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,121
You've already affected my work.

42
00:02:58,561 --> 00:02:59,441
Sitong,

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,281
send Ms. Li to the elevator.

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,721
No matter who wrote
that anonymous letter,

45
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,320
I will hire an attorney.

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,521
That's for the best.

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,441
Good morning, Flowey.

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Good morning, Grace.

49
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:26,920
You don't need to wait for me.

50
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:27,721
You should leave first.

51
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,360
It's fine.

52
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:29,521
It's still early.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,401
Let's walk together.

54
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,800
How did you manage

55
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,561
to get a shared bike?

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,961
There's always none
whenever I reach the station.

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,760
Is that so?

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I couldn't get one
in the past few days either.

59
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,561
I don't know why,

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,401
but for some reason,

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,841
there's always one bike

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,200
at the station whenever I'm there.

63
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,561
Maybe I'm just lucky.

64
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:47,521
If so, I guess you're too lucky.

65
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,360
I hope I can be lucky all the time.

66
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:50,920
Have you taken breakfast?

67
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:51,360
Not yet.

68
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:51,841
What about you?

69
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,001
I haven't taken breakfast either.

70
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:53,800
Let's get some breakfast later.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,480
I'll go up first.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,241
Alright. See you later.

73
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:57,721
Goodbye.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,841
Hello?

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,640
Are you Xiang Zhong?

76
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm Deng Haiyang's friend.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,241
Hello.

78
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:08,241
What's wrong?

79
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,880
Deng Haiyang is in huge trouble.

80
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,040
What happened?

81
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,800
Xiang Zhong!

82
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,881
I'm Haiyang's friend, the person

83
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,961
who called you just now.

84
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,281
You can call me Ling.

85
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,281
Nice to meet you.

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,281
Deng Haiyang just posted this
on his WeChat Moments.

87
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,161
He recalled it after a few minutes.

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Luckily, I took a screenshot.

89
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:39,880
(Deng Haiyang: Goodbye.)

90
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,440
He's trying

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,761
to bid farewell to the world.

92
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:45,920
This can't be.

93
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:48,281
You said you couldn't
get in touch with him.

94
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,841
If so, I'm sure I can't
get in touch with him either.

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,920
But he's in Shanghai now.

96
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,721
What is he doing in Shanghai?

97
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:55,521
I've already asked him about it.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,240
He wasn't willing to tell me.

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,521
Actually, I know

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,081
that he escaped to Shanghai.

101
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:05,401
He has received a huge blow lately.

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,641
Forget about the divorce for now.

103
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,360
Due to that incident,

104
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:10,800
everyone in the world knows

105
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:11,881
that he's a scam victim now.

106
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,321
Which incident?

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
Don't you know?

108
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:18,800
Haiyang's scam case was solved.

109
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,841
The TV station reached out to him
for an interview.

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
His interview was already aired.

111
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,480
Wouldn't the news

112
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,281
blur the faces of those
who were involved?

113
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,321
They did.

114
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,721
But those who know him

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,240
can tell that it's him at first glance.

116
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,321
Then what's the point

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
of protecting the people involved.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,240
Don't be frustrated at me.

119
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,401
I'm not the one who censored it.

120
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,281
According to your understanding of him,

121
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,000
do you think he's that kind of person?

122
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,680
What kind of person?

123
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
The kind who will end their lives.

124
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,560
I don't know either.

125
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,600
Mr. Wang, look.

126
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,440
It's almost lunchtime.

127
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
Why don't we have lunch

128
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:04,321
together later?

129
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:06,440
Mr. Chai, you're too courteous.

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,321
Don't mention it.

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,761
Yuanyuan,

132
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:09,600
The restaurant has been booked, right?

133
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:10,440
That's right.

134
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,201
You can head there with Mr. Wang

135
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,800
and Mr. Liu first.

136
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,521
I need to do something.

137
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,521
I'll head there later, okay?

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,401
Okay.

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,081
See you guys later.

140
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,081
Mr. Chai, see you later.

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,961
Alright. Goodbye. Good job.

142
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,721
See you guys later.

143
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:19,560
See you guys later.

144
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,161
Over here, please.

145
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,161
So,

146
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,040
you're actually late for a meeting, huh?

147
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,360
You're leaving after entering the room.

148
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,120
What's going on?

149
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,521
Nothing's going on.

150
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,680
Nothing's going on? Just look at you.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Come on. Let's have lunch.

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,360
Hello, Ms. Huang?

153
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:42,881
Weren't they okay

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,881
when I sent them to school this morning?

155
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,000
Alright, understood.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,560
I'll go and pick them up.

157
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,161
You see,

158
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,961
something cropped up at home.

159
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,841
The teacher said Cong and Qi are having

160
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,040
gastroenteritis.

161
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Where's Gao Ping, then?

162
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,040
You can tell Gao Ping
to check on them.

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,560
No need for that.

164
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,721
He's preparing for his thesis defense.

165
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,201
He's just making preparations.

166
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,360
It's not like he's doing it.

167
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,161
The children are sick, you know?

168
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:04,201
He can't just ignore them.

169
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,440
It's fine. I'll pick them up myself.

170
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,040
That's not it.

171
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:07,081
How will you head there?

172
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,321
I thought your car broke down.

173
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,841
I'll hire a cab.

174
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,480
It's more convenient.

175
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,120
You can drive my car there.

176
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:14,600
Yuanyuan and I are here.

177
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:15,841
Thank you, Boss.

178
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:16,881
Sorry for making you
entertain them alone.

179
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,440
Cong's mother!

180
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,761
Ms. Huang, how are the children?

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,480
They've already taken

182
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,440
anti-nausea and
anti-diarrhea medication.

183
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,201
For safety's sake,

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,281
you should take them to the hospital.

185
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:35,961
Come. Over here.

186
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,721
Cong, Qi.

187
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:43,961
Are you guys sick?

188
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,440
Mom.

189
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,040
Mom, why are you only here now?

190
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Mom, I feel terrible.

191
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
Your stomach hurts, doesn't it?

192
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,161
I'll take you guys to the hospital now.

193
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,440
The doctors will give you a diagnosis

194
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,401
and tell you why your tummy hurts.

195
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Mom, I can't walk.

196
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,161
Can you carry me on your back?

197
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,480
I can carry you on my back.

198
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,560
Mom, I can walk by myself.

199
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:10,401
You can walk by yourself?

200
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,761
My baby, you're great.

201
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,961
Good job.

202
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,281
I'll carry Cong on my back, then.

203
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Come.

204
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:19,360
Come, my baby.

205
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,000
Get up.

206
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:28,680
Okay.

207
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:33,641
Ms. Huang, sorry for the trouble.

208
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:34,401
Let me carry your bag for you.

209
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,560
Thank you.

210
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,161
Qi, let's go.

211
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,241
Baby, let's go.

212
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,241
Be careful.

213
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:42,761
Here.

214
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:43,680
I'll open the door for your mother.

215
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,440
(Xiang Zhong: Deng Haiyang,)

216
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,200
(where are you right now?)

217
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:20,080
(Haiyang: Changsha...)

218
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,560
Why did you go to Changsha?

219
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:28,161
(Haiyang: Road.)

220
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:34,720
Buddy,

221
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,361
can't you finish your sentence?

222
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,601
(Medical Technology Center)
You guys are okay now, right?

223
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:47,761
You guys can enjoy beverages.

224
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,800
The doctor told me

225
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,440
to buy electrolyte water for you.

226
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,720
Mom,

227
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,320
why isn't Dad here yet?

228
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,440
Dad...

229
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,680
He's on a business trip.

230
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,080
Who will recharge my battery, then?

231
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,001
I'll be out of energy without it.

232
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,960
I'll recharge your battery

233
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,920
after we're done with the drip.

234
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,560
Mom, it's useless when you do it.

235
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,560
Can you stop talking?

236
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
You guys will be energetic

237
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
after taking the drip.

238
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm here. Where are you?

239
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,281
I saw you.

240
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,761
I didn't see you.

241
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,560
Look at your left rear at a 45° angle.

242
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,720
You're wearing spectacles now.

243
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,361
Do you have shortsightedness
or presbyopia?

244
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,560
It's none of them.

245
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,121
It's just a decoration.

246
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:03,601
You changed your style, huh?

247
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:04,641
You look refined now.

248
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:05,320
Yeah, right?

249
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,440
Why don't we take a walk?

250
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:08,881
Alright. Let's go.

251
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:10,960
What are you doing in Shanghai?

252
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,121
To attend a training program.

253
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,241
What training program?

254
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,521
A training program for
Odor Detection Specialists.

255
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,800
What's an Odor Detection Specialist?

256
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
An odor detection specialist

257
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,761
will determine

258
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,800
whether an environment

259
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:23,881
or a water source

260
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,720
is polluted or not
and its pollution level

261
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,881
by using their sense of smell.

262
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,481
That's a new position

263
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
added to our
environmental protection system.

264
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:31,960
It's not just us. It includes you guys.

265
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,840
Listen,

266
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,481
An odor detection specialist

267
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,401
is also called an olfactory specialist.

268
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,080
We need to take a
professional certificate exam for this.

269
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
It's not something that anyone can do.

270
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
You have to be talented.

271
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
You mean a talent for odor detection?

272
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,361
Olfactory talent.

273
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,881
When I attended the test,

274
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,720
I realized that I was much better
than other people.

275
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,601
I suddenly realized

276
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,960
that everyone has their own talents.

277
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:58,601
It's just that they haven't
been discovered yet.

278
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,361
I have to congratulate you, then.

279
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,040
You've finally discovered

280
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
your talent.

281
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,001
Talent alone isn't enough, you know?

282
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,001
You need to work hard as well.

283
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,361
This position

284
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:09,840
has high requirements

285
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,960
for physical fitness as well.

286
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:12,161
A lot of factors

287
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,800
could potentially affect
your sense of smell.

288
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:15,080
For example, smoking, taking alcohol,

289
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,001
staying up late,

290
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,001
and having BBQ,
which is my favorite thing to do,

291
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:19,161
I've quit all of them.

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,761
I'm particularly focused
on wellness now.

293
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:22,720
That's great.

294
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,641
If so, why did you make that post

295
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,881
on WeChat Moments?

296
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
I recalled it after posting it.

297
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,560
You saw it,

298
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:32,881
huh?

299
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:33,920
You pay a lot of attention to me, huh?

300
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,641
Who said so?

301
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,281
Ling came running to me.

302
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,401
She was worried about you.

303
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:40,920
Hurry and reply to her text.

304
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,800
She's Qian Feng's cousin.

305
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:45,521
They know that I was divorced

306
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,401
and was liberated from suffering.

307
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
They want us to be together.

308
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:52,241
I mean, not liberated from suffering.

309
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:52,920
It's

310
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:54,361
a kind of rebirth.

311
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,121
To me,

312
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm liberated from suffering.

313
00:12:58,521 --> 00:12:59,481
Was it that terrible?

314
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:01,040
What do you think?

315
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:05,800
Zhong,

316
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,601
our divorce procedure

317
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,320
will be completed soon.

318
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,840
Can we stop arguing?

319
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,080
Can we try to get along with each other?

320
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:18,881
Sure. No problem.

321
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,281
As to why I posted the picture

322
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,121
with Ferris wheel,

323
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,440
do you remember this?

324
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,601
In the past, you used to tell me

325
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,680
that you wanted
to ride the Ferris wheel.

326
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,720
I gave you all kinds of excuses.

327
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,401
It wasn't because I had no time.

328
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,601
It was because I was afraid.

329
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,881
But in reality,

330
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,121
after I took the Ferris wheel,

331
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,121
it wasn't as scary as I thought.

332
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,761
You see,

333
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,641
when you looked at the city from above,

334
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:51,881
it felt as if

335
00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:53,720
everything

336
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:54,960
could start anew.

337
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,481
Aren't you already

338
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,761
starting anew?

339
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,361
I might not have the courage to do so

340
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,481
had you not resigned
and came to Shanghai.

341
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:05,361
Because of me?

342
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,881
I thought

343
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,960
you were dejected because of the scam.

344
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,720
Don't bring it up again.

345
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
Fine. I understand.

346
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:19,401
I still have to catch the subway
back to Kunshan.

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,960
I'll make a move first.

348
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:21,920
Just

349
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,761
tell me

350
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,481
if you need any help.

351
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,161
I'll always be around.

352
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,920
I hope I'll be fine.

353
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,121
Mom, can you please not leave?

354
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,881
Okay.

355
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:54,960
I won't leave.

356
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Just go to sleep.

357
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,720
- Mom.
- Mom.

358
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,121
Wake up.

359
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,601
If not, we'll be late.

360
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:17,521
My goodness.

361
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:18,881
Mom's alarm clock isn't ringing.

362
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,001
Hurry, Qi.

363
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:21,241
Go and wash up with Cong.

364
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,521
I'll make breakfast for you two.

365
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,481
Hurry.

366
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:35,761
Dad? Mom?

367
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,281
Why are you two this early
in the morning?

368
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,121
Wait.

369
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,481
You didn't even answer our call.

370
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:40,680
Xiang Qian, what's wrong?

371
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,401
I forgot to charge my phone.

372
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:42,800
My alarm clock didn't ring...

373
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,881
Grandpa! Grandma!

374
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,680
Grandpa! Grandma!

375
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,001
Why aren't you two in school?

376
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:49,001
Grandma, you're so beautiful.

377
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,241
You're such a sweet girl.

378
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,481
Why aren't you guys in school?

379
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:53,920
Mom overslept.

380
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
Mom has overslept,

381
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,401
then you should hurry

382
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,320
and wash up with Cong.

383
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,040
Hurry!

384
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,761
Hurry. Call Grandma.

385
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Grandma will take care of you two.

386
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:01,320
Hurry.

387
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:02,161
I'll make breakfast.

388
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,361
You should hurry and wash up.

389
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:03,960
Okay.

390
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,601
Will do.

391
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:06,641
My goodness.

392
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:07,881
Should I fold this up?

393
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,641
Or put it down?

394
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,280
You look great.

395
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:10,881
How do I look?

396
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,720
That looks great too.

397
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,081
You look great no matter what.

398
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:13,601
I'm just asking you.

399
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,401
You kept asking me on our way here.

400
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,121
My goodness.

401
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:18,760
Dad,

402
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,680
they had a case of

403
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,121
mild gastroenteritis yesterday.

404
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,321
Make something plain for them.

405
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:25,641
Gastroenteritis?

406
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,680
It's very minor.

407
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,321
Alright. I'll make some noodles.

408
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
It'll be done soon.

409
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,841
It smells great.

410
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,960
Where's Gao Ping?

411
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,881
He's attending a research topic
conference in Suzhou.

412
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,841
Suzhou isn't that far away.

413
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,920
The children are sick.

414
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,041
But he's not coming back
to check on them.

415
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,200
This is outrageous.

416
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:57,520
It's not that big of a deal.

417
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,081
You two didn't argue, right?

418
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,240
No, we didn't.

419
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,121
Have you been

420
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,520
taking care of them alone
all this while?

421
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,960
Why didn't you tell us about it?

422
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,401
Didn't I take care of them myself

423
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,841
when they were born?

424
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:19,920
They're all grown up now.

425
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,641
They're easy to raise now.

426
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:21,520
I can do it myself.

427
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:23,041
As if.

428
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:23,801
If so,

429
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:24,801
it wouldn't end up
like that this morning.

430
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,720
Yesterday night was just an accident.

431
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,000
I forgot to charge my phone.

432
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,641
I...

433
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,881
I'll charge it later.

434
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:50,641
Dad, what's wrong?

435
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,121
Why did you call me here?

436
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:53,520
Luckily, I'm still around.

437
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,760
Calm down.

438
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:55,361
Don't worry.

439
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,000
I've already sent the kids
to kindergarten.

440
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:58,680
My goodness.

441
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,401
Where's Mom?

442
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,801
Your mother?

443
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:01,641
I don't know.

444
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,240
You don't know?

445
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,081
Didn't you two send the kids

446
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,121
to school together?

447
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,440
Did you two argue?

448
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,841
We did.

449
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,361
She dumped me.

450
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
She dumped you?

451
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,760
What does that mean?

452
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,041
After sending the kids there,

453
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:16,240
I told her that we should go home.

454
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,920
She said her classmates
had organized a gathering.

455
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:19,561
It's just a classmate gathering.

456
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't see anything wrong with that.

457
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,480
What do you know?

458
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,321
She had a male classmate.

459
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,801
He wanted

460
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,121
to court your mother
when they were still studying.

461
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,841
Now that he's this old,

462
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,601
he's even more unrestrained.

463
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:32,641
You...

464
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,760
He never forgot about your mother.

465
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,081
He always sent her

466
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,321
funny clips.

467
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,041
He even invited her on a road trip.

468
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:41,641
What do you think he's up to?

469
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,801
Where does he think

470
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:43,720
I stand?

471
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:44,920
That's right.

472
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,081
Your mother was even worse.

473
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,760
Ever since she started
getting in touch with him,

474
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,200
she put on makeup every day.

475
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,041
She spent at least two hours

476
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:54,200
just to put on makeup.

477
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:55,960
This...

478
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,121
It's basically a reunion for them.

479
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,041
When I saw them together,

480
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,200
I told her that she shouldn't go.

481
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,720
The kids are here.

482
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,641
We should help Xiang Qian

483
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,480
to take care of the family.

484
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,041
Isn't that great?

485
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:03,680
She didn't listen to me.

486
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,401
She vanished like a ghost.

487
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Now, I can't even find her.

488
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,041
What should we do about this, then?

489
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,000
What should we do?

490
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Like peas in a pod,

491
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:18,881
they're a perfect match.

492
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:20,321
It takes two to tango, you know?

493
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:21,561
How could I stop her?

494
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
How should we resolve this issue, then?

495
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,480
What time are you
getting off work tonight?

496
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,760
I...

497
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,561
Just tell me what you need.

498
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:33,801
I'm fine with any time.

499
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,321
What about this?

500
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:39,841
Can you lend me your car?

501
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:41,920
Sure.

502
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,960
Your car is better.

503
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,480
I'll pick your mother up.

504
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:47,801
I'll make sure

505
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:48,401
that she

506
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:49,520
looks posh.

507
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:50,641
Listen.

508
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,121
I do have a posh car

509
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:53,321
today.

510
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,041
Tell me, then.

511
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,200
Who dotes on your mother the most?

512
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,520
The one who dotes on
your mother the most

513
00:20:58,561 --> 00:20:59,520
is still me.

514
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,161
Do you think she can depend on
that male classmate of hers?

515
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,121
You're right.

516
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,200
She...

517
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,440
Did you change your car?

518
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,881
That's not it.

519
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,601
My car broke down.

520
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,321
I sent it for repairs.

521
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:11,321
This is Chai Jin's car.

522
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,081
It's an expensive car.

523
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:14,920
This...

524
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,440
Hey, I dare not drive this car.

525
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,121
If I scratch it,

526
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,361
I'll have to pay tens of thousands
to repair it.

527
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,841
This is...

528
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,200
Just drive it.

529
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:21,480
I'll fork out the money
for you if you scratch it.

530
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,200
I'm working.

531
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,680
I don't have time

532
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,321
to chat with you.

533
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:23,801
Xiang Qian.

534
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,321
I need to discuss something with you.

535
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:29,920
After I pick up your mother tonight,

536
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:31,801
we plan

537
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,641
to live in your house for a few days.

538
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:36,081
We'll take care
of your children for you.

539
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,920
No need for that.

540
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:39,920
Gao Ping will come back

541
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,200
in a few more days.

542
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,081
We'll leave when he's back.

543
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:44,200
We won't affect your lives.

544
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,440
Alright.

545
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,280
Okay.

546
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll head to work now.

547
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,520
Alright.

548
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,440
Do I need to pick up

549
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
the children tonight?

550
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:54,841
Yes please!

551
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,561
Just look at her.

552
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I've proofread your script.

553
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,801
There's no issue.

554
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:14,760
I think you can post it now.

555
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:31,680
Buddy, don't.

556
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,161
What are you doing?

557
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,041
What am I doing?

558
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,321
I'm scanning the code to rent the bike.

559
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,121
This is mine.

560
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,760
I already scanned it. Look.

561
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:38,361
Buddy,

562
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:39,000
do you know

563
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:39,960
that this is a shared bike?

564
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,121
But look, my hand is here.

565
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:42,920
I was here long ago.

566
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,480
Sorry about this.

567
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,000
There's another bike over there.

568
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,641
Over there.

569
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,081
Deng Haiyang.

570
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:55,960
Zhong?

571
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,720
What are you doing here as well?

572
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,321
What a coincidence.

573
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,000
I was wondering why

574
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,881
there was a bike here

575
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,760
every morning.

576
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,920
It was you, huh?

577
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:06,480
That's not it.

578
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,480
There aren't that many bikes here.

579
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,161
And,

580
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,321
your office is pretty far away.

581
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:12,361
So, you were following me, huh?

582
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,361
That's not true.

583
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,881
I attended a training program
in Shanghai.

584
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:16,920
And, I saw you

585
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,520
in the subway before.

586
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,440
I just wanted to know

587
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,361
where you were...

588
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,440
Thank you. I don't need it.

589
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,161
Okay?

590
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:31,720
Wait.

591
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:34,561
Deng Haiyang,

592
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,561
Let's not keep in touch

593
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:36,960
or meet up again, okay?

594
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,881
Hey.

595
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,440
Can't we just be friends?

596
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:44,720
Just let me off, okay?

597
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:07,280
What happened?

598
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:09,601
Dad and Mom are here.

599
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,801
They saw that Aunty wasn't around.

600
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,881
They wanted to stay here

601
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,121
and take care of the kids
for a few more days.

602
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:16,401
They said

603
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,720
they wanted to stay here

604
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,680
until you come back.

605
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,960
One or two days are fine.

606
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,000
But I don't know
how to explain it to them

607
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,680
if they intend to stay past that period.

608
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
I don't want them

609
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,680
to be worried about us

610
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,161
before our conflict is resolved.

611
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,881
How do you intend to resolve it, then?

612
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:33,321
I don't know.

613
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,601
We can talk about it
after your thesis defense is over.

614
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,401
You want me to head home

615
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:42,361
and stage an act

616
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:43,841
in front of Mom and Dad?

617
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,520
Don't you think

618
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:47,361
we're being pretentious here?

619
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,960
Let me think about it.

620
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:56,361
I hope you can come back.

621
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
The hidden warriors

622
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,440
surrounded the nine-colored deer

623
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:12,760
and shot arrows one after another.

624
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,841
All of a sudden,

625
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,440
fierce flames

626
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,361
rose around the nine-colored deer.

627
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:20,280
All of the arrows

628
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,161
were burned down by the flame.

629
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:06,081
I've captured her.

630
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:07,321
Stop messing around.

631
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,881
Please.

632
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:10,000
He's been pretending the entire day.

633
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,121
He even wore white gloves?

634
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,601
He pretended to be my chauffeur.

635
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,401
Actually, he tailed me.

636
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
I was there to add to your radiance,

637
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,480
you know?

638
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,081
That's enough.

639
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,841
You have your own

640
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,280
personal chauffeur, you know?

641
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:22,680
Didn't you think

642
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,000
that you were glorious today?

643
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,440
Stop bringing that up.

644
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
My legs hurt

645
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:27,920
from wearing high heels all day long.

646
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,920
Cong and Qi are asleep.

647
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,520
That's right.

648
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,720
How many times have I told you?

649
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,480
High heels aren't meant for me indeed.

650
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:36,361
Don't blame your high heels.

651
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,200
Your legs hurt from dancing too much

652
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,641
with your old flame, am I right?

653
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,680
Great job.

654
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,920
I'll get you some warm water

655
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,401
to immerse your feet in.

656
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,081
I'll go.

657
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,081
You're tone-deaf.

658
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,240
You're jealous when I dance.

659
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,121
Just sit down.

660
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:47,680
That's enough.

661
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,081
I finally saw

662
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,601
your mother's old classmate today.

663
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,680
Your mother always told us

664
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:02,440
how handsome he was, right?

665
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,081
I saw him today.

666
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,161
Listen.

667
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,000
He...

668
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,361
He was truly handsome!

669
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,520
Was that a genuine reaction or not?

670
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,561
I had no idea before I saw him,

671
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,240
but I was shocked when I saw him.

672
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:19,401
Are you done yet?

673
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,121
I wouldn't have gone there

674
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:20,960
had I known he looked like this.

675
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,440
There's no need to worry at all.

676
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,081
What's taking you so long?

677
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:27,081
Are you retrieving it from a well?

678
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:27,881
Do you know

679
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:29,081
why he keeps pestering her?

680
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,601
Why?

681
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,641
Your mother

682
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
thought her old classmate

683
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,440
was devoted to her.

684
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:36,601
She thought
he couldn't forget about her.

685
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,280
But, listen to me,

686
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,960
he has an ulterior motive.

687
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,081
Tell your daughter why

688
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,720
he keeps pestering you.

689
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,480
Look at her.

690
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,280
What are you laughing at?

691
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:47,920
Tell her.

692
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:48,680
Tell her what happened today.

693
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:52,200
He's in the insurance industry.

694
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,440
Look at how smug you are.

695
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:59,960
So, is he handsome or not?

696
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:00,960
How come I didn't get

697
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,720
what Dad meant?

698
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,520
He's so handsome.

699
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:03,641
Tell her how handsome he is.

700
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,361
That's enough.

701
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:05,480
He hasn't grown an inch

702
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,000
since he graduated from

703
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,081
primary school.

704
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:12,920
You should thank me.

705
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
You would've fallen into the trap

706
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,161
had I not rescued you today.

707
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,121
That's enough.

708
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:18,841
I'm back.

709
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,561
My feet are so sore.

710
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,280
Take your foot bath.

711
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,041
Dad, Mom.

712
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,081
You're back.

713
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,881
Gao Ping.

714
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,440
You're back.

715
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,401
I thought Xiang Qian said

716
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,801
you would come back in a few more days.

717
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:30,841
My meeting ended in advance.

718
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:31,480
That's why I came back.

719
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:33,760
Give me the box.

720
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:38,920
Leave it in there.

721
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,920
I'll organize it later.

722
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,200
You have quite a lot
of meetings lately, huh?

723
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,480
I heard that you had
plenty of meetings in Suzhou.

724
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,601
That's right.

725
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:51,401
There's a new project
from the institute.

726
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
My supervisor is there too.

727
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,401
That's why I have to go.

728
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,280
Gao Ping,

729
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,720
it's good that you're busy.

730
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:00,920
But you can't just
forget about your family.

731
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:02,601
You see,

732
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,440
in your family,

733
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,280
Xiang Qian is looking after the two kids

734
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
by herself.

735
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,680
When they fell sick,

736
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,200
she panicked,
and everything went to hell.

737
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:12,401
Last night,

738
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,361
Cong and Qi fell sick.

739
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,321
Don't you know that?

740
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:19,760
He does.

741
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,240
I do.

742
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:22,680
Xiang Qian told me

743
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,920
that it wasn't anything major.

744
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,760
That's why I didn't come back.

745
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,480
Dad, Mom,

746
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,081
you guys should rest early.

747
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,280
You just came back.

748
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:30,361
You should take a bath.

749
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:30,960
Okay.

750
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,561
Please have a seat.

751
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,480
Did you see that?

752
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,401
Let's go.

753
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,041
I haven't dried my feet yet.

754
00:29:41,121 --> 00:29:42,081
No need for that.

755
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,841
What are you doing?

756
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,641
I'm dripping water all over the floor.

757
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,520
Let's go.

758
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:58,440
I saw a Porsche on our parking lot.

759
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,960
It's Chai Jin's car.

760
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,920
My car broke down.
It hasn't been repaired yet.

761
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,041
Why didn't you tell me about it?

762
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,561
Are we even keeping in touch these days?

763
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:19,401
Stop messing around.

764
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,480
What are you doing? Just sleep.

765
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
Don't you think

766
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,200
something's off about

767
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:28,200
Xiang Qian and her husband today?

768
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,240
What do you mean?

769
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:33,801
Xiang Qian said

770
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,440
Gao Ping loved the children.

771
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,161
He would always buy gifts for them

772
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,480
whenever he came back
from business trips.

773
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:39,520
At the very worst,

774
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:41,841
he would buy them a box of snacks.

775
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:43,280
But did you see it?

776
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,440
Gao Ping came back

777
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:47,361
without buying anything today.

778
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,920
Did he leave it in his luggage

779
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,960
because he forgot?

780
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,561
Xiang Qian said

781
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:57,401
Gao Ping would be worried

782
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:58,520
whenever the kids were sick.

783
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,121
But today,

784
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:01,440
just look at his expression
when he looked at me.

785
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,480
It felt as if he didn't know

786
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
that the kids were sick.

787
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,280
Let's analyze it.

788
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,520
Why did Xiang Qian

789
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,321
keep it from him?

790
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:11,720
Why didn't she

791
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,641
tell us about the real situation?

792
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:15,161
Maybe she's afraid that it might affect

793
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,121
his work.

794
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,480
She's afraid
that it might stress him out.

795
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,881
Maybe he's under too much pressure.

796
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,720
You're basically saying nothing.

797
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:23,440
Go to sleep.

798
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,801
The analysis isn't even that hard.

799
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:25,401
My goodness.

800
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:28,641
As if you didn't bring that up.

801
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,920
What happened to the kids?

802
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,280
They had acute gastroenteritis.

803
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:37,801
Maybe it was something bad they ate.

804
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,200
What did you feed them?

805
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,081
They had milk

806
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,321
and sandwich in the morning.

807
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:49,680
Did you put round ham

808
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,000
in the sandwich?

809
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:55,200
It was almost expired

810
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,641
when I came upon it a few days ago.

811
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,161
I forgot to remind you to throw it away.

812
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,161
If so, why didn't you
throw it away immediately?

813
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,480
Pay attention to what I said.

814
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,041
I said it was almost expired.

815
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:07,480
I didn't say that it was expired.

816
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:09,161
How could I throw it away
when it wasn't expired?

817
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:10,881
I barely had any time in the morning.

818
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,440
How could I

819
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,601
check every ingredient

820
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:13,720
and see if they were expired or not?

821
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:15,601
I've made breakfast so many times.

822
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,000
Why has this
never happened before, then?

823
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:17,641
That's right.

824
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,041
You were the one
who made breakfast usually.

825
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Raise your volume.

826
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:22,081
Let Dad and Mom hear it too.

827
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:25,401
What do you mean by that?

828
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:25,960
Don't talk.

829
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,480
You're blaming me
for raising my voice now?

830
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,121
What's the matter?

831
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,680
Don't talk.

832
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,161
What was that?

833
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,841
What are you doing?

834
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,440
Come here.

835
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,520
What?

836
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,041
My hearing is terrible.
Hear it on my behalf.

837
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,960
You.

838
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,480
Eavesdrop on them.
My hearing is terrible.

839
00:32:57,161 --> 00:32:57,881
There's nothing.

840
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,720
Dad, you're still awake?

841
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,720
Yeah.

842
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,561
You see, I...

843
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:08,881
My lower back is aching a little.

844
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,680
Your lower back is aching?

845
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,240
I need to use the restroom.

846
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:20,240
If so, I...

847
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,720
Let me get you some ointment.

848
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:22,601
No need for that.

849
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:26,041
Why aren't you guys asleep yet?

850
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:26,960
I...

851
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:28,520
I'm getting some water.
I'll sleep after that.

852
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:29,920
Alright, then.

853
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:31,041
Okay.

854
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,041
Are you sure you're fine?

855
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm fine.

856
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,440
Do you need my help?

857
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:35,200
No thanks.

858
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:36,881
You can go ahead.

859
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Alright. Be careful, then.

860
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,041
Isn't it cold to sleep on the floor?

861
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,081
Not at all.

862
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:10,321
What has Li Shu done wrong

863
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:11,321
for you to treat her like that?

864
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:18,240
Even now, you still think

865
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,760
that I wrote the anonymous letter,

866
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,200
huh?

867
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:21,680
Only you,

868
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,561
I,

869
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,680
and her boyfriend
know about her pregnancy.

870
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:24,800
So?

871
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:26,800
I'm the only person in the world

872
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
who has a motive to act, huh?

873
00:34:27,961 --> 00:34:29,081
Who else can it be, then?

874
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:31,880
Sometimes, I don't understand.

875
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,601
Why do you always act

876
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:34,320
without any mercy?

877
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,521
She had a bright future ahead of her.

878
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:37,280
She could apply for

879
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,041
teaching assistant positions

880
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:40,240
or pursue a PhD
after graduation, you know?

881
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,121
Now, she can't even

882
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:42,441
walk into the institute
without feeling ashamed.

883
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,921
You've ruined her life entirely.

884
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:44,561
Did you know that?

885
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,161
What do you mean by that?

886
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,400
What have I done

887
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:50,641
to ruin her life?

888
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,800
You always said that I didn't trust you.

889
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,121
Now, you're the one
who's not trusting me.

890
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,521
I already told you.
I didn't write the letter.

891
00:34:58,561 --> 00:34:59,400
I didn't.

892
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:01,081
Why don't you trust me?

893
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,081
We've been living together

894
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:03,720
for so many years.

895
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,240
Don't you know

896
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,121
the kind of person I am?

897
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:06,280
Since when have I done things

898
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,601
without mercy?

899
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,921
Can you please lower your volume?

900
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,161
My return is pointless

901
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:11,561
if Dad and Mom hear us, you know?

902
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,121
So, you came back today

903
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:21,961
to interrogate me

904
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:23,200
on Li Shu's behalf,

905
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,840
am I right?

906
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:27,360
I don't have the right to do so.

907
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:42,041
You're awake.

908
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,001
Morning, Dad.

909
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,641
Mom is helping the kids

910
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,400
to get dressed.

911
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,441
Dad,

912
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:57,680
will you and Mom
return to Kunshan today?

913
00:35:58,601 --> 00:35:59,280
Why the rush?

914
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:00,720
We'll stay here

915
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,481
and take care of the kids
for a few more days.

916
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:06,840
But you guys are occupying

917
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,521
Gao Ping's study room.

918
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:10,720
Did he complain about it?

919
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:13,360
No, he didn't.

920
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
You see, his thesis defense is nearing.

921
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:17,601
He needs some

922
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:18,921
private space.

923
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,441
Did you argue with Gao Ping?

924
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:25,760
No.

925
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,481
We even agreed

926
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:28,601
to go on a family trip

927
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,161
after his graduation.

928
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:32,961
I'm glad to hear that.

929
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:33,961
I'm truly glad to hear that.

930
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:36,041
What about this?

931
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:39,760
Later, Mom and I

932
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,720
will send the kids to school.

933
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,001
We'll head back after that.

934
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,001
I don't think you guys need to rush.

935
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,720
I'll send you guys back after work.

936
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,081
No need for that.

937
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,840
You guys

938
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
just need to take care of yourselves

939
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,200
and the kids.

940
00:36:57,521 --> 00:36:58,081
Here.

941
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,081
Bring the eggs there later.

942
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,041
Okay.

943
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:08,481
Good morning, Dad.

944
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:09,240
You're awake.

945
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:12,800
I don't know
if your mother is helping them

946
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,720
to get dressed

947
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,240
or making a dress for them.

948
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,800
Are you not done yet?

949
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,601
Dad and Mom will
return to Kunshan today.

950
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,441
It's fine.

951
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,121
They can stay here as long as they like.

952
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:30,521
I'll keep up with the act.

953
00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:35,200
But I can't.

954
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,121
Suit yourself. I don't care either way.

955
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,400
Li Shu.

956
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:01,521
Have a seat.

957
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,961
Let me introduce them to you.

958
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:06,200
This is Mr. Wu.

959
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,641
These two are Ms. Huang and Mr. Lin

960
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,121
from Sifang Notary Office.

961
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:12,840
This is Ms. Li Shu,

962
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,481
whom I had mentioned before.

963
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,161
Have a seat.

964
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,360
Xiang Qian.

965
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,121
Why are you looking for me?

966
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:23,961
The morning before last,

967
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,720
you rushed to my office

968
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,240
and was sure

969
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,601
that I wrote
the anonymous letter, right?

970
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:30,921
Today, I've invited Mr. Wu

971
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:32,001
and the personnel of Notary Office here

972
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,641
to clarify the situation.

973
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,760
You said you were going

974
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,680
to hire an attorney, right?

975
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,081
Have you hired one?

976
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:40,601
You can tell him to come here.

977
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,400
Ms. Li,

978
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
please have a seat.

979
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,280
Ms. Li,

980
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,601
please take a look.

981
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,081
This is

982
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,880
the surveillance camera footage

983
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:03,921
retrieved from Ms. Xiang Qian's office

984
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:05,601
at 9:20 A.M.

985
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:06,360
on the 20th of the month.

986
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,641
It showed

987
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:09,521
that you went

988
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,641
to Ms. Xiang Qian's office.

989
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,280
It appeared that there was a conflict
between you two.

990
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:17,680
I have a question.

991
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:18,800
What was the content

992
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,481
of your conflict with her?

993
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:27,961
Have you forgotten about it?

994
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:30,840
Do you need me to remind you?

995
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,720
Did you

996
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,041
question Ms. Xiang Qian

997
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,200
why she framed you

998
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,880
with the anonymous letter

999
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:40,561
when you were in her office?

1000
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,320
Since you're keeping quiet,

1001
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:47,921
I'll take it as a sign of consent.

1002
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,320
Alright, then.

1003
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:57,800
I have a question.

1004
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,081
Do you have any evidence

1005
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,561
to prove that the anonymous letter

1006
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,200
was written by Ms. Xiang Qian?

1007
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,121
If you do,

1008
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:04,121
you can provide it to us.

1009
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:05,001
Do you have any?

1010
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:07,441
I don't.

1011
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:08,800
Okay.

1012
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,720
If so, can I put it this way?

1013
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:14,680
Without any evidence or proof,

1014
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
you went to Ms. Xiang Qian's office

1015
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,961
at 9:20 A.M. on the 20th of the month

1016
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,400
and accused her in public

1017
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,041
for framing you

1018
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,720
with the anonymous letter.

1019
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:25,481
My description is accurate, right?

1020
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:28,840
Since you're keeping quiet,

1021
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,280
can I take it as a sign of consent?

1022
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,481
Mrs. Xiang.

1023
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,441
What exactly are you up to?

1024
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,760
Speak for yourself.

1025
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,200
Were you trying to ruin my family

1026
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:42,760
or sabotage my work?

1027
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
I had an important meeting to attend

1028
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,720
when you came to my office
on the 20th of the month.

1029
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,041
As I was worried that you might

1030
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:51,121
cause a commotion in the company,

1031
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:53,320
I had no choice but to withdraw
from the meeting.

1032
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,481
That had affected my work.

1033
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,521
There are two points
I wish to state here.

1034
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:58,360
Firstly,

1035
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,240
I didn't write the anonymous letter.

1036
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,360
If I can't prove my innocence

1037
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,961
with my words alone,

1038
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,921
I can only prove it through legal means.

1039
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,760
Secondly,

1040
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:12,441
you accused me of framing you
without any evidence.

1041
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,601
That's slander.

1042
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:16,081
Don't you agree?

1043
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,641
Back then, I was too agitated.

1044
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,880
I'm sorry.

1045
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,280
Ms. Li,

1046
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:33,200
calm down.

1047
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,200
Please calm down.

1048
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,921
Let's continue, okay?

1049
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,481
Can you please

1050
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:41,481
answer my question directly?

1051
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,041
You see,

1052
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,200
our comrades from
the notary office are here.

1053
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:47,001
If you keep quiet,

1054
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,760
we can only take it
as a sign of consent.

1055
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:52,161
That's right.

1056
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,081
I did find her before.

1057
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,680
But she and Gao Ping

1058
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,521
were the only ones

1059
00:41:58,561 --> 00:41:59,720
who knew about my pregnancy.

1060
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:02,280
Who wrote the anonymous letter, then?

1061
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,800
I didn't offend anyone.

1062
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,240
Why must they frame me?

1063
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,921
Are you sure

1064
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,240
that no one else

1065
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,521
knew about your pregnancy?

1066
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,961
Are you sure that Ms. Xiang Qian

1067
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,161
wrote the anonymous letter?

1068
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,001
Under such uncertain circumstances,

1069
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,441
if your extreme actions

1070
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:23,481
and inappropriate statements

1071
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,121
have affected

1072
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,001
my client's life and job

1073
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,961
in a negative way,

1074
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,961
you will be held legally responsible.

1075
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:33,001
Do you understand?

1076
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:36,880
That's all I have to ask.

1077
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:00,121
