00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 21=

4
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,469
If it doesn't work,

5
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,950
I can go straight to the hot spring.

6
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,531
It should be easy to find out.

7
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:45,091
Li Shu was there, alright?

8
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,490
She wants to be Mr. Lu's PhD student.

9
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,349
I don't care about

10
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,331
who wants to be a PhD student.

11
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,469
I just want to know

12
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,490
why you lied to me.

13
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,189
I didn't lie to you.

14
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,030
Li Shu did go there.

15
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:01,750
But Mr. Lu

16
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,189
did go to the hot spring too.

17
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,549
Plenty of us went there together.

18
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,010
There were other coursemates as well.

19
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:06,709
Li Shu and I

20
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,790
met each other by coincidence
at the entrance.

21
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,750
I casually scanned her ticket

22
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:09,510
together with mine

23
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,269
and slipped it in my pocket.

24
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,411
It's as simple as that.

25
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,829
If so, why did Aunty

26
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,589
react strongly

27
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,730
when she saw the two tickets?

28
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,170
I...

29
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,610
Unless Aunty knew

30
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:24,950
that Li Shu went to Suzhou
together with you

31
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:26,010
and enjoyed the hot spring together.

32
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:29,010
She was helping you to hide the secret.

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,691
That's why she was stressed out.

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,470
That's why she wanted
to leave our house,

35
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:33,290
am I right?

36
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,730
That's right.

37
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,910
If so, why did you say

38
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,811
that I was the one
who chased Aunty away?

39
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,091
Didn't you...

40
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:45,390
Didn't you always force her to do things

41
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:45,910
like how you forced me?

42
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:47,130
I don't see any issue with that.

43
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,829
But you knew

44
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,390
that I wasn't willing to let you

45
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:52,269
be in contact with Li Shu.

46
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,230
Even so, you went

47
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:54,149
to Suzhou together with her.

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,589
Mr. Lu told her to go.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,230
What could I do about it?

50
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:56,950
Was I supposed to stop her?

51
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:57,989
First, you said she wanted

52
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,829
to be Mr. Lu's PhD student.

53
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,709
Now, you're saying

54
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,211
Mr. Lu invited her to go.

55
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,110
I don't know which words are true

56
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,290
and which are lies.

57
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,840
(Jiang Jiaqiao)

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,771
Hello?

59
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,190
Xiang Nan,

60
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:02,869
have you received the video

61
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,010
I sent you?

62
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,130
I already viewed it. What's wrong?

63
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,170
Where are you right now?

64
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,170
I'm working in the studio now.

65
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,691
Listen.

66
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,510
My brother had a huge argument

67
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:15,549
with Xu Sumin.

68
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,850
He already sent her away.

69
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,190
Now, he's begging

70
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,531
for your return.

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,730
Hello?

72
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,509
(Why do you like)

73
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,971
(to complete this puzzle painting
all the time?)

74
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,110
Did you see the old couple

75
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:10,531
in the painting?

76
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,810
(That's the married life I desired.)

77
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,949
Come inside.

78
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,850
Aunty.

79
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,370
You can take this.

80
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,730
This won't do.

81
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,150
You've already given me
plenty of wages.

82
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,490
I can't take your money.

83
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,131
Aunty, just take it.

84
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,810
You're our elder.

85
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,110
It's my duty and Gao Ping's duty

86
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:41,170
to be filial to you.

87
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,429
Now, Fang Yuan

88
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,949
has found a decent job.

89
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,771
You don't need
to be worried about him now.

90
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:50,331
It's time for you to head back, rest,
and go on a trip.

91
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,411
Xiang Qian, thank you.

92
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,389
Please pack your belongings.

93
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,309
I'll send my children

94
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,749
to the kindergarten tomorrow morning.

95
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,451
I won't be seeing you off
at the train station.

96
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,331
Wait.

97
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,869
I got this protective amulet

98
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,429
before I left home.

99
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,651
It serves to protect you.

100
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,411
Keep it with you.

101
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,290
I hope

102
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:17,610
that you have a smooth life ahead.

103
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,011
Okay. Thank you, Aunty.

104
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,810
In the future,

105
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,869
no matter what you do,

106
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,211
you shouldn't just
pay attention to Gao Ping.

107
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,790
You should pay attention

108
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,810
to your needs as well.

109
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:34,971
Understood?

110
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,131
Understood.

111
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,971
Aunty, please go ahead.

112
00:06:56,471 --> 00:06:59,211
You see, we need
to learn how to be content.

113
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,891
Xiang Qian is nice to you.

114
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,091
She's pretty nice to me.

115
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,590
But I am nice to her

116
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,170
and her children too.

117
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,810
If so, why are you
trying to get a divorce?

118
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,651
Aunty,

119
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,230
since we're a family,

120
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,531
I'll be honest with you.

121
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,451
If I could stay at the research center,

122
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,651
I do feel like spending
the rest of my life with them peacefully.

123
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,610
All humans have feelings.

124
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:28,170
We've been together for so many years.

125
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,771
I do have feelings for her
and her children.

126
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,050
But now, I'm already
at the end of the road.

127
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,211
I've studied all my life.

128
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:48,710
Do you think I'm willing
to be a househusband

129
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,710
who does the laundry,

130
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,930
cooks, looks after the children,

131
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,030
and waits for my wife

132
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,971
to come back home from work at home?

133
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,309
There are plenty of

134
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,270
excellent foreign research centers
and colleges

135
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:06,629
that are willing to give me an opportunity.

136
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,429
Why shouldn't I give it a try?

137
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,610
Why should I be trapped here
for the rest of my life?

138
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,011
But you're letting her down by doing so.

139
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,451
I know I'm letting her down.

140
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,509
But first, I need to learn

141
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,730
how to fulfill my needs.

142
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,190
Be careful. Watch out for the wall.

143
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,830
That's right. Keep an eye on him.
That's right.

144
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:08,029
Okay. Thank you.

145
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,891
Qian Feng?

146
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,330
Xiang Zhong?

147
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,491
You're back.

148
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,450
What's going on?

149
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:18,771
Haiyang told me to remove this wall
at all costs by today.

150
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:19,989
But why?

151
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,851
Because his mother
had already moved out.

152
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,251
You had no idea, huh?

153
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,330
No.

154
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,110
Haiyang told his mother

155
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,450
that your family was scammed
of your savings.

156
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,690
But she didn't believe him.

157
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,110
Haiyang had no choice.

158
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,830
He went and turned himself in to Xiaosi.

159
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:37,210
His mother left in a fit of anger as well.

160
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,810
Now, I'm worried

161
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,491
that news of this might spread quickly.

162
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,909
If that happens, Haiyang will never

163
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,731
be able to face the world again.

164
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:51,251
Mom.

165
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,570
Aunt.

166
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,450
Why are you guys
getting rid of the wall?

167
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,789
Has the old hag moved out?

168
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,269
She has.

169
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,131
Yeah.

170
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,149
Has she truly straightened out
her thoughts?

171
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,290
Or is she up to something else now?

172
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,629
Mom, you should stop asking.

173
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,590
What did you bring?

174
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,509
You said you couldn't cook.

175
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,989
Your father instructed me
to deliver food to you.

176
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,669
It's not like I can't eat outside.

177
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,190
Why did you bring so much food here?

178
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:11,710
Don't go there.

179
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,509
You haven't eaten yet too, right?

180
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,029
Yeah.

181
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,131
Let's eat together.

182
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,669
It's so dusty in the house.

183
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,450
How can you let Qian Feng eat here?

184
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,411
Yuanyuan, have you left the house?

185
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,050
I'm getting ready.

186
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,269
After that,

187
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,310
send me

188
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:25,350
the GPS address

189
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,411
again.

190
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:36,131
Aunty already left.

191
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,570
I've sent the children
to the kindergarten.

192
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,290
I can pick them up as well today.

193
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,710
I'm only meeting one client today.

194
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:45,771
That's all I'm doing today.

195
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,731
What about you?

196
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,690
You can track my car, right?

197
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:51,930
You can take a look at it yourself.

198
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,070
Enough. How many times have I told you

199
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,190
not to deliver food to me?

200
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:14,491
Don't you think it's troublesome?

201
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,789
I arranged to meet Deng Haiyang

202
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,411
at the Civil Affairs Bureau
to complete the paperwork.

203
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,690
He agreed to it?

204
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:24,371
Yeah.

205
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:27,131
What conditions did he bring up?

206
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,771
He didn't.

207
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,070
But I feel restless

208
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,930
after hearing that.

209
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,029
Isn't it good for us
to resolve this peacefully?

210
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,110
Tell Father about this
when you get back.

211
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,210
Tell him not to worry.

212
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,531
If so, I suppose
you don't need to resign, right?

213
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:43,749
I will.

214
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,470
I've submitted my resume
to a few companies in Shanghai.

215
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,731
Two companies have already arranged
an interview for me.

216
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,029
Even if his mother
didn't stir up a ruckus,

217
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,371
I would've resigned anyway.

218
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:53,891
Shanghai is very far, you know?

219
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:56,350
Do you wish
to stay away from us that badly?

220
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:57,789
Mom, what are you saying?

221
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,749
How is Shanghai far?

222
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,491
It's common for people
to travel to Shanghai for work.

223
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,110
Even if I'm working in Shanghai,

224
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,550
I have to stay in Kunshan.

225
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:04,550
The rent in Shanghai is expensive.

226
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,810
I can't afford it.

227
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,629
It's tiring if you have
to travel back and forth.

228
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,970
Every job is tiring, you know?

229
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:10,950
Alright. Go now.

230
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,110
Go back and take a nap.

231
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:12,629
Okay?

232
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,350
You came here so early in the morning.

233
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,310
You should think twice.

234
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,050
Got it.

235
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:16,090
You should head back now.

236
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:18,930
Text me when you arrive home, okay?

237
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:32,749
This won't affect

238
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,509
your

239
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,070
normal access. Please give me a second.

240
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:36,810
Madam, Mr. Jiang is in a meeting.

241
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:38,830
I've brought him something.

242
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:39,830
Let me bring it to him, then.

243
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:41,190
No need for that. You can go ahead.

244
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:42,190
I'll wait for him at his office.

245
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:42,891
Okay.

246
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:46,210
That's right.

247
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,810
Xiang Nan.

248
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,371
What are you looking for?

249
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,611
Isn't this Xu Sumin's bag?

250
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,491
Why is it here?

251
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,389
Jiang Jiaqiao told me

252
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,470
that you've already sent her away.

253
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:21,389
If so, why is her bag still here?

254
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,450
Why didn't she take it with her?

255
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:25,851
This is my office.

256
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,851
We can talk at home.

257
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,669
What else are you and Xu Sumin

258
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,491
hiding from me?

259
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,731
You don't need to know.

260
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,350
How are we

261
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:35,269
still a family

262
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,629
if you hide everything from me?

263
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,950
It's impossible for me
to report everything

264
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,170
to you.

265
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,669
I'm sure you knew about
Xu Sumin's return

266
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,470
in advance.

267
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:42,509
Why didn't you tell me about it?

268
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,070
Do you think she won't return

269
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:44,070
after I tell you about it?

270
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:44,789
At least you can

271
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,891
discuss it with me.

272
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,190
You don't tell me

273
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:47,789
anything at all.

274
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,749
You only notify me.

275
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,749
What do you take me for?

276
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,930
A vase?

277
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,290
Fine.

278
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,330
You wish to know

279
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:58,310
why Xu Sumin's bag

280
00:13:58,311 --> 00:13:59,491
is here, right?

281
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:01,810
I'll tell you right now.

282
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,611
I bought this bag

283
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,550
for Xu Sumin with the money I made

284
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:07,891
with my first business deal.

285
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,050
She said she wanted
to leave the bag here

286
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,389
and sever our ties entirely

287
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,970
before returning to Canada.

288
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:15,011
I haven't got the time
to dispose of it yet.

289
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:17,251
What else do you wish to know?

290
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,029
Is it truly that simple?

291
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,170
Of course not.

292
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,690
I gave her this sum.

293
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,891
I gave her 100 million yuan!

294
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,590
She said she lost all of her investments

295
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:30,710
in Canada.

296
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,090
Now, she's in huge debt.

297
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:33,710
Initially, I wanted to take my time

298
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:35,210
to resolve the issue.

299
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:36,869
I didn't expect you two

300
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,371
to fall out with each other.

301
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,710
After that, she blackmailed me

302
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,651
by saying that I would never
get to see my daughter again.

303
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:43,830
Do you know how long has it been

304
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,210
since I saw Jiang Xiaotong?

305
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:47,230
Do you know how much

306
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,330
I care about my daughter?

307
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,131
What else can I do?

308
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,611
Xiang Nan.

309
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,731
I keep certain secrets from you

310
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,170
because I don't want you
to be stressed out.

311
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:26,090
I didn't mean to reprimand you at all.

312
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,531
I hope you can understand.

313
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,090
Besides that,

314
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,930
there's another thing
I need to tell you.

315
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:46,470
Xiaotong will return

316
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:47,690
and live with us soon.

317
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:50,669
I hope we can take care of her

318
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,851
together.

319
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,731
Have your legs recovered?

320
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,450
I guess.

321
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:12,731
Have you brought your ID card
and photocopied pictures?

322
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,629
This is my second time here.

323
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,629
Of course I brought
everything necessary.

324
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,771
Alright. Let's go, then.

325
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,491
We have to line up inside.

326
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:18,029
I know.

327
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,149
It's not my first time here.

328
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,989
I'll queue for a number.

329
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,050
I already got one.

330
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:22,771
It's crowded today.

331
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,090
We should wait outside.

332
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,970
Does your mother know that
we're completing the procedure today?

333
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,251
I didn't tell her about it.

334
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:43,710
You have to tell her

335
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,690
since this is a joyous occasion.

336
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:46,710
I assume

337
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,330
she has already given up on me.

338
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:50,651
If so, I need to congratulate you.

339
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,629
For what?

340
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,050
She already chased me out of the house.

341
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:57,251
She chased you out?

342
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,450
Where are you living, then?

343
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:02,731
In Qian Feng's house.

344
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,830
You can't just live with him

345
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:04,771
forever.

346
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,371
That's none of your business.

347
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:10,869
You need to queue up.

348
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,411
That's what I'm doing,
and that's none of your business.

349
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,411
I have a few routine questions
for you two.

350
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:25,869
Do both parties have the capacity

351
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,429
to act?

352
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,170
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

353
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,110
Is the divorce mutually voluntary?

354
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,851
- Yes.
- Yes.

355
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,110
Regarding your children...

356
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,051
- We don't have one.
- We don't.

357
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,550
Guys,

358
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,730
let me finish my questions, okay?

359
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,030
Is the property of both parties

360
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:45,869
to be divided?

361
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,571
- Yes.
- Yes.

362
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:51,229
Can't you guys wait for me

363
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,851
to finish?

364
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:54,411
Sorry about that. Please continue.

365
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:00,669
If one party is facing difficulties,

366
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,629
have both parties reached an agreement

367
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,510
regarding financial assistance?

368
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:05,371
Is the payment method appropriate?

369
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:06,510
Wait.

370
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,869
Can't we get a divorce

371
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,291
if we say no?

372
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,949

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,811

381
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,250
Is this your first time
applying for a divorce?

382
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:28,450
No.

383
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:30,790
Guys, please fill up the forms

384
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,010
over there.

385
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,131
Okay. Thank you.

386
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,550
What are you doing?

387
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:42,790
Why must you be mean to him?

388
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,629
Why did you do so?

389
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,690
That's none of your business.

I knew

392
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:03,990
you would write the wrong thing.

393
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:04,750
So what?

394
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:05,770
It's not like it'll affect...

395
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,669
It will affect the procedure.

396
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,170
They won't let you apply for it
if you write the wrong thing.

397
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,411
I just need to correct it.

398
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,331
What nonsense is this?

399
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,371
What's the reason for divorce?

400
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:19,970
A relationship breakdown.

401
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,530
Can I write another reason?

402
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,851
What reason do you want to write?

403
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,371
I just want to state the facts.

404
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:29,371
For example,

405
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,331
why do you wish to get a divorce?

406
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,051
It's because of
the relationship breakdown.

407
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,730
Have you ever loved me before?

408
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:41,450
That's disgusting.

409
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,450
Fine. I got it.

410
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,210
You never loved me before.

411
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,131

413
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,070
What did you write?

414
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:02,909
Just write "relationship breakdown"

415
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,131
and be done with it.

416

So,

you can take the car with you.

424

That's not it.

Will Ms. Li be here today?

Ms. Li won't be coming recently.

But why?

468
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,131
Because she needs to prepare for
her graduation ceremony.

Ms. Li comes to our house,

483
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:49,530

or dislike someone.

487
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:02,770
There are many
complicated reasons at play here.

488
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,490
Let's go.

489

00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:38,770
She didn't tell me about it
even when I asked her.

498
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,851
is quite interesting.

00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,250
I have to ask Haiyang about it tomorrow.

502
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,891
Don't.

503
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,690
They're already divorced.
The procedure is already completed.

504
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,270
They're unrelated now.

505
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:03,830
If you go and ask him,

506
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:05,530
you'll be meddling with
their family affair.

Xiang Qian, are you at home?

580
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,830
Dayuan, I'm home.

581
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,730
What's wrong?

582
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,651
Can you come and fetch Gao Ping?

583
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,851
He's drunk.

584
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:32,611
He's utterly drunk.

585
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,690

We're at a KTV.

588
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,110
Please come and pick him up.

589
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:40,590
I'm serious.

590
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:42,210
I've never seen him this drunk before.

591
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:43,510
Alright.

592
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:45,189
Send me

593
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,869

594
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,851
I'll head there now.

595
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:47,851
Okay.

596
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,690
Please come and fetch him.

597
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,571
Alright. I'm heading there.

(Huihuang KTV)

599
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,550
Xiang Qian.

600
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:57,149
Dayuan.

601
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,709
Over here.

602
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,450
Over here.

603
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:00,250
I'm drunk too.

604
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,851
Say,

605
00:30:02,271 --> 00:30:03,229
have you guys

606
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,371
been arguing lately?

607
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:05,990
We're supposed to celebrate my success

608
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:06,949
since I received Hopkins' offer letter.

609
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,210
But he was drowning himself
in sorrow instead.

610
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:10,669
He's inside the room.

611
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,690
I won't head inside.

612
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,450
My friends are waiting for me outside.

613
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,291
Congratulations, Dayuan.

614
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:17,371
Thank you.

615
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:09,131
Let's go.

616
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,170
Let's go home.

617
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,091
Cong and Qi

618
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,651
are waiting for you at home.

619
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,371
Are you asleep?

620
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:17,291
I have a question.

621
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,189
I thought Dayuan

622
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,189
already received a slot in the academy.

623
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,170
How did he apply for
another slot abroad?

624
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,210
You're asking me?
Who should I ask, then?

625
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,629
You should ask your institute.

626
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,110
This is stupid.

627
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:29,949
Why are they reserving a slot

628
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,709
in the academy

629
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,571
for someone who's about to go abroad?

630
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:36,730
I don't feel like asking them anymore.
It's already pointless.

631
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,030
Since Dayuan is going abroad,

632
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:42,909
will they

633
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,571
give you the slot, then?

634
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,949
I don't feel like asking them.

635
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,510
I no longer want to ask them about it.

636
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,571
Okay?

637
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,790
I just want

638
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,070
to graduate peacefully.

639
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:53,949
It's pointless

640
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,590
to ask around and compete with others.

641
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:57,450
I'm tired. I'm truly tired of this.

642
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,469
But didn't you say you wish

643
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,930
to get a slot in the academy
after graduating?

644
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,669
Since Dayuan will be going abroad,

645
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,051
you should ask them about it.

646
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:09,651
I'll sleep in the study room
for the time being.

647
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,811
What did you say?

648
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:16,709
I said, I'll sleep in the study room

649
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,891
for the time being.

650
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:20,770
But why?

651
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,909
You have no idea

652
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,250
how terrible I feel.

653
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:27,310
You have no idea

654
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:28,811
how much pressure I'm under.

655
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,189
You've never experienced this
in your life, relationship,

656
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,970
and work.

657
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,730
There's literally no hope for me.

658
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,331
Finish the milk.

659
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:06,750
Good morning, Mom.

660
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:08,811
Morning, my babies.

661
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,669
Dad,

662
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,731
can you tell Ms. Li to come back?

663
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,789
Ms. Li is very busy.

664
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,331
She has her own affairs to deal with.

665
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,229
But we haven't finished

666
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,390
our clay family yet.

667
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:24,851
I'll receive a stamp of excellence
after completing it.

668
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,070
I really want

669
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:28,390
my teacher to praise me.

670
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:30,110
I want my teacher

671
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,171
to praise me too.

672
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,211
Alright, I got it.

673
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,229
Hurry. You guys should pack your bags.

674
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,530
Time to go to school.

675
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:38,149
Go now.

676
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,629
Okay.

677
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,309
I'll help you guys out

678
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,110
later.

679
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:40,510
Go now.

680
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,490
Okay, Dad.

681
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,530
Can you allow Li Shu

682
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,490
to come back just once?

683
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,731
Let her finish the clay family
together with the children.

684
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,090
I don't want the children
to be disappointed.

685
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,789
There's no need

686
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,211
for us to implicate

687
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,291
the children, right?

688
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,870
Think about it.

689
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,251
I'll help them pack their bags.

690
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:23,450
Here, take a look.

691
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,331
From now on, this will be your home.

692
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,970
Xiaotong!

693
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:34,970
Who are you?

694
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:36,749
I'm your aunt.

695
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,130
Don't you recognize me?

696
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,731
She's your aunt.

697
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:40,629
I always held your hands

698
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,010
when you were young, you know?

699
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,530
Did you go for plastic surgery?

700
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:52,891
Do I look prettier now?

701
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,771
You don't.

702
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,930
You're breaking my heart, you know?

703
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,251
Alright now. Come here.

704
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:01,650
Let me introduce someone to you.

705
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,851
This is Xiaotong.

706
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,371
Hello, Xiaotong.

707
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:06,490
This is Xiang Nan.

708
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,331
How do you want me to address her?

709
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,090
Sister? Aunt?

710
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,891
Or Stepmother?

711
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,930
You can call me Xiang Nan.

712
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,130
That's right.

713
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:20,291
Ms. He,

714
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,110
you can take Xiaotong to her room first.

715
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:22,789
Alright.

716
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,130
Xiaotong, come with me.

717
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:30,970
She's all grown up.

718
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,251
Come, Xiaotong.

719
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,291
You can check out your room.

720
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,570
Is there another room?

721
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:50,629
Madam decorated

722
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,050
this room for you.

723
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,709
Everything is pink. It's disgusting.

724
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,851
I feel like throwing up.

725
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:57,211
Go ahead, then.

726
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,851
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

727
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,870
Can you guys not put any portraits

728
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:10,510
in my room?

729
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:11,910
Can you be polite for once?

730
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:12,590
Xiaotong, it's fine.

731
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:13,430
If you don't like

732
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,349
the pink layout,

733
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,669
we'll change it for you.

734
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,430
Xiang Nan, no need for that.

735
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:17,291
There's no need to change it.

736
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:18,371
Just leave it like this.

737
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:21,470
Not all girls

738
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:22,910
like pink, okay?

739
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:23,891
Not okay.

740
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,090
You leave me no choice anyway.

741
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:28,930
In the future,
only Mandarin will be allowed.

742
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:30,731
This isn't Canada.

743
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,930
She has terrible habits.

744
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,970
I'm sure it's because
Xu Sumin spoiled her.

745
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:51,891
She's too arrogant for her own good.

746
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:54,709
Why didn't you make her

747
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,990
come back earlier?

748
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:57,411
You think I didn't want to do so?

749
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,050
Her mother disagreed with the notion.

750
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,970
She couldn't even come back

751
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,530
had I not renegotiated
the terms with her.

752
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,891
Where are my things?

753
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,610
The boxing gloves and all.

754
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:14,211
Don't you know how to greet your father?

755
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:15,650
Where's my stuff?

756
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:17,211
I threw them away.

757
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:20,891
Why did you throw them away?

758
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:22,490
What gives you the right to do so?

759
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,371
Firstly,

760
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,470
you don't need that junk

761
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,411
when you live here.

762
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:26,251
Secondly,

763
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:27,309
I'm your father.

764
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,470
I have all the rights
in the world to do so.

765
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,291
Understood?

766
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:33,851
She's spoiled.

767
00:38:35,431 --> 00:38:36,309
Did you actually

768
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,490
throw her things away?

769
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:37,910
No.

770
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:38,970
I kept them away.

771
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:39,950
All those

772
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,331
were junk.

773
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:43,149
Jiang, she's only in her teens.

774
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,691
She's in her teenage years.

775
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,411
If you do this,

776
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,331
it'll only intensify
the conflict between you two.

777
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,171
If we don't keep her in check now,

778
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,891
it'll be too late in the future.

779
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,090
Are you Xiang Zhong?

780
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,530
I'm Xiang Zhong.

781
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,050
I'm Flowey.

782
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,530
Nice to meet you. I'm Yu Yue.

783
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,291
We use nicknames here.

784
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:58,891
I'm Grace.

785
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,211
What an ancient name.

786
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,590
Ms. Grace,

787
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:05,050
welcome to the 21st century.

788
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,490
Come. Over here, please.

789
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,709
Later,

790
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,470
I'm going to make a garden.

791
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:14,629
You want to make a garden?

792
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,669
Which color will you pick

793
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,811
for your garden?

794
00:40:16,991 --> 00:40:18,950
I'll get some green modeling clay first.

795
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:19,629
After that,

796
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,771
I'll make a grass patch.

797
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,550
Let's finish the family first,

798
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:26,590
okay?

799
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,189
Okay.

800
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,851
Cong, Qi.

801
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,669
Mom, come and take a look.

802
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,149
This is the clay family
that Qi and I had made.

803
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,211
- Mom, take a look.
- Xiang Qian.

804
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,411
Mom, take a look.

805
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:40,030
Mom, this is you.

806
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:41,430
This is Dad.

807
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:42,870
This is Grandpa.

808
00:40:42,871 --> 00:40:44,349
This is Grandma.

809
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,669
This is Qi.

810
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,490
This is Cong.

811
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,771
You two did a great job.

812
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:52,669
Do you guys want to make

813
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,211
one for Aunt Zhong and Aunt Nan?

814
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:55,891
Okay.

815
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,749
If so, let's make clay figures

816
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,269
for Aunt Zhong and Aunt Nan.

817
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,450
There's Grand Aunt as well.

818
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:03,950
If so, let's make another one

819
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:04,829
for Grand Aunt.

820
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,090
Okay.

821
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,050
Just a little more.

822
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,811
Do you need to resort to this?

823
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,530
What do you mean?

824
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:27,829
The house's camera

825
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,010
was switched on.

826
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,070
I have no idea.

827
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,331
It wasn't me.

828
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:35,309
It's been so long

829
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,851
since the camera was activated.

830
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,149
However, it was activated today.

831
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,070
Li Shu discovered it.

832
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:40,229
Did you know how embarrassing it was?

833
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,731
Did you know how awkward it was?

834
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,870
Isn't it strange?

835
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,070
Li Shu is a home tutor.

836
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:46,990
Why is she

837
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:47,950
paying attention

838
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:49,211
to our surveillance camera?

839
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,870
You told me to bring Li Shu here

840
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:52,669
to teach the children.

841
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,870
After that, you activated the camera.

842
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:55,090
What are you trying to record here?

843
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:58,331
I agreed to let Li Shu come back because

844
00:41:59,071 --> 00:42:00,771
I don't want the children to be upset.

845
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:01,629
I want them

846
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,910
to complete their clay family.

847
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:03,930
That's all.

848
00:42:04,031 --> 00:42:05,229
I also hope that our relationship

849
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,251
can return to a peaceful era.

850
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:07,910
Xiang Qian,

851
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:08,749
I have no idea

852
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,950
what you are up to.

853
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:11,669
You don't like Li Shu? Fine.

854
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,510
Just tell her to leave.
I have no issue with that.

855
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:14,891
But how can I do that at my workplace?

856
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:17,110
She and I are working in the same place.

857
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:19,171
And, she intends to be
Mr. Lu's PhD student as well.

858
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,229
If she succeeds,

859
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,390
we'll have to see each other
for three years.

860
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:22,970
We'll run into each other all the time.

861
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:24,110
Do you want us to argue over her

862
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,090
for the next three years?

863
00:42:25,471 --> 00:42:26,629
Even if she does leave,

864
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,189
there will be other people like her.

865
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,349
You can't expect me
to work in an environment

866
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,691
without any female colleagues.

867
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:31,829
If you wish

868
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,189
to repair our relationship,

869
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,829
don't you think

870
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,789
you should place more trust in me

871
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,189
instead of

872
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,610
resorting to such cheap means?

873
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:41,811
Since when did I resort to cheap means?

874
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,189
I don't think

875
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,990
I've ever doubted your relationships

876
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:48,749
with any of your female coursemates

877
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,650
or colleagues before, right?

878
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,149
I think

879
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,251
you're overreacting here.
