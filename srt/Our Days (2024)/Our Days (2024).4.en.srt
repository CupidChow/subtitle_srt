00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
(Adapted from Lang Lang's original novel
"The Prime of the Goddess")

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 4=

4
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,519
If you don't move, I'll post
your pictures on my WeChat Moments

5
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,859
so that you can be happy about it.

6
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,340
You must be bored out of your mind.
That's no fun.

7
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:05,939
Do you need to resort to that?

8
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,939
He must be sick in the head.

9
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,508
Mr. Gao Ping.

10
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:27,027
Can we swap our car today?

11
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:29,166
Mine is out of gas.
And, I have no time to refill it.

12
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,587
Can you refill it for me this afternoon?

13
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:32,027
No problem. Go ahead.

14
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,228
Sorry.

15
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:37,886
I cannot go back

16
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,067
with you today.

17
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,247
I need to finish this

18
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:41,307
by 3 P.M.

19
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:43,347
It's fine. You can go ahead.

20
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,166
They have a swimming session at 5 P.M.

21
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,027
Don't forget.

22
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:50,127
Goodbye.

23
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:50,867
Goodbye.

24
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,788
What are you doing here?

25
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:27,600
Are you afraid
that I'll see your massage device?

26
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:30,788
Didn't you say you already
gave it to someone else?

27
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:32,907
It's a critical time for you

28
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,948
to remain in the hospital now.

29
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,446
Can you let go of

30
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,067
some of that arrogance of yours?

31
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,147
It's pointless for you
to be professional alone.

32
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,228
Don't you think you have to establish
some connections too?

33
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:44,788
I'm not trying to be arrogant here.

34
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:47,067
I did try to deliver it to her.

35
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,687
But Dayuan also bought

36
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,407
a 6,000 yuan chair
for Ms. Yuan at the same time.

37
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:51,228
I was

38
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,347
too embarrassed to give it to her.

39
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:55,367
It's the thought that counts

40
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,988
when a student gives his teacher a gift.

41
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,388
It has nothing to do with the price.

42
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,446
Isn't it great?

43
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,927
He's gifting her a chair while
you're gifting her a massage device.

44
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,240
At least the gifts aren't the same.

45
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:08,747
What will you do, then?

46
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:11,307
Will you buy something more expensive?

47
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,147
I don't have money for that.
I only have a tiny bit of allowance.

48
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,347
What do you mean by that?

49
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,487
We've been living together
for almost five years now.

50
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,307
Now, you're trying
to differentiate between us, huh?

51
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:27,247
There's no need for that.
I didn't contribute anything.

52
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:28,908
You're the one sustaining the family.

53
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,307
You'll graduate soon, right?

54
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,067
By then, you can give me your wage.

55
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:40,588
You can't do anything
with that measly wage of mine.

56
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,148
So?

57
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,566
I know you don't mind.
But you should consider my feelings.

58
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,588
I can't just spend your money all the time
without feeling guilty, you know?

59
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,006
Isn't this how we've divided things

60
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,827
in our family all along?

61
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:55,548
What's wrong?

62
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,228
Did my words hurt you again?

63
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:02,507
That's not it.

64
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,387
You can proceed with your thesis.

65
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:10,947
I'll deliver your massage device
to Mom and Dad.

66
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:28,067
Mom.

67
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,267
Have you eaten?

68
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,228
Which meal do you mean?
Look at the time.

69
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,267
Qian, look.

70
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:39,788
Did you dye your hair?

71
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,006
Why did you...

72
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,907
Lower your volume.

73
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,167
Why did you only dye such a small part?

74
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,966
I dare not go overboard.
Your father didn't like it.

75
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,788
I told your aunt
to dye my hair in secret.

76
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:48,428
- It looks nice, right?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:49,960
If I must say, you should dye all of it.

78
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:50,867
Xiang Qian.

79
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,148
Why are you only back now?

80
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,607
Look at the time.
Aren't we having dinner at 6 P.M.?

81
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:57,187
Look at the time? I have to prepare dinner
in advance, you know?

82
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:58,966
- Fine.
- What's wrong with your mother?

83
00:05:58,967 --> 00:05:59,526
It's nothing.

84
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,526
- Do you have a lice problem?
- That's not it. Let me help you out.

85
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,028
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

86
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:16,827
Dad.

87
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:19,086
Are you celebrating Chinese New Year?

88
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,080
Didn't you say you were going
to prepare some simple dishes?

89
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:22,526
These are the simple dishes

90
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:23,788
we always prepare.

91
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,326
You're quite hilarious, huh?

92
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:26,326
Do you and Mom have them

93
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:27,627
at home every day?

94
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:28,807
If so, I'm sure you guys

95
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,387
have to visit the hospital every day.

96
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,827
It's not terrible.

97
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,747
You guys grew up eating them, you know?

98
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,446
Come.

99
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:37,788
Grab me the scissors.

100
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:39,707
Alright.

101
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:43,028
By the way, Xiang Qian,

102
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:47,006
I've gotten a thorough understanding

103
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,108
of Jiang Hongbin's situation lately.

104
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,028
What have you understood?

105
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,047
I've read all reports

106
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:54,267
that were related to him.

107
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:55,627
I won't talk about the good ones.

108
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:57,747
But some situations

109
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,108
require a deeper understanding.

110
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,067
It's all in my mind now.

111
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,468
We have to act accordingly

112
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:07,127
during the meal.

113
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,428
We must make sure

114
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,187
that each point is implemented.

115
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:17,788
Monthly wage,

116
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:19,947
and units in possession?

117
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:20,807
Units?

118
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:21,927
He builds houses for a living.

119
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:23,607
How could he remember
how many units he has?

120
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,947
That'll depend on

121
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,588
a drinking session.

122
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:27,947
Don't you agree?

123
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:29,526
We'll be brave enough

124
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:30,747
to ask him when we're drunk.

125
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:32,127
And, he'll answer everything

126
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,588
when he's drunk.

127
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,788
We must drink well today.

128
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,548
You must remember to stay sober.

129
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:42,588
You must record his answers, okay?

130
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:45,446
Understood?

131
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:46,446
Understood.

132
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:48,247
I'll obey your command.

133
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:49,287
You even want to know about

134
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:50,367
his monthly expenditures?

135
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,908
What has this got to do with you?

136
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,788
I'll go and find Mom. I'll get changed first.

137
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,988
I'll help you out later.

138
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:04,047
Mom.

139
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,428
Why isn't Xiang Zhong back yet?

140
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,067
Your father argued with her.

141
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,387
She didn't heed his advice.
She left after that.

142
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:13,727
Why does Dad like

143
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,588
to provoke Xiang Zhong all the time?

144
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:17,668
Say,

145
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,588
is one bottle enough?

146
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,766
Don't talk to me.

147
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:21,867
Let me take a picture first.

148
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,627
Dad, Mom, Qian.

149
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:25,668
Xiang Nan?

150
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:27,947
Xiang Nan,

151
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:30,148
why are you back alone?

152
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,086
Jiang said

153
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,526
he had a sudden meeting to attend.

154
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:35,827
He told me to return first.
He'll come by himself later.

155
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,847
Today's an important gathering,
you know?

156
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:40,087
How could he busy

157
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,067
with something else?

158
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:42,827
He...

159
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,247
He's a business owner.

160
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:45,908
I can understand why he's busy.

161
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:47,748
Can you?

162
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:48,947
I can.

163
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,286
It's fine as long as
you can understand it.

164
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,227
Where's Zhong?

165
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:53,227
You can ask your father.

166
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,908
Dad, where's Zhong?

167
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,847
It doesn't matter if Zhong

168
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:57,748
returns or not.

169
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:59,668
She has a hard time with everyone.

170
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:01,028
She spoils our mood when she's back.

171
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,788
I wouldn't return either

172
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:04,947
if I heard that.

173
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,806
Aren't I just stating facts?

174
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,847
What about this? I'll call her

175
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:08,827
and ask her about it.

176
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:10,487
I just finished calling her.

177
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,567
She didn't answer my call.

178
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:12,508
You should forget it.

179
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,628
Xiang Nan,

180
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:38,686
why don't you call Jiang

181
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:39,646
again?

182
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,087
I already called him. He didn't pick up.

183
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:43,707
I already called him several times.
He didn't even reply to my texts.

184
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:44,628
Look at you.

185
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:48,028
Enough. You should stop forcing her.

186
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,628
What? Did I do the wrong thing?

187
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:53,967
Dad, Mom,

188
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,247
why don't you guys eat first?

189
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:55,886
It's late now.

190
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:56,327
Precisely.

191
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:57,748
Why don't you take a bite first?

192
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,428
How could I be in the mood to eat?

193
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:01,046
I'm just worried
that you might be hungry.

194
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,447
I can hang in there
even when I'm hungry.

195
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,508
All of you are doing it. Why can't I do it?

196
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,587
Did everyone forget about their manners?

197
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:07,806
Miss Xiang.

198
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,567
Mr. Wang?

199
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:09,646
This is Mr. Wang,

200
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,268
Jiang's chauffeur.

201
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:12,406
Have a seat.

202
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,487
- Come inside.
- Have a seat.

203
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,028
Where's Jiang? Is he at the entrance?

204
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:16,908
Mr. Jiang is still in the meeting.

205
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:18,587
It's like this.

206
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:19,766
He's worried

207
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,926
that you guys might wait for him

208
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:22,347
and delay the dinner.

209
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:23,840
That'll affect your parents' health.

210
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,006
Therefore, he had booked
a dinner appointment at a restaurant.

211
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,320
He sent me here to pick you guys up.

212
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:27,926
What?

213
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,107
Does that mean

214
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,947
all of us have to go there instead?

215
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:32,508
Jiang Nan.

216
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:36,247
Why don't you tell Jiang Hongbin
that we can have the meal another time.

217
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:37,967
We can have a meal
with him when he's free.

218
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:38,868
Don't say that.

219
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:41,268
What are you saying?

220
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,367
Xiang Nan, don't do that.

221
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:44,067
Wait.

222
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,046
No matter if he's changing
the venue or the time,

223
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:47,006
don't you think he should

224
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,166
notify me in advance?

225
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,107
How could he do this suddenly?

226
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:51,947
Let me call him.

227
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:57,868
He's not answering my calls again.

228
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,827
He never answered any of them.

229
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:01,628
Mr. Jiang has been
in a meeting all along.

230
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,327
Jiang, you better call me back

231
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:05,748
after hearing this.

232
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,868
How could he act like this?

233
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:11,067
Mr. Wang, tell him this.

234
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:13,668
We can cancel the meal if he's busy.
Just forget about it.

235
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:14,908
Don't do that!

236
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,388
Mr. Wang, don't do that.

237
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,908
Please wait for us outside, okay?

238
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:25,926
I'll wait for you guys outside, then.

239
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,227
Thank you so much.

240
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:31,067
You don't need to wait.
Just cancel the dinner appointment.

241
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,508
Girl, you...

242
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,006
How could you not go there?

243
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,367
You have to look at the bigger picture.

244
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:36,487
It doesn't matter

245
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,087
where your mother and I have to go,
you know?

246
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,886
It doesn't matter
even if we change the venue.

247
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,028
What should we do, then?

248
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:41,886
You can't do this.

249
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,686
What do you mean by it doesn't matter
even if we change the venue?

250
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,200
What bigger picture
are you talking about here?

251
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,908
Mom, tell me.

252
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,707
Isn't he considered a junior?

253
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,087
What does it mean
to pay a visit in person?

254
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,067
That means he has to come here
and visit us in person.

255
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,567
Your mother and I
are much older than you.

256
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:54,788
Are you teaching us what to do now?

257
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:56,646
It's half past seven.

258
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,548
Now, he wants us
to head outside for dinner?

259
00:11:58,807 --> 00:11:59,286
Listen,

260
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:00,707
we have to attend
the dinner appointment.

261
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:03,067
When we're there, I'll tell Jiang this,

262
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:06,548
"You're disrespecting Xiang Nan
with your sudden arrangement, you know?"

263
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,307
This is ridiculous.

264
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,720
Xiang Nan, what do you think?

265
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,227
But Xiang Nan,

266
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:14,587
Xiang Qian,

267
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:16,587
we still need to attend
the dinner appointment,

268
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:17,467
don't you guys agree?

269
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,148
Don't just sit down.

270
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:23,788
Go and get changed. We have to go.

271
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,166
Stop staring at them.

272
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,607
Come on. Let's go and get changed.

273
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:29,827
Wait here. Don't waste any time.
Get ready.

274
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:31,748
My goodness.

275
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:35,367
Wait.

276
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:37,207
What's going on?

277
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,406
I don't know either.
He doesn't do this usually.

278
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,428
He has always been punctual.

279
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:49,908
Over here, please.

280
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:52,748
There's a giant lake beside it?

281
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,347
- This is great.
- There's fish.

282
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:58,187
Have you not seen a fish before?
My goodness.

283
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:00,668
Is that a swan?

284
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,406
What are you doing?

285
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,548
I want to take a picture of it.

286
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:06,508
She wants to take a picture.

287
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:08,447
Don't turn on the flashlight.

288
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:09,748
It'll scare the swan away.

289
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:12,987
You're doing it for real, huh?

290
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,347
Mom, be careful.

291
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:15,686
It's not afraid of humans.

292
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:17,107
It'll hurt when it pecks you.

293
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:18,628
Come on.

294
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:23,947
They even have swans here?

295
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,686
I think this place will look better

296
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:31,827
during the day.

297
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,668
This is a private club.

298
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,646
This restaurant is hard to reserve.

299
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:39,067
You can only get a reservation
if you make one several months in advance.

300
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:40,668
Is that so?

301
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:43,748
Mr. Jiang will be here
right after the meeting.

302
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,788
It's not that easy

303
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,908
to meet Mr. Jiang.

304
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:54,707
Calm down.

305
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:57,268
I'll head outside and ask him about it.

306
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,307
You keep taking pictures.

307
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,868
Xiang Nan is upset, you know?

308
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,327
Look at the time. How can anyone
be happy without having dinner?

309
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:07,926
You should stop
adding fuel to the flame.

310
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:08,788
You...

311
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,788
Hey, Mr. Shen.

312
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:12,428
Miss Xiang?

313
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:13,686
When will Mr. Jiang

314
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,967
be here?

315
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:15,447
He's coming.

316
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:16,347
I'm going to receive him.

317
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:17,268
Okay.

318
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:19,107
What is this?

319
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,748
I heard that Mr. Jiang
had a heated argument

320
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,207
with the other company this afternoon.

321
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,028
He cut his hand as he was too agitated.

322
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,908
I bought some iodine solution
and medicine for him.

323
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:29,127
Was the injury serious?

324
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:29,908
It's not that bad.

325
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:32,680
Alright. What about this?
You can give them to me.

326
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,587
I'll hand them to him later.

327
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:34,447
Alright.

328
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:35,428
Okay. Thank you.

329
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:36,307
I'll be going, then.

330
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:37,187
You may go ahead.

331
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,327
I met his secretary just now.

332
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:52,686
He said he had arrived.

333
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,548
He'll bring him inside soon.

334
00:14:57,848 --> 00:15:00,067
Look at the time. Dad and Mom
haven't had dinner yet, you know?

335
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,388
I'll tell him off later.

336
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:03,587
I'm sure he's too busy.

337
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:05,868
Don't tell him off.

338
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,028
Don't be impatient.

339
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:10,587
He had a meeting to attend, you know?

340
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,707
Guys, Mr. Jiang has arrived.

341
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:16,166
Sorry about this.

342
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,388
I had a sudden meeting just now.

343
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,148
They were dragging it out.

344
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,467
I'm truly sorry about this.

345
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,628
This...

346
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,028
They must be Mr. Xiang
and Mrs. Xiang, right?

347
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:28,347
This is your eldest sister, right?

348
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:29,148
That's right.

349
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:30,347
Nice to meet you.

350
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,247
Please don't stand.

351
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,707
Please have a seat.

352
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,166
Here, Mr. Xiang.

353
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,967
Mr. Jiang, we're not affecting your work
by coming here, right?

354
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:38,567
Not at all.

355
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:39,587
Mrs. Xiang, please.

356
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,187
I'm truly sorry about this.

357
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:42,487
You see,

358
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,247
our meeting venue

359
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:45,207
was a temporary office

360
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,628
located at our site.

361
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,148
The signal over there is terrible.

362
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,428
I was worried that you guys
might be waiting for me for too long.

363
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,967
I even texted Xiang Nan

364
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,187
and said that I would
bring you guys here.

365
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:56,526
But I only found out

366
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:57,827
that the text wasn't delivered

367
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,847
when I checked my phone
after the meeting.

368
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:01,447
You're not a baby, you know?

369
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:02,926
Don't you know how WeChat works?

370
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,046
Don't you know how to confirm

371
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,166
whether or not your texts
were delivered after sending them?

372
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,646
We had to wait for you
for so long, you know?

373
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:08,428
I know that.

374
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:10,307
I'm truly sorry about this.

375
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:14,628
Come in.

376
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,766
I've already made the order.

377
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:18,886
We won't need to order again.

378
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:22,308
Mr. Jiang, the Hengjiang Reeves' shad,
which you had ordered, is ready now.

379
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:24,440
Should we prepare it according
to what you told us in the evening?

380
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,788
Since we have elderly customers,
we can make something blander for them.

381
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:28,120
Steam it using the traditional method.

382
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,748
That'll do.

383
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,827
No ginger in all of the dishes, right?

384
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:32,187
That's right. No ginger.

385
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,548
Alright. Please wait a moment.

386
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:35,748
Hurry up.

387
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:40,207
You have enough time

388
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,046
to make arrangements with the chef,

389
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:44,227
yet you have no time to answer my calls?

390
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:45,926
I told Shen to make

391
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:47,707
the arrangement in advance.

392
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,286
I was in a meeting the entire afternoon.

393
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:50,788
I hardly went out at all.

394
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:53,087
So, you know that I don't like ginger?

395
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:55,607
Mrs. Xiang, I heard from
Xiang Nan that you didn't like ginger.

396
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,686
That's why I instructed the kitchen

397
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:58,827
to omit ginger in their dishes.

398
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:00,166
I appreciate your effort.

399
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,227
You're very thoughtful.

400
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:02,868
It's what I should do.

401
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:05,347
Jiang,

402
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:06,567
although I know

403
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,307
that you're super busy today,

404
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:09,087
you did

405
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:10,767
do the wrong thing today.

406
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:11,767
I think you have

407
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:13,206
to apologize to Dad,

408
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:14,428
Mom,

409
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,668
and Qian.

410
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,807
Didn't Jiang explain himself just now?

411
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:20,486
He had a meeting today.

412
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:21,547
No, Mr. Xiang.

413
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,227
Xiang Nan is right.

414
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:24,047
I was wrong today.

415
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:26,880
It was my fault. I was worried
that you guys might wait for too long.

416
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,667
I didn't know what time
my meeting was going to finish.

417
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,200
It takes me 40 minutes
if I rush to your house.

418
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,646
It'll make me look more disrespectful.

419
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,367
Therefore, I told Xiang Nan
to bring you guys here.

420
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,007
What about this?
Mr. Xiang, Mrs. Xiang, Qian,

421
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,926
let's put aside the rules
this time around, okay?

422
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:39,707
Next time,

423
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,628
I'll make it up to you guys.

424
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:42,747
Okay?

425
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,428
It's fine.

426
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,227
I...

427
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:47,807
I feel like saying something.

428
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:48,406
Please go ahead.

429
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:49,908
Please call me Hongbin.

430
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,108
This is my first time
meeting you, Jiang.

431
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,588
I can tell

432
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:57,108
that you've put in a lot of effort
for the dinner arrangement.

433
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:58,828
You're very thoughtful as well.

434
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,987
However, the way you handled this

435
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:04,987
was kind of inappropriate.

436
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:08,428
Let's forget about the fact
if we should be here

437
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:09,646
or

438
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:11,428
if you should visit us at our house.

439
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:13,027
That's just a trivial detail.

440
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:14,607
I don't mind

441
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:15,747
these rules.

442
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:17,707
What I'm concerned about

443
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,747
is that you should respect

444
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,787
Xiang Nan's opinion,

445
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:23,828
am I right?

446
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:24,707
You're right.

447
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:27,807
I know you're busy with work
and that you can't head home in time.

448
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:28,828
What should you do, then?

449
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,787
Merely texting her on WeChat

450
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:32,707
isn't enough, you know?

451
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:34,388
You should've

452
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,747
at least called Xiang Nan

453
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:39,108
and discuss the situation with her.

454
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:40,747
Mr. Xiang, you're totally right.

455
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,588
Xiang Nan, I've criticized Jiang.

456
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,646
Stop being angry, okay?

457
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:48,547
I'm not angry.

458
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:50,787
Alright.

459
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:51,588
What about this?

460
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:54,646
I'll start by
pouring myself three drinks.

461
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,507
They serve as my apology.

462
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:57,767
Don't do that.

463
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,926
Don't drink like that.
Your stomach is empty.

464
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,787
Just one drink is enough.

465
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,628
Alright, Mrs. Xiang.
I'll heed your advice.

466
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,027
I'm truly sorry about today.

467
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:15,507
Why isn't the cold dish ready yet?

468
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:16,607
What about this?

469
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:18,507
I'll head to the kitchen and urge them.

470
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:19,246
Xiang Nan,

471
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:20,707
you can chat with your parents.

472
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:26,127
Enough already.

473
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:27,567
He said that he was in a meeting.

474
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,227
You should stop being angry at him.

475
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:30,807
Dad.

476
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:32,187
Dad, what's wrong with you?

477
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:33,886
What's wrong with you today?

478
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:35,628
How could you be
so lacking in principles?

479
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:39,267
If he wants to pay a visit in person,
he should visit our house personally.

480
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:39,726
Indeed.

481
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:42,868
It's fine if he's not coming.
But he had to bring us here at this late hour.

482
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:43,847
This is our first meeting.

483
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:46,567
Do you expect me
to express my stand immediately?

484
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:48,527
My tummy was growling just now.

485
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:50,108
He didn't hear it, did he?

486
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,348
I did.

487
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,726
I thought the fish in the pond
was beckoning me.

488
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,507
How dare you laugh?
Mom is starving because of you.

489
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:00,726
Guys, lower your volume.

490
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:02,148
He might hear us.

491
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,428
What's wrong? Are you hungry?

492
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,267
Look at the time.
How could we not be hungry?

493
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:08,886
Dinner will be ready soon.

494
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,227
We'll have a feast later.

495
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:26,668
Mr. Xiang, Mrs. Xiang,

496
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,828
I have something to say.

497
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:35,166
Mr. Xiang, Mrs. Xiang, Qian,

498
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,068
today, I wish to express my stand

499
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,308
in front of you guys.

500
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:42,148
I assume Xiang Nan has
told you guys about my situation.

501
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,446
I'm usually

502
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:44,987
busy with work.

503
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:47,707
It might be difficult for me
to consider Xiang Nan's feelings all the time.

504
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,127
But I'll definitely do my best

505
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,868
to look after Xiang Nan.

506
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,027
And,

507
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:54,726
Mr. Xiang, Mrs. Xiang,

508
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:55,747
if you guys

509
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,148
don't mind,

510
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,588
I would like to look after Xiang Nan
for the rest of my life.

511
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:10,947
Mr. Jiang.

512
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:13,486
Xiang Nan

513
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:15,828
didn't tell us
that she was in a relationship.

514
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,087
The news

515
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:18,547
was pretty sudden for us.

516
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,807
And, this is our first meeting.

517
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:21,828
Let's drop

518
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:24,068
the serious topic, okay?

519
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:30,507
I don't drink. I'll offer you
a toast with water.

520
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,828
Alright, Qian. I'll heed your advice.

521
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:34,588
Here, let's have a toast.

522
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:51,348
Let me see.

523
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:53,588
Does it hurt?

524
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,406
I'm fine. Stop fiddling with it.

525
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:56,868
Let me see.

526
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:58,166
Xiang Nan, I'm fine.

527
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,348
It's much better now.

528
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:01,148
Was it serious?

529
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,507
Did it hurt?

530
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:04,486
I'm fine.

531
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,267
I'm fine now. I'm serious.

532
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:08,987
Alright, let's drop the topic.

533
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:12,108
How could you be so careless?

534
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:17,428
Jiang.

535
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:21,187
That's how my father is.

536
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,367
When he's drunk,

537
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:24,668
he addresses everyone as his buddies.

538
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:27,108
Your father can really
hold his liquor well.

539
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:30,507
Even so, you shouldn't think
that he's easy to get along with.

540
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:32,588
Is he hard to get along with?

541
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,868
After all,
I'm the youngest child in the family.

542
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,947
Everyone in the family dotes on me.

543
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:40,308
They're afraid
that people might mistreat me.

544
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,567
Just like what you did today.

545
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:44,707
I was worried
that you might've messed it up.

546
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:47,547
But you performed
especially well later on.

547
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:51,446
I could feel that my parents
were very happy.

548
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:52,507
They were very satisfied too.

549
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:55,027
You deserve praise for that.

550
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,148
I'm glad that they're happy.

551
00:22:58,528 --> 00:22:59,367
But you must make sure

552
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:01,027
that doesn't happen again.

553
00:23:01,528 --> 00:23:03,308
Alright. I know my fault now.

554
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:04,987
I'll surely change my ways next time.

555
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:07,527
You own up to your mistakes.

556
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:08,828
That's a commendable attitude.

557
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:17,628
Wang,

558
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,308
you can send Xiang Nan to Kunshan first.

559
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,267
What's wrong?

560
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:25,828
I have another important appointment
to attend. I have to be there.

561
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,187
Jiang.

562
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:30,507
Are you cheating on me?

563
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:32,007
Listen up.

564
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,588
If you did cheat on me,

565
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,707
you better give me an account
as soon as possible.

566
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:41,507
If so, you'll be my mistress.

567
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,187
I'm being serious here.

568
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:47,886
If you do cheat on me, my sisters will...

569
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:49,108
What will they do?

570
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:56,068
They...

571
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,227
They'll definitely castrate you.

572
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,847
Isn't your family terrifying?

573
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:04,707
Listen. You've drunk with my father
and had a meal with my family.

574
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,588
It's too late to regret it now.

575
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,227
I have no regrets.

576
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:14,166
If so, promise me this.

577
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,547
Drink less in the future, okay?

578
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:18,588
Don't worry.

579
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:22,227
Let me see your wound.

580
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:26,588
Did you trick me again?

581
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:32,987
You were pretending.

582
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:41,527
Hurry. Go back.

583
00:24:41,528 --> 00:24:42,987
Return to your room.

584
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:45,367
I'm so sleepy.

585
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,828
Discard those old toothbrushes
of you two.

586
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,348
I have new ones for you two.

587
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:51,308
Alright.

588
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:52,348
Is Dad asleep?

589
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:53,947
He was snoring long ago.

590
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:55,926
He drank quite a lot.

591
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:56,868
Why don't we have a chat?

592
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:58,227
Let's have a chat.

593
00:24:58,568 --> 00:24:59,628
You guys don't mean it.

594
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:00,886
- That's not true.
- Yeah.

595
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:02,367
- We want you to listen.
- Join us.

596
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,206
I won't join you guys.

597
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:04,868
- Come on, Mom.
- Come on.

598
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:05,908
You guys don't mean it.

599
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,348
I'm sure she's super curious.

600
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,926
Who wants to chat at this hour?
Return to sleep.

601
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,668
I do have something to tell you.

602
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:15,388
Qian,

603
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,787
what do you think about Jiang Hongbin?

604
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:19,726
Listen.

605
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,406
You see, he's more than just different
from what Dad had imagined.

606
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:25,467
He's different from
what I had imagined as well

607
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,280
even though we shouldn't
let our imagination run wild.

608
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,646
Let's forget about the fact
that he's much older

609
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:30,588
than you.

610
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:31,886
His financial status

611
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,787
is quite different from ours as well.

612
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:35,527
In the six months we've been together,

613
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,607
I've never spent a single cent
of his money.

614
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:39,327
I have my own studio.

615
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,527
I'm financially independent.

616
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:41,686
I can make a living

617
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:42,686
with the studio's income.

618
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:43,908
I don't need to rely on him.

619
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,027
Dad is never a reliable guy.

620
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,747
He gave me a list of tasks
to accomplish.

621
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,507
He actually assigned tasks to you?

622
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:51,686
But when he saw liquor,

623
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:53,388
he forgot about everything else.

624
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,068
It's this. Let's take a look.

625
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,507
It's very interesting.

626
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,267
What is this?

627
00:26:02,008 --> 00:26:05,406
Dad listed out all the questions

628
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:08,108
he hoped he could ask
Jiang Hongbin tonight.

629
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:09,287
Look at this.

630
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:11,767
I'm sure Dad came up with this because
of your second brother-in-law.

631
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:12,567
You mean Question 13?

632
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:13,388
That's right.

633
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,628
Does he smoke, drink,
or play video games?

634
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,680
He definitely doesn't play video games.

635
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,527
But people like him cannot avoid
entertaining their clients, you know?

636
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:24,406
That's understandable.

637
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,206
Does he have a habit of working out?

638
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:27,027
He does.

639
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,187
Timeline for marriage and children?

640
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:31,840
How many children does he intend to have?
Does he care about the gender of child?

641
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,886
I questioned Dad yesterday.

642
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,908
What has his monthly expenditure
got to do with him?

643
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,726
Most of the questions he listed
aren't usable.

644
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:41,187
Luckily, I didn't take this out
during the meal.

645
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,187
It'll be embarrassing.

646
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,787
What's his view on dowries?

647
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:46,787
What's his view on dowries?

648
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,588
I don't think he cares about it.

649
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:52,668
We never talked about it before.

650
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:54,287
Has he ever mentioned anything

651
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:57,348
about a prenuptial agreement before?

652
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:00,127
No.

653
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:00,847
If he did,

654
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:03,707
that means his intention isn't pure.

655
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,747
He'll think
that you're dating him for his money.

656
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:07,800
If he does mention it to you,
you should sign the agreement.

657
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:09,767
Yeah. I don't care about his money.

658
00:27:09,768 --> 00:27:10,467
Yeah.

659
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:12,367
We don't care about his money.

660
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:14,108
If he doesn't mention it to you,
I think...

661
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:19,068
- Will you think that he's a nice person?
- At least he's not a bad egg.

662
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:21,527
Anyway, I think

663
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,868
your dating period is too short
for us to tell.

664
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:28,908
I don't care.

665
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:30,588
Jiang is the best.

666
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:32,206
Xiang Nan, I'm serious.

667
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:33,127
I think you two

668
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:34,588
have spent too little time
with each other.

669
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:35,947
You...

670
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:39,646
You should pull a trick on him
or argue with him someday

671
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:41,187
to test his reaction.

672
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,388
Pull a trick on him?

673
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:44,947
You want me to create trouble?

674
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:47,547
This is what I think Jiang will say,

675
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:49,966
"Enough, Xiang Nan.

676
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,087
I'll heed your will.

677
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,987
Everything you say is right."

678
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:55,367
Does he not have a temper at all?

679
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:56,287
Nope.

680
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,027
He never gets angry.

681
00:27:58,088 --> 00:28:01,467
He might even think that I'm adorable
for pulling a trick on him.

682
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:04,227
He might think that I'm pulling a trick
on him because I care about him.

683
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:07,908
So childish.

684
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:09,327
That's not true.

685
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:11,527
Think about it.
He's always been this nice

686
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:12,966
and gentle to me

687
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:14,428
for the past six months.

688
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:16,588
There's no way he's just pretending.

689
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:18,206
Listen.

690
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,246
You're only six months in.

691
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:22,127
Six months mean nothing. It's easier for him
to pretend if we extend the dating period.

692
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:23,127
Why?

693
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:24,588
It's because you don't
belong to him yet.

694
00:28:24,748 --> 00:28:26,027
It's because he hasn't married you.

695
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:27,367
Are you saying

696
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:28,246
that he'll turn into

697
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:29,908
a different person after marrying me?

698
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:31,908
That's impossible.
That will never happen.

699
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:32,987
I'm going to sleep now.

700
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,507
Sleep on your own bed.

701
00:28:58,088 --> 00:28:59,267
Why aren't you asleep yet?

702
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:01,588
I'll be asleep soon.

703
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:02,908
You should go to sleep first.

704
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,640
(Hair loss could be
a sign of early cancer.)

705
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:22,747
Dad.

706
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,047
Who were you talking to

707
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:26,148
in the courtyard early in the morning?

708
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:29,308
You woke up already, didn't you?

709
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,480
You overheard everything, huh?

710
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,068
Why didn't you come downstairs
after waking up?

711
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,947
Who else could I be talking to?

712
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,588
I was talking to Wang,
Jiang Hongbin's chauffeur.

713
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:40,446
Jiang Hongbin knew

714
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,987
that I was a great cook.

715
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:44,868
I could make dishes like drunken crab,
marinated chicken, and so on.

716
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:46,227
He was craving my cooking.

717
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,467
That's why he sent Wang here

718
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:49,148
to pack my cooking back for him.

719
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:52,227
He's pretty devious, huh?

720
00:29:52,528 --> 00:29:53,047
It's obvious

721
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:55,308
that he was just trying
to make you happy.

722
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:56,747
You see,

723
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,607
if he knew
that this would make me happy,

724
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:01,388
that means

725
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:03,087
he's pretty thoughtful.

726
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:04,987
Are you preparing to say yes to him?

727
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:07,367
You wrote 20 questions for him
on the paper yesterday.

728
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:08,547
You didn't ask him a single one.

729
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,187
There's no need for that.

730
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:12,047
His financial status

731
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:13,428
is there for everyone to see.

732
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,686
His ability is also there
for everyone to see.

733
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:16,947
What should I ask him?

734
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:20,440
It's good as long as he's nice
to Xiang Nan and loves her.

735
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,947
That's more important
than anything else.

736
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:25,908
I've overheard everything.

737
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,646
You mischievous girl. Hurry and come.

738
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:29,767
Come here. Great timing.

739
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:30,446
Did you...

740
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:31,987
Did you badmouth Jiang?

741
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:34,726
He praised him so much that he would get ahead
of himself if you didn't come down soon.

742
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:36,567
Is that so? What did he say about him?

743
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,320
Let me hear about it.

744
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,747
That's all for the compliments today.
I'll praise him again next time.

745
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:41,628
There's a part two now?

746
00:30:41,727 --> 00:30:42,908
Yeah.

747
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:45,767
Mom, come here.

748
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:46,287
Mom.

749
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:47,507
Get me a jacket. It's cold.

750
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:50,108
It's cold.

751
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,068
Xiang Qian,

752
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:58,166
can you tell Gao Ping
to bring the two kids back.

753
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,567
We should hold a gathering

754
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:00,847
and make the family lively.

755
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:01,966
Mom.

756
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,127
Get me a rubber band.

757
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,108
- A rubber band?
- Look at you two.

758
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,446
If so,

759
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,886
why don't I text Zhong

760
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:08,966
and tell her to come back?

761
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:09,828
Alright.

762
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:11,767
Wait. Didn't you guys say

763
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:12,847
that Aunty's hair saloon

764
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:15,027
was going to open soon and that everyone
was supposed to come back?

765
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:17,287
Open?

766
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:19,406
She won't be able
to attend the opening ceremony.

767
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:20,486
Let's take some of this

768
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:21,726
and deliver to her.

769
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:22,486
Great idea.

770
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:23,087
Am I right?

771
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,480
The entire family should be there.
We'll liven up the atmosphere.

772
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,588
- We'll support her.
- Goodness.

773
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:28,206
We'll congratulate her.

774
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:29,726
Eat up. Here.

775
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:30,847
Don't waste any time.

776
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:31,987
Here.

777
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:33,308
What's wrong?

778
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:35,087
I've told you this 100 times.

779
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:35,807
You should cut it

780
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:37,287
with a pair of scissors.

781
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,108
Why are you eating it like this.

782
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:40,166
Look at her.

783
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,908
Look at how hideous that looks.

784
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:42,886
Fine.

785
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,187
- This is huge.
- You...

786
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,567
Here, take it.

787
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:46,966
I don't want that. I'll take this.

788
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,087
Look at you.

789
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,588
Welcome.

790
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:52,926
Congratulations on your opening!

791
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:54,428
Congratulations!

792
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:58,886
So,

793
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:00,327
the first customer

794
00:32:00,328 --> 00:32:03,206
will enjoy a free hair wash, haircut,
and blowing service.

795
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:04,527
Who wants to be my first customer?

796
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:05,686
Your first customer?

797
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:06,707
Come.

798
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:08,446
Where are you going?

799
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:09,267
Wait.

800
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,068
It's free, right?

801
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:12,868
Why don't I give it a try?

802
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:18,828
Forget it. Qi can be my first customer.

803
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:20,628
Qi,

804
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:22,127
I'll give you

805
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:23,707
an afro.

806
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:24,807
Aunty,

807
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:25,406
she's still young.

808
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:26,726
Why would you give her an afro?

809
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,406
You should mess with Gao Ping instead.

810
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:29,588
Why me?

811
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,686
Why did you use that term?

812
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:32,926
You at least have to admit

813
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,446
that I'm competent at this.

814
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:35,847
I'm definitely the best hairstylist

815
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,847
on this street.

816
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:38,686
Okay?

817
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,027
I'm the top hairstylist.

818
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:42,847
Why is it flickering?

819
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:44,187
Is that the design?

820
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,520
(Yingzi)

821
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,908
Xiang Nan, what's wrong?

822
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,807
Maybe the current flow isn't stable.

823
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:51,327
Aunty, I'll go and take a look.

824
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:52,886
The quality is subpar.

825
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,686
Gao Ping, help her out.

826
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:56,007
Come inside.

827
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,406
Come inside.

828
00:32:58,407 --> 00:32:59,246
Let's go inside.

829
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:00,707
Come inside.

830
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:03,027
See if this shop looks nice.

831
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,348
Welcome!

832
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:14,547
Congratulations on your opening!

833
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:23,807
So, my first customer

834
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:26,668
will enjoy a free hair wash, haircut,
and blowing service.

835
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,206
- Who wants to be my first customer?
- Me!

836
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,108
Your first customer?

837
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:33,947
Why don't I give it a try?

838
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:35,686
Forget it.

839
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,908
Qi can be my first customer.

840
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:42,787
Qi, I'll give you an afro, okay?

841
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:44,987
Where's Haiyang?

842
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:47,628
He's busy.

843
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:50,507
Did you two argue again?

844
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,246
Marriage is a total mess.

845
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:57,047
Right or wrong doesn't matter that much.

846
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:58,308
You shouldn't hold it against him.

847
00:33:58,768 --> 00:34:00,707
But I can't just muddle through it.

848
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,007
It'll be fine if you just pretend.

849
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,767
I've pretended to be foolish
all my life.

850
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,747
Even so, I still had fun.

851
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:08,446
You didn't pretend to be foolish.

852
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,947
You are foolish.

853
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:12,767
Mom.

854
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:14,147
What are you guys watching?

855
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:16,107
Cartoon.

856
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,587
Where's Qi?

857
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,047
Weren't you two looking after Qi?

858
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:21,567
Huh?

859
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,868
Aunty said she wanted to play with Qi.

860
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:25,927
Oh no.

861
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:27,527
Qi is one of her targets now.

862
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:28,766
What do you mean?

863
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,366
Your sister has become
one of her targets.

864
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:31,286
I'll go and rescue her.

865
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:32,846
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

866
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:34,326
You'll see when she's back.

867
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:35,527
You'll know by then.

868
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:36,286
Aunty,

869
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,246
who's Shirley Temple?

870
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:39,407
Shirley Temple

871
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:40,748
is a beautiful girl

872
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:42,828
who lived in a foreign country.

873
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:43,947
Thank you.

874
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,927
Is it almost done?

875
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:48,587
Yeah, it'll be done in a second.

876
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,507
It'll be done after I paste this.

877
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:53,868
You're not done yet?

878
00:34:53,888 --> 00:34:55,388
I'll be done soon.

879
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,308
She's very pretty.

880
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,607
Aunty.

881
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:00,127
She's beautiful. And, she can dance.

882
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:01,286
She has to attend school tomorrow.

883
00:35:01,287 --> 00:35:01,766
Mom.

884
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:02,686
Do you know

885
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:03,908
who Shirley Temple is?

886
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,067
Of course your mother knows who she is.

887
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:07,487
If she was still alive,

888
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:08,748
she'd be older

889
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:11,547
than me.

890
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,326
You look great.

891
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:19,348
You look just like me now.

892
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:21,286
Take out your phone

893
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,407
and record some videos.

894
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:23,487
Okay.

895
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,748
It looks nice, right?

896
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:26,967
Listen.

897
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:27,567
I did

898
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:28,607
your mother's perm for her

899
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,527
when she was young.

900
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,388
Where's Qi?

901
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:32,206
Qi?

902
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,908
Take a look at her hair.

903
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,147
She's having a perm.

904
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:39,587
Isn't that good?

905
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:40,686
How is it good?

906
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,547
Good thing she's doing it
with a curling iron.

907
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:43,646
Aunty did it once for me

908
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,147
when I was in junior high.

909
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,587
I was too embarrassed to
raise my head in school for a few days.

910
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:49,640
I'm sure it's not that terrible.

911
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,587
You had a perm when you were young, huh?

912
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:52,947
It was an afro perm.

913
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:56,067
Qian?

914
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:57,246
Qian.

915
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:58,388
Get up!

916
00:35:58,647 --> 00:35:59,366
You should get up.

917
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,686
Don't touch me!

918
00:36:00,687 --> 00:36:01,326
Let me take a look

919
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,748
at what you're doing.

920
00:36:03,568 --> 00:36:04,748
Let me take a look.

921
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:06,348
Qian,

922
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,388
who did this to you?

923
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:10,127
It was Aunty.

924
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:10,806
I already told her

925
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:12,147
not to do this.

926
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:14,067
Take a look at what you look like now.

927
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:17,326
I know now.

928
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:19,107
You don't look like the Lion King.

929
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:21,107
It's a frizzy perm instead.

930
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:22,887
Show me the picture.

931
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:23,947
I don't have one.

932
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,788
I'll turn her into a pretty doll.

933
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:37,188
I'm sorry for what I've done
yesterday afternoon.

934
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,147
My attitude wasn't the best.

935
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:44,047
Recently, my thesis
and the residency process

936
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:45,908
are making me lose my mind.

937
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:54,228
It was heartbreaking to hear you

938
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,348
differentiating between us.

939
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,908
We've been living together
for some time.

940
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:02,067
It's just that our roles
are divided differently.

941
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:04,967
I would like to thank you

942
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:07,067
for your contribution
to the family as well.

943
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:15,467
You're thanking me all of a sudden, huh?

944
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:24,087
Hang in there.

945
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:25,428
It'll be done soon.

946
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:26,987
I'll turn on the switch.

947
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,007
Okay.

948
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,507
Hang in there.

949
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:30,887
You'll turn into

950
00:37:30,888 --> 00:37:33,828
a beautiful girl soon.

951
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,188
Since you're thanking me,

952
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,627
I want to thank you as well.

953
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:40,507
It would've been impossible

954
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:42,348
for me to get my PhD

955
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:43,927
had you not worked hard

956
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,228
to support the family.

957
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:48,107
I would've dropped out of college
and made a living.

958
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,308
There are just a few more months left.
You'll graduate in a few more months.

959
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,166
I want to use up all of
my annual leave anyway.

960
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,987
Let's go on a trip.

961
00:37:57,287 --> 00:37:58,627
Let's take a break,

962
00:37:58,807 --> 00:37:59,908
okay?

963
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:01,428
Let's go.

964
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:09,686
Look! Don't move.
You shouldn't touch it.

965
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,686
Do I look nice?

966
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:11,788
- What do you think?
- So cute

967
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,667
I haven't gotten rusty, have I?

968
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:15,447
Not at all.

969
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:16,806
Not at all, huh? Come.

970
00:38:16,807 --> 00:38:18,166
It's your turn.

971
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,087
That's right. Come here.

972
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,366
Give her a perm.

973
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,908
I'll give her a perm.

974
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,127
Why are you doing this?

975
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:24,860
- We'll make a move first!
- I'll keep the things.

976
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,766
Goodbye.

977
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,667
Aren't you even going
to move the ladder inside?

978
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:31,268
Just run!

979
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:32,467
Aunty will...

980
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:33,646
We're too slow.

981
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,286
We should've captured her
and gave her a perm.

982
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:36,348
Wait, she...

983
00:38:38,008 --> 00:38:40,107
Let me dye your hair for you. Come on.

984
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,487
I already had a perm.

985
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,228
Let's dye your hair.

986
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:53,806
Gao Ping,

987
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:55,708
even he was there.

988
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:57,587
But they didn't invite me.

989
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:58,646
I...

990
00:38:58,647 --> 00:38:59,927
I'm also their son-in-law,

991
00:38:59,928 --> 00:39:00,788
am I right?

992
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:02,166
Do you know

993
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,667
when they'll think of me?

994
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,627
They'll only think of me
when they crave crabs.

995
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,188
What do they take me for?

996
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:16,587
A seafood vendor?

997
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:21,388
Brother,

998
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:24,788
do you lack communication
with your wife?

999
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:28,027
Especially the deeper kind
of communication?

1000
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:29,507
No need for that.

1001
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:30,828
There's no room for communication now.

1002
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:33,388
We're separated now.

1003
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:36,467
If you two are separated today,

1004
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,748
you two will go on
your separate ways in the future.

1005
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:40,107
Do you believe it?

1006
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,147
Brother, listen.

1007
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,547
No matter how you guys
are living separately now,

1008
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:48,868
as long as the main gate isn't locked,

1009
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,527
that means she's playing hard to get.

1010
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:52,748
Your solution

1011
00:39:54,088 --> 00:39:55,428
is to confront her directly

1012
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:57,308
and take her down with one blow.

1013
00:39:59,008 --> 00:39:59,846
One blow?

1014
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:00,947
One blow.

1015
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:03,828
One blow? That'll work.

1016
00:40:03,928 --> 00:40:05,587
That'll work just fine.

1017
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:06,748
One blow, huh?

1018
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:09,188
Alright.

1019
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:49,868
Zhong.

1020
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:51,908
Zhong, listen to me.

1021
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:53,908
What are you doing? Let me go.

1022
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:55,868
Let me go. What are you doing?

1023
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:57,646
Deng Haiyang, you stink!

1024
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:58,206
Wait, Zhong.

1025
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,047
You stink!

1026
00:40:59,048 --> 00:40:59,527
I...

1027
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:00,246
Scram!

1028
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,067
Go away!

1029
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:02,846
Scram!

1030
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:04,547
You didn't lock the gate.

1031
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:05,868
Scram!

1032
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:39,806
Mr. Jiang,

1033
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:41,007
when the engineering team

1034
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:42,607
went to help Miss Xiang's second aunt

1035
00:41:42,608 --> 00:41:43,908
with the hair saloon's renovation,

1036
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:46,428
she gave everyone a perm.

1037
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:51,947
Does her second aunt
only know how to dye hair?

1038
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:55,067
She doesn't even discuss it with you.
She dyes your hair directly.

1039
00:41:57,008 --> 00:41:59,646
I think Miss Xiang's family members

1040
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,027
are quite peculiar.

1041
00:42:02,247 --> 00:42:06,080
I heard that this second aunt of hers
was trying to ascend to the heavens.

1042
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,908
The entire neighborhood
has already heard about it.

1043
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,868
And, the second daughter of the family

1044
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:11,166
does live streams all the time.

1045
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,400
She always wears a goddess's outfit.

1046
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,280
She could actually fly
when it was windy, you know?

1047
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:20,027
And,

1048
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:21,507
the old madam,

1049
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:23,587
she worked as a pimp.

1050
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:25,228
I know that.

1051
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:26,467
That's just a misunderstanding.

1052
00:42:27,448 --> 00:42:28,587
And, Wang,

1053
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:29,908
do not simply spread these rumors

1054
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,127
in the future.

1055
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:32,067
They sound terrible.

1056
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,627
Understood?

1057
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,428
Shen,

1058
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:55,228
arrange a body checkup for me.

1059
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:58,748
It's best if it includes

1060
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:00,908
processes related
to genetic inheritance.
