32
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,480
that I killed you.

33
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,480
I also tell myself

34
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,960
that I killed you.

35
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,440
But now,

36
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,960
someone is saying that I didn't.

37
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
Brother.

38
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960

(Prince Guang's Residence)

Princess Ninghe is coming back.

42
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
Really?

43
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,360
Definitely.

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
Could this really

45
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,200
be Ninghe's doing?

(Zhenwu Region Governor, Sun Lie)
from the rebels in Lucong.

You're quite ready to act bravely
for a just cause.

56
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
It's the Zhenwu Army's
moral obligation

57
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,400
to bring Princess Ninghe
back to Heng'an.

58
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,880
Did Ninghe ask

59
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,000
to return here herself?

60
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
It was Princess Misha's decision.

61
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,040
Lucong is in major chaos now.

62
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,320
As a princess,

63
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,720
Princess Ninghe shouldn't be
wandering out there.

64
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
She should return to her family
in Heng'an instead.

65
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,880
They're already on the way.

66
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,160
They should be here in half a month.

67
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
What's the matter?

68
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,680
You don't think it's appropriate,
Duke Chu?

69
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
No.

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,240
Not only should she return,

71
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,240
she must return

72
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,000
in a grand manner.

73
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,880
Everyone in the imperial court

74
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,680
must welcome her outside
the palace gate.

75
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,600
Your Majesty.

76
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,640
Am I right?

77
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,520
Yes.

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
Issue the decree then.

79
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,640
Everyone.

80
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Go outside the palace gate

81
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,960
to welcome Aunt Ninghe.

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,600
That includes me.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,320
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

84
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
This won't do, Your Majesty.

85
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,960
Since you already know

86
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,160
that Princess Ninghe is the third party,

87
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,760
why are you letting her return?

88
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
I'm not the one
who's letting her come back.

89
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,880
It is Qiu Ziliang.

90
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Qiu Ziliang

91
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,520
also suspects Princess Ninghe.

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,440
Am I right?

93
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,120
What we can find out,

94
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
Qiu Yanzhi can also find out.

95
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,520
Then Qiu Ziliang

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
surely doesn't have any good intentions.

97
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,880
What are you looking for?

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,799
I'm checking

99
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,320
about the feud between Qiu Ziliang

100
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,760
and Princess Ninghe.

101
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
There won't be any records
in the Resume.

102
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,400
Instead of looking for it there,

103
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,960
why don't you ask me directly?

104
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
Your Majesty, you know?

105
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,160
Even if I was still
very young back then,

106
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
I remember things.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
Back then, the provincial
military commissioner

108
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,480
originally wanted to marry my Ninth Aunt.

109
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
But Qiu Ziliang suggested
to the late emperor

110
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
that Aunt Ninghe is the most
suitable candidate.

111
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
In the end,

112
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,880
Aunt Ninghe was the one
who married to a far place

113
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,360
and completed this political marriage.

114
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,560
Why?

115
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,840
I don't know

116
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,720
why the two of them

117
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,800
had a feud.

118
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,720
But Aunt Ninghe

119
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
said something before she left.

120
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,240
What was it?

121
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,680
Your Majesty.

122
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,880
Your Majesty!

123
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,720
(Princess Ninghe)
Isn't there anything you want to say to me?

124
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,120
Qiu Ziliang.

125
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't be too pleased.

126
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,920
In life,

127
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
there's karma.

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Someday,

129
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,520
I'll pay you back

130
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,880
for what you did to me!

131
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,000
I will return.

132
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll surely return!

133
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,800
I know that you'll return.

134
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,800
I'll welcome you back.

135
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,240
What's the matter?

136
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,960
How will you return?

137
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,400
You'll return when you're dead?

138
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,840
There's no doubt that Princess Ninghe

139
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,520
is the third party.

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,760
First,

141
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
she told the assassin
to try to kill you,

142
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,920
then framed the Chess of Generals Camp
for it.

143
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,680
However, you didn't fall for the trick.

144
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,320
That was why she used

145
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
her second trick,

146
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Wu.

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
She's a princess.

148
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
She grew up beside Empress Dowager,

149
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,080
so she has old servants in her palace.

150
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
That was why

151
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,440
she was able to let Wu
enter the palace smoothly.

152
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
The she instigated Wu

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,720
to assassinate Qiu Ziliang
in the banquet.

154
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
However, you didn't fall
for her trick again.

155
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,160
In the end, she can only
tell the assassin

156
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,080
to try to kill you in the Wine Shop,

157
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,800
and let Chess of Generals Camp
discover Yuzhen Hall.

158
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,800
This way, you and Qiu Ziliang

159
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
will surely be at odds.

160
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
However...

161
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,120
She should have waited longer.

162
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,880
She could have returned

163
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
until after a winner is determined

164
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,160
between me and Qiu Ziliang,

165
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
or after we bring destruction
upon each other.

166
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,240
Right.

167
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,400
Coming back now

168
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,600
is not a wise decision.

169
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
It's obvious that Qiu Ziliang

170
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,480
will deal with her.

171
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,520
There are only two possibilities.

172
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,440
First.

173
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,040
There's no turning back for her anymore.

174
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,280
She doesn't know where to go,

175
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,960
so she can only return to Heng'an.

176
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,160
Because of the major chaos in Lucong?

177
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,200
That's the biggest possibility.

178
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,280
What's the second possibility then?

179
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
The second possibility

180
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
is that Aunt Ninghe
isn't the third party.

181
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
Just like Wu,

182
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,080
perhaps she was also forced to take part

183
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,560
in this matter

184
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,480
as a bait.

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,120
Ninghe will arrive in Heng'an
after ten days.

186
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,640
His Majesty and other officials

187
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,960
will personally welcome her
outside the palace gate.

188
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,040
Go and make arrangements.

189
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
Father, I think you said

190
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,080
that you wouldn't allow her to return.

191
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,760
If she dares to come back,

192
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll dare to kill her.

193
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,040
While I'm at it,

194
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,640
I'll scare the imperial court
officials a bit.

195
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
I understand.

196
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,280
Yanzhi.

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,200
Do it nicely.

198
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,280
Yes.

199
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,200
Yan Xiu.

200
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,920
What is His Majesty busy with
in the past few days?

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Sir.

202
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
After bringing Little Fish back
to the palace,

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
he never went out again.

204
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,040
During his free time,

205
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,040
he's been practicing the bow
and arrow with Little Fish.

206
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,080
Little Fish?

207
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,680
Little...

208
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,520
Cheng Ruoyu.

209
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
It seems like

210
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,480
His Majesty really wants to train her.

211
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,480
Is Prince An back?

212
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,400
We already picked him up
from his mother's maternal family.

213
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,520
They said

214
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,400
that as long as you

215
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,920
are willing to let Prince An become
the heir apparent,

216
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,200
they're willing to obey you.

217
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,560
Bring him over.

218
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,720
Yes.

219
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,280
Father.

220
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,760
Qi Yan values Cheng Ruoyu.

221
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,680
Will she become an obstacle for us?

222
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,800
Cheng Ruoyu is all brawn and no brain.

223
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,680
She's nothing to worry about.

224
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,800
It's just that Qi Yan...

225
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,600
I was wrong about him back then.

226
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,680
Qi Yan is very ambitious.

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
It's unavoidable

228
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,600
to be careless, Father.

229
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,320
Zhi'er.

230
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,400
Have you witnessed

231
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,320
His Majesty's martial arts skill?

232
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,880
Not yet.

233
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,960
Back then,

234
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,040
when he acknowledged me
as his godfather,

235
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,080
he said that he admired
my martial arts skills.

236
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,520
The late emperor happened
to be disobedient,

237
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,560
so

238
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,840
I took him as my godson

239
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,120
and personally taught him martial arts.

240
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,400
You taught His Majesty martial arts?

241
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,880
I only taught him for three months.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,840
I didn't expect him to be so gifted.

243
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,320
After three months,

244
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,080
it was like he trained for three years.

245
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,760
Later on, I stopped teaching him

246
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,880
and commanded people
to bring him hunting and having fun.

247
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,920
You only taught him for three months?

248
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,520
You got both of them.

249
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Your Majesty, nice shot.

250
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
That's right.

251
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,360
After one year,

252
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,360
his bow and arrow skill
surpassed everyone's.

253
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,760
After three years,

254
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,680
no one could defeat him
in the Shencai Army.

255
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,160
I don't want his martial arts skills
to be good.

256
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,080
That was why I told him to concoct pills
and enjoy himself.

257
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,040
That was when Cheng Xi

258
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,440
went to him.

259
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,240
Cheng Xi is great with the technique
of concocting pills?

260
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,840
That was how Cheng Xi and Cheng Huaizhi
became powerful.

261
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,920
It was all because of me.

262
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,040
Come to think of it,

263
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,640
after doing one step wrong,

264
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,520
everything afterwards was wrong.

265
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
How are you planning

266
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
to deal with Qi Yan then?

267
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,680
Prince An has arrived!

268
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,920
Greetings, Duke Chu.

269
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,599
Prince An!

270
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,520
Prince An.

271
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,840
This cricket has a nice color.

272
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
You're knowledgeable about crickets,
Duke Chu?

273
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,920
Not only do I know it,

274
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,120
I know how to raise it.

275
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,680
The trick

276
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,440
is "fighting".

277
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,160
Your Majesty.

278
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
They already went down the mountain

279
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,040
to find

280
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,160
the preys you shot earlier.

281
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,360
I have an idea.

282
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,720
What is it?

283
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,920
Your Majesty, please tell me.

284
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,120
It's about how to let the 300 people

285
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400
from Yuzhen Hall

286
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,760
return honorably.

287
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,360
Let these 300 people

288
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,120
return to the city with Princess Ninghe.

289
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,080
One is influenced by close association.

290
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,520
After closely associating with me,

291
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
you've improved a lot indeed.

292
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
However,

293
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,840
we already know that Qiu Ziliang

294
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,520
will surely deal with Princess Ninghe.

295
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,640
If these 300 people

296
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,560
return to the city this way,

297
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,960
won't they walk right into a trap?

298
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,560
That will depend on you.

299
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,160
Yes.

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,400
What's the matter with you?

341
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Yu'er.

342
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,120
I heard about you

343
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
and His Majesty already.

344
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,960
Don't be shy.

345
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,840
His Majesty dressed your wound before...

346
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,400
Don't be ridiculous.

347
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,840
That's not true.

348
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,840
You're blushing.

349
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,720
Look.

350
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,480
My good niece.

351
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,960
When all is said and done,

352
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,360
remember what I'll tell you.

353
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,480
When the time comes,

354
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,120
serve His Majesty well.

355
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,040
Then...

356
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,600
By the way,

357
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,200
this is the point.

358
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,480
You can't

359
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
just let His Majesty
do whatever he wants.

360
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,880
When His Majesty

361
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,840
sleeps with a maid,

362
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
it will be recorded in the journal.

363
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,520
If you get pregnant...

364
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Stop it.

365
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,440
You...

366
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
We can record it after the fact.

367
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,120
We can record it after the fact.

368
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,480
I heard that when His Majesty
went hunting yesterday,

369
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,760
she was the one who served him.

370
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,120
I heard that His Majesty
really likes her.

371
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,560
I wonder how she got so lucky.

372
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,880
I heard

373
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,200
that she might become a concubine.

374
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
Seriously?

375
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
In the future,

376
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,720
she'll have a high status.

377
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,600
Right.

378
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,600
Come and massage my legs.

379
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,760
Did you hear that?

380
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,400
Come here.

381
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,520
Massage my legs.

382
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,680
Don't you understand what I said?

383
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,280
Massage my legs.

384
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
My legs hurt.

385
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,280
All right.

386
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
Why are you so stupid?

387
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,400
I want you to do something.

388
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,480
Tell me.

389
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
What's written inside the bamboo tube?

390
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,600
Yan Xiu.

391
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,600
Bring soldiers to the Violet Bureau
to arrest people.

392
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,160
On what grounds?

393
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,760
Tell them that the Violet Bureau

394
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,760
is involved in the unlawful
weapons possession case

395
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,520
of Yuzhen Hall.

396
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
You don't have any proof.

397
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
We can lock them in prison first

398
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,400
and investigate slowly.

399
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,760
We won't release them

400
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
until we find something.

401
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,960
You...

402
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,120
What do you think?

403
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,680
Do you want to tell me now?

404
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,960
You can torture me.

405
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,360
There's no need.

406
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,600
Your aunt Cheng Xi

407
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,080
and the entire Violet Bureau

408
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,880
would be imprisoned and tortured
on your behalf.

409
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,920
You don't need

410
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,480
to threaten me with their lives.

411
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,960
At most, I can kill myself

412
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,280
to be with them.

413
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,080
Your Majesty.

414
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,040
Let's pretend to secretly transfer

415
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,080
Princess Ninghe

416
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,280
and test Qiu Yanzhi's reaction.

417
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,960
Let's see what they'll do.

418
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,040
Right.

419
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,880
Then...

420
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,440
Then how can I

421
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,200
confess in a natural manner

422
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,560
and not let them find out?

423
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,720
Don't confess.

424
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,840
What do you mean?

425
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,240
I don't understand.

426
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,800
Based on your personality,

427
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,520
you definitely

428
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,080
won't confess.

429
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,560
That's why

430
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,280
just insist on not confessing.

431
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,600
Then how can we let the fake news

432
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,520
spread out?

433
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
Someone will confess on your behalf.

434
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,200
Who?

435
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,200
Today, His Majesty

436
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
wrote many notes.

437
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
He gave one of them to Cheng Ruoyu,

438
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,680
then

439
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
burned the rest in the fire.

440
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,920
After he left,

441
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,600
Gao Ping took this from the fire.

442
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,290
(Qiu... danger...
change route to Luo...)

443
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,520
"Qiu..."

444
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,760
"Danger..."

445
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,560
"Change route to Luo..."

446
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,200
Luo...

447
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,520
Luoyang.

448
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,240
Getting this news from Gao Ping

449
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,640
is more believable than getting it
from you.

450
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,160
Then what should I do?

451
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,800
Just be yourself.

452
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,120
Then

453
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,880
wait for me

454
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,320
to save you.

455
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,200
Yes.

456
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,320
His Majesty is quite smart.

457
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,600
He knows that Father won't let Ninghe

458
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,560
enter Heng'an alive.

459
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,440
That's why he told her to hide

460
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
in Luoyang first.

461
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,400
Duke Chu really wants

462
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,280
to kill Princess Ninghe?

463
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,160
Of course.

464
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,400
He even wants the officials to see

465
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
how he does

466
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,560
what he says.

467
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,280
As for you,

468
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,680
you're so bold.

469
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,000
You know that Father wants Ninghe dead.

470
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,880
I can't believe you even want
to take her from him.

471
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,280
The nation will be watching

472
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,480
when Princess Ninghe
returns to Heng'an.

473
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,360
Besides,

474
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,320
she just wants to come home.

475
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,920
Why can't he let her fulfill her wish?

476
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
Come home?

477
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Fulfill her wish?

478
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,400
Does Qi Yan think

479
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,640
that his position is too stable?

480
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Does he know

481
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,160
that Father already commanded people

482
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,800
to bring Prince An back to Heng'an?

483
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,160
Prince An is back?

484
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,880
Yes.

485
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,320
And this time,

486
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,480
you can't save him anymore.

487
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,920
Prince An is staying
in Father's residence,

488
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,480
and he's personally watching him.

489
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,120
What does that mean?

490
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,360
Cheng Ruoyu.

491
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,360
You really don't get it?

492
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,000
Tell Qi Yan

493
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,120
to stop disobeying Father.

494
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,920
Don't interfere
in Ninghe's affairs anymore.

495
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,000
You're telling me these things

496
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,280
to help me.

497
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,040
And what's your reason

498
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,720
for helping me?

499
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,280
How do you want to use me again?

500
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,000
Sir.

501
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,280
His Majesty is awake.

502
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,880
He's looking for her.

503
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,000
Qi Yan valuing you

504
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
is a good thing.

505
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
Then as the Sword Bearer,

506
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,840
you must also help him clearly see

507
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,920
the situation now.

508
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,360
What is the situation now?

509
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,520
His wings aren't strong enough.

510
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,560
Don't be in a hurry to fly.

511
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,280
The one who escaped death the most

512
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,880
in the entire Changming Palace

513
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,680
is you.

514
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,600
Go back to His Majesty.

515
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,640
Be good.

516
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,200
Don't keep making
Chess Overseer furious.

517
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,960
I heard

518
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
that Qi Yan's attitude
towards her changed.

519
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,160
From hate, it turned to love.

520
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,320
And he's intending
to make her a concubine.

521
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
When a man and a woman

522
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,760
go through death together,

523
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,560
it's unavoidable for them
to develop feelings.

524
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,680
Aren't we

525
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,720
a man and woman

526
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
who went through death together too?

527
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,080
Send someone to guard

528
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,480
the main and side roads toward Luoyang.

529
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,720
Also, send 20 more soldiers

530
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,520
to Jinyang.

531
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,640
You must pick up Princess Ninghe.

532
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,840
If not,

533
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,720
all of you don't need to come back.

534
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,360
- Yes!
- Yes!

535
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,200
Your Majesty.

536
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,400
It's time for your medicine.

537
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,200
Your Majesty.

538
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,120
All right.

539
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,800
Let Yu'er serve me.

540
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,880
You may all go.

541
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,080
Yes.

542
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
What did you do so late at night?

543
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,480
Your Majesty was looking for you.

544
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,840
You may all go.

545
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

546
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,680
Your Majesty.

547
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,200
Cheng Ruoyu.

548
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
Put the curtains down.

549
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,040
Yes.

550
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,760
I bid my leave.

551
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,080
Come.

552
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,800
Sleep with me for a while.

553
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Sleep?

554
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,240
Record that.

555
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,200
His Majesty woke up
in the middle of the night.

556
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,920
It was hard for him to sleep,

557
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,080
so he summoned Cheng Ruoyu to the palace
to serve him.

558
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,880
Take off your shoes.

559
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,000
Why are you so stupid?

560
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,000
Tell me.

561
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,440
About what?

562
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,800
Cheng Ruoyu.

563
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,520
Do you really think

564
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,719
that I

565
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,040
want you to sleep here?

566
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,040
Sowing discord among the enemies.

567
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,159
Get it?

568
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,440
Right.

569
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,159
After Yanzhi saw

570
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,080
the paper fragment

571
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,440
from Eunuch Gao,

572
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,679
she believed it indeed.

573
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
And she was very angry.

574
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,760
Angry?

575
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,040
She got

576
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,719
such an important news.

577
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,719
And she can

578
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,040
claim credit in front of Qiu Ziliang.

579
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,000
Why was she angry?

580
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,360
"Hmm"?

581
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,840
This is urgent.

582
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,440
Why are you spacing out?

583
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,040
Yanzhi is really strange.

584
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,880
It seems like

585
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,040
she really doesn't want anything
to happen to you.

586
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,680
Your Majesty.

587
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,920
Official Qiu is worried
about your leg injury.

588
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,640
He especially asked me
to bring some medicines.

589
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,640
Eunuch Gao.

590
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,840
His Majesty is already resting.

591
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,520
Get out!

592
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,040
I deserve to die.

593
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,960
Record that.

594
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,800
His Majesty asked Eunuch Gao
to get out.

595
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,000
Write.

596
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,280
Do it well.

597
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,800
Your hand.

598
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,120
So

599
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,760
Qiu Ziliang

600
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,480
will make a move when Aunt Ninghe
enters the city?

601
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,120
He wants everyone

602
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,080
to see how Princess Ninghe
comes home dead.

603
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,080
We must think of another way.

604
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,600
Go to Mount Qi.

605
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,640
Check

606
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,320
the martial arts skills
of those warriors of sacrifice

607
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,840
and whether they're reliable.

608
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
This is very important.

609
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,840
Nothing can go wrong.

610
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,640
Your Majesty.

611
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
I want to tell you something.

612
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,400
Go ahead.

613
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,640
If that third party

614
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,080
is really Princess Ninghe,

615
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
she has unfathomable motives.

616
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,600
Your Majesty, will you still save her?

617
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,800
When you say things in secret,

618
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,200
can you lower your voice?

619
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,440
Will you still save her?

620
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,840
Lust makes one dumb indeed.

621
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
What?

622
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,040
Nothing.

623
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
Will you still save her?

624
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,120
Yes.

625
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,360
Even if it angers Qiu Ziliang,

626
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,960
and the throne
will be passed to Prince An?

627
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,880
It's not hard to replace me.

628
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,200
But if they want to appoint Prince An
as the next emperor,

629
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,680
the regional governors

630
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,040
won't be that nice.

631
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,000
Your Majesty.

632
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,640
What do you mean?

633
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,120
I've already written 12 imperial edicts

634
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,640
and asked Han Ding to give them
to the 12 provincial military commissioners.

635
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,200
If I die,

636
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,400
they'll support

637
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,760
a new imperial son to ascend
to the throne.

638
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,880
Won't that make the nation
more chaotic then?

639
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,240
That's why

640
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,800
Qiu Ziliang

641
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,040
doesn't dare to make a move now.

642
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,840
The so-called military authority
he has now

643
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
can just be used

644
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,760
for show in Heng'an.

645
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,360
Out of the city,

646
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,720
it's just like a piece of paper.

647
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
I get it now.

648
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,800
A eunuch's power stems
from the emperor's power.

649
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,480
If the emperor's power collapses,

650
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,160
the eunuch's power is also gone.

651
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,480
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

652
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,160
Did I say something wrong?

653
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,200
Many years ago,

654
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,920
my teacher

655
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,520
also said the same thing.

656
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,800
Your teacher?

657
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,880
Who was your teacher?

658
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,920
My teacher was a flawless person.

659
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,880
Write down,

660
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,120
"Cheng Ruoyu sleeps with His Majesty.

661
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,320
She's beautiful and smart.

662
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,960
His Majesty is consoled."

663
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,840
No.

664
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,120
"His Majesty is greatly consoled."

665
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,760
Which other nice adjectives
can you think of?

666
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,880
Write them.

667
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,720
I'll be nice to you.

668
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,760
Go back and sleep.

669
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,560
Go.

670
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,240
I'm going to sleep.

671
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,120
Hurry.

672
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,200
Hurry up, Cheng Ruoyu!

673
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,240
Cheng Ruoyu.

674
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,680
Let me tell you.

675
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,960
Don't think

676
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,640
that since you have my favor,

677
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,600
you can forget who you are!

678
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,840
If you dare to speak on behalf
of Zheng Wu again,

679
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,520
you'll see what happens!

680
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,120
Go and reflect on your mistake!

681
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,000
Huaizhi!

682
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,760
Watch your niece.

683
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,520
Without my permission,

684
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,400
don't let her out!

685
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,480
Yes.

686
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,720
Yes.

687
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,640
Eunuch Cheng.

688
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,320
Eunuch Cheng.

689
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,440
Should I write down that part?

690
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,800
Do you know how to spell
the word "scram"?

691
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,240
I know my mistake.

692
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Scram!

693
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,000
What happened on earth?

694
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,240
Madam.

695
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,920
Yu'er went out of the palace.

696
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,600
She went out of the palace at this hour?

697
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,560
That's why Eunuch Cheng

698
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,280
asked us to find

699
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
someone who has the similar figure as Yu'er

700
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,280
and bring her to him.

701
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,520
Go.

702
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,160
I don't feel at ease
to send someone else.

703
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,040
And you have great martial arts skills.

704
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,520
You can handle it if anything happens.

705
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,840
Yes.

706
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,840
Yu'er must have gone to Mount Qi.

707
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,400
Based on her personality,

708
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,160
I don't know what will happen

709
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,480
if those warriors of sacrifice
are under her management.

710
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,880
Chess Ancestor Shennong?

711
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,720
It's unsure

712
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,680
whether Shennong created

713
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,280
the Chinese Chess or not.

714
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,000
You think you can win in chess
by just worshipping a portrait?

715
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,400
Dream on.

716
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,120
This isn't right.

717
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,800
Someone touched my painting.

718
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
There's poison on the painting.

719
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,040
I know who it is.

720
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,640
Who?

721
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,920
Aside from Left Knight,

722
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,040
nobody is bold enough

723
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,360
to sneak into my room.

724
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
He still won't give up?

725
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,040
He's not a rash person.

726
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,400
He must have discovered something.

727
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,920
- Capture him.
- Yes.
