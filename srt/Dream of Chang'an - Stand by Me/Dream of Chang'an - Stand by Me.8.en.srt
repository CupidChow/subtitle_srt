(I knew it wasn't easy to be
the Sword Bearer.)

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,320
(Indeed.)

17
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,760
(Am I crazy?)

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,840
(I'm finally free,)

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560

(the real reason for your death.)

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,120
Congratulations.

28
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,680
You've been reinstated.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,040
Why are you looking at me that way?

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,840
Weren't you able

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
to return because of me?

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
You also got what you want,

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,600
didn't you?

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,560
What do I want?

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
You know

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
that Yuzhen Hall is Aunt's turf.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,400
Yet you used me

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,440
to expose it to His Majesty.

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,160
Am I right?

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,240
I was helping His Majesty.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
His Majesty valued Cheng Xi so much.

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
Yet behind his back,

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
Cheng Xi hid 300 people.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
She's malevolent.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
That's why

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
you want to use His Majesty

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
to kill my Aunt.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
No.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
I did it

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
to promote you.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,840
I don't like Cheng Xi,

52
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,160
but I like you.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Yuzhen Hall

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,320
is my promotion gift to you.

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,320
It's only because

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
those in the Yuzhen Hall
escaped so quickly.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,520
You didn't have an opportunity
to capture them.

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,960
That was why you gave up on it.

59
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,840
I can't help it if you think that way.

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
But someday,

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,840
you'll understand my intentions.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,480
What is your intention?

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,560
Your intention

64
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,240
is to let His Majesty be isolated
and helpless

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,680
and continue being restrained

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
by your father.

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,600
You're wrong.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,600
At this point,

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,600
it's not only about the fight
between Violet Bureau

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,280
and Chess of Generals Camp.

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,040
A third party

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,320
wants to see us bring destruction
upon each other.

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm way more interested in him

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
than the Violet Bureau.

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,160
Don't you want to know

76
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,960
who he is?

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
You and I should collaborate.

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,720
I'll protect Father.

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
You'll protect His Majesty.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,760
Since our paths are different,

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
we can't work together.

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,040
Don't refuse me so quickly.

83
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,440
Someday,

84
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,920
you'll need me.

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,000
You're welcome to come to me any time.

86
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Wake up.

87
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,880
Wake up.

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,760
Who are you?

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
Where am I?

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,680
Where are you taking me?

91
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
We're on the way to Fengyang.

92
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,520
Zheng Tian

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,280
will take you to find

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,360
your father's former subordinates.

95
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Were you the one who saved me?

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,240
Why did you save me?

97
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
The ribs and spine

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,760
protect the heart from behind.

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,640
In this area,

100
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
if the arrow speed is fast enough,

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,080
and the force is just right,

102
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,440
the arrow can get stuck
between the bones,

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
and there's still a chance to be saved.

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,360
That was what your father told me.

105
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,320
Father, Mother,

106
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,800
and everyone in my family are all dead.

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,880
I want to take revenge.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just continue living

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,720
with that belief.

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,400
As long as you're alive,

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,840
you stand a chance.

112
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
(The ribs and spine)

113
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,320
(protect the heart from behind.)

114
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
(In this area,)

115
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,640
(if the arrow speed is fast enough,)

116
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,760
(and the force is just right,)

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,080
(the arrow can get stuck
between the bones,)

118
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
(and there's still a chance
to be saved.)

119
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,240
(Teacher.)

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
(I can't shoot it accurately.)

121
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
(It's too difficult.)

122
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,800
(It can't hide)

123
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
(from Qiu Ziliang's eyes.)

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,200
(I'm sorry. I can't do it.)

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
(I can't do it.)

126
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,280
Back then, I used that trick

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,480
to kill three people.

128
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
This is how you ended up.

129
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,560
What about the other two?

130
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,600
If they're still alive,

131
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,040
come to seek revenge from me.

132
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,200
Your Majesty.

133
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,760
Did I wake you?

134
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
Your left arm just recovered.

135
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,240
Rest a bit more.

136
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
Today is the 5th.

137
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,040
I should have gone hunting.

138
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,880
I've really delayed
an important matter then.

139
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
You don't need to be on duty today.

140
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,880
Go and rest.

141
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,480
Your Majesty.

142
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,200
Do you want to go out
of the palace tonight?

143
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,360
Like that.

144
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,960
What exactly are you trying to say?

145
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,000
Your Majesty.

146
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,000
I didn't know before

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
that you were the masked man.

148
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
The Zheng Residence,

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
Chess of Generals Camp,

150
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,200
and Yuzhen Hall.

151
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,240
Leave those things to me in the future.

152
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,880
You'll do those things with your amateur
martial arts skills?

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
You can teach me.

154
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,520
Your Majesty.

155
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,400
Do you also want...

156
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,280
Do you also want to retaliate

157
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,360
against the Chess of Generals Camp?

158
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
What do you have in mind?

159
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Before,

160
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,440
when we went to
the Chess of Generals Camp,

161
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
we triggered the mechanism.

162
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,280
Qiu Yanzhi went to save us,

163
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,360
and I was very grateful.

164
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,480
Back then,

165
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
I thought that she was a good person,

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,640
and she's different from Qiu Ziliang.

167
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
But I didn't expect

168
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,880
that in the end, she told me

169
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,920
someone from Yuzhen Hall
killed Mrs. Cai.

170
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,400
I went to investigate
without thinking much.

171
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,280
However,

172
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,720
I fell for her trick.

173
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,520
This time,

174
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,280
you've thought things through.

175
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Qiu Yanzhi said

176
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,600
that it's not a fight

177
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,840
between the Chess of Generals Camp
and Violet Bureau anymore.

178
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,160
A third party

179
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,320
is adding fuel to the flames

180
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
and wants to see us bring destruction
upon each other.

181
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
Qiu Yanzhi even said

182
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,880
that she wants to collaborate with me

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,920
to catch that person.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,320
I rejected her back then.

185
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,080
But thinking back now,

186
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,080
why did I reject her?

187
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,400
I should have agreed

188
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,400
and go with her plan

189
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,680
to find the roots
of Chess of Generals Camp.

190
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,480
It's impolite not to reciprocate.

191
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,880
Someone like you

192
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,840
wants to sow discord among the enemy?

193
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,880
Your Majesty.

194
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,000
I was the first place

195
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
during the Violet Bureau's exam.

196
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,520
Go on.

197
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,320
Your Majesty, do you know

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
why those in the Yuzhen Hall

199
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,000
can only escape when something happened?

200
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Because they're in the dark.

201
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,720
They can't be out in the open.

202
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,280
Otherwise, they will die.

203
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,560
And the Chess of Generals Camp
is also in the dark.

204
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,920
Yet why didn't it die out in the light?

205
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,960
Your Majesty.

206
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,360
We're different now.

207
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,960
Before, we were small in number
and meager in strength.

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,960
But now,

209
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,560
we have 300 warriors of sacrifice.

210
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,200
Why should we still suffer a beating?

211
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,360
Am I right?

212
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,960
Cheng Ruoyu.

213
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,400
Your Majesty.

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,480
Please give your command.

215
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
Go home and rest.

216
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,880
Don't overthink.

217
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,920
But I'm not sleepy yet.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
I think Your Majesty
isn't sleepy either.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
And I'm not finished yet.

220
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,320
I have some plans.

221
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,120
Your Majesty, it's true.

222
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,680
I have some plans.

223
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,240
Go and sleep.

224
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,720
I haven't told you about them yet. I...

Chess Overseer.

You came so late.

265
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,280
Please come inside.

266

There's no need.

267
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,320
I just have a few questions.

268
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,800
I'll leave after I'm done.

269
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,680
Why did you give Right Knight the rosa rubus?

270
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
It wasn't for him.

271
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,120
It was for you.

272
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,920
Do you like my gift to you?

273
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,120
Gift?

274
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,640
It's a gift if it makes people happy.

275
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,520
It's not a gift if it makes
people panic.

276
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,080
I believe that you

277
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,720
can surely use it well

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,080
and turn panic into happiness.

279
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,760
I won't appreciate it.

280
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
You can appreciate it when you need it.

281
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,520
I won't do as you wish.

282
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,320
What is my wish?

283
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,160
You want to use me

284
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
to kill Right Knight.

285
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm not the one who wants

286
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,000
to kill Right Knight.

287
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,800
It's you.

288
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,080
A plant

289
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,280
bought you off.

290
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,320
Right Knight.

291
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,440
How do you explain that?

292
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,760
Do you know your mistake?

293
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,040
I didn't betray you.

294
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,600
Father.

295
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,200
Those poisoned by the rosa rubus

296
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,080
aren't aware of it.

297
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,840
Right Knight...

298
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,040
There's no doubt about Right Knight's loyalty.

299
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,480
Prince Guang's just had unfathomable
ulterior motives.

300
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,560
It's Prince Guang's fault.

301
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,800
Don't blame yourself, Father.

302
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,000
Prince Guang?

303
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,240
I'll go and kill him.

304
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
I can't believe that he used a plant

305
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,800
to trick you for so many years.

306
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
He even destroyed
the top martial arts expert

307
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,120
of the Chess of Generals Camp.

308
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,600
You're very powerful
in the imperial court.

309
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,840
Even if people with ill intentions

310
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,120
want to use the posthumous edict
to create trouble,

311
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
we can just directly suppress them.

312
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,600
We don't need to worry about it.

313
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
Suppress them?

314
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,720
How?

315
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,320
Shencai Army's 120,000 troops.

316
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,720
They are a bunch of useless people.

317
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,400
They can only fight head-on
with the soldiers

318
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
of regional governors

319
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,360
and lose to them.

320
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,320
Then the Chess of Generals Camp's
500 warriors of sacrifice...

321
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,520
This is

322
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,040
a critical moment in my fight

323
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,200
for power with Qi Yan.

324
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,440
Don't do anything to Prince Guang first.

325
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
If you do,

326
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
it will only let Qi Yan

327
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
be reckless and uncontrollable.

328
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,640
The timing is not right yet.

329
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,400
Yes.

330
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,280
I was too rash.

331
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,960
Your Highness.

332
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Smash them all.

333
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,160
There are more over there.

334
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,240
- They'll only feel at ease this way.
- Yes.

335
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,680
- Smash them all up.
- Yes.

336
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,480
And now,

337
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
what I need most

338
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,920
is for them to feel at ease.

339

then gave them as assistance

403
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
have you visited her already?

404
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,840
Grand Empress Dowager
wasn't feeling well.

405
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,240
She couldn't meet with me.

Even if we can't make it extravagant,

409
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,960
we must still hold

410
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,720
a banquet here.

411
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,520
Only family will be invited

412
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400

Yes.

421
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,480
It would be great if Princess Ninghe

422
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,560
can return.

423
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,360
I heard that Lucong's military
commissioner has already passed away.

424
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,280
I've already asked someone to go
and pay respects.

425
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,360
I wonder

426
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,880
if they've met

427
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,960
Aunt Ninghe.

428
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,520
What if we take this opportunity

429
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,520
to pick her up and reunite with her?

430
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,080
It's too much trouble.

431
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,680
Besides,

432
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,080
Duke Chu

433
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,080
won't let her come back.

434
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,640
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

435
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,480
Is the one you're talking about

436
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,520
the princess who married

437
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,240
to Lucong?

438
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,240
I heard that when she got married,

439
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,560
she took many musical scores with her.

440
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,960
Even the Violet Bureau
doesn't have them.

441
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,880
Your Majesty.

442
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,960
Can you write a letter to her

443
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,480
to ask for a hand-written copy?

444
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,520
Huaizhi.

445
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Yes.

446
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,680
Didn't you teach your niece

447
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,800
some manners?

448
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,000
Your Majesty is right.

449
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,360
What did I do?

450
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,800
What's the matter with you?

451
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
His Majesty

452
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,160
and His Highness
are having a discussion.

453
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,840
Why are you butting in?

454
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,200
No, Uncle.

455
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,240
There are really many musical scores

456
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,920
that we can't find anymore.

457
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,000
It would be great

458
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,640
if we can find them again.

459
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Why are you worried about that?

460
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,200
Why are you worried about that?

461
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,240
Just wait here.

462
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,840
Every day,

463
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,560
I feel so worried.

464
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,560
Do you feel happy?

465
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,520
I have a headache.

466
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,800
Be happier.

467
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,400
It's rare for the Changming Palace

468
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,320
to have someone lively.

469
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,640
That's why my head aches more now.

470
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,240
I don't know

471
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,200
what she's thinking all day long.

472
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,040
Uncle.

473

475
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,120

I, Left Advisor Yan Xiu,

481
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,880
want to consult with you on something.

482
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,160
Go away.

483
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,240
I'm busy.

484
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,240
This is the exciting part.

485
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,600

(Library)

487
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,840
You answer the Chess Overseer
if she asks you.

488
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,040
You want me to get out
when I do the asking.

489

Left Minister.

490
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,120
The difference in your treatment

491
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,000
is too obvious.

492
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,520
We can't find the people
from Yuzhen Hall.

493
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
We can't find out the poison

494
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,040
on the assassin's needle either.

495
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,640
Which poison is it exactly?

496
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680

What do you think?

504
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,720
Can you tell?

505
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,280

00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,880
It seems like the gloves are a bit old.

510
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,280
I must sew them again.

511
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,560
I...

512
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,320
Can you take care of official business?

513
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,600
Which poison is on the needle?

514
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,440
I can't tell looking at it this way.

515
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,280
What should we do then?

516
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,280
This is what we'll do.

517
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,960
Get me ten people.

518
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,040
Five men and five women

519
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,280
age 10, 20, 30,

520
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,720
50, and 70.

521
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
I'll try the poison on different ages

522
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,680
and genders.

523
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,640
We'll know the answer in a few days.

524
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,600
You're scarier than you were

525
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,680
a few months ago indeed.

526
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,320
By the way,

527
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,000
where did you go
during this period of time?

528
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
I failed in getting
the Chess Overseer position,

529
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,320
so I traveled around to feel better.

530
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,480
Do you feel better now?

531
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
Exactly the opposite,

532
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
especially when I found out

533
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,080
that Right Knight died

534
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,240
in Qiu Yanzhi's hands.

535
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,040
I felt much worse.

536
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,600
So go

537
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,760
and inform Qiu Yanzhi

538
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,960
that I'm back.

539
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,480
After being the Chess Overseer
for so long,

540
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,040
she didn't achieve anything.

541
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,640
It's time

542
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,840
to replace her.

543
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,700
(Violet Bureau)

544
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,360
You may go.

545
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,760
Yes.

546
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,080
What did you find?

547
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,320
Yuzhen Hall originally has 509 people.

548
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,360
Now, they have 277 people.

549
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,600
In the past eight years,

550
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,440
they never executed

551
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,320
any real missions.

552
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
Those people are gone

553
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,480
due to internal conflict.

554
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,520
Do you know

555
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,080
how many people are there
in the Chess of Generals Camp?

556
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,560
I don't.

557
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,880
Based on incomplete statistics,

558
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
20,000 people were listed.

559
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,440
Now,

560
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,120
less than 3,000 are left.

561
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Do you still think

562
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,240
that it's cruel in Yuzhen Hall?

563
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,080
Even so,

564
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,640
Yuzhen Hall's training method

565
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,800
might not necessarily be right.

566
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,080
I want to go to Mount Qi

567
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,080
and get them back to the Violet Bureau
as soon as possible.

568
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,720
Qiu Yanzhi is also

569
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,000
investigating Yuzhen Hall now.

570
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,400
It's not very safe

571
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,160
for you to go alone.

572
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,000
Wait a bit more.

573
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,880
That makes sense.

574
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,960
I was too impatient.

575
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,240
Your Majesty.

576
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,000
Your Majesty.

577
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,000
Have some tea.

578
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,760
Have another one.

579
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,480
Here's more.

580
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,160
There's no need.

581
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,560
I can't drink it anymore.

582
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,240
You drink it.

583
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,880
Drink.

584
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,920
I'm full from drinking.

585
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,600
Go on reading.

586
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,960
Go on.

587
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,600
What's this?

588
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,760
- This is...
- The internal organ of a blowfish.

589
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,719
The blowfish

590
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,760
has a white stomach

591
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,719
with yellow patterns
on its greenish black back.

592
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
After you eat it, you'll vomit,

593
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,920
your limbs will feel cold,

594
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,199
and your heart will stop.

595
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,400
What if you inject it
into the blood directly?

596
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,560
The effect is the same.

597
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,800
What else do you know?

598
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,880
The late emperor committed suicide
by taking this poison.

599
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,720
Left Knight!

600
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,800
Why did he leave?

601
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,000
I know what he was going to say.

602
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,880
He had nothing to say.
Of course he left.

603
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,040
No wonder he lost to you.

604
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,000
Even if you don't have
martial arts skills,

605
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,360
you're almost

606
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,280
as smart

607
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,600
as the widely knowledgeable
Left Minister.

608
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,440
Why did the assassin choose

609
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,280
a needle with blowfish poison?

610
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,680
Was it unintentional

611
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,000
or intentional?

612
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,920
You're suspecting

613
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,240
that the third party has something to do
with the late emperor's death?

614
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
Unless he wants to announce it,

615
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,600
I can't think of another reason

616
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,440
why he went through

617
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,760
such trouble.

618
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,960
You must know

619
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,480
that it's hard to catch a blowfish.

620
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,320
It only comes by with luck.

621
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,720
That means

622
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,920
the third party

623
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,840
may very likely have come

624
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,320
to take revenge for the late emperor.

625
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,700
(Prince Guang's Residence)

626
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,960
If Your Highness didn't alert them,

627
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,760
Madam Jade and the others surely
won't be able to escape.

628
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,160
Rise.

629
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Learn your lesson.

630
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
You can plan things slowly next time.

631
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,640
If the late emperor is looking down
from above,

632
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,800
he won't blame you.

633
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,560
I'm useless.

634
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,680
I failed the late emperor.

635
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,720
Back then, the late emperor

636
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,280
was choosing someone to rebuild
the Violet Bureau.

637
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,320
I recommended you.

638
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,200
I've also disappointed you.

639
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,320
What happened with Yuzhen Hall

640
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,440
was because you didn't
think things through indeed.

641
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,040
Why didn't you inform

642
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,240
His Majesty earlier?

643
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,040
My wrong decision

644
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,240
was used by Qiu Yanzhi.

645
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,840
Not only did I lose Yuzhen Hall,

646
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,520
I lost His Majesty's trust.

647
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,160
It's not only Qiu Yanzhi.

648
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
There's a third party.

649
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,960
A third party?

650
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,520
Your Majesty.

651
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,680
Cheng Ruoyu.

652
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,240
Come out.

653
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,400
Your Majesty.

654
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,440
You're just in time.

655
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,960
You should meet each other.

656
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,800
I'm Han Ding,

657
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,440
Left Commander of the Qianniu Guards.

658
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
You're one of the Qianniu Guards?

659
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,720
Why does it seem like
I haven't seen you before?

660
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
I haven't seen you before too.

661
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,160
I'm the Violet Bureau's
new Sword Bearer,

662
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,120
Cheng Ruoyu.

663
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,040
All right.

664
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,120
Since you already know each other,

665
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,840
it's time to talk
about official business.

666
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,360
Han Ding.

667
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,280
What is the progress

668
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,480
on what I asked you to investigate?

669
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,280
I found out already.

670
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,200
Please take a look.

671
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,650
(Secret)

672
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,920
Handmaiden Hong?

673
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,280
The third party who instigated Zheng Wu
to assassinate Qiu Ziliang

674
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,440
and caused

675
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,200
what happened afterwards...

676
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,920
Who is it?

677
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,720
Yuan Du.

678
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,640
Yes, Your Highness.

679
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,240
Inform Madam Cheng

680
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,080
what you've found.

681
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,000
Zheng Wu

682
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,680
didn't interact much with people outside

683
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,200
of Violet Bureau.

684
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,040
She only

685
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,840
had some contact

686
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,160
with the old gatekeeper
of Hanliang Hall, Handmaiden Hong,

687
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,440
from time to time.

688
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,280
Handmaiden Hong's eldest sister

689
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
was Zheng Wu's wet nurse.

690
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,680
Three days after Zheng Wu died,

691
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Handmaiden Hong accidentally fell

692
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,560
into the Taiye Pond and drowned.

693
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,250
(Secret)

694
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,080
She accidentally fell?

695
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,240
Handmaiden Hong

696
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,000
was originally Princess Ninghe's maid.

697
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,960
After Princess Ninghe left,

698
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,640
she gradually lost her power

699
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
and became a gatekeeper.

700
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,480
In the past year,

701
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
she only received one letter

702
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
from outside the palace.

703
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,640
The letter came...

704
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,640
Where did the letter come from?

705
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,600
Lucong.

706
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,360
Lucong?

707
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,480
Princess Ninghe sent it to her?

708
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,120
The letter is already destroyed.

709
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,280
We don't know what it said.

710
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,240
Handmaiden Hong's roommate said

711
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,200
that she was very happy
after receiving the letter.

712
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
She said that she was going
to make a comeback.

713
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,400
She can only do that

714
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,880
if Princess Ninghe returns.

715
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,640
But it's impossible

716
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,920
for Princess Ninghe to return.

717
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,240
Why?

718
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,320
On the 8th year of Tai'an,

719
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,240
after Lucong's military commissioner
Yang Zhicheng

720
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,280
was driven out by soldiers,

721
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,880
Shi Quanzhong became
the new military commissioner,

722
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,120
and also became the new husband

723
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
of Princess Ninghe.

724
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,720
Not long after that,

725
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,200
Handmaiden Hong received the letter.

726
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
And last month,

727
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
Chen Yintai colluded with a part
of the Zhenwu Army

728
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,240
and killed Shi Quanzhong.

729
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,320
Now, Lucong is in a lot of chaos.

730
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,160
In that case,

731
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,320
as a princess of Xing,

732
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
for the sake of morality and justice,

733
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,720
His Majesty will surely bring her back.

734
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,920
But Qiu Ziliang has a feud with her.

735
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,960
He won't let her return.

736
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,640
Why does she have

737
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,280
a feud with Qiu Ziliang?

738
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,080
It's good if we can find out.

739
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,800
That's why in order for Princess Ninghe

740
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,920
to return,

741
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,880
she sews discord

742
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,560
between His Majesty and Qiu Ziliang.

743
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,080
She wants to use His Majesty

744
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,800
to kill Qiu Ziliang.

745
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,480
That was why I personally

746
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,520
went to Lucong.

747
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,160
What did you find out then?

748
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,400
Lucong is in a lot of chaos now.

749
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,320
I don't know where Princess Ninghe went.

750
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,800
Continue finding her.

751
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,200
Yes.

752
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,920
I'll go and investigate now.

753
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,160
Your Majesty.

754
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,320
I'll go as well.

755
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,880
Cheng Ruoyu, why are you going there?

756
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,800
Your Majesty.

757
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,960
Thank you.

758
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,600
It turns out that you've already
sent someone

759
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,160
to investigate Wu's case
a long time ago.

760
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,000
Your Majesty, do you also think

761
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
that the third party hiding in the dark

762
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,600
is Princess Ninghe?

763
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,800
When I was very young,

764
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,760
I didn't see her much.

765
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,120
I don't have much impression

766
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,080
of her.

767
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,720
But she has a feud with Qiu Ziliang.

768
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,840
And she was close with the late emperor.

769
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,760
It's not impossible for her

770
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,920
to instigate it.

771
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,960
Why do you keep staring at me?

772
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,840
Your Majesty.

773
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,200
Rumor has it

774
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,080
that you killed the late emperor

775
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,120
and usurped the throne
from Prince Guang.

776
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,840
Is that true?

777
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,960
This is just your speculation.

778
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,200
Ninghe is pure.

779
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,720
She's not that kind of person.

780
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,800
It's been 15 years since she married
to Lucong.

781
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,640
Fifteen years

782
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,400
are enough time to change someone.

783
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,400
No.

784
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,240
I don't believe

785
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,920
that Ninghe did all of this.

786
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,360
Madam Cheng.

787
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,480
I told you these things

788
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,840
hoping

789
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,000
that you can investigate this with us.

790
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,480
Yes.

791
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
In order to prove my innocence,

792
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,560
I'll surely investigate this matter.

793
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,440
However,

794
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,760
if the mastermind

795
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,000
is really Princess Ninghe,

796
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,520
what are you planning to do?

797
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,600
Stop her from continuing her wrongdoing.

798
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,440
But perhaps she's helping you.

799
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,600
She hates Qiu Ziliang.

800
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
She also hates His Majesty.

801
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,680
Yet she has always loved you.

802
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,040
If His Majesty and Qiu Ziliang

803
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,800
bring destruction upon each other,

804
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,720
the one who will benefit in the end

805
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,560
is you, Your Highness.

806
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,160
If that's true,

807
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,120
what will you do?

808
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,160
The Violet Bureau's first rule

809
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,840
is to be loyal to Your Majesty.

810
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,160
In terms of how you

811
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,080
ascended to the throne

812
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,040
is not part

813
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,160
of my consideration.

814
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,880
Is that so?

815
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,080
But I don't think

816
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,840
that you are that kind of person.

817
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,680
Back then,

818
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,960
you intentionally released Wu.

819
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,680
Even if I repeatedly ruined your plan,

820
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,280
you were always lenient.

821
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,360
And you even got injured because of me.

822
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,200
How can that kind of person

823
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,120
be someone

824
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,440
who killed his brother
and usurped the throne?

825
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,040
The rumors

826
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,240
are fake.

827
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,850
(Secret)

828
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,440
In that case,

829
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,920
we must stop her all the more.

830
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,880
A throne that causes chaos
to the imperial court

831
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,560
and results from killing my nephew

832
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,320
is not something I want.
