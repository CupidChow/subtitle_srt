Chess Overseer.

20
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,800
- Your Majesty.
- Let's go.

21
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,680
Let's return to the palace.

22
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,600
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

23
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,720
Where is Left Advisor?

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,360
I haven't seen him, sir.

25
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,880
What's the matter?

26
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
Didn't you inform her?

27
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,280
Sir.

28
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,360
We've already informed her

29
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,000
from outside.

30
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
But no one answered.

31
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,560
Sir!

32
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Sir.

33
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,920
Left Minister.

34
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,960
Why are you here?

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,400
Right Minister told us to let you check

36
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,920
if the new Cannons are fine.

37
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,480
That's fine.

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,160
Let's see Yanzhi together.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
Let her check too.

40
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,360
What's that smell?

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
It smells of wine.

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,360
Why does it reek of wine?

43
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,760
Sir!

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,200
Sir!

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
Sir!

46
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,760
I was wrong.

47
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,240
Sir.

48
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,280
I got drunk.

49
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,200
Left Advisor.

50
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,960
Sir.

51
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,040
Hey,

52
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
what are you doing

53
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
on Yanzhi's bed?

54
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,040
Sir.

55
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,800
I deserve to die.

56
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,520
I deserve to die.

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,280
I deserve to die.

58
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I was wrong.

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
Sir, I deserve to die.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where's Yanzhi?

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,960
Yanzhi...

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,200
Yanzhi...

63
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, right. Sir,

64
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,360
where's Yanzhi?

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,680
Father.

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,560
You're looking for me?

67
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,880
Where did you go?

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
Xiu got drunk

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,920
and occupied my bed.

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,440
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry,

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,880
but I felt annoyed,

72
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,240
so I went to the library,

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,040
wanting to discuss a book
with Left Minister.

74
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,440
I didn't expect

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,040
that Left Minister would be here.

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,200
Why are you looking for me

77
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,200
so urgently?

78
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,880
I suspect

79
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,640
that Li Deyun is ready
to create trouble.

80
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,960
These are the new Cannons

81
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,880
that Right Minister chose.

82
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,120
Tell them to watch Li Deyun closely,

83
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,480
and don't let him get an opportunity
to return to the capital.

84
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,920
Yes.

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,880
Also,

86
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
continue searching for Prince An.

87
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,840
Either see him alive

88
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,200
(Pawn eighteen)
or see his corpse.

89
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm not going.

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't want to go to a far place

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
like Zhenwu.

92
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,000
With Your Highness staying in Heng'an,

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
it's very difficult for His Majesty.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,720
He's thinking of ways to protect you.

95
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,240
You must also consider his sake.

96
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,800
You won't be there forever.

97
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,160
We'll bring you back in a few years.

98
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,840
I'm not going.

99
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,000
Yu'er.

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
What did you do?

101
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,640
Aunt.

102
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,400
We don't have time

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
to explain things to him anymore.

104
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,480
You're going to Zhenwu this time.

105
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,440
The journey is far and dangerous.

106
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
You must be careful.

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,120
You too.

108
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,360
You must take care of yourself.

109
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
Don't worry.

110
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,040
Aunt.

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,400
You must be careful.

112
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,040
You too.

113
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,480
(Right Advisor)

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,680
(Right Advisor.)

115
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,320
I returned late.

116
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
I've made you worry.

117
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,520
Every time you go out,
you return injured.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Forget it.

119
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,040
Zening waited for you all day.

120
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,000
It's all in the past now.

121
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
It is in the past.

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,200
But how can you not think about it?

123
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
If Li Deyun hadn't been demoted
back then,

124
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,240
you two would be married by now.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,360
It's impossible between me
and Li Zening anymore.

126
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,840
Grandmother,

127
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
please don't worry about this anymore.

128
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,760
What about Cheng Ruoyu?

129
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Your Majesty.

130
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,120
You should have children now.

131
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,960
If you like Cheng Ruoyu,

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,920
make her your concubine first.

133
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,840
Let her give birth to Xing's descendant.

134
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,800
That's what you should do.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,600
Huaizhi.

136
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,679
Yes.

137
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you want to become
an imperial relative?

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
I don't dare to.

139
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,920
I deserve to die.

140
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,800
Huaizhi.

141
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,840
Yes.

142
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,960
I

143
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
like Yu'er indeed.

144
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,680
But it's only between an emperor
and an official.

145
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,760
It's the kind of joy

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
between a swordsman with a famous sword

147
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,360
and a painter with nice scenery.

148
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,880
It has nothing to do with the relationship
between a man and a woman.

149
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,800
So

150
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,200
it's impossible for Yu'er
to be a concubine

151
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,080
and even more impossible for her
to give me children.

152
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Remember that.

153
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
I will.

154
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,040
What do you want to tell me?

155
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,080
Me?

156
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,920
I...

157
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,040
Your Majesty.

158
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,160
Right Advisor found out

159
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,160
Prince An's whereabouts.

160
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,480
I'll return to Violet Bureau now

161
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,040
to arrange for reinforcement.

162
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,640
Wait.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Bring people to go with Cheng Xi

164
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,200
to bring Qi Rong

165
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,000
to Zhenwu,

166
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,960
then come back.

167
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
Zhenwu is too far. I...

168
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,440
This is an imperial command.

169
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,400
Yes.

170
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Why is my face so hot?

171
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,920
I...

172
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,280
He said that it's joy, not love.

173
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Cheng Ruoyu, what are you thinking?

174
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,520
However,

175
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,240
why does he want me to go to Zhenwu?

176
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,520
He wants to transfer me out?

177
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,800
Why?

178
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,320
Why are you crying?

179
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,960
Your Majesty.

180
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,160
I know.

181
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm grateful.

182
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,640
You're intentionally
transferring Yu'er out.

183
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,800
Your Majesty.

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,000
Han Yue is already dead.

185
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,440
Qiu Ziliang has the power again.

186
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,560
Next,

187
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,200
he'll be dealing with me.

188
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,880
Even if Prince An is already away,

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,520
there are still many royal sons
in the capital.

190
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
At this dangerous time,

191
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,320
I'll be facing a great crisis.

192
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,520
If Yu'er is around,

193
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
she'll only get dragged down.

194
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,000
Your Majesty.

195
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Do you have a fool-proof plan?

196
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,920
Yes.

197
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
But the chance of succeeding

198
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,120
is only ten percent.

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,160
Ten percent?

200
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,760
Ten percent.

201
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,200
Let's do our best,

202
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,240
and let the heaven do the rest.

203
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,920
I don't believe

204
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,400
that the heaven wants
the Xing empire to perish.

205
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,650
(Duke Chu's Residence)

206
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,240
Sir.

207
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,440
What's the matter?

208
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you find Prince An?

209
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,600
Cheng Xi secretly brought Prince An
out of the capital

210
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,880
and went to Zhenwu.

211
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
It's Zhenwu again.

212
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
What about Liu Misha?

213
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,000
I especially went to prison to check.

214
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,040
They switched the person inside.

215
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,280
It seems like

216
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Liu Misha is already back to Zhenwu.

217
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,800
I'm sure Cheng Xi brought
Prince An there

218
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,120
to seek protection.

219
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
Send soldiers at once.

220
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,760
Regardless if dead or alive,

221
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,120
bring Prince An

222
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,440
and Liu Misha back.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,600
Yes.

224
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,800
Qi Yan.

225
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
You think that without Prince An,

226
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,920
I wouldn't dare to do anything
to you anymore?

227
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,800
(Chess Ancestor Shennong)

228
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,560
Bad news.

229
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,040
Right Advisor followed Cheng Ruoyu

230
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,080
and discovered Prince An's whereabouts.

231
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,480
He even found out that Qi Yan

232
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
secretly released Princess Misha.

233
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,720
Eunuch was so furious

234
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,160
that he brought blowfish soup
to the palace.

235
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,160
He wants to kill Qi Yan.

236
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,000
Huaizhi.

237
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,760
Yes.

238
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,280
Is Han Ding back?

239
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Not yet.

240
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,440
I'm afraid

241
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,560
that it's really too late.

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
Did you see clearly?

243
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,240
Is it really that bowl?

244
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,440
It's the one Eunuch Qiu

245
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
brought the late emperor last year.

246
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
- Grand Empress Dowager.
- Grand Empress Dowager.

247
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
- Grand Empress Dowager!
- Grand Empress Dowager!

248
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,440
Get the imperial physician.

249
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,040
Yes.

250
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
Grand Empress Dowager.

251
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,680
Based on the sign,

252
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,440
after going southwest outside the city,

253
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,160
we'll get there in about four hours.

254
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,040
They're Prince Guang's people.

255
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,200
Yu'er.

256
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,840
Why are you here at this time?

257
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
We're going out of the city.

258
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,800
You're going out of the city?

259
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Something bad is going to happen
to His Majesty,

260
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,760
and you're leaving the city?

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,600
Something bad?

262
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,360
What is it?

263
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm going

264
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,240
to report to His Highness
Prince Guang now.

265
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Qiu Ziliang brought fish soup

266
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
and went to His Majesty's study room.

267
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,640
Fish soup?

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Poisonous fish soup?

269
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,360
Back then, after the late emperor

270
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,720
drank the fish soup Eunuch Qiu brought,

271
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,920
he passed away in less than one hour.

272
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,560
Continue chasing after them.

273
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,200
I'll go back to the palace.

274
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,760
Yu'er.

275
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,880
Let's go.

276
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,440
Your Majesty!

277
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Qiu Ziliang is coming.

278
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,640
Your Majesty.

279
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
Qiu Ziliang is coming.

280
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
Run, Your Majesty.

281
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,680
Run, Your Majesty.

282
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Your Majesty.

283
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,200
The late emperor is different from you.

284
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,840
He didn't have martial arts skill,

285
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,520
and he was kept on house arrest
for many years.

286
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,120
He had no desire to live already.

287
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,400
That was why when Qiu Ziliang

288
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,520
brought the blowfish,

289
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,560
he drank it.

290
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,560
Your Majesty.

291
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
If you want to leave,

292
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
who can stop you? Your Majesty.

293
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,800
I can't leave.

294
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,000
This is my palace.

295
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,240
Only here

296
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,720
am I the emperor.

297
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,320
If I escape,

298
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,400
how am I different
from ordinary citizens?

299
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
I won't escape.

300
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,480
Open the door.

301
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,480
I'll wait for Qiu Ziliang.

302
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,560
Your Majesty.

303
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,520
Yes.

304
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,880
Wait!

305
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,920
Yu'er.

306
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,920
I happen to be a bit thirsty.

307
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,520
Give me this soup.

308
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
You were yelling in the hall.

309
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,760
Where are your manners?

310
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,000
It's time to find someone to teach

311
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,280
the Sword Bearer some manners.

312
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,760
Bring the fish soup.

313
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,600
Your Majesty.

314
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,560
I know that there's more.

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,720
Bring it.

316
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,960
Don't drink it.

317
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,040
You left your post

318
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,040
and disobeyed the imperial command.

319
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
I can't keep

320
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
a Sword Bearer like you.

321
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,320
You can't drink it.

322
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,280
Your Majesty.

323
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,280
Huaizhi.

324
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,840
Yes.

325
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,360
Take your niece and leave.

326
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,560
Yes.

327
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,560
Your Majesty.

328
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
- I'm not leaving.
- You're injured.

329
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,720
Be good.

330
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,760
No one can leave.

331
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
Your Majesty.

332
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
How touching.

333
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm so moved.

334
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,880
This scenario is so familiar.

335
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,480
It made me remember
Gongsun Jing back then.

336
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,880
I didn't expect that you
and the late emperor

337
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
are such lucky people.

338
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
You have

339
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,760
such a loyal Sword Bearer beside you.

340
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,920
It makes one envious.

341
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Your Majesty.

342
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,520
Your Majesty, you can't drink it.

343
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,240
Your Majesty!

344
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,360
You can't drink it.

345
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,280
You can't drink it.

346
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,080
Reporting!

347
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,720
Bad news, Eunuch Qiu.

348
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,800
This is a very urgent report.

349
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,960
Read it.

350
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,760
The Lucong Army is in chaos.

351
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,360
Chen Yintai is using the mutiny

352
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,040
to collude with people everywhere

353
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,080
to become self-reliant.

354
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,520
Military commissioners all over

355
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,640
are requesting His Majesty

356
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,480
to write an imperial command

357
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,640
to quell the rebellion.

358
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,150
(Report)

359
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,550
(Two hundred and three thousand
elite soldiers are moving westward)

360
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,720
It seems like I don't need

361
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,320
to drink this fish soup so urgently.

362
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,040
Don't think that I won't dare to do it.

363
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,800
Protect His Majesty!

364
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

365
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,240
Qianniu Guards and I came late
in protecting you.

366
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,240
Please forgive me.

367
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,200
Qi Yan.

368
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,120
You're great.

369
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,360
Thank you for your compliment,
Godfather.

370
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
In the imperial court meeting tomorrow,

371
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,640
while discussing how to quell
the rebellion,

372
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
I will need your assistance.

373
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,280
Of course.

374
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,000
(Report)

375
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,240
Thank you for your hard work.

376
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

377
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,680
At this point,

378
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,720
there's no use in being anxious.

379
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,240
Let's think about

380
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,600
what to do next first.

381
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,920
This isn't right.

382
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,480
What do you mean?

383
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,600
Since the Sunny Rain Pavilion yesterday,

384
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
nothing is right.

385
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,880
Right Minister knows our every move

386
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,680
so well.

387
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
It's impossible for him not to guard
against Right Advisor.

388
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,720
Then Right Advisor

389
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
couldn't have appeared suddenly

390
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,360
to ruin his plan.

391
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,720
Unless

392
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,720
Right Minister never allowed us

393
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,080
to really save Prince An

394
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,280
from the start.

395
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,280
You mean

396
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,160
Right Minister allowed you and Qi Yan

397
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,760
to let Prince An go.

398
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,920
Then he allowed Right Advisor
to inform Official Qiu

399
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,600
and infuriate him to kill Qi Yan.

400
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,920
How many people did Qiu Ziliang send

401
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,560
to chase after Prince An?

402
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
Official Qiu was furious.

403
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,440
He sent 3,000 Shencai Army troops

404
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,440
and 50 soldiers.

405
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,240
That's almost two-thirds

406
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,080
of usable military power.

407
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,040
What have you thought about?

408
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,840
It's a diversion.

409
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,240
Investigate immediately

410
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,880
if there are other mobilizations
in the camp.

411
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,520
Also,

412
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,920
command the new Cannons to see me.

413
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,920
I want to ask them something.

414
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,440
Are we still going to the palace then?

415
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,720
No.

416
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,440
You're right.

417
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,120
We're powerless to stop him,

418
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,520
and it's too late to stop him.

419
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,640
We should take a chance then.

420
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I bet the Right Minister

421
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,920
surely has another trick up his sleeves.

422
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,640
Why did you return?

423
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,320
Your Majesty.

424
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,400
I didn't know about your plan.

425
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,240
I just heard that you were in danger,

426
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,560
so I came back immediately.

427
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,280

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,560
Yes.

518
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,680
With the impending battle,

519
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,040
if we replace the emperor,

520
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,480
the military commissioners will surely
take the opportunity to rebel.

521
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,520
Then that would be hard to handle.

522
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,800
Does Liu Congjian

523
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,040
really have the late emperor's
posthumous edict?

524
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,160
I've already sent people
to Zhaoyi to check.

525
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,840
But that's not our turf.

526
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,760
It's very complicated and dangerous.

527
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,640
We haven't found anything yet.

528
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,280
That old fart.

529
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,360
Because he has military power,

530
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,000
he thinks that I can't
do anything to him.

531
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,640
He sought redress for Wang Yang's
grievance three times.

532
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,680
I should have

533
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,040
sent people from Chess of Generals Camp
to kill him.

534
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,760
And it wouldn't have accomplished
what Qi Yan wanted.

535
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,640
Father, you mean...

536
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
All these years,

537
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,040
the princes ruled on their own.

538
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,560
They have no regard
for the imperial court.

539
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,840
With this chaos in Lucong,

540
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,880
why are they all coming forward?

541
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,320
Qi Yan

542
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,600
must have secretly

543
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,840
made a deal with them.

544
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,280
They want to eliminate
the evil eunuchs around His Majesty.

545
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,150
(Northern Mountains
and Rivers Map of Xing)

546
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,160
This is where Lucong is.

547
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,600
After Misha returns,

548
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,080
with Zhenwu's 80,000 elite warriors,

549
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,800
together with military commissioners

550
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,120
who are willing to help,

551
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,960
they'll become a multilateral force

552
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,800
that can suppress

553
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,800
Qiu Ziliang's troops.

554
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,520
Your Majesty, you have long

555
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,600
set this all up?

556
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,040
I found out

557
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,840
about Lucong's situation
from Aunt Ninghe,

558
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,520
so I immediately sent Han Ding
to investigate in detail.

559
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,720
Aunt Ninghe still has

560
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,720
some remaining power in Lucong.

561
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,280
She can help me.

562
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,120
Now,

563
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,120
we have the support

564
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,960
of the military commissioners
from Zhenwu and Zhaoyi.

565
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,880
Once Chen Yintai becomes more powerful,

566
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,880
and war breaks out,

567
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,240
Qiu Ziliang won't have

568
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,480
any useful people to utilize.

569
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,280
When that time comes,

570
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,920
Li Deyun can take the opportunity
to return.

571
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,600
But we didn't expect

572
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,400
that Han Yue would suddenly come.

573
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,760
Right.

574
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,320
Plans can never keep up with changes.

575
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,560
However,

576
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,880
we're finally

577
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,400
back on track.

578
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,160
But once we go to war,

579
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,960
the citizens will be displaced again.

580
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,800
I know.

581
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,360
But the eunuch's faction

582
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,320
is like a long-time cancer.

583
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,720
Medicines can't cure it.

584
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,440
We can only cut it away.

585
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Even if there will be blood loss,

586
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,600
it's better than letting the cancer
continue developing

587
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,200
and become incurable.

588
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,440
"The clear sky in autumn aids
in mobilizing troops.

589
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,720
The wind in the night
clears the dust away.

590
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,560
Men remove the swords from their waists.

591
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,880
Happy to see them gone
from the imperial highway."

592
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,480
Why do you know this poem?

593
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,120
I...

594
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,639
Perhaps I was just overwhelmed
with emotions.

595
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,679
That was why I recited it.

596
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,360
What's wrong with this poem?

597
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,920
Do you know whose poem it is?

598
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,960
I don't.

599
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,800
Whose is it?

600
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,520
It's Wang Yang's poem.

601
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,800
Wang Yang?

602
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,719
Perhaps I saw it

603
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,840
in the Resume before

604
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,760
and memorized it.

605
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,679
I...

606
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,080
Your Majesty.

607
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
Can you tell me about it?

608
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,679
About what?

609
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,840
Aside from Han Yue,

610
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,960
Wu,

611
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,480
and the two granddaughters

612
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,560
of Wang Yang,

613
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,760
what exactly did you do back then?

614
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,640
You never say anything,

615
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,720
and just let the citizens curse you,

616
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,280
outsiders misunderstand you,

617
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,880
eunuchs laugh at you,

618
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,400
and even have nightmares all night.

619
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
(All of us can die)

620
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,800
(for you.)

621
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,840
(If you win,)

622
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,560
(Xing will stay alive.)

623
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
(If you lose,)

624
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,000
(Xing perishes.)

625
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,120
(Qi Yan.)

626
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,360
(You must win.)

627
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,840
There's no misunderstanding.

628
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,560
What they're saying is all true.

629
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,640
In order to become emperor,

630
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,200
I acknowledged a traitor
as my father

631
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,880
and killed Qiu Ziliang's
political enemies,

632
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,680
which resulted
in the current imperial court

633
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,840
not having any loyal, wise,

634
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,960
and useful talents.

635
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,160
You're not that kind of person.

636
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,360
Then

637
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,480
what kind of person am I?

638
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,560
You're the type

639
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,680
who'll personally go to Chess
of Generals Camp at night

640
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,840
because you're worried
about your brother's safety.

641
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,080
You knew that His Highness Prince Guang

642
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,520
is a threat to your throne.

643
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,680
Yet you still chose to trust him.

644
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,920
You knew that there's danger,

645
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,720
and you intentionally transferred me out
to protect me.

646
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,320
You really care

647
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,320
about Xing and the nation.

648
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,040
How can you be

649
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,960
a heartless person

650
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,520
who'll do anything for power?

651
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,040
Your Majesty.

652
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,720
Don't come near me.

653
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,920
Your Majesty.

654
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,040
You'll win,

655
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,360
and we,

656
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,640
all of us, will help you.

657
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,040
It's late.

658
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,160
Go and rest.

659
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,920
Yes.

660
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,160

(Even if I've already become a demon,)

663
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,680

664
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,800

665
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680

Reporting.

693
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,360
What's the matter?

694
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,680
Li Zening is still not making any move,

695
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,040
and Cheng Ruoyu shook us off.

696
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,320
Cheng Ruoyu was riding Ru Feng.

697
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,120
His hooves are different
from ordinary horses.

698
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,520
You still can't find her by following
the hoof prints?

699
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,160
We did,

700
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,280
but we only found Ru Feng.

701
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,240
There was no one on the horse.

702
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,000
Watch Ru Feng closely.

703
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,000
Qi Yan won't bear to lose that horse.

704

Yes.

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,920
What time is it now?

706
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,520
It's already past 1 pm.

707
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,040
It's been so long,

708
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,240
and Li Zening is still
not doing anything?

709
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,920
No.

710
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,880
Send someone to go and test her.

711
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,840
Force the people in the carriage
to come out.

712
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,520
Yes.

Baikong
[*Meaning empty]

716
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,240
is really an empty temple.

717
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,120
It's been desolate for many years.

718
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
There's nothing inside.

719
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,040
Tell us.

720
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,480
Where is Li Zening?

721
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
We don't know either.

722
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,880
She said

723
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,640
that the monks in Baikong Temple
have a hard time.

724
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,080
It's inconvenient to go up
and down the mountain,

725
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,240
so she told us to give them

726
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,280
this carriage.

727
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,120
Li Zening told you to give the carriage

728
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,480
to an empty temple?

729
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,240
We're just servants.

730
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,480
We just do

731
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,640
as our mistress said.

732
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,880
She even told us

733
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,600
to wait outside the temple.

734
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,240
After the monks finish
what they need to do,

735
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,760
they'll come out to get the carriage.

736
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,080
Cheng Ruoyu?

737
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,560
Why are you here?

738
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,840
Who told you to come here?

739
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,360
It was His Majesty?

740
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
His Majesty asked you to come

741
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,040
and pick up Li Deyun.

742
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,880
Am I right?

743
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

744
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
I came here

745
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,280
to enshrine Buddhist scripture

746
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,040
for Grand Empress Dowager.

747
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,960
There are so many imperial temples.

748
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,840
Why choose an empty one

749
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,120
to enshrine Buddhist scripture?

750
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760

752
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
It's really an empty temple.

753
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,520
How strange.

754
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,400
It was a trick to lure us away.

755
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,120
We fell for it. Let's go.

Is this the heat-relieving soup
His Majesty wants?

759
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,120
Why did it only arrive now?
