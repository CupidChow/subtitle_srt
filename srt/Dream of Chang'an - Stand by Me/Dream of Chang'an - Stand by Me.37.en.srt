00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,160
It's getting late.

166
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
You should sleep in my room.

167
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
Chess Overseer,

168
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,320
the room is ready.

169
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,920
You may leave.

170
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,600
Understood.

171
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,720
What are you trying to do?

172
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you going to place me
under house arrest?

173
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,600
You are overthinking it.

174
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,360
If so,

175
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,520
why can't I get my own room?

176
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,080
I don't want to sleep
in the same room with you.

177
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
Staying in my room is more convenient.

178
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,480
No one will spy on you here.

179
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
I have plenty of things
I want to teach you.

180
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
You're planning to teach me?

181
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,400
Music, chess, calligraphy, painting,

182
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
astronomy, geography,

183
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,760
the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams,

184
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,120
and Qimen Dunjia,

185
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,720
I will teach you everything.

186
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,860
(Chess of Generals Camp)

187
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
Have you solved it?

188
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,440
What kind of nonsense is this?

189
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,880
This is too difficult for me!

190
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,120
If so, how did you manage to understand

191
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,040
the Ninth Heaven Mystic Maiden Formation
in one go back then?

192
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,880
You actually knew about that?

193
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,400
I know everything

194
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
about you.

195
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
Qiu Yanzhi,

196
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,120
seems like you had spent

197
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,520
a huge amount of effort
to take me under your wing.

198
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
It's good that you know about it.

199
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
The palace's celebration banquet

200
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
will be starting soon.

201
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,560
Wait.

202
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,440
I thought you promised me

203
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,120
that I could put an end

204
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
to my relationship with His Majesty?

205
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,080
You've met His Majesty yesterday.

206
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
You should give me another chance.

207
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,040
Yesterday's meeting was too hasty.

208
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,280
That doesn't count.

209
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,000
I haven't given up on him yet.

210
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
You do say everything
that is on your mind

211
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,280
without thinking it through.

212
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,680
Fine.

213
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,920
I'm not a heartless person.

214
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
If you can solve this formation,

215
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,920
I will let you go.

216
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,840
Your Majesty,

217
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,560
the banquet is ready.

218
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440
We await your presence.

219
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,240
Did Ling Ling attend the banquet?

220
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,400
I don't think so.

221
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
All right.

222
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,760
I want to go out

223
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,480
and take a breather.

224
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,000
I swear

225
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,080
that I won't escape.

226
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm serious.

227
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
I'm here to see Prince Guang

228
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,920
under Chess Overseer's order.

229
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,359
I have important matters
to discuss with him.

230
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,440
Prince Guang.

231
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,200
Yu'er?

232
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
Please save me.

233
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,960
Official Zhang, please.

234
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,560
I'm done.

235
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Did you fall asleep?

236
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,280
You solved the formation?

237
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,720
So, this is how
you solved the formation.

238
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,240
Your Highness, you're amazing indeed.

239
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,720
You're very knowledgeable

240
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,680
when it comes to traps and formations.

241
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,320
This formation is exceptional.

242
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,640
Where did you get this from?

243
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,080
Yanzhi showed me this formation
in order to test me.

244
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,520
She's teaching you this

245
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,840
for your own good.

246
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,560
I think she just wants to
make things difficult for me.

247
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,160
She's doing it deliberately so that
I won't be able

248
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,960
to enter the palace and see His Majesty.

249
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,360
Enter the palace?

250
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,600
I don't know

251
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,240
if I can make it in time.

252
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,040
Farewell.

253
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,160
Thank you, Prince Guang.

254
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,360
Yu'er.

255
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,000
I've committed a bad deed

256
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,520
even though I was well-intentioned.

257
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,560
I solved the formation.

258
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,640
You better keep your words.

259
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,320
Farewell.

260
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,400
Your Highness.

261
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,120
Did I ruin your plan?

262
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,040
Are you referring to the formation?

263
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,800
I didn't know that she was going to
see His Majesty

264
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
after solving the formation.

265
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
It's fine.

266
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,800
No one was able to stop her anyway.

267
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,160
Ever since

268
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
you taught her the
Ninth Heaven Mystic Maiden Steps,

269
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,880
ordinary soldiers

270
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,480
have no way to catch up with her.

271
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
Yu'er does have innate talent

272
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,800
for learning martial arts.

273
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
How does she fare
compared with Qiu Ziliang?

274
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,920
Yu'er is broad-minded.

275
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,840
If she can focus on
improving her martial arts

276
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,080
and be well-acquainted
with the ways of the world,

277
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,120
she will be able

278
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,360
to surpass Qiu Ziliang.

279
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Are you sure?

280
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,160
I am.

281
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Since ancient times,
the good always triumph over evil.

282
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,200
Your Highness,

283
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,800
thank you.

284
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,120
You will never be able to imagine

285
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,200
how important it is for me

286
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,920
to learn

287
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,360
that Ruoling is still alive.

288
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
And you, who told me about this fact,

289
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
are very important to me as well.

290
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,200
How do you plan

291
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,360
to make them cut their ties?

292
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,640
As long as His Majesty
doesn't acknowledge her existence,

293
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,360
their ties will be cut eventually.

294
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,520
But will His Majesty

295
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
be able to do so?

296
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,880
Eunuch Cheng.

297
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,800
Sorry for being late.

298
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,520
Who are you?

299
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,800
Are you Yu'er?

300
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,600
I thought you were dead?

301
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,000
Eunuch Cheng,

302
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,120
I am Ling Ling.

303
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,200
I was late because
I had something to attend to.

304
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,680
Can you bring me in?

305
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,560
You resemble her too much.

306
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
The resemblance is uncanny.

307
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,080
Uncle,

308
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I am Yu'er.

309
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,320
I am the real Yu'er.

310
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,920
I didn't die.

311
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,480
Qiu Ziliang ordered his men to kill me,

312
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,040
but Yanzhi saved me.

313
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
This is a secret.

314
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,240
Now, only you and His Majesty
know this secret.

315
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
But His Majesty doesn't want
to acknowledge my existence.

316
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,960
Can you help me out?

317
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,480
I wish to help you,

318
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,120
but

319
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,960
I don't dare to trust you.

320
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,360
Uncle, if you don't trust me,

321
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,880
you may ask me questions.

322
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,480
Ask me something that
only I have the answers to.

323
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,920
What is your favourite food?

324
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,480
Cherry pastry.

325
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,320
What is my favourite food?

326
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,640
Jujube rice cake.

327
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
What is Xi's favourite food?

328
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,640
Roasted camel hump.

329
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,960
What is Li Rong's favourite food?

330
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,640
Li Rong?

331
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,720
For Madam Li,

332
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,760
she likes nothing in particular.

333
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,920
But she doesn't eat fish.

334
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,960
Not even one bite.

335
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
Yu'er!

336
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,400
Uncle.

337
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,240
Cheng Huaizhi.

338
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,480
Your Majesty.

339
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,520
Your Majesty.

340
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,600
Uncle,

341
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,160
please tell His Majesty about it.

342
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,440
Your Majesty,

343
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
this is Yu'er.

344
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Your Majesty, she's still alive.

345
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,160
Your Majesty.

346
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,000
She isn't Yu'er.

347
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
Yu'er is dead.

348
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Your Majesty.

349
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
I am right in front of you.

350
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,920
My body,

351
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,720
my voice,

352
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,760
my hands, my feet,

353
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,800
my entire being and my heart,
all of them are here.

354
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,760
Why are you

355
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,640
ignoring me?

356
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,280
Even if you are similar

357
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,600
to Yu'er in every way,

358
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
you are not Yu'er.

359
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,360
I

360
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,080
won't fall for your trick.

361
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,400
Your Majesty.

362
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,480
Your Majesty!

363
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
Are you not acknowledging my existence

364
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,400
because you're worried about something?

365
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,560
Maybe...

366
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,080
Maybe you're doing so

367
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,000
because you're afraid

368
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
that Qiu Ziliang may try to harm me

369
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,920
once he knows that I'm still alive.

370
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,360
If that isn't the case,

371
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
maybe it's Yanzhi.

372
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,800
Is Yanzhi using me as an excuse
to threaten you?

373
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,240
Your Majesty,

374
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,960
if you have any arrangements for me,

375
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
please tell me.

376
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
I will follow your instruction.

377
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,480
But please don't do this to me.

378
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,840
I feel upset

379
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,880
when you're not acknowledging
my existence.

380
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,640
You're indeed a warrior of sacrifice

381
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,960
of the Chess of Generals Camp.

382
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Not only do you bear an uncanny
resemblance to her,

383
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
you know how to manipulate
the human heart as well.

384
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,840
I almost fell for your trick.

385
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,360
Do you know why I'm sure

386
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,880
that you are not Yu'er?

387
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,560
Why?

388
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,560
Why?

389
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,320
Why?

390
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,880
How did you hurt yourself?

391
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,960
I saw it.

392
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,520
Saw what?

393
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
I saw you washing
Prince Guang's sleeves for him.

394
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,360
You even...

395
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Is that why

396
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,240
you got yourself into a fight?

397
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,000
Remove your clothes then.

398
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,720
I can wash them for you as well.

399
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,240
That's not what I want.

400
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,520
What do you want then?

401
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,120
I...

402
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,200
You're supposed to marry Qi Yan

403
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,840
and become the empress.

404
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,640
Yes.

405
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,600
Did you change your mind?

406
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,400
I didn't.

407
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,000
You did.

408
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,560
Your determination

409
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,600
is starting to waver.

410
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,920
What I wish for

411
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,320
and hope for

412
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,280
hasn't changed at all.

413
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,800
I'm sorry.

414
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,360
I shouldn't have forced you.

415
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
But I am jealous.

416
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,760
Although you're going to marry Qi Yan,

417
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,880
I know you do so

418
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,160
out of revenge.

419
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,800
But when I see Prince Guang,

420
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,000
I feel afraid.

421
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,920
You changed after you knew

422
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
that he was the one

423
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
who had saved your younger sister.

424
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,280
Ru Feng!

425
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
-Ru Feng!
-Ru Feng!

426
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,680
Ru Feng!

427
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,320
Did you see that?

428
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
Ru Feng is running away.

429
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,800
Yesterday,

430
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,280
you came to me

431
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
and told me that you were Cheng Ruoyu.

432
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,920
But when Ru Feng saw you,

433
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,360
it didn't respond.

434
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,920
Is that reason good enough for you?

435
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,480
Your Majesty.

436
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,640
Your Majesty!

437
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,480
What do you want me to do

438
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,000
in order to make you trust me?

439
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,400
Why aren't you acknowledging
my existence?

440
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,120
Your Majesty.

441
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,520
Ru Feng, good boy.

442
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,160
You do listen to me indeed.

443
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
Bring it to the stables.

444
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,400
Your Majesty,

445
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,040
I think she is Yu'er.

446
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,160
Huaizhi,

447
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,600
your niece,

448
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,120
Cheng Ruoyu, is dead.

Her body

450
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,200
is within Ziyu Pavilion.

451
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,880

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,640
The Chess of Generals Camp
isn't my home.

506
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,920
Where else can you go

507
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,200
if you don't follow me back?

508
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,760
You must be proud of yourself right now.

509
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,480
His Majesty fell for your trick.

510
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,720
He wasn't willing to acknowledge
my existence,

511
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,600
and I have no other choice.

512
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
I can only follow you back.

513
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,280
Congratulations.

514
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,720
You have finally embraced reality.

515
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,520
Since you have embraced reality,

516
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,560
you still have plenty of things
to learn.

517
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,920
You have no time to throw a fit.

518
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,760
And

519
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,440
you do have a home.

520
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,240
From now on,

521
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,480
the places I go

522
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,280
will be your home.

523
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,040
(Qiu)

524
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,900
(Chess of Generals Camp)

525
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,080
Understand them,

526
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,080
and study them thoroughly.

527
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,960
Come.

528
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,920
It's hot!

529
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,640
Don't move.

530
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,840
It's good for your injury.

531
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,680
Do you even know what you are doing?

532
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,520
It hurts over here as well.

533
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
Higher.

534
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,760
I don't believe it.

535
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,560
I'm sure I'll win tomorrow.

536
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,880
What kind of lousy sword
did you give me?

537
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,120
It's unusable.

538
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,120
Do you want to retrieve
your Qingguang Sword?

539
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,200
Forget about it.

540
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,680
Just let that sword

541
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,880
accompany the dead Cheng Ruoyu.

542
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,760
You are giving up already?

543
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,520
I thought

544
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,840
you would continue to see Qi Yan

545
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,680
until he acknowledges your existence.

546
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,560
Actually,

547
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,040
I think His Majesty does trust my words.

548
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,400
He doesn't want to acknowledge
my existence

549
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,440
for my own good.

550
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,320
Before this,

551
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,920
I didn't think it through.

552
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,600
I went to find him on a whim.

553
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,920
But now that I think about it,

554
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,960
I did realize that
it was dangerous of me to do so.

555
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,720
If Qiu Ziliang wasn't
on an isolated meditation,

556
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,680
he would've known that
I am still alive.

557
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,600
So,

558
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,360
no matter how terrible

559
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,080
your advice may sound before,

560
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,840
I am still grateful to you.

561
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,840
And for the past few days,

562
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,440
I can feel that you were

563
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,080
trying your best to teach me.

564
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,640
When I was in the Violet Bureau,

565
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,440
my aunt didn't teach me
anything in particular.

566
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,000
I was ignorant.

567
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,560
Until the day...

568
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,480
Until the incident with Yuzhen Hall.

569
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,280
Only then, you started to
realize your folly,

570
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,360
am I right?

571
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,360
You are right.

572
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,840
And now,

573
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,440
although it may seem like
you are forcing me to learn,

574
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,280
I am enjoying it myself.

575
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,560
I

576
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,800
have a question for you.

577
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,560
Tell me.

578
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,840
Why are you treating me this well?

579
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
Cheng Xi is missing.

580
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,640
Two months ago,

581
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Zhang Jiang sent his men

582
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,880
to kill the guards around her.

583
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,080
He brought her away.

584
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,640
Now, Zhang Jiang has lost his battle.

585
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,280
We have no idea about
her current whereabouts.

586
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,000
Ask Madam Jade to lead the search.

587
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,360
Qiu Ziliang

588
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,400
finally fell for our trick
and went on an isolated meditation.

589
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,000
We mustn't let new problems crop up

590
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,160
during a crucial moment like this.

591
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,640
Yes, Your Highness.

592
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,760
And

593
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,200
keep an eye on Li Rong.

594
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,720
If Cheng Xi returns here,

595
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,080
she will definitely contact her.

596
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,760
Yes, Your Highness.

597
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,920
I had a younger sister.

598
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,280
She was intelligent and mischievous.

599
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,160
Unfortunately, she passed away.

600
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,360
You resemble her.

601
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,280
Whenever I look at you,

602
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,760
I feel as if I was looking at her.

603
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,680
But I'm teaching you all these skills

604
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,680
for the sake of the Violet Bureau.

605
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,160
What do you mean?

606
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,880
Violet Bureau's
Ninth Heaven Mystic Maiden Formation

607
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,240
can rival 1,000 men

608
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,600
with just 100 people.

609
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,440
If we can use it within a real battle,

610
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,960
it will be highly effective.

611
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,720
Now,

612
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,240
Cheng Xi is gone.

613
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,760
Don't you want to return to the bureau

614
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,840
and lead them to glory again?

615
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,600
Last time, you were able
to solve the formation

616
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,680
because of Prince Guang's help.

617
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,320
You grabbed hold of your opportunity.

618
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,680
Now,

619
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,960
I'm helping you to catch up
with traps and formations,

620
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,120
so that you can integrate them
into your strategies.

621
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,160
Only then, the Violet Bureau
will be able

622
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,120
to perform at its best.

623
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,160
If you want to protect Qi Yan,

624
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,600
if you want to deal with Qiu Ziliang,

625
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,760
if you want to be
the second Madam Gongsun,

626
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,320
the first thing you must do

627
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,960
is to make yourself stronger.
