Yes.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,040
Start walking!

00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,320

Keep walking.

No!

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
Keep moving.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Move.

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,720
Where is the Military Advisor?

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,880
Where is the Military Advisor?

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,080
He's...

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
- Where is the Military Advisor?
- He's...

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
at the Yuzhen Hall.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,240
He's long gone.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Tell me.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,480
Where is he now?

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
I don't know

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,160
where he is now.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
All I know is that

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,760
he wants to marry

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
Princess Misha to His Majesty.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
Other than that,

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
I know nothing.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Princess Liu Misha, isn't it?

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
So, you want to be our next Empress.

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
Report!

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,220
(The three Princes and six Pieces
are in Donglin)

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,680
The three Princes and six Pieces

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,400
are in Donglin.

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
I invite you to a game

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,840
at Sunny Rain Pavilion.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
By the Morning Dew Stranger.

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
This is interesting.

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,600
Tell me,

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
did your Military Advisor

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,240
join the forces of Zhenwu
eight years ago?

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Yes.

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,320
He came to us eight years ago.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
Great.

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,680
It seems like Zheng Wu
wasn't the only remnant

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,080
from the Morning Dew Rebellion.

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
Sir, are you going?

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
He's no one.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,280
He's not worth my time.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,040
I don't care about the others.

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
But Yanzhi...

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
If she fails

65
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,800
to break free from this predicament,

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,320
she is not worthy

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
of becoming our Chess Overseer.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,560
No.

69
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,120
You must stop His Majesty.

70
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Why?

71
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
Maybe it would work.

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
But what about the future?

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,320
Qiu Ziliang is a bloodthirsty hyena.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
But Zheng Lu and Li Xu

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,760
are far from being virtuous.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,600
Don't forget,

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,960
they got rid of three Chancellors.

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,280
That created a power vacancy,

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
sending the Imperial Court
into disarray.

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,600
If the Morning Dew Rebellion
comes to fruition,

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,720
who do you think will control the army

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,760
after Qiu Ziliang's death?

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,560
Qiu Ziliang is a eunuch.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,400
He got his power from the Emperor.

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,480
Zheng Lu and Li Xu's greed

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,840
is more than just power.

87
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,600
If their Rebellion is successful,

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,360
His Majesty will definitely

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
become those villains' puppet.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,520
If they fail,

91
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,200
Qiu Ziliang will want

92
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
his payback.

93
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,040
It's a time of turmoil.

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,120
We can't stay our hands out of this.

95
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
Teacher,

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,920
I'll head for the palace
and stop my brother.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,000
Go!

98
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,240
Prince Yi.

99
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,560
It's late into the night.

100
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,880
Where are you going?

101
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,680
Grand Empress Dowager's birthday
is around the corner.

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
I wish to discuss the celebration

103
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
with my brother.

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
His Majesty is asleep.

105
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
I could

106
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,520
pass the message for you.

107
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
I'll tell His Majesty.

108
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
It's not very urgent.

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
I'll tell him when I meet him.

110
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Wait.

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,480
Prince Yi.

112
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,280
The Grand Empress Dowager
loves a good play.

113
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,320
Let's put up a play.

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
Wouldn't that be a sound plan?

115
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
Sure.

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,200
(No.)

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
The plan was leaked.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
I bet Qiu Ziliang

119
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
has started suspecting.

120
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,920
But who leaked it?

121
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,880
We have no time

122
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,520
to find out who leaked it.

123
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
We must prevent the situation
from getting worse.

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,280
But I'm afraid it's already too late.

125
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,080
Teacher,

126
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,560
you could tell me anything.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
The only person who can save His Majesty

128
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,480
and the nation of Daxing

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,520
is you.

130
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Your Highness, now, you need

131
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,320
to take on the path of a sinner.

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
(No one will understand you.)

133
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
(You will become
the people's object of scorn.)

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,520
Even your closest kin

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
will be disappointed in you.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
(However,)

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
(your suffering has its purpose to it.)

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,480
(If you don't endure the suffering,)

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,320
(you won't be able
to achieve your wish.)

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,520
Sir.

141
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,720
Wang Yang got away.

142
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,280
I'll get him.

143
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,320
(Your Highness, now, you need)

144
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,800
(to take on the path of a sinner.)

145
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,840
(If you don't endure the suffering,)

146
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,600
(you won't be able
to achieve your wish.)

147
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,799
(The part behind the heart,)

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,679
(is protected by the rib cage
and the spine.)

149
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,080
(Aim at that point.)

150
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,320
(With enough projectile speed)

151
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,560
(and the right force, the arrow)

152
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
(will be stuck between the bones.)

153
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,280
(The person might survive the wound.)

154
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,880
Teacher.

155
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,880
Teacher.

156
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,440
Your Majesty.

157
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,440
What's the matter?

158
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,040
Was it a nightmare?

159
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,040
Yu'er.

160
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,840
You once told me

161
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
that my past...

162
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,480
has brought me great suffering.

163
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,320
So I should move on.

164
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
If even Han Yue

165
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,960
might have been wronged...

166
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
and that I

167
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,600
deserved the worst form of death,

168
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
would you still...

169
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,960
be by my side?

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
I will.

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,400
Do you mean it?

172
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,360
Han Yue might have been wronged,

173
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,680
but the way he exacts his revenge

174
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
was too cruel and gruesome.

175
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,040
It was shameful.

176
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
Your Majesty had done terrible things,

177
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,080
but Your Majesty regretted it

178
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,480
and is now trying to make amends.

179
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
So...

180
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
when I told you

181
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,000
to have a different life,

182
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,360
I'd be there for you.

183
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
Cheng Ruoyu.

184
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,480
You shall hold

185
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
to your words.

188
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,680
Yu'er.

189
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
What's wrong?

190
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:02,880
Yu'er.

191
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm fine.

192
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm just a little hungry.

193
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,600
You're hungry.

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Then you should sleep.

195
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,480
Close your eyes.

196
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
Come.

197
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,640
Imagine...

198
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,120
Imagine

199
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
we were at the West Market

200
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,040
for the osmanthus cake.

201
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,880
They just came out of the oven.

202
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,600
The topping...

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
is a layer of fudge.

204
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,720
The osmanthus petals

205
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
are sprinkled on the fudge.

206
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,560
The whole West Market

207
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,080
is full of osmanthus petals' fragrance.

208
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,640
I'd buy you

209
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
your favorite

210
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
braised trotters.

211
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,320
It's juicy but not too greasy.

212
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
Just one bite

213
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
will cover your mouth in grease.

214
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,440
By the way,

215
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,880
I'd buy you

216
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
your favorite wontons.

217
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
You got the big wontons.

218
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,440
You could have

219
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,400
as many as you like.

220
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,280
Okay?

221
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
Your Majesty.

222
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm starving.

227
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,080
Do you have an escape plan?

228
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,640
Does it matter

229
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,400
if I have one?

230
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,000
If you have a plan,

231
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,560
you must leave this place.

232
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,600
We'll stall Han Yue for you.

233
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,400
Get us backup.

234
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
If you don't have a plan,

235
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,320
I hope

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,120
you could lend us a hand in ending this.

237
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,760
Your Highness.

238
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,640
Is there a way

239
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,960
to get out of here?

240
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,680
On the way here,

241
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
I left some markings.

242
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,320
I believe Yuan Du

243
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,760
will be here very soon.

244
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,520
But the catch is that

245
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,040
even if we leave this place,

246
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,640
Lucong and Zhenwu

247
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,880
are already caught up in this.

248
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,160
The slightest conflict

249
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
will result in disorder
in the prefectures.

250
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,080
So what do we do now?

251
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Yu'er.

252
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,640
Leave with Yuan Du when he's arrived.

253
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,800
Send the letters to Lucong and Zhenwu.

254
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,920
Tell them the whole story.

255
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,760
Yanzhi.

256
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,840
You know the layout

257
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,760
of the contraptions.

258
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,440
We need you to stall Han Yue.

259
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,640
Your Majesty.

260
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,880
It's time to recall Li Deyun.

261
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,000
Li Deyun?

262
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
Who's that?

263
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Qiu Ziliang was very wary of him.

264
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,040
I doubt he would let Li Deyun
step into the city.

265
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,160
Now is the chance of a lifetime.

266
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,960
While Qiu Ziliang and Han Yue
are too busy with the power struggle,

267
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,280
Li Deyun could solve the conflicts

268
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,640
that involve the Imperial Court,

269
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,120
Lucong and Zhenwu

270
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,960
at the moment.

271
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,360
The assassin from Lucong

272
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,480
tried to take out
His Majesty and Princess Misha.

273
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
The Military Advisor of Zhenwu
imprisoned His Majesty.

274
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,000
But Princess Misha
wants to marry His Majesty.

275
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,520
This is a three-way conflict.

276
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
We need

277
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,520
a capable mediator.

278
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,760
Indeed.

279
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,920
Qiu Ziliang can't handle
the official operations

280
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,320
of the Imperial Court.

281
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,960
As the one who triggered this conflict,

282
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,840
he can't show himself in public.

283
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
Li Deyun was born into a noble family.

284
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,720
He was reputable.

285
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,960
The prefectures' officials knew him.

286
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,920
He is the best man we have
for a mediator.

287
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,720
How so?

288
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,600
Through marriage.

289
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,760
I will never marry her.

290
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,560
We could marry off a princess

291
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,640
to Zhenwu.

292
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
This crisis might also be

293
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,600
a great opportunity.

294
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,000
If we could resolve it properly,

295
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,600
this could be our chance

296
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
to reclaim control over the army.

297
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
A bunch of fools!

298
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,480
Before Qiu Ziliang is dead,

299
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,960
no one will leave this building.

300
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,600
This is not the end.

301
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,200
Do you have any plans?

302
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm waiting for my father to
come to my rescue.

303
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,880
(As I expected,)

304
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,640
(Li Deyun is now caught up in this.)

305
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,359
Sir.

306
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,280
Open it.

307
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,440
Sir.

308
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,080
(Spare Liu Misha, use her to blackmail
Liu Mian of Zhenwu into submission)

309
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,080
Imprison the Princess
in solitary confinement.

310
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,520
We can deal with her later.

311
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,920
As for...

312
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,120
Yes.

313
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,160
What do you want?

314
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,760
Where are you taking him?

315
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,880
- Princess!
- Sun Lie!

316
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,840
- Princess!
- Sun Lie!

317
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,520
- Princess!
- Sun Lie!

318
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,040
Don't you dare forget this.

319
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
As long as I live,

320
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,440
I will have my revenge on you!

321
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Sir.

322
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,680
She is a loose end.

323
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,880
Sir, are you planning

324
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,840
to seize control of Zhenwu's
80,000 soldiers?

325
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,880
Right Minister offered a nice suggestion.

326
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,680
With the Shencai Army
of 120,000 men strong,

327
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,560
we'll have enough leverage

328
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,040
to negotiate with those rebellious

329
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
military commissioners.

330
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,160
You have the power
over tens of thousands.

331
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
Why bother threatening the princes?

332
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,000
No one would give up on
having greater power.

333
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
With those people waiting
to strike us down,

334
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,200
this game

335
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,080
will be even more intriguing.

336
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Master.

337
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,480
Qiu Ziliang

338
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
never went to the Sunny Rain Pavilion.

339
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,400
Ruoqing was right.

340
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,520
We must resort

341
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,640
to our second plan.

342
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,760
A second plan?

343
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,120
What is it?

344
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,720
(General Han, you want)

345
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,360
the Zhenwu Army so you could

346
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,960
go against Qiu Ziliang.

347
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,000
The Morning Dew Rebellion failed

348
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
because Qiu Ziliang was on high alert

349
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,560
and we lacked the military might.

350
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
I took advantage of Ninghe's return
to Heng'an

351
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
to involve Zhenwu in my plot.

352
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,240
What I seek

353
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,960
are the 80,000 elite soldiers they have

354
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,320
to keep the Central Shencai Army
in check.

355
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
Then you used the three Princes
and six Pieces

356
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,280
to lure him into meeting you alone.

357
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,320
Yes.

358
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,280
But I never expected

359
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,320
that the Chess Overseer

360
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,560
would be you.

361
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,280
General Han,

362
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,520
you don't know Qiu Ziliang well enough.

363
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,240
All of us are merely pawns

364
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,280
for his bidding.

365
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,400
And he can replace any pawns
he deems useless.

366
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
What do you propose?

367
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
We could learn from
the Morning Dew Rebellion.

368
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,320
Qiu Ziliang knew

369
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,840
Zheng Lu and the rebels

370
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,560
were waiting in the Left Battle Hall.

371
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,600
But they went in anyway.

372
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,760
Why?

373
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,800
Because he was furious.

374
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,200
He was furious over
the Late Emperor's betrayal.

375
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,040
So he insisted on killing

376
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
those who once humiliated him

377
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,800
to prove

378
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,560
the Late Emperor had made
a grave mistake.

379
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,080
You mean...

380
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,320
Tell him my real identity.

381
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,240
I want him to know

382
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,120
the girl he raised with care

383
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,840
was actually Wang Yang's granddaughter.

384
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
I want him to know

385
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,080
I've been planning my revenge on him
all this time.

386
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,280
What Qiu Ziliang hates the most

387
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,280
are contempt and betrayal.

388
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
So he will surely punish me

389
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,040
with his own hands.

390
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,800
The plan is too risky.

391
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,160
To rebuild Daxing,

392
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,920
this is a small price to pay.

393
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,200
It's been eight years.

394
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
I had been fighting this battle alone

395
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,680
before I met you, General Han.

396
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,480
It's Heaven's will
that we rebuild this nation.

397
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Tell Qiu Ziliang

398
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,720
Qiu Yanzhi's real identity

399
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
is Wang Ruoqing.

400
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,280
Yes.

401
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
Consider it done.

402
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,320
Wait.

403
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
Leave it to the Left Knight.

404
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,280
A sound plan.

405
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,040
Qiu Ziliang doesn't know

406
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
the Left Knight is our man.

407
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,680
No.

408
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,880
I want to find out whether

409
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,240
he would obey this order.

410
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
So your plan is...

411
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,880
He spent eight years in
the Chess of Generals Camp.

412
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,280
Power has blinded his heart and soul.

413
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,040
Had he not lost

414
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,520
to Qiu Yanzhi while competing

415
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
for the title of Chess Overseer,

416
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
he would have betrayed me.

417
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,040
It can't be.

418
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,200
I hope so.

419
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
But we shall find out

420
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,000
very soon.

421
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,620
(Alpha Ursae Majoris)

422
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,560
Master.

423
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
Qiu Ziliang doesn't know

424
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,400
Yanzhi's real identity.

425
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
If he knew,

426
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,280
he wouldn't let Wang Ruoqing

427
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,080
live to this day

428
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
and let her

429
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
live as his own daughter.

430
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,160
Who's there?

431
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,920
Yu'er.

432
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,040
Yu'er.

433
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Have some food.

434
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,720
Yu'er.

435
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Your Majesty.

436
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,880
Your hand is so cold.

437
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,120
Your Majesty.

438
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm fine.

439
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,040
I only need a nap.

440
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,160
Come, Yu'er.

441
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,400
Save the nap for later.

442
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,920
Come closer.

443
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Every time I had a fever,

444
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,920
my mother did it for me.

445
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,360
Uncle.

446
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,000
Yu'er is burning up.

447
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
Her breathing is getting slower.

448
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,600
Your Majesty.

449
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,320
Yu'er is...

450
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,160
Prince Guang.

451
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,240
I'm fine.

452
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,520
Let me sleep for a little while.

453
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,520
- Just a little while.
- Yu'er.

454
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,520
Be honest.

455
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,800
Your injury got worse.

456
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,840
You need medical attention.

457
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,720
Uncle.

458
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,400
What is going on?

459
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,840
Yu'er has been lying

460
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,880
so you wouldn't be worried.

461
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,760
Han Yue

462
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
hit her back during the fight.

463
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,560
Her heart meridian is damaged.

464
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,760
She needs immediate treatment,

465
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,360
or she might lose her life.

466
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,840
Guards.

467
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,720
Guards!

468
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Your Majesty.

469
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,440
Guards!

470
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,800
Guards!

471
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
What is it?

472
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:05,240
Yu'er needs medical attention.

473
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,760
Medical attention.

474
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,840
No.

475
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,520
Why not?

476
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,480
- Yu'er.
- With that injury,

477
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,920
you're not fit to be in charge
of the Yuzhen Hall.

478
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,320
I can't believe

479
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,520
you actually hate me so deeply.

480
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,600
Indeed.

481
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,120
You are just the same as Cheng Xi.

482
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,880
You can't tell right from wrong,

483
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,840
and served the evildoers.

484
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
You pledged your loyalty
to this puppet ruler.

485
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,720
Do you have any idea
how many innocent lives

486
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,120
he helped kill for Qiu Ziliang

487
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,560
during the Morning Dew Rebellion?

488
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,400
But fortunately,

489
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll take you

490
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,640
to my master.

491
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,320
You may ask him

492
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,120
if he has a way to save
your precious bodyguard.

493
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,760
Come with me.

494
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,120
No.

495
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,200
Yu'er.

496
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,160
Wait here.

497
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,200
I'll get you the medicine.

498
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,960
Don't go.

499
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
It's too risky.

500
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,360
It's too risky.

501
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,880
I don't need the medicine.

502
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,240
Fear not.

503
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,240
They won't take my life.

504
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,320
Don't go.

During the Late Emperor's coronation,

516
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,600
he held a banquet at the Hanyuan Hall.

517
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,760
He gave you this at that time.

518
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,680
Its name

519
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,040
is Sanchun.

520
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,280
When the Late Emperor's alive,

521
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,280
he gave up on luxuries,

522
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,840
and never neglected his duty.

523
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,880
He hoped to be a wise ruler.

524
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,080
But fate had other plans for him.

525
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,160
First,

526
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,920
Qiu Ziliang, the officer
he trusted the most, betrayed him.

527
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,920
Then, the brother he loved the most
stabbed him in the back.

528
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
He died with a grudge in his heart.

529
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,880
His dream of

530
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,680
"Gradual approach into Summer,

531
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,040
and rise in the Springtime"

532
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
had never come to fruition.

533
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,000
Before his passing,

534
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,440
he gave me a posthumous edict.

535
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,440
He ordered me to
send it to Official Wang.

536
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,960
He wanted Prince Guang
to have the throne.

537
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
But due to a battle,

538
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
the edict was lost.

539
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,000
You're a treacherous fool

540
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,880
who served that tyrant

541
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,800
took advantage of the opportunity.

542
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,800
Now,

543
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,240
write another edict.

544
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,520
Return the power you seized

545
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,680
via those despicable means

546
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
back to Prince Guang.

547
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,680
Don't you have any conscience?

548
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,640
Your birth mother
Noble Consort Wei died young.

549
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,520
Empress Xiao

550
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,000
took you in and raised you
as her own son!

551
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,200
The Late Emperor gave you
shelter and food.

552
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,400
He shared everything with you!

553
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,440
In the end,

554
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,280
you stabbed him in his back!

555
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,200
You worthless scoundrel!

556
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,600
You're a disgrace to the Qi family!

557
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,440
I'll say this again.

558
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,760
Are you writing the edict

559
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,040
or not?

560
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,560
Only in your dreams.

561
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,200
Only in my dreams?

562
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Write it,

563
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,400
or I'll kill Cheng Ruoyu now!

564
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,160
You said so yourself.

565
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,040
I had the resolve to take

566
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,120
my brother's life.

567
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,600
She is but a mere woman

568
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,040
who means nothing to me.

569
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,240
Kill her if you want.

570
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,880
You can have the edict

571
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,400
over my dead body.

572
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,120
You...

573
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,840
A kind reminder for you.

574
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,320
It took Prince Guang

575
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,360
a tremendous amount of effort

576
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
to save Cheng Ruoyu from dying.

577
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
If you want to humiliate me,

578
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,320
make sure you know

579
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
what your future Emperor

580
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,520
would think of you.

581
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
However,

582
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,880
don't bother killing her

583
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
with your own hands.

584
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Cheng Ruoyu suffered

585
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,400
great injury from her fight against you.

586
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,080
Without the medicine,

587
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
she will surely die.

588
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
What do you think

589
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
my uncle will think of you?

590
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,720
Get him out of my sight.

591
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,880
Yes.

592
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
Your Majesty.

593
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,160
Look closer.

594
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,960
Is it really her?

595
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,920
She looks like her.

596
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,040
The similarity is remarkable.

597
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,520
Are you sure?

598
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,280
Is she really Wang Ruoqing?

599
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm not sure if she was Ms. Wang,

600
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,080
but she looks exactly the same

601
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,880
as Madam Wang in her younger days.

602
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,920
There is no doubt about it now.

603
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,460
(Li's Residence)

604
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,740
(Li's Residence)

605
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,400
The Feimang Bow

606
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,160
are as agile as the Feifu Bow.

607
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,040
But they have more range.

608
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,320
The Trident Bow deal
the greatest damage,

609
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,000
but it requires a heavier draw weight.

610
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,280
Miss.

611
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,600
Madam Cheng wishes to see you.

612
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,520
(Daughter of Li Deyun, Li Zening)

613
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,560
(Daughter of Li Deyun, Li Zening)
Madam Cheng?

614
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,160
It's so cold.

615
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,840
Do not fall asleep.

616
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Do not fall asleep.

617
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,680
Yu'er.

618
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,160
Hang in there.

619
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Do not fall asleep.

620
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,880
Yes.

621
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
His Majesty is hurt!

622
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,720
Your Majesty.

623
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,360
How did you get injured?

624
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,040
Your Majesty.

625
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,040
How did it go?

626
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,679
How is Yu'er?

627
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,440
You're hurt.

628
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,159
Sorry.

629
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,719
I'm fine.

630
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
It's just a scratch.

631
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,040
Don't apologize.

632
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm fine.

633
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,400
Yu'er.

634
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,920
I'm sorry for this.

635
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,080
Don't feel sorry.

636
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,120
Your Majesty.

637
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,720
Everyone is destined to die.

638
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,040
I shall have no regret.

639
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,400
However,

640
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,000
Your Majesty was in danger
because of me.

641
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,960
Yet I have no way to get us out.

642
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm worried.

643
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,800
I have only been the Sword Bearer

644
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,880
for a short amount of time.

645
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,040
But Your Majesty had
chased me away so many times.

646
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,080
It's strange, though.

647
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
I used to

648
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,200
long for a life outside the palace.

649
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,240
But then,

650
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,480
I couldn't stop thinking
about coming back

651
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,880
to your side.

652
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,960
Although...

653
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,440
people have said

654
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,000
you were a villain,

655
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,000
I know for certain

656
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,320
you're a good person.

657
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
In the past,

658
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,560
I always watched behind you.

659
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,440
You were so lonely.

660
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,320
I wished I could walk over there
and tell you

661
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,720
that I'd be there for you.

662
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,160
I don't care

663
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,320
which side of you the people see.

664
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,840
In my heart,

665
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
you're the best.

666
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,280
In the past,

667
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,320
you frowned a lot.

668
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,520
I wish I could

669
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
flatten the frowns for you.

670
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,080
And now,

671
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,560
I finally make it.
