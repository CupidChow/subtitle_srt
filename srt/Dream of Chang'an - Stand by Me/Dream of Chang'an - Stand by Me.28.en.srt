00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,880
Madam,

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,040
it must've been tough on you.

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,400
Have some tea.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,560
No need for that.

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,880
Lady, thank you for your kind intention.

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,720
Don't be nervous.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
I'm not nervous.

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
Will you be able to feel it by doing so?

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,320
No.

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,080
If so, how do you know
if she's pregnant or not?

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,160
I'm trying to feel her fundus.

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,160
Usually, at this period,

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,200
when the fetus is pressing against it...

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,760
(Didn't you say
you'll be able to solve this?)

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,360
I'll be able to feel it

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
when I put pressure on the area
two or three fingers above

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,120
the pubic symphysis.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,760
(What should we do now?)

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
I deserve to die!

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,080
I deserve to die!

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
Why are they taking so long?

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,600
Your Majesty,

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,960
why don't I...

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,200
Are you done?

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Yes, I am done.

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,880
How was it?

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll report it to Official Qiu.

43
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,080
(I'm done for.)

44
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,280
Your Majesty, Official Qiu,

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,320
I found a growth the size of a longan

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,880
when I touched the lady's fundus.

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,880
According to my deduction,

48
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,320
she should be two and a half
months' pregnant.

49
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,560
Don't tell me this is true?

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,880
(What's going on?)

51
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,240
(Who is she?)

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,880
(Why is she lying to them?)

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,120
Someone!

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,680
Bring in the Life and Death Gongs!

55
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,883
(Death)

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,190

60

(Death)

61
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,360
Now,

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,160
I will give you one last chance.

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,040
Is Cheng Ruoyu

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,840
pregnant

65
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,720
or not?

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,720
If she's pregnant,

67
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,400
head to the Death Gong.

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
If she's not pregnant,

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
head to the Life Gong.

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,320
(I think Xiu is almost done by now.)

71
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,240
(I need to delay this
for another six hours.)

72
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,680
(Duke Chu's Residence)

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,520
Reporting in!

74
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,560
Hurry!

75
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,720
I have something important
to report to Eunuch Qiu!

76
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,120
Eunuch Qiu refuses
to entertain any guest today.

77
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,840
No!

78
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,680
This is a major matter!

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,840
I must see Eunuch Qiu!

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
No means no!

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,880
No!

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,000
Sir, your words
are the absolute truth!

83
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Sir, please show mercy!

84
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Sir, please show mercy!

85
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
(Death)
Sir, please show mercy!

86
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,040
Sir, please show mercy!

87
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,000
Sir, please show mercy!

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,240
Sir, please show mercy!

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,760
Physician Shen.

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Sir.

91
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,480
You've been serving me for many years.

92
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,320
I've always

93
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,240
believed in you.

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,920
Sir, you took great care
of me and my career.

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
That's why I was able
to rise through the ranks.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,880
People say that I have medical skills
without any medical ethics.

97
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm ashamed to face Deity Dong Feng.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,240
Now, I'm over 70 years old.

99
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,880
As the saying goes, at 70, I could
follow the dictates of my own heart.

100
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,920
But this time,

101
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,600
I need to follow my heart
without breaking the rules.

102
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,562
(Death)

103
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,440
Very good.

104
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,760
Seems like you guys
have made your decisions,

105
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,480
am I right?

106
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,400
If so,

107
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
execute them.

108
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,960
Sir, please show mercy!

109
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,720
(Life)
Sir, please show mercy!

110
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,200
Sir, please show mercy!

111
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,720
Sir, please show mercy!

112
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,003
(Death)

113
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,920
Don't move!

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
His Majesty hasn't summoned for us.

115
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,920
We mustn't act recklessly!

116
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,720
Sir!

117
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,160
Didn't you say that
we'll be able to stay alive

118
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,640
if we say that she's not pregnant?

119
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,200
Those who fear death

120
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,000
are the people who will betray you.

121
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,640
Do you think I'll believe in
people like them?

122
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,720
Bring their corpses
to the Imperial Institute of Medicine.

123
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,480
Let the newcomers

124
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,560
take a good look at them

125
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,640
so that they know
how to speak properly in the future.

126
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,080
Physician Shen,

127
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
you did great.

128
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,840
I was right

129
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,200
to trust you.

130
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,760
But do you understand

131
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,360
the true meaning of

132
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,240
following your heart
without breaking the rules?

133
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,000
I understand.

134
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,480
Great.

135
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
It's good that you understand it.

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,080
On account of your loyalty to me,

137
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,240
I'll leave you with a complete body.

138
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,840
Your family members won't be implicated.

139
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,480
Since it has proven that the Sword Bearer

140
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,000
is pregnant,

141
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,000
we should deal with her
according to the law.

142
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,320
Someone.

143
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,120
Your Majesty.

144
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,400
Sir.

145
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Prepare some Anshen Soup for her.

146
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,320
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,800
Duke Chu,

148
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,320
what do you mean by that?

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
She is a sinner.

150
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Your Majesty, she's not worthy enough

151
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,600
to bear your child.

152
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,460
(Duke Chu's Residence)

153
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,920
Will you be able to
bear the responsibility

154
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,160
if Eunuch Qiu were to blame someone

155
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,160
for the late military intel?

156
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,200
Save your breath!

157
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,960
If you dare to intrude,

158
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,120
we'll show you no mercy!

159
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,340
(Duke Chu's Residence)

160
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,140
(Duke Chu's Residence)

161
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,640
Your Majesty,

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,680
Sir,

163
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,400
the soup is ready.

164
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,400
Wait.

165
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
I am the one

166
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,000
who makes the call here.

167
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,440
Your Majesty, no one is above the law,
including you.

168
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,280
Don't tell me
you're trying to cover up for her?

169
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm doing it for the sake of my child.

170
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
(I just need four more hours.)

171
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,440
Let me do it.

172
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,440
Qiu Yanzhi.

173
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,880
Your Majesty, even if
Li Deyun and Han Ding

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,720
were able to return to your side,

175
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,480
even if the Jinwu Guards
were right outside the door,

176
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,560
don't forget,

177
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
the person closest to you

178
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,840
is me.

179
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
You gave me

180
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,280
the power to harm you.

181
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,800
Fine.

182
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,640
I'll go.

183
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
I'll feed it to her personally.

184
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,400
Good.

185
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,280
Your Majesty, you're
an affectionate person indeed.

186
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,440
It's no wonder

187
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,040
the Sword Bearer is loyal to you.

188
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,000
She chose you between

189
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,280
her aunt and you.

190
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,240
How could this be?

191
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,660
(Shi Residence)

192
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,380

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,760
Your Majesty?

194
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,080
Your Majesty,

195
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,640
how's the situation out there?

196
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,520
Everything has ended.

197
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,920
Did I pass the test?

198
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,080
This is great.

199
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,600
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

200
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,680
I feel much better.

201
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,200
That old physician

202
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,480
gave me some medicine just now.

203
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
I feel much better.

204
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,280
I would like to thank him

205
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160

Cheng Xi,

261
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,080
what else do you have
to say for yourself?

262
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,520
What a great act.

263
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,040

and it took me by surprise.

266
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,680
So, are you saying

267
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,160
that I've maligned you?

268
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,840
Sir,

269
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,680
since you're so paranoid,

270
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,280
why didn't you suspect

271
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,520
the person standing right beside you?

272
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,360
Madam Cheng,

273
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,200
seems like you're trying to
drag me down with you.

274
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,120
Since when have I offended you?

275
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,240
You offended me when
you colluded with Cheng Ruoyu

276
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,760
in order to frame me.

277
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Where's your proof?

278
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,280
I don't have any proof,

279
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
but I know you're the mastermind.

280
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,280
Qi Yan and Cheng Ruoyu

281
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,760
wouldn't be able to persuade
Physician Shen to join them.

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,880
Only you,

283

the person who's been hiding beside
Official Qiu all along,

284
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
can formulate

285
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,720
such a plan.

286
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,040
Father,

287
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,160

Speak.

291
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,040
According to our hidden sentry,

292
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,560
Zhenwu Army is on the move.

293
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,400
- You may leave.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,600
Cheng Xi,

295
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,400
how dare you try to find excuses?

296
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,640
Regarding

297
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,240
the three things that your niece
accused you of doing,

298
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,520
the traps set at Danfeng Gate,

299
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,800
the Zhenwu Army,

300
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
both of them are confirmed.

301
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,440
So,

302
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,240
that means you were the one

303
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,760
behind Prince An's illness, am I right?

304
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,440
Cheng Xi!

305
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,040
Father!

306
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,760
Just ignore me!

307
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,720
Kill her!

308
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,560
Don't do so.

309
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,600
Sir, I've always been loyal to you.

310
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
But I was maligned by this wretch.

311
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,640
I can only resort to this

312
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,040
in order to defend myself.

313
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Let her go,

314
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,640
and I may trust you for now.

315
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,880
Sir,

316
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
I'm afraid I can't do so.

317
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,520
Father!

318
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,160
Cheng Xi!

319
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,520
Father, just ignore me!

320
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,240
I'll give you another chance.

321
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,400
Let her go.

322
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
We can

323
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
talk this over.

324
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,760
Sir, it seems like you do love

325
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,600
this goddaughter of yours.

326
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,120
It's a pity that
you are wrong about her.

327
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,840
One day,

328
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,800
this wolf

329
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,880
in sheep's clothing

330
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,240

Cheng Xi.

332
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,560
Cheng Xi!

333
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,040
You won't be able to escape from me.

334
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,120
Let go of the Chess Overseer,

335
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,360
and I

336
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,520
may leave your body intact.

337
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,640
Never try, never know.

338
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,920
Leave.

339
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
Qiu Ziliang,

340
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,600
I didn't expect you to have a weakness.

341
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,160
Let her leave!

342
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Sir!

343
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,360
Sir!

344
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,640
What's the matter?

345
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,520
This is bad.

346
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,880
Central Commander Yuan brought his men

347
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,320
to bawl at Central Commander Shi
in front of his residence.

348
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,400
Both parties fought each other.

349
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,440
There are countless casualties.

350
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,440
When did this happen?

351
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
It happened four hours ago.

352
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,680
Four hours ago?

353
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,680
Why didn't anyone notify me about it?

354
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,360
Sir, I've sent several soldiers

355
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,120
to report this news to you.

356
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,720
But they were blocked by
the guards in front of the gate.

357
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,040
They said you were dealing with
something important

358
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,000
- and that you weren't seeing anyone.
- Sir!

359
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,000
Sir, I have bad news!

360
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,640
Sir!

361
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,800
Sir, I have bad news!

362
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,360
Central Commander Yuan
is seriously injured.

363
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,800
The four other
Central Command Assistant Generals

364
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,240
are dead as well.

365
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,920
Where's Shi Yuan?

366
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,400
Central Commander Shi is missing.

367
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,160
Sir, Central Commander Jiang
ordered me to seek you out.

368
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,160
His Majesty has arrived!

369
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,480
Prepare the carriage.

370
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,840
Sir,

372
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,120
where is the Chess Overseer?

373
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,840
Sir,

374
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,040
Central Commander Jiang
said this was an emergency.

375
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,560
He wanted you to head there
as soon as possible.

376
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,240
Your Majesty,

377
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,800
the Shencai Army Camp
is facing internal strife.

378
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,440
Your Majesty, please issue an edict
in order to quell the chaos.

379
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,440
Let us return to the palace!

380
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Official Li,

381
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,680
how are you doing?

382
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,400
Eunuch Qiu,

383
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
thanks to you,

384
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm doing well.

385
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,320
Turn!

386
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,740
(Duke Chu's Residence)

387
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,720
Huaizhi.

388
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
Let Prince Guang
enter the palace immediately.

390
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,600
Official Li.

392
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,200
Follow me.

394
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

395
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:14,980
(Duke Chu's Residence)

396
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Your bones were broken.

397
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
I hope my uncle will come up
with a solution.

398
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,760
It's fine, Your Majesty.

399
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,360
I can endure it.

400
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,840
Official Li,

401
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,640
how's the situation out there?

402
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,880
The Shencai Army is in shambles indeed.

403
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,120
All of Qiu Ziliang's
trusted aides are dead.

404
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,360
Jiang Ding is the only one left.

405
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,480
Your Majesty,
I've followed your instruction

406
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,480
and brought in the Zhaoyi Army

407
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,360
to bring the army camp under control.

408
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,560
The new general will
assume his post soon.

409
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,880
Now, the Shencai Army

410
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,760
is under our command.

411
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,920
Everything is just as
what Yanzhi predicted.

412
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,080
Your Majesty,

413
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
did you know about

414
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,800
the plan that Yanzhi and I
had come up with long ago?

415
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,840
Isn't it obvious?

416
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,000
If not, how could I

417
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
join in the act?

418
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,000
(Do you have a way to make the
Shencai Army turn against each other?)

419
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,720
I do.

420
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,800
But I need your cooperation.

421
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,320
You must stall Qiu Ziliang for me.

422
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,200
Make sure he stays in his residence

423
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,160
and deals with his problems.

424
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,120
Make it so that he has no time
to deal with the affairs outside.

425
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,920
What do you plan to do?

426
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
I require 12 hours

427
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
to proceed with my six-step plan.

428
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,360
First step,

429
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
Shi Yuan will hold a feast

430
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
for the generals within Shencai Army.

431
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,680
Official Shi, I hope
you will rise through the ranks

432
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,480
and enjoy a successful career.

433
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,400
Great!

434
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,320
- Great words!
- Come.

435
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
This is a joyous occasion!

436
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,280
- Let's drink!
- Please.

437
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,960
(Shencai Army's Commander, Shi Yuan)
Second step,

438
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:47,720
(Shencai Army's Commander, Shi Yuan)

439
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,280
Yuan Xing doesn't
get along with Shi Yuan,

440
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,680
therefore, he won't attend the feast.

441
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,920
We can intensify the animosity

442
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,120
between them using this opportunity.

443
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,640
(This is what you get
for not attending the feast.)

444
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
This is what you get
for not attending the feast.

445
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,960
Third step,

446
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,000
Yuan Xing will lead his soldiers

447
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
and cause a scene
in front of Shi Yuan's residence.

448
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,520
Fourth step,

449
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
Yuan Xing and Shi Yuan
will fight with each other.

450
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,240
Kill them!

451
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,920
How dare you hurt our General!

452
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,560
Brothers, attack!

453
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,600
Fifth step,

454
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,640
Shi Yuan will realise that
the middle-rank generals have been killed.

455
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,960
Sixth step,

456
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,520
Shi Yuan will become sober

457
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,440
and realise that
he has killed Yuan Xing by mistake.

458
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,200
And

459
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,280
he'll realise that some of his
trusted aides are dead as well.

460
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,680
Judging from his cowardly nature,

461
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,120
he will surely escape.

462
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,480
Even if he doesn't escape,

463
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,280
I will send my men
and force him to escape.

464
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,600
By doing so,

465
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,280
the Shencai Army

466
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,040
will fall into pieces.

467
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
Great plan.

468
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,840
But it is extremely risky as well.

469
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,760
If we make one wrong move,

470
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,960
we'll lose the entire game.

471
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,360
That's right.

472
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,400
The situation is unpredictable.

473
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,920
Just like Aunt

474
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,520
and Cui Niang.

475
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,000
I wonder

476
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,240
if Yanzhi will be in danger

477
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,320
after she was abducted by Aunt?

478
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,440
I'm afraid

479
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,760
she has expected that to happen as well.

480
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,440
Your Majesty,

481
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
are you saying

482
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,080
that Yanzhi let Aunt abduct her

483
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,280
on purpose?

484
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
The Chess Overseer was abducted.

485
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,640
The Chess of Generals Camp

486
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,560
will be in chaos for a moment.

487
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,160
That way,

488
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,680
it would make it easier for me

489
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,840
to take over

490
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,560
the Shencai Army.

491
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,240
And

492
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,040
it will require ten days at most.

493
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,760
Ten days?

494
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,760
What will happen after ten days?

495
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,840
I've ordered Han Ding

496
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,160
to escort Misha
back to Zhenwu personally.

497
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,920
After ten days,

498
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
both inner and outer threats

499
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,920
will cease to exist.

500
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,760
Congratulations,

501
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,160
Your Majesty.

502
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,120
It's too early for us to celebrate.

503
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,440
Qiu Ziliang

504
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,360
won't give up that easily.

505
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
He will surely retaliate.

506
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,760
I will keep an eye on him.

507
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,120
Stop the carriage.

508
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,720
(Liquan Pavilion)

509
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,440
(Liquan Pavilion)

510
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,380
(Baikong Temple)

511
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,280
So, this is where the Right Minister
lived in the past?

512
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
I thought

513
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,760
you're on the same side
with Cheng Ruoyu?

514
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,040
Didn't she tell you about this?

515
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
She did tell me.

516
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,920
But

517
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,560
you are the one who told her about it.

518
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,560
And I don't trust you.

519
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,120
You're just

520
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,680
as paranoid as Qiu Ziliang.

521
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,080
Is the Right Minister
truly your sibling?

522
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,520
You said you were
the descendant of Qi Hu.

523
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,360
What's your true name then?

524
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,600
You'll head to hell soon.

525
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,040
Stop asking questions.

526
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,120
I won't die here.

527
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,080
I'm useful to you.

528
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,120
How could you bear to let me die?

529
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,480
So,

530
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,920
did you let me capture you on purpose?

531
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,960
Of course.

532
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,000
If not, you would've been dead by now.

533
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,480
What exactly do you want?

534
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,160
I want the same thing as you.

535
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm a descendant of the Qi Family.

536
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,760
I'm a descendant of the royal lineage.

537
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,240
Who do you think you are?

538
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
The female emperor's surname isn't Qi,

539
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
but she still got her hands
on the Xing empire.

540
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,560
So, were you protecting

541
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,520
Qi Yan time and time again

542
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,080
because of that reason?

543
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,280
Yes.

544
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,120
Prince Guang is too weak.

545
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,960
Prince An is too foolish.

546
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,160
As for the other princes,

547
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,360
they're too ugly.

548
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,400
In the end,

549
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I think Qi Yan

550
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,080
is the most suitable candidate
to be my husband.

551
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
But Cheng Ruoyu
is the woman he fancies.

552
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,880
That's right.

553
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,080
That's why I've made a deal

554
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,360
with Cheng Ruoyu.

555
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,719
If I manage to protect Qi Yan,

556
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,920
she'll let Qi Yan take me
as his empress.

557
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
I don't believe in

558
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,639
any of your words.

559
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,719
Forget about it then.

560
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,040
Do you really think

561
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
that I won't kill you?

562
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,360
Since it has come to this,

563
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm your only protective amulet.

564
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,320
Without me,

565
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
you'll never be able to escape

566
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,400
the net Qiu Ziliang laid for you.

567
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,280
Actually,

568
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,960
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

569
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,280
You're the third person.

570
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,840
The third person?

571
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,440
Aren't you the one

572
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,520
who has been driving a wedge between

573
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,360
Qi Yan and Qiu Ziliang

574
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,600
and urged Han Yue

575
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,080
to stage a rebellion?

576
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,320
Am I right?

577
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,040
You're right.

578
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,920
It was me.

579
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,360
If that's the case,

580
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,920
do you think you can make a comeback

581
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,080
when it has come to this situation?

582
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,160
But I'm not alone.

583
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,320
Sir.

584
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,000
Did Shi Yuan

585
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,920
escape just like that?

586
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,240
Yes, sir.

587
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,760
Why didn't you escape with him then?

588
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,480
Sir,

589
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
I...

590
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,360
Firstly,

591
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,480
I couldn't stop

592
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,120
Official Yuan and Shi Yuan
from fighting each other.

593
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,160
Secondly,

594
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I wasn't alert enough.

595
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
That's why my comrades died.

596
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,760
Thirdly,

597
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,440
I couldn't stop Shi Yuan

598
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,320
when he tried to escape.

599
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,920
I've committed three heinous crimes.

600
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,480
I don't dare to escape from my crimes.

601
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,320
Sir, that's why I stay here.

602
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,280
I will wait for your punishment.

603
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
You're much more intelligent

604
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,360
than that fool Shi Yuan.

605
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,120
You may rise.

606
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,600
Thank you, sir.

607
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,520
Sir,

608
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,920
Li Deyun

609
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,800
has regained control of our army camp
with the help of the Zhaoyi Army.

610
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,520
What should we do now?

611
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,160
Cheng Xi,

612
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,480
the descendant of the royal lineage,

613
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,720
Yuan Xing,

614
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Shi Yuan,

615
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,480
what a great series
of devious stratagems.

616
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,000
Qi Yan,

617
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
Li Deyun,

618
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
Cheng Xi,

619
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
and Cheng Ruoyu.

620
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,280
Sir, what's the matter?

621
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,640
I'm fine.

622
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,560
I've been practising
my martial arts lately.

623
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,920
It's common for this to happen.

624
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,640
Congratulations, sir.

625
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,200
Your skills have reached the next level.

626
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,920
Do they think

627
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,120
they'll be safe

628
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,760
once they take over the army from me?

629
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,600
Qi Yan,

630
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,560
you've underestimated me.

631
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Right Minister,

632
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,120
you're finally here.

633
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,800
Thirteen?

634
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,640
Why are you here?

635
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,040
What?

636
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,240
Do you want me to release her?

637
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,720
All of my efforts went down the drain
because of her.

638
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,760
Not only are you not helping me,

639
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
but you're also trying to save her?

640
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,600
Do you want me to escape?

641
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,520
How?

642
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,920
Do you want me to imitate Han Yue?

643
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,080
He has been hiding outside
the pass for eight years!

644
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Do you want me to return
only when the timing is ripe?

645
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,880
I won't leave.

646
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
I was betrayed by Yu'er.

647
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,880
I was betrayed by my elder brother.

648
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,160
Now, even my biological brother

649
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,960
is forsaking me.

650
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,480
I've lost too much.

651
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,240
How could I give up like this?

652
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,680
I thought

653
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,040
the show between the niece and her aunt
was interesting enough.

654
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,360
I didn't expect

655
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,040
the show here
to be much more interesting

656
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,160
as the two siblings
turn against each other.

657
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,160
Are you guys sure

658
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,440
that you aren't just putting up a show
in front of me?

659
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,320
People of different aspirations

660
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,640
cannot get along.

661
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,160
From now on,
don't meddle with my affair.

662
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,080
This isn't the last straw for me.

663
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,880
I won't hand her over

664
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,160
to you.

665
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,400
So, you do not know martial arts at all?

666
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,680
Why do you save me?

667
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,960
I set up a trap
in order to frame Cheng Xi.

668
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,120
That means

669
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,440
I've put you in danger indirectly.

670
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,120
Aren't you angry with me?

671
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,540
(Angry)

672
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,900
(But I want you to win)

673
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,320
Do you know what will happen if I win?

674
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,280
Qiu Ziliang will have no control
over the military.

675
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,440
Qi Yan will become the true emperor.

676
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Even so,

677
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
are you willing to do it?

678
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
I've never...

679
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,508
(I've never coveted the throne.)

680
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,720
coveted the throne?

681
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,400
If so, what's your motive

682
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,840
for hiding within
the Chess of Generals Camp?

683
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,520
To get rid of the eunuch's faction?

684
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,600
This is the funniest joke

685
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,120
I've ever heard of.

686
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,060
(Just like Wang Yang)

687
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,360
Right Minister,

688
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,000
you're great at conquering
one's mind indeed.

689
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,086
(Angry, but I want you to win. I've
never coveted the throne.)

690
00:42:56,093 --> 00:42:57,479
(To get rid of the eunuch's faction
and stabilise the Xing empire.)

691
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,133
