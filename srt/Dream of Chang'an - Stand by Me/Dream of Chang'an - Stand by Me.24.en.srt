Your Majesty.

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,480
What brought you here?

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,440
I was summoned

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,680
to play some tunes
for the Grand Empress Dowager.

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
Her palace is in the other direction.

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,360
You are at the wrong place.

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,160
I have questions for Your Majesty.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,000
Have you considered

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
what I proposed the other day?

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
Miss Li,

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
how generous of you.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,960
I was moved by your action.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,280
However,

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,160
that was uncalled for.

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,280
Have you found

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
a better partner?

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
Is that why you rejected me?

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't understand what you mean.

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,480
It's Cheng Ruoyu,

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,600
right?

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,200
You think she is more loyal,

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,160
reliable,

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
and useful.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
Is that why you rejected me
without hesitation?

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,000
Not everyone shares
your view of the world.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
I don't judge a person

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,600
based on their usefulness to me.

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,840
Your Majesty, you are wrong.

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,360
Cheng Ruoyu is merely part of a scheme.

43
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
She always is.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,520
Her seemingly innocent look

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,560
has deceived you.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Silence.

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
This ends here.

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
We may still be friends.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,920
Haven't you noticed?

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
Ever since she came into your life,

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
nothing you do has ever

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
come to fruition.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you really think she and her aunt

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,560
are loyal to you?

55
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you have any idea

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,560
how Prince An came back?

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
It was Cheng Xi.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,640
Cheng Xi sold you out!

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
We found out

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Qiu Ziliang was hiding Prince An

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
in the residence

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,960
of Changle Parlor
in the east of Heng'an.

63
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,920
A neighbor confirmed

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
the person who sent him there

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,880
was Cheng Xi.

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,280
You could confront her about this.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,800
If she can betray you,

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
do you think her niece will be loyal?

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
About Cheng Xi's background,

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,959
where should we start?

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,920
Perhaps

72
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
I could ask around

73
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,520
in her hometown Puzhou.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,320
She told Cheng Ruoyu everything.

75
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,960
That means she left nothing
that can be traced back to her.

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,760
Rather than searching
at the wrong place,

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,720
we might as well use the shortcut.

78
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,600
A shortcut?

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
We could just ask the Right Minister.

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,800
(If you don't believe me,)

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,680
(you can confront Cheng Ruoyu.)

82
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,080
(See as she denies everything)

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,040
(and uses her fancy words)

84
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,000
(to fool you.)

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800

(My aunt made a grave mistake.)

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
(I shouldn't lie for her.)

106
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,800
(However...)

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
(Even if Cheng Xi betrayed me,)

108
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
(I would never be mad at you.)

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,680
(However,)

110
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
(if I can stop her in time)

111
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,520
(and make her give up her plot,)

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,320
(there may still be a chance.)

113
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,880
(I only ask that)

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,120
(you can be honest with me.)

115
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,920
Prince An knew nothing.

116
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,360
Is that so?

117
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
You told me

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
you need to confirm something.

119
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
What have you found?

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
I went to Yanzhi.

121
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,840
I asked her to help me locate

122
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,320
Princess Misha.

123
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
And?

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
She had no idea too.

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,520
So,

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,760
is there something else

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,520
you wish to tell me?

128
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,840
I...

129
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,080
(Yu'er,)

130
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
(be honest with me.)

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,560
(Tell me the truth.)

132
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,880
(I will forgive you.)

133
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,080
However,

135
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
I can't tell you just yet.

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,320
Why?

137
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
That's because...

138
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,080
In any case,

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,720
I must get to the bottom of it...

140
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
Dismiss.

141
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,280
I...

142
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
I want some time alone.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Yes.

144
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
I am leaving now.

145
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Right Minister.

146
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
I have three questions.

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
What is the cost for that?

148
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,620
(We trade with questions)

149
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,760
Very well.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
I'll go first.

151
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,320
Now my first question.

152
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
Is Cheng Xi

153
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
really your half-sister

154
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
from a different father?

155
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,160
Cheng Ruoyu

156
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,800
asked me to investigate your background.

157
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,160
But you once warned me

158
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
not to pursue the lead.

159
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
I thought

160
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
we've come to an agreement.

161
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,960
But now,

162
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,680
Cheng Xi surprised us all.

163
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,000
To save my own neck,

164
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,880
perhaps I could only...

165
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,260
(Classic of Poetry:
Eulogies of Shang; Mystic Birds)

166
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,880
Flesh-and-blood son?

167
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
Do you mean...

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,880
The family's wealth usually

169
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,920
goes to the younger brother
when there is no son as the heir.

170
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,760
But as long as there is a son,

171
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,360
the younger brother gets nothing.

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,160
You plan to replace
a flesh-and-blood son

173
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
as the Crown Prince.

174
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,080
Qiu Ziliang will never allow this.

175
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Uncle.

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,160
Has His Majesty finished his meal?

177
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
He didn't touch the food.

178
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm worried sick.

179
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,520
Yu'er.

180
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
I must ask you one thing

181
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,400
and you must be honest with me.

182
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
Did you do something to
upset His Majesty again?

183
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,560
- I...
- You know,

184
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,120
the way

185
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,800
His Majesty looked at me lately...

186
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,880
What do you mean?

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,400
He treated me as an eyesore.

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,920
I'll ask him.

189
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,560
Are you out of your mind?

190
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
His Majesty and Official Li

191
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,360
are discussing the matter

192
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,080
of appointing Prince An
as the Crown Prince.

193
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,640
We were ordered

194
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,560
not to interrupt the discussion.

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,680
Do as I say.

196
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
Anyway,

197
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,560
just keep my advice in mind.

198
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
While you're at work,

199
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360
be more sensible.

200
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,960
Don't upset His Majesty even more.

201
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Yes.

202
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,960
Official Li.

203
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,320
Official Li.

204
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,000
Huaizhi.

205
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm here.

206
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,360
Close the door.

207
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,320
Yes.

208
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,960
My second question is,

209
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,400
are you willing to help me

210
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,640
resolve the situation?

211
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,000
Very well.

212
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,160
Before we can save Qi Yan,

213
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,640
we shall join hands.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,680
Now,

215
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,240
I have one final question.

216
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,640
The true origin of Cheng Ruoyu.

217
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,040
Or the truth

218
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,040
about yours and
Cheng Xi's background.

219
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,960
You refuse to tell me.

220
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,320
Do I need to pay extra?

221
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
Or do you not trust me?

222
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,820
(Who are you?)

223
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
I thought you knew.

224
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Indeed.

225
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,960
I am Wang Ruoqing.

226
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,720
What about now?

227
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
Do I have enough leverage?

228
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,400
Do I

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
have your trust?

230
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,980
(The late emperor's...)

231
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,180
(Where is the late emperor's
posthumous edict?)

232
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,360
It was in my younger sister's shoe.

233
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
I was running for my life.

234
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,960
I didn't look for it.

235
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,240
So now,

236
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
I have no idea where it is.

237
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,400
(Trade the edict for my background)

238
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,060
(Trade the edict for my background)

239
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,480
If you don't believe me,

240
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,040
then forget it.

241
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Your Majesty.

242
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
It's time for your meal.

243
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,280
Leave.

244
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,640
You haven't eaten anything in a day.

245
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,520
Don't make me say this again.

246
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Leave.

247
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
I need to have a word with you.

248
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,840
I don't want to hear it.

249
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,600
I don't want to see you.

250
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,280
Leave!

251
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,080
I fell for your trick.

252
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
I don't understand.

253
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,080
I fell for your Beauty Trap.

254
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,680
Your Majesty.

255
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,520
Naive and frank.

256
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,160
Pure and innocent.

257
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,400
Brave and loyal.

258
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
You play hard to get.

259
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,360
They knew and sent me the woman

260
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,000
I'd like.

261
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,480
No, Your Majesty.

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,920
What happened to Prince An

263
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,720
was unexpected.

264
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,160
We have a solution.

265
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,440
- We could save him...
- Cheng Ruoyu!

266
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,120
Enough!

267
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
Your consolation and concerns,

268
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,560
as well as your motivating

269
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,520
and hopeful lies

270
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,600
won't work on me anymore.

271
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,960
Lies?

272
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,040
What else could they be?

273
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,280
Before

274
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,760
I become furious over your lies,

275
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,359
leave!

276
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,440
I'm not going anywhere.

277
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,240
When I met Prince An,

278
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,680
he said...

279
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
He said that

280
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,600
it was my aunt

281
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,920
who brought him to Qiu Ziliang.

282
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,640
However,

283
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
my aunt had her reason to do so.

284
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,560
She...

285
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,360
What?

286
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,160
Before you come clean,

287
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,600
your lies are worthless!

288
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,520
I have known

289
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,600
the truth.

290
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,640
Nothing you say can convince me.

291
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,640
I was trying very hard

292
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,480
to restrain myself.

293
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
But this time

294
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,000
I shall spare you

295
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
the last bit of mercy I have.

296
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,360
Leave!

297
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't want to see you again.

298
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,600
Huaizhi!

299
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

300
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,960
Come over here.

301
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,880
I...

302
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,800
Take your niece and leave.

303
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,400
You too.

304
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,880
From now on,

305
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
don't ever show up in front of me.

306
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,360
- Your Majesty.
- Yes.

307
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,840
He knew it.

308
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,080
Yes.

309
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,800
Why?

310
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,360
Why?

311
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
Why did His Majesty

312
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
chase me out?

313
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,840
He knew it.

314
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,440
What does he know?

315
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,840
What does he know?

316
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,440
Aunt

317
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
betrayed him.

318
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,920
Yes.

319
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,920
I handed over Prince An

320
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,720
to Qiu Ziliang.

321
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,600
I betrayed you.

322
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,160
Don't you know why I did it?

323
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
If you could make up your mind

324
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,840
to realize your goal,

325
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,400
I would do anything.

326
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
It's now or never.

327
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
Don't hesitate.

328
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,760
While Qi Yan and Qiu Ziliang are

329
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,200
still fighting each other,

330
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,320
we must set our plan into motion.

331
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,760
I have Liu Misha as my hostage!

332
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,880
What we are about to do,

333
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,120
is to form an alliance with Zhenwu

334
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
through Liu Misha.

335
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,640
During the appointment ceremony,

336
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,240
we'll launch the mutiny.

337
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,320
The empire of Qi family

338
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,240
will become ours.

339
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,519
♪Confessing to the moon
in the rustling wind back then♪

340
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,680
♪Like a boat being swallowed up
among the cities♪

341
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:11,000
♪Watching the flowers fall in unease,
worries and troubles fill my mind♪

342
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,440
♪Am I going to where I want♪

343
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,640
♪The road to Chang'an shrouded in mist♪

344
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,320
Leave!

345
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,360
If you plea for Li Deyun again,

346
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,840

00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,000
I ordered them to arrest Cheng Xi.

518
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,840
Yet...

519
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
They disobeyed you.

520
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,800
What they are doing is wrong.

521
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
The pawns shouldn't care about morality.

522
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
Obedience is all that matters to them.

523
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,200
They didn't help you

524
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,200
because you lack authority.

525
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,960
You failed to convince them.

526
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,920
For them,

527
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,000
His Majesty is an outsider.

528
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,520
Cheng Xi

529
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,040
is the teacher

530
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,160
who raised and trained them.

531
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,280
It's very apparent

532
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
whom they are closer to.

533
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,800
But what about you?

534
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,680
You didn't join your kins

535
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,680
but defend Qi Yan so blindly.

536
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,600
Yes,

537
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,600
Qi Yan saved your life.

538
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,560
But Cheng Xi spent years raising you.

539
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,600
She is your true family.

540
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
I think

541
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,440
a person

542
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,440
should know what's right from wrong,

543
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
regardless of kinship.

544
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,400
Treason

545
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,160
can never be right.

546
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,240
I want to stop my aunt
from making further mistakes.

547
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
I want her to stop and repent

548
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,560
before it's too late.

549
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,240
It's already too late.

550
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,240
Indeed.

551
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
I was too ignorant.

552
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,480
His Majesty knows.

553
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
My aunt

554
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,920
is never going to repent.

555
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
Consider yourself fortunate.

556
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,160
What?

557
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,240
You lost your parents,

558
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,120
and your childhood is a tragedy.

559
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,680
But you have no recollection
of those memories.

560
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,800
You were raised in the Violet Bureau

561
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,440
under protection.

562
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,280
You know nothing of
the people's suffering.

563
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,520
That is the reason why
you're frustrated

564
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,920
over a minor setback.

565
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,440
If you were Qi Yan, Cheng Xi,

566
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,360
or even me,

567
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,040
you would know

568
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,520
that there is

569
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,160
no perfect solution in this world.

570
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
You must take a path and see through it.

571
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,120
There is no right

572
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,280
or wrong.

573
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,160
There are only winners

574
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,560
and the defeated.

575
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,320
With victories,

576
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,040
all you do will be right.

577
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,880
When defeated,

578
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,880
nothing you do is ever right.

579
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,080
Take Qi Yan as an example.

580
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,320
If he can't win,

581
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,720
he can't realize his vision.

582
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,760
Based on his current achievements,

583
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,600
he's far from being a wise ruler.

584
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,400
Your protection for him

585
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
is meaningless.

586
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,120
What is meaningful, then?

587
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,040
Winning.

588
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,120
Winning in the quickest way possible.

589
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,800
Only by winning

590
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,480
can you have everything.

591
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,840
How do I win?

592
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Return to his side.

593
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,960
Help him appease
the chaos in Lucong.

594
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,680
He doesn't trust me anymore.

595
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,160
Do you know

596
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,240
who told him about Cheng Xi's doing?

597
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,960
Official Li?

598
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,000
It was his daughter,

599
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,640
Li Zening.

600
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,360
It's unfortunate of you

601
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,240
to have her as your rival.

602
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,600
There is no rivalry between us.

603
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
That's not how she sees it.

604
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,640
His Majesty

605
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,880
seems to think otherwise as well.

606
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,160
His Majesty and I do not share

607
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
such an intimate relationship.

608
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,440
Stop uttering

609
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,400
this nonsense,

610
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,320
or I'll leave.

611
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Fine.

612
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
With her as my rival,

613
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,480
I consider myself unfortunate.

614
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,000
I would rather

615
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,360
have you

616
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,880
by His Majesty's side and not her.

617
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,800
What are you trying to say?

618
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,120
What am I trying to say?

619
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,880
I want

620
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,120
to help you win his heart back.

621
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,040
Bring him a present.

622
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
He will surely forgive you.

623
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,640
What is it?

624
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,920
It's Liu Misha.

625
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,140
(Hanyuan Hall)

626
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,800
Anyone here?

627
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,080
I told you to leave.

628
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,160
Look, Your Majesty.

629
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,760
I left.

630
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,960
But I told you

631
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,240
never to come back again.

632
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,880
I never wanted to come back.

633
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,560
But there is one thing

634
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,360
I must inform you as soon as possible.

635
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,680
My aunt

636
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,080
only handed Prince An
over to Qiu Ziliang.

637
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,200
You finally admitted it.

638
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The secret is finally told.

639
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,040
Just Prince An alone.

640
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,880
Your Majesty.

641
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,000
What about Misha?

642
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,000
That's the point.

643
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,280
This is the problem.

644
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,480
She never told me

645
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,400
where Misha is.

646
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,360
You came to tell me

647
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
you weren't in cahoot with Cheng Xi?

648
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,960
Or did she abandon you

649
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
so you came back seeking refuge?

650
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,800
I mean,

651
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,560
I want to help you

652
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,440
rescue Misha.

653
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,640
Your Majesty.

654
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,200
Many have forgotten the oath they took

655
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,000
when they joined the Violet Bureau.

656
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,000
But I still remember it.

657
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,840
Spirits of Heaven and Earth.

658
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,520
Spirit of the swords.

659
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,960
My heart is like a sword,

660
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,600
suppressing the wicked
and eliminating evil.

661
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,320
My sword is like my heart,

662
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,720
protecting the nation
and being loyal to the emperor.

663
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,120
Cheng Xi assumed holding Misha hostage

664
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,080
would give her control
over the Zhenwu Army.

665
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,600
How naive of her.

666
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,840
Shall we wait and see how it ends?

667
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,680
Certainly not.

668
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,760
This is my game.

669
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,640
I can't let her

670
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,040
use my pawns.

671
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,120
Princess Misha

672
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,200
will fall under my control.
