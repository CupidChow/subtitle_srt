(the base of Chess of Generals Camp.)

Your Highness.

23
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
It's time for your medicine.

24
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,720
(Prince An.)

25
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
Please drink your medicine.

Scram!

27
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,160
Your Highness...

28
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
(Why would Prince An be here?)

29
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,960
Duke Chu will be angry
if you don't take your medicine!

30
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,600
You...

31
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,680
(Prince An, Qi Rong)
It hurts...

32
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,960
You must drink this medicine.

33
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,000
It hurts...

34
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,200
Drink the medicine if it hurts.

35
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
Otherwise, I won't be able

36
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,240
to explain this to Duke Chu
if he gets angry when he learns of this.

37
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
- Your Highness.
- It hurts...

38
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,600
Please drink the medicine.

39
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,560
Your Highness?

40
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,400
All right...

41
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,560
All right...

42
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,320
Your Highness...

43
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,200
Your Highness.

44
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
Rest well.

45
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,160
I'll get going.

46
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,760
It hurts!

47
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,160
(These criminals kidnapped Prince An)

48
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,400
(and brought him here.)

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
(I wonder what kind of poison
they gave him.)

50
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
(If I leave now)

51
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
(and call for help
before I come back here,)

52
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,480
(I'm afraid that it'll be too late.)

53
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,680
(No.)

54
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
(I have to take him with me.)

55
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,920
(But...)

56
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
(If His Majesty finds out
I caused trouble again,)

57
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,800
(not only will he kick me out,)

58
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,800
(but Aunt will be angry too.)

59
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,040
(No.)

60
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,440
(I must still take him away from here.)

61
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,440
Your Highness.

62
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,920
Your Highness!

63
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,400
Your Highness!

64
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,120
Save me...

65
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,160
I'll take you out of here.

66
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Be careful.

67
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,760
Hang in there.

68
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,720
Slowly.

69
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
So it was you.

70
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,560
You're bold.

71
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,240
How dare you kidnap and imprison

72
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,120
His Highness in the base
of Chess of Generals Camp.

73
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,520
You're the one

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
who is bold indeed.

75
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,526
I am just being chivalrous.

76
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,440
Well, then, heroine,

77
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
you are trapped here.

78
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,480
What is your next plan?

79
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Follow me.

80
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,840
Let's go.

81
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Be careful.

82
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,440
Yanzhi.

83
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
What is this place?

84
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
How much further?

85
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:16,873
Follow this secret passage,

86
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,960
and you'll be able to get out of here.

87
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,760
Your Highness.

88
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,640
However...

89
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Only one of you

90
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,080
can leave.

91
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
Why?

92
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,640
If both of you leave

93
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
I fail to fulfill my duty.

94
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,320
So...

95
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,640
Make a choice.

96
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
You may take Prince An with you

97
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
and prove your loyalty.

98
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,360
But it will be at the cost of my life,
the one who helped you.

99
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,919
Or you can repay the favor,

100
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
leave Prince An here,

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
and pretend that you were never here.

102
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
Nothing ever happened.

103
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:52,760
Yanzhi.

104
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
Let His Highness go.

105
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,320
I will stay.

106
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,240
I don't know

107
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
why you captured him.

108
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,120
But Prince An

109
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,200
is really sick.

110
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,640
Will that be all right?

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,760
Please...

112
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,520
No?

113
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
Just go.

114
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,960
But...

115
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Leave quickly...

116
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
before I change my mind.

117
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,360
What about you?

118
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,680
I will be fine.

119
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,280
Thank you.

120
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,760
Your Highness.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,680
Hurry.

122
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,600
Foolishly loyal!

123
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,520
Every one of them

124
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,880
behaves the same.

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,160
Congratulations.

126
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,560
After this,

127
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,640
Little Fish will surely

128
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,360
be grateful to you.

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
About what?

130
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,880
The fact that I sent her to hell?

131
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
You are so mean.

132
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,840
But I like it.

133
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,040
You are too free.

134
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,520
Did you find out what the poison
was on the needle?

135
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,840
I came to tell you about it.

136
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
Although I haven't found out

137
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,920
what the poison was yet,

138
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
I've found the source.

139
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,040
It is a silver needle for acupuncture.

140
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,760
However, it is slightly shorter

141
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,440
than regular acupuncture needles.

142
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,880
It is lighter as well.

143
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,400
It came from the palace,

144
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,280
specifically for the emperor's use only.

145
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
These needles
were incredibly hard to produce,

146
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
so only ten sets were made back then.

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
For the emperor's use only...

148
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Guess.

149
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
Who did it originally belong to?

150
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,680
Zheng Lu.

151
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,360
No fun.

152
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,840
You guessed it so easily.

153
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,360
It was made

154
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
when the late emperor fell ill.

155
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
Zheng Lu especially refined
these silver needles

156
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,720
to treat the late emperor.

157
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
In other words...

158
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,400
The culprit behind the assassination
of His Majesty at Cai's Wine Store...

159
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,760
is also...

160
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,920
a descendant of the Zheng family,
like Zheng Wu.

161
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,840
Yes.

162
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,440
No.

163
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
If I were a descendant
of the Zheng family,

164
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,520
I would not deliberately

165
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,680
use anything
that belonged to the Zheng family.

166
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,600
Especially not a silver needle
as unique as this.

167
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,800
You mean...

168
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
someone is trying
to frame the Zheng family?

169
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,600
Then someone might have

170
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,640
pretended to be Zheng Wu as well.

171
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,040
I will grant you your wish.

172
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
No.

173
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,360
The look of intense hatred in her eyes

174
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,640
could not have been faked.

175
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,200
Yu'er,

176
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,640
what exactly is going on?

177
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,480
Aunt,

178
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I was being followed.

179
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,360
But I was smart.

180
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,920
I counter-followed him

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,160
all the way to the old residence
of Wang Yang instead.

182
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,880
What?

183
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,360
Where did you go?

184
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,320
The old residence of Wang Yang, Aunt.

185
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,400
Have you forgotten about Wang Yang?

186
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,720
He's the chancellor
of the previous dynasty.

187
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,760
The one who rebelled with Zheng Lu

188
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,320
and had their entire clan
and assets seized.

189
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,120
Aunt...

190
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,640
What's the matter?

191
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,240
Yu'er,

192
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,080
carry on.

193
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,880
What happened after that?

194
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,080
Then I discovered

195
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,280
a huge square

196
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,120
and saw Prince An in the backyard.

197
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,040
Prince An was administered

198
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
with some sort of poison.

199
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
He was on the verge of death.

200
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,760
Oh! Also,

201
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,760
I even came across

202
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,800
a masked man in black.

203
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,160
So I shot him with a dart.

204
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,320
Then...

205
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,627
And then what happened?

206
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,600
Hurry up and tell us.

207
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,960
(Qiu Yanzhi released me.)

208
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,320
(I can't betray her.)

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,200
(If I let the cat out of the bag,)

210
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,200
(she'll be punished by Qiu Ziliang.)

211
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,080
Then

212
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,160
Prince An

213
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,600
begged me to save him.

214
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,640
So I escaped together with him.

215
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,440
You found the Chess of Generals Camp?

216
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:41,288
Aunt,

217
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,800
you knew in the first place?

218
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
I didn't tell you about it
all this while

219
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,480
because I fear you would
inadvertently alert the enemy.

220
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Moreover, that place
is extremely perilous.

221
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,000
I can't believe you came back
safe and sound.

222
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,000
You even escaped

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
together with Prince An.

224
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,600
Could it be a trap?

225
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,680
Aunt,

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm in the wrong.

227
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,280
I committed a huge mistake.

228
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,200
Madam,

229
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,440
what has happened has happened.

230
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,880
We should focus on finding a solution.

231
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
That's right, Aunt.

232
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,960
Please hurry up and save Prince An.

233
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,720
He...

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,080
is the only one...

235
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
who can save Prince An now.

236
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,000
(Bodyguard of Prince Guang, Yuan Du)

237
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,840
Help carry His Highness inside.

238
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,640
Yes, Madam.

239
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,000
Be careful.

240
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,280
Your Highness.

241
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,870
(Prince Guang, Qi Chen)

242
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,880
Savior.

243
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,360
It's you?

244
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,840
Yu'er?

245
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,680
Get me the medicine box.

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,560
Aunt...

247
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,680
Both of you, as you were.

248
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,240
I've brought huge trouble

249
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,760
to Your Highness

250
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
by bringing Prince An here.

251
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm at fault.

252
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't deserve to get up.

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Prince Guang...

254
00:16:58,491 --> 00:16:59,400
Saving my own nephew

255
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,320
is not a trouble at all.

256
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,800
Madam Cheng,

257
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,840
get up right away.

258
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,599
You get up, too.

259
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,000
So you are Prince Guang...

260
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
I can't believe you still remember me

261
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
after all this time.

262
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,760
Of course.

263
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,359
I would've died

264
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,560
if it weren't for you.

265
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,800
And I wouldn't be able
to see Aunt anymore.

266
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,400
These are your fateful ties
with Madam Cheng.

267
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,000
As long as the ties aren't broken,

268
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,400
you'll be safe and well.

269
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,040
Similarly,

270
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,240
there are ties between
Prince An and me, too.

271
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,860
(Cheng Xi and Prince An
have sought out Prince Guang for help.)

272
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:04,874
(Prince Guang is helping them.)

273
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,240
Sir,

274
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
this is a letter from Prince Guang.

275
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,620
(Letter from Qi Chen)

276
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,640
Summon Yanzhi.

277
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,360
Yes, sir.

278
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,720
The pigeon is plump.

279
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,880
It's time to make a soup out of it.

280
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,840
When I handed
the Chess of Generals Camp over to you,

281
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,600
I told you about three things.

282
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,760
Do you still remember?

283
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,760
Yes.

284
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
Firstly, to not harm princes.

285
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,680
Secondly, to not harm our allies.

286
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,720
Thirdly, to not harm Prince Guang.

287
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,960
Father, are you upset

288
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
because Prince Guang
got involved in this matter?

289
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,750
(I hope you understand, Qi Chen)

290
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,000
I released Cheng Ruoyu

291
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,520
because I wanted to see

292
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,040
how Cheng Xi would handle this matter.

293
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
If she brought him to Qi Yan,

294
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
it implied that Qi Yan

295
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,720
was indeed disloyal to you.

296
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,360
If she hid him from us,

297
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,520
then we could get to the bottom
of the matter by following the clues...

298
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,360
But unexpectedly, they brought him

299
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
to Prince Guang's residence.

300
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,680
And Prince Guang

301
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,120
wrote a letter to me directly,

302
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,080
requesting to keep him.

303
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,680
Not harming princes is because
we fear our resources are limited.

304
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,720
Not harming our allies is because we
fear a third party will be benefited.

305
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,040
But I don't understand

306
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,480
why it is that
we can't harm Prince Guang.

307
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,720
Do you really not know

308
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
why I spared his life?

309
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,040
I am slow-witted.

310
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,520
"I heard recently that

311
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,320
there's a boulder in Taiwu Mountain.

312
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,840
It weighs around ten thousand jin.

313
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
It has a dragon-like pattern.

314
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,200
Such an auspicious sign from the sky

315
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,560
implies that Your Majesty is wise."

316
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
"It gave me a shock

317
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,760
hearing that the military commissioner
in Lucong has passed away."

318
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,280
When was it?

319
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,760
The 21st of last month.

320
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,640
Draft a decree.

321
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,920
Order Shi Yu to send someone

322
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
to Lucong to pay respects.

323
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,000
Send my regards to Madam Ninghe.

324
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,040
If she has any requests,

325
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,360
I'll agree to all of them.

326
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

327
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,240
Your Majesty.

328
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,560
In the report, His Highness
Prince Guang said

329
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,040
that His Highness Prince An
has been poisoned by a strange poison

330
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,440
and was sent to his place for treatment.

331
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,960
Is that so?

332
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,800
Then... I must go and visit him.

333
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
The late emperor and I knew each other
before we occupied important positions.

334
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,720
When I was still cleaning dogs
and feeding eagles in the five halls

335
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,600
and living miserably,

336
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,560
the late emperor,
who was only a prince back then

337
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,280
recognized my talent

338
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,920
and made me his personal guard.

339
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,280
Later on,

340
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,160
to deal with the eunuch Wang Shouchen,

341
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,840
I spared no effort in my duty

342
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,000
and fulfilled the late emperor's wishes.

343
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,240
However,

344
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,720
my great achievements
made him feel uneasy.

345
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,400
My great achievements made him insecure.

346
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,720
The late emperor's ambitions grew,
as did his greed...

347
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
And as he did...

348
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,160
he grew distant and neglected me...

349
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,920
In the end, he even wanted...

350
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,200
to use the Morning Dew Incident
to get rid of me...

351
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
But the late emperor

352
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,480
took me too lightly.

353
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,680
Didn't he?

354
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,640
When he saw that his plan
had been exposed,

355
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,760
he immediately wrote
a secret imperial edict,

356
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,960
passed the throne to Prince Guang,

357
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
and commanded his confidant Han Yue
to take it out of the palace.

358
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,960
But he was wrong.

359
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
He was wrong.

360
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,720
Why would I kill him?

361
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,280
I wanted him to live! Live well!

362
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,840
And suffer...

363
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,280
the consequences of his disobedience.

364
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,640
So...

365
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,160
You let the late emperor live

366
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,360
until the beginning of this year.

367
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,800
Yes.

368
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,880
Later on, I ordered him to change
his posthumous edict

369
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,760
and pass the throne to Qi Yan.

370
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,560
He became anxious,

371
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,840
and he committed suicide.

372
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,560
He couldn't endure it.

373
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,000
Where is the posthumous edict

374
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,240
declaring the throne
to Prince Guang then?

375
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,960
Who knows?

376
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,760
It's precisely because

377
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
we can't publicly
search for the posthumous edict

378
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,480
that I established
the Chess of Generals Camp.

379
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Doesn't Prince Guang deserve
to die all the more then?

380
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,680
If the posthumous edict falls
into his hands...

381
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
You

382
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,400
are still bad at playing chess.

383
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,280
Regional governors,
provincial military commissioners,

384
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,240
and some officials

385
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,640
have been waiting for a chance
to cause trouble all these years.

386
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
Even if I control

387
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
the Central Shencai Army,

388
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,560
and if they collaborate together,

389
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,680
the situation would be dismal.

390
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,480
That's why

391
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,000
we're letting Prince Guang live

392
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,280
and holding him tightly in our hands

393
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,440
to prevent them from rebelling
after finding the posthumous edict

394
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,160
in the name of restoring legitimacy.

395
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,240
And keeping Prince Guang alive

396
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,960
will allow us to restrain Qi Yan.

397
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,520
You finally get it.

398
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,600
Cheng Xi must know that.

399
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,920
That was why she brought
Prince An there.

400
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,640
The long line you cast
to catch a big fish

401
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,080
was used by others instead.

402
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
I know my mistake.

403
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm willing to be punished.

404
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,320
Your Majesty.

405
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,720
Yu'er.

406
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

407
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,960
Uncle.

408
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Where's Qi Rong?

409
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,000
Your Majesty.

410
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,560
Please come inside.

411
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,480
Thank you for your help

412
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,760
in saving Qi Rong.

413
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,800
If Your Majesty wants to thank someone,

414
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,000
thank Cheng Ruoyu.

415
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,760
She was the one

416
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,400
who saved Qi Rong
from the Chess of Generals Camp.

417
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,360
Forgive us, Your Majesty.

418
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,200
Yu'er, kneel down.

419
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,800
Apologize to His Majesty.

420
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,480
But I didn't do anything wrong...

421
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,400
Your Majesty, don't worry.

422
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,040
I've already written
a letter to Duke Chu

423
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
to inform him about the offense.

424
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,520
I don't think he'll hold
anyone accountable for this.

425
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,160
On the surface, he won't.

426
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,160
But in private, he does a lot of things.

427
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,800
Wasn't he the one

428
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,080
who injured you?

429
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,920
I was wrong.

430
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,920
You changed your statement quite fast.

431
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,040
It was right for me to save people,

432
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,080
but I didn't expect

433
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
to bring so much trouble

434
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,280
to Prince Guang.

435
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,040
My injury is fine now.

436
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,320
I'll pay attention to my recovery.

437
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,560
Your Majesty.

438
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,960
Please let them rise.

439
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,360
Cheng Xi.

440
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,720
Leave with your niece.

441
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,040
Yu'er.

443
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,480
Your Majesty.

444
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,840
Yu'er is a simple child.

445
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm afraid she won't understand

446
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
your kind intentions.

447
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,480
I don't have any kind intentions
towards her.

448
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,080
Your words are harsh,
but your heart is kind.

449
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,360
Your Majesty obviously

450
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,720
wants her to be disassociated

451
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,200
with this matter as soon as possible.

452
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,080
I'm useless.

453
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,360
I couldn't protect Qi Rong well.

454
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,840
Instead, I had to rely on you.

455
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,680
Seeing you in such
a dangerous situation,

456
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,000
I can't help you either.

457
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200
Your Majesty is making me feel ashamed.

458
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,760
I see you being restrained by others.

459
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,680
Yet I can't do anything.

460
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
If the late emperor
is watching from above,

461
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,000
he would surely blame me.

462
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,840
My brother wouldn't bear to blame you.

463
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,560
He wanted to pass the throne

464
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,320
to you.

465
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,920
I shouldn't have said that.

466
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,680
Your Majesty.

467
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
When the late emperor fell severely ill,

468
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,240
I had already moved to the mountains
to live in seclusion.

469
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,880
It's impossible for the late emperor

470
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
to pass the throne to someone like me.

471
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,520
Everyone says
that there is a posthumous edict,

472
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,760
but no one has ever seen it.

473
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,880
Qiu Ziliang is very well-informed.

474
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
Yet he wasn't able to find it either,
didn't he?

475
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,520
So the fact

476
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,560
is that there is no posthumous edict.

477
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,960
If you're at odds with me

478
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,560
because of this matter,

479
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,800
then you've really fallen
into the villain's plan.

480
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
You're right, Uncle.

481
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,640
I was being petty.

482
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
You're magnanimous and kind.

483
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:52,767
You live up to the name
Prince Guang indeed.

484
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm ashamed.

485
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,480
Your Majesty is injured?

486
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,960
Let me have a look.

487
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,560
Why was it handled so carelessly?

488
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,600
It's fine.

489
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,200
It's just a minor injury.

490
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,640
It was from a dart

491
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,520
around three inches.

492
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,840
There was no cutting edge,

493
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,160
but the thrower is skilled
in martial arts

494
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
and is very strong.

495
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,120
That's why while the wound
appears smooth on the surface,

496
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,920
the actual wound is deep.

497
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,960
You could tell even from this?

498
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,600
You're incredible indeed.

499
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,680
A girl did it.

500
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
And I can tell

501
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,480
that you didn't want to fight with her.

502
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,560
Otherwise, given your skills,

503
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,880
you could have captured her.

504
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,400
Or maybe you were afraid of hurting her,

505
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,920
so you left in a hurry.

506
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,480
That was why you got hurt.

507
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,640
I wasn't afraid of hurting her.

508
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,120
I was worried

509
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,440
about making a fuss back then.

510
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,200
It happened when you
were trying to save Qi Rong?

511
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,520
That person...

512
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,080
was Cheng Ruoyu?

513
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,600
You're prophetic indeed, Uncle.

514
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,240
Yu'er said she encountered
a skilled martial arts practitioner

515
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,880
clad in black and a mask

516
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,240
when she tried to save Qi Rong.

517
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,024
She even shot him with a dart.

518
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,120
I didn't expect it to be you.

519
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,600
Cheng Xi

520
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,800
has been managing the Violet Bureau
for so many years.

521
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,320
Yet she raised such a nuisance.

522
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,840
How disappointing.

523
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
That's not true.

524
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,200
Uncle.

525
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,840
Why are you grinning?

526
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
Yu'er has great martial arts skills.

527
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,840
Even harder to come by

528
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,960
is her chivalrous heart.

529
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,720
She also

530
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,600
has a lot of guts.

531
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,920
And she's not afraid to die.

532
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,440
I don't dare

533
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,240
to use someone like her.

534
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,040
But only someone like her

535
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,960
will take a sword

536
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,200
and die for you

537
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,120
in your time of need.

538
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,680
What does it say?

539
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
Among the three women missing
from the Violet Bureau,

540
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,760
three of them

541
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,960
appeared briefly

542
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
at Cai's Wine Store.

543
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Is the message reliable?

544
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,920
Don't forget,

545
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,000
not only are these women smart,

546
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,360
they're also beautiful.

547
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,840
And beautiful women

548
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
make quite an impression.

549
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,360
"Someone named Madam Jade

550
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,440
appeared in Cai's Wine Store
on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival

551
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
in the 10th year of Tai'an...

552
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,040
A local hooligan came on to her.

553
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
She wouldn't give in,

554
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,960
and her throat was slit."

555
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,960
Her throat was slit?

556
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,960
"Three days after the hooligan went home,

557
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,320
he accidentally fell
into the water and died."

558
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,200
That leaves quite an impression indeed.

559
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,640
What are we waiting for then?

560
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,560
Arrest her.

561
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Yes, ma'am.

562
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,720
What... What are you doing?

563
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,120
Let go of me!

564
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,880
Mrs. Cai!

565
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,840
Yu'er!

566
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,520
What are you doing?

567
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Why are you arresting her?

568
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,320
Someone reported this wine store

569
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,080
for not paying the liquor tax.

570
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,320
We were instructed

571
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,240
to investigate the place.

572
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,199
I'm being falsely accused.

573
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,239
That's a false accusation.

574
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,360
What's the matter?

575
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,280
Little Fish, you're here too?

576
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,040
You...

577
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,760
Take her away.

578
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,920
- Let go of me!
- Come on.

579
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,560
Mrs. Cai.

580
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,600
Let me go!

581
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm being falsely accused!

582
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,719
Let me go!

583
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,760
Add another charge.

584
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,000
For selling fake wine!

585
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,920
See you, Little Fish.

586
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,239
(I have to go back and inform Madam Li.)

587
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,040
I have urgent matters

588
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,440
to discuss with Madam Cheng
from the Violet Bureau.

589
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,360
Without a command token,

590
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,360
you can't go in and out of the palace.

591
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,040
Go away.

592
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,640
(You're forcing me)

593
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,440
(to sneak in.)

594
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,880
(Yu'er has great martial arts skills.)

595
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,640
(Even harder to come by)

596
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,560
(is her chivalrous heart.)

597
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,320
(But only someone like that)

598
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,960
(will take a sword)

599
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,560
(and die for you)

600
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
(in your time of need.)

601
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,320
It's you again, Cheng Ruoyu.

602
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,520
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

603
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,950
(Violet Bureau)

604
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,600
Madam.

605
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,960
I just received a secret report.

606
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,160
The Chess of Generals Camp

607
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,840
arrested Madam Cai.

608
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,960
When I sent Yu'er there that day,

609
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,280
I've already decided

610
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,120
to completely give that place up.

611
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,680
Didn't she say

612
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,360
that she cleaned up everything already?

613
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,640
I'm worried about Madam Cai.

614
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,600
An untrained woman

615
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,280
might let it slip when she can't handle
the torture anymore.

616
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,080
What can she let slip?

617
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Back then, Madam Jade and the others

618
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,600
lived in the wine store for some time.

619
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
A hooligan even came on to Madam Jade.

620
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,160
Even if that was already
eight years ago,

621
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,920
and we also killed

622
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,960
that hooligan,

623
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,960
what if someone

624
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,280
intentionally investigates that?

625
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,720
It has been three years
since your brother passed away.

626
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,960
Yes.

627
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,600
What if...

628
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,720
she stays virtuous till the end

629
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,560
and follows her husband?

630
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,360
Yes, Madam.

631
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,520
(She's here to see Cheng Xi.)

632
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,360
By the way,

633
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,840
is that done?

634
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,480
Not quite.

635
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,960
It will be done in three days.

636
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
One sword in eight years.

637
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,960
I wonder if it will turn out fine.

638
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,040
And when can it be put to use?

639
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,720
900 people were repeatedly tempering it.

640
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,960
Only 300 are left.

641
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,720
Each of them is worth ten men.

642
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,280
That's not enough.

643
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,680
They should be

644
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,800
like Madam Gongsun back then.

645
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,280
Aunt, it's me!

646
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,480
It hurts.

647
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,080
Look at you.

648
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,280
You're so rash.

649
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,000
If you made a sound one second later,

650
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,200
you would have been dead.

651
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,680
I was anxious.

652
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,680
Mrs. Cai...

653
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,520
I know about it already.

654
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
You know already?

655
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,080
Let's figure something out then

656
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,800
to save her.

657
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,160
You said someone else was here earlier?

658
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,840
But I don't know who he is.

659
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,120
What did you hear?

660
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
What did I hear?

661
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,800
I couldn't hear clearly.

662
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,400
Really?

663
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,760
We could hear both of you talking,

664
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,560
but we were far away.

665
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,760
So we couldn't
make out the words at all.

666
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,360
Yu'er, think about it again.

667
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Did the person who followed you

668
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
have any distinct features?

669
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,040
He had a unique scent on him.

670
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,200
Could it be him?

671
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,800
Who?

672
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,840
The masked man who fought with me

673
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
in the Zheng Residence

674
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,480
and in the Chess of Generals Camp.

675
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,170
(Violet Bureau)

676
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,920
(One sword in eight years.)

677
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,680
(I wonder if it will turn out fine.)

678
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,280
(And when can it be put to use?)

679
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,440
(900 people
were repeatedly tempering it.)

680
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,680
(Only 300 are left.)

681
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,280
(Each of them is worth ten men.)

682
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,320
36 people.

683
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Cheng Xi.

684
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,840
You're untrustworthy indeed.

685
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,470
(Yuzhen Hall)

686
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,650
(Yuzhen Hall)

687
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,850
(Yuzhen Hall)

688
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,080
We haven't even gotten anything

689
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,840
from Mrs. Cai,

690
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,560
yet someone immediately came

691
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,760
to kill her.

692
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,400
Could it be Cheng Xi?

693
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,800
Let's analyze it again.

694
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
There were supposed to be 1,000 people
in the Violet Bureau.

695
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,600
In the past few years,

696
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,800
900 people quietly went missing.

697
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,720
Aside from Cheng Ruoyu,

698
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,320
who doesn't have a calculating nature,

699
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,360
the rest who are left are useless.

700
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,360
But there are 300 people in Yuzhen Hall.

701
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,320
Second.

702
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,720
The expenses for His Majesty's
night fox hunt are too high.

703
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,000
It's way over what's needed.

704
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,600
Supporting warriors of sacrifice
requires a lot of money.

705
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,640
Third.

706
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
Someone from Yuzhen Hall

707
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,320
pretended to be a government office
worker and killed Mrs. Cai.

708
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,360
And her martial arts skill

709
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,200
is very similar to Cheng Ruoyu's.

710
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,960
So...

711
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,160
The palace maids missing
from the Violet Bureau

712
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,680
actually went to Yuzhen Hall.

713
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,600
His Majesty kicked Cheng Ruoyu
out of the palace

714
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,360
to the wine store

715
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,720
to let her be in the dark
instead of being out in the open.

716
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,840
And when we found out about Mrs. Cai,

717
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,280
Cheng Xi was afraid
that the secret would be revealed,

718
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
so she killed her.

719
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:17,080
Wait.

720
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,000
What are we waiting for?

721
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,560
Let's gather people

722
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,600
and search Yuzhen Hall.

723
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,720
Do you think we can find anything

724
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,080
by bringing people

725
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,520
to search Yuzhen Hall now?

726
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,000
If Cheng Xi can hide 300 people

727
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,560
in Heng'an City

728
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,680
right under Godfather's nose,

729
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,520
she must be prepared.

730
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,200
What are you planning to do then?

731
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,960
Do you still remember

732
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,960
who led us into discovering all of this?

733
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,120
You're referring

734
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,840
to the mastermind behind Zheng Wu?

735
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,840
He used Zheng Wu

736
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,880
to let us suspect
the Violet Bureau first,

737
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,280
then made an assassination attempt
against His Majesty at the wine store

738
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,240
to get Cai's Wine Store

739
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,480
and Yuzhen Hall involved.

740
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,360
If we make a move rashly,

741
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,120
we'll surely end up

742
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,760
letting a third party benefit

743
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
from the entire debacle.

744
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,000
That's why

745
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,920
we must find a way

746
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,840
to lure this third party out

747
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,440
as well.

748
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,760
How?

749
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,720
He wanted to use us

750
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,080
to deal with the Violet Bureau.

751
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,160
Let's go the other way then.

752
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,000
We'll use the Violet Bureau

753
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,760
to lure him out.

754
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
It's time

755
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,560
for Little Fish to make a move.
