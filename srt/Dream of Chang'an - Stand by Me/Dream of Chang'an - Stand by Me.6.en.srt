15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
Why are you here?

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,800
Where did you take Aunt Cai?

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,800
What do you want

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,440
before you can let her go?

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
Mrs. Cai is dead.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
What?

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,720
You...

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,080
After she was taken to prison,

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,720
she died unexpectedly
in the middle of the night.

24
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,720
Why did you kill her?

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
I hadn't gotten the answers I wanted.

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,760
Why would I let her die?

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
What exactly happened?

28
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,560
What is your motive?

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
I want answers to these three questions.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,920
First,

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,800
why did His Majesty visit
Cai's Wine Store?

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,880
Second,

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
why did the assassins

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,080
decide to take action here twice?

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Third,

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,800
who is the man

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
that killed the assassins?

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,200
You witnessed

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,760
all of the assassinations in person.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
Don't you want to know the answers?

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Tell me how did Aunt Cai die.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,480
She was poisoned.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,720
Who did that?

44
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,600
(Yuzhen Hall)

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,200
What is this?

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
The person who killed Mrs. Cai

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,240
is hiding in that place.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,440
Why are you

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,720
telling me

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
such an important piece of information?

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
You owe me a favor.

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,960
Now,

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,880
it's time to pay it back.

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,640
Find the assassins.

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
They must be related

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
(Yuzhen Hall)
to Guan Wu's case.

Your Majesty.

62
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,960
Your archery has improved.

64
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,920
Really?

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,520
But I think

66
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
my skill is stagnating.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
I summoned you here today

68
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,080
in hopes that you can

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
help me improve.

70
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
Shooting dead items

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
is too easy

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
for Your Majesty now.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,440
Why not replace your targets
with living things?

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,120
Living things?

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,560
What living things?

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,160
Make the death row prisoners run
holding an arrow target.

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,880
What do you think, Your Majesty?

78
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,360
That sounds like a good idea.

79
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,960
However,

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,520
most of the death row prisoners

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,480
do not know martial arts.

82
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,440
Why don't we replace them

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
with the people
from the Violet Bureau?

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,080
While I practice archery,

85
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,680
the people from Violet Bureau
can practice their martial arts too.

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
That's killing two birds with one stone.

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,600
Are you reluctant?

89
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
The 36 maids have undergone training
for many years.

90
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,040
It was not an easy task.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,880
If they can't even dodge

92
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,720
my arrows,

93
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
and are so mediocre,

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,200
they might as well die.

95
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
Issue an edict.

96
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,480
From tomorrow on,

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,080
all members of Violet Bureau
will join my practice.

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes, Your Majesty...

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Madam,

100
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,200
is it true

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
that His Majesty wants us
to be his practice targets

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,080
and practice archery with him?

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,880
His Majesty is suspecting us.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,400
His Majesty was the masked man

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
who was following Yu'er

106
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
yesterday night.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,480
How is that possible?

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
The masked man
went to the Zheng Residence,

109
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,840
and also the Chess of Generals Camp.

110
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,880
It's not entirely impossible.

111
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
He must have heard

112
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
our conversation

113
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
and grew suspicious.

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,800
Now, he's trying to test us.

115
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
What should we do now?

116
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,840
We can sacrifice 36 people.

117
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,880
But the 300 people at Yuzhen Hall,

118
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,160
are the fruits
of our many years' effort.

119
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,400
Evacuate them immediately.

120
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,640
Don't let His Majesty find out.

121
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
Hurry up.

122
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,600

Oh, no.

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
His Majesty went to Yuzhen Hall.

176
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Has everyone evacuated the place?

177
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,600
Al... almost.

178
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Didn't I tell you to hurry up?

179
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,600
But...

180
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,800
we only received the order

181
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,520
six hours ago.

182
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,000
We didn't think it was this urgent.

183
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh, no.

184
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,000
Yuzhen Hall's rules dictate

185
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,160
that all trespassers

186
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
shall be killed.

187
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,000
Cheng Xi has fallen into the trap.

188
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Great.

189
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,800
Prepare the team.

190
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,720
We will set off immediately.

191
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,680
Are you coming too?

192
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,680
This is a serious matter.

193
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
Both of us will go together.

194
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,200
All right.

195
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,250
(Yuzhen Hall)

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
(I've searched the place
and found nothing.)

197
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,800
Moon Dancing Hall.

198
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,120
(Is this an opera house?)

199
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,040
(This is strange.)

200
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
(Where did everyone go?)

201
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
(It seems like I have to do something.)

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,840
I heard

203
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
this place has nice performances.

204
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm here to see it myself.

205
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,160
Anyone here?

206
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,200
(What?)

207
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,920
(Does she not know what this place is?)

208
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,040
I do know a thing or two.

209
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,120
Do you want to fight with me?

210
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,000
You dare kill others,
but you are afraid to confront me.

211
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,040
Cowards!

212
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,840
It's you again.

213
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,000
I said

214
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,200
I would defeat you
the next time we meet.

215
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,280
Watch out!

216
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
Your Majesty!

217
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,650
(Yuzhen Hall)

218
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,120
The bell.

219
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,520
(Yuzhen Hall)

220
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,840
It has stopped.

221
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,960
Someone's here. What should we do?

222
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
Search the place.

223
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,480
Yes, sir!

224
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,520
Find them!

225
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,680
Cheng Ruoyu.

226
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,920
Cheng Ruoyu, what's wrong?

227
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
Please don't get an attack at this time.

228
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
Who are you?

229
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,040
Who are you?

230
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,560
Who are you?

231
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,760
Sir, look at this.

232
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,400
Search the place.

233
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,440
Here.

234
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,814
How do you feel?

235
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,200
Are you feeling better?

236
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,000
We have to figure out

237
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,720
how to leave this place quickly.

238
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,320
Got it.

239
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:00,640
Your Majesty.

240
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,080
- Your Majesty!
- Don't move.

241
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
You're injured.

242
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,920
Remove it.

243
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,200
Why are you not removing it yet?

244
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,720
Your Majesty, please bear with it.

245
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Please bear with it.

246
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,280
There must be

247
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
a secret passage
that's connected to another place.

248
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,080
Let's find it.

249
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
Break the Sun Wonder and Moon Wonder.

250
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Destroy the Delusion, Scenery,
and Fear Doors.

251
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,920
Break the Sun Wonder and Moon Wonder.

252
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Destroy the Delusion, Scenery,
and Fear Doors. Quick!

253
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, sir!

254
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,720
There's a trap at the east.

255
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,320
There's a trap at the southwest.

256
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
There's also a trap at the north.

257
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,360
Where is it?

258
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,480
Where's the Life Door?

259
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,080
Come.

260
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,320
Your Majesty!

261
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,120
My sword broke.

262
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,440
Stop crying.

263
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,400
I'll reward you with
100 new swords later.

264
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
The Life Door is over there!

265
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Take care of yourself.

266
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,160
Don't destroy the Life Door!

267
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
They have found the entrance.

268
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,840
Qiu Yanzhi.

269
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,640
Yes.

270
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,120
She said I could find the killer here.

271
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,640
Killer?

272
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,080
What killer?

273
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Aunt Cai is dead.

274
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,960
Yanzhi said the killer hid here.

275
00:20:58,587 --> 00:20:59,760
Have you not realized

276
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,600
that we have both fallen into the trap?

277
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,920
What do you mean?

278
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,560
While we're after them,

279
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,120
someone else is after us.

280
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
I have to leave here immediately.

281
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,320
They can't see me.

282
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,840
Your Majesty,

283
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
Yanzhi won't kill me yet.

284
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,480
When we find the exit,

285
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,080
you should leave first.

286
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
I'll buy you some time.

287
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
The center of the array must be here,

288
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,800
and the exit must be somewhere here too.

289
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
Let's find it.

290
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
I need a few more men. Hurry up!

291
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Yes, sir!

292
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,600
Watch out!

293
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,360
Look out!

294
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,960
Ruoyu!

295
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,560
Are you all right?

296
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,360
I'm fine.

297
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,520
(Only someone like her)

298
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,480
(will protect you,)

299
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
(and die for you)

300
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,200
(in your time of need.)

301
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:55,192
How are you?

302
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,040
Are you hurt?

303
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Give me a hand.

304
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,280
Step back.

305
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,327
Yes, sir.

306
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,920
Where are they?

307
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,920
This is the secret passage.

308
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,320
Where does this lead to?

309
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,560
I have no idea.

310
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's go there and have a look.

311
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's go.

312
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,480
I'm sure I saw two people

313
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,320
went in there.

314
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,520
Report.

315
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,680
Madam,

316
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,160
there's no one in the courtyard.

317
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,520
No one?

318
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,520
Did a ghost ring the bell?

319
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,480
They are gone.

320
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
But the traps are still here.

321
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,080
Leave no stone unturned.

322
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,560
Unearth this thing.

323
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Yes, Madam.

324
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,040
Your Majesty.

325
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,320
Over there.

326
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,480
Please be careful, Your Majesty.

327
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,080
Your Majesty,

328
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,680
I can't run anymore.

329
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,120
I need to take a break.

330
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,680
Hurry up.

331
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,560
Get up.

332
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,360
I took the medicine

333
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,440
and am feeling so sleepy.

334
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
I need to take a break...

335
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,760
Without my Sword Bearer to protect me,

336
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,200
how am I supposed to proceed?

337
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
I will rest for just a while.

338
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Just a while.

339
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,600
Just a little while.

340
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Fine.

341
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,880
This area

342
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,080
seems to be relatively safe.

343
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
We will

344
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,920
take a rest here.

345
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

346
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,640
But it was really odd.

347
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Who sounded the bell?

348
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,440
Who let us go?

349
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,440
If I ever find out

350
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,560
who let us go,

351
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll send them my gratitude.

352
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
They put you in danger.

353
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Yet, you still want to thank them.

354
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
We got out,

355
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
didn't we?

356
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Besides,

357
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,520
it was us who broke
into Yuzhen Hall in the first place.

358
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,760
As for them,

359
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,680
it was self-defense, right?

360
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,040
Under my reign,

361
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
do you think it's rational

362
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,280
that the former mansion

363
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
of the princess

364
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,240
hides such weaponry?

365
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,360
How brilliant they are.

366
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,840
How many secrets

367
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:23,455
are being kept

368
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,640
by the Chess of Generals Camp
and Yuzhen Hall?

369
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
What else did Yanzhi tell you

370
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
aside from

371
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,840
Mrs. Cai's murderer

372
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,480
who appeared in Yuzhen Hall?

373
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,680
She told me

374
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,920
there must be someone behind Wu.

375
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,120
That person saved her back then

376
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,840
and sent her into the palace,

377
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,200
then forced her to assassinate.

378
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,200
That person must have ulterior motives.

379
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,760
Your Majesty,

380
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,200
why did you stop me

381
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
from investigating Wu's case

382
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,800
as well as those who tried
to assassinate you?

383
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,160
Do you

384
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,960
really not care about it?

385
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,920
If you do investigate Wu,

386
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,520
it'll involve old matters dating back
to eight years ago.

387
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
I admit...

388
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,200
that I purposely released

389
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,920
Zheng Wu back then.

390
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
You were the one who released her?

391
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,800
Are you the one

392
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,480
who sent Wu into the palace too?

393
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,440
No.

394
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,400
I didn't know

395
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,400
she would return to seek trouble.

396
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
She must have been
manipulated by others.

397
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,600
Manipulated by others?

398
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,600
By who?

399
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,880
Don't ask questions about things

400
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,320
you shouldn't know.

401
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
The more you know,

402
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
the closer you are to death.

403
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,000
And you told me you were tired
because of the medicine you took.

404
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,480
Silly.

405
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,280
Sir!

406
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,960
Three hundred swords.

407
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,560
Who forged them?

408
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,160
Who owned them?

409
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
What is their intention?

410
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,040
Playing such a trick

411
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,080
right under my nose.

412
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,280
What atrocious guts!

413
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,360
Please calm down, Sir.

414
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
- Please calm down, Sir.
- Shut up!

415
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,120
You're all brilliant indeed.

416
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,160
The Chess of Generals Camp

417
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,320
claims to control Heng'an City,

418
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,800
but knows nothing

419
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
about all of this!

420
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
What use are all of you?

421
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,480
Back then,

422
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
I was a mere servant
who bathed the horses.

423
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,560
I worked prudently and planned carefully,

424
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,680
step by step, before I finally built

425
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,960
the Chess of Generals Camp
and became its leader!

426
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
And look at all of you!

427
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,280
A bunch of useless fools!

428
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,080
Guards!

429
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,120
Tell me how many whips

430
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,880
do you deserve?

431
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,640
Tell me!

432
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,560
30.

433
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,320
Stop howling.

434
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
It's just a small injury.

435
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,360
What about your niece?

436
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,760
How is she faring?

437
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,960
Your Majesty.

438
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,560
I beg of you

439
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,480
to never sneak out

440
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,800
from the palace again.

441
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,400
It's dangerous.

442
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,080
Dangerous?

443
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,560
And do you know

444
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,960
what sort of dangers I encountered?

445
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,200
Your Majesty.

446
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,520
Please forgive me.

447
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,320
I didn't mean anything else.

448
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,920
I only meant

449
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
since Your Majesty and Yu'er

450
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,760
were severely injured,

451
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,320
you must have encountered

452
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,160
great danger.

453
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,480
Your Majesty,

454
00:31:57,324 --> 00:32:00,280
I didn't mean anything else at all.

455
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Call for the imperial physician.

456
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,120
Your Majesty,

457
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,520
you mustn't summon
the imperial physician right now.

458
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,360
Otherwise,

459
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,440
the others will know
Your Majesty snuck out of the palace

460
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,040
last night.

461
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,160
Fine.

462
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
I'll do it myself.

463
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,400
Get me some premium medicine
and ointment for wounds,

464
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,720
and stand guard outside.

465
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,200
Don't let anyone come inside.

466
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,160
Understood.

467
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
Bear with it.

468
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,400
(My sword broke.)

469
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
I'll get you a hundred swords
when we get back.

470
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,600
You wouldn't let me
be your Sword Bearer.

471
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,000
And now even the sword is broken.

472
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,680
Do you want
to be my Sword Bearer that badly?

473
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:03,219
(Sword Repository)

474
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,680
We evacuated in haste

475
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,239
and left too many traces behind!

476
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,560
Fortunately,
someone notified us with the bell

477
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,800
and allowed the girls to escape safely.

478
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,040
Now that I think about it,

479
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:18,655
from the moment Mrs. Cai was captured,

480
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,360
we were gradually lured

481
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,880
into a trap they set up.

482
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,560
I was incompetent.

483
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,719
Please punish me.

484
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,120
We...

485
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,880
have underestimated Qiu Yanzhi.

486
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,480
However,
His Majesty didn't find anything

487
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,960
in Yuzhen Hall.

488
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,199
That means

489
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,520
it would be better to pretend
not to know anything about it, Madam.

490
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,920
It was such a huge array.

491
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,199
It would be a mistake if I knew about it

492
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
and my incompetence if I didn't!

493
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,239
Since His Majesty has become suspicious,

494
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,960
he will investigate the matter.

495
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,400
It'll be worse for us
if I deny knowledge of the matter

496
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,000
and lose his trust.

497
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,560
Rather than sitting here,

498
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,400
we should take the initiative.

499
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,520
I'll come clean to His Majesty.

500
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,640
Continue to stand guard outside.

501
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,480
Understood.

502
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,920
What's wrong?

503
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,360
Why are you nervous?

504
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm treating your wounds.

505
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,240
Moreover,

506
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,040
you're not my type.

507
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Fragile

508
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,280
and scrawny.

509
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,120
Do you think

510
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,000
I have an interest in you?

511
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,040
In your dreams.

512
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,200
Don't scream.

513
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,080
Be quiet.

514
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,800
Can't you stand such a small injury,

515
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,560
Sword Bearer?

516
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,120
Bear with it.

517
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,240
It's done.

518
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,920
Your Majesty.

519
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Madam Cheng from Violet Bureau
requests an audience.

520
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
Have her wait outside.

521
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,680
I'm almost done.

522
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

523
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,640
Maybe you should...

524
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm fine.

525
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,840
Besides swords and clothing,

526
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,080
we found some combs,

527
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,720
hair accessories, fly-whisks,

528
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,720
and some other items

529
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
inside the well at Yuzhen Hall.

530
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,520
But all of them were immersed in water

531
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,640
for so long, there are hardly

532
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,200
any traces left.

533
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
Not entirely.

534
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,240
The source of the pearls,

535
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
its craftsmanship,
and the store which produced it,

536
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,320
all of these can be traced.

537
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
As well as this cut.

538
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,400
It was clearly slashed by a sword.

539
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,720
However, the sword stopped halfway.

540
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,360
That's why you can see
that half of this pearl

541
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,400
was slashed,

542
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,240
and the other half was broken forcibly.

543
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,720
The sword was wielded by a woman.

544
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,960
She probably won't last 50 moves

545
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,480
if I went up against her.

546
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
And if you were up against

547
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,000
300 women

548
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
of this skill?

549
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,600
300?

550
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,800
I won't force myself.

551
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,240
I would run away.

552
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,720
Women value beauty by nature.

553
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,560
They would wear hair accessories
while battling

554
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,640
as well as when escaping.

555
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,280
Investigate further through this clue.

556
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,600
Yes, Chess Overseer.

557
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,560
Madam Cheng.

558
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,920
What brings you here?

559
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,640
What's this?

560
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,640
The real name list of the Violet Bureau.

561
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,200
(Sword Repository)

562
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,040
How to decode them?

563
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,720
The zither has 13 notes,

564
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,040
which represent 13 people.

565
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,480
Every fingering signifies their actions.

566
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,600
For example, the tenth-flip-fourth.

567
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
The ring finger

568
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,520
presses the tenth note,

569
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,240
and the middle finger
plays the fourth string.

570
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,400
It means...

571
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,480
The tenth member killed four.

572
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,760
So,

573
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,240
there is a secret force

574
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,720
within the Violet Bureau.

575
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,040
And you kept it from me.

576
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
I didn't.

577
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,800
I am just following the orders

578
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,360
of the late emperor.

579
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,360
You mean...

580
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,600
it was my brother's orders?

581
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,360
Yes.

582
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
After the Morning Dew Rebellion,

583
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,880
the late emperor
was imprisoned by Qiu Ziliang

584
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,720
and couldn't do anything.

585
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,480
That's why he ordered me

586
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,640
to select girls
who have potential in martial arts

587
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,080
and re-establish the Violet Bureau.

588
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,280
Your Majesty,

589
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,120
you're aware of this too.

590
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,080
I do know.

591
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
However...

592
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,400
He did not ask you

593
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,360
to build another Yuzhen Hall.

594
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,160
The Changming Palace is full of spies.

595
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,080
Thousands of girls are a huge number.

596
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,040
To avoid
raising Qiu Ziliang's suspicions,

597
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
I could only gradually
select the best girls

598
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
and send them out of the palace

599
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,360
to be trained.

600
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,440
Really?

601
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,760
Then why didn't you report this to me

602
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,040
after I ascended to the throne?

603
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,840
The late emperor said

604
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,960
if the new emperor
is capable and ambitious,

605
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,960
we should offer our assistance.

606
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,960
But if...

607
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,080
But if the emperor was dishonorable

608
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,200
and incapable,

609
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,800
you would rebel, is that right?

610
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,360
I dare not.

611
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,720
I remained silent

612
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,600
due to my own incompetence

613
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,560
as well as the late emperor's orders.

614
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,960
Until now, amongst the 300 warriors,

615
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,640
there are only a few of them

616
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,840
whose skills can be compared to Yu'er's,

617
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,600
much less Your Majesty's.

618
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,760
They're unworthy to be at your service.

619
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
Where are they now?

620
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,720
They've left the city

621
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,720
and hid at Mount Qi.

622
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,320
The incident last night...

623
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,000
It was the scheme of Qiu Yanzhi.

624
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,720
Wonderful.

625
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,400
Wonderful.

626
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,200
Rise.

627
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,600
Your Highness.

628
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,880
The 300 warriors of Yuzhen Hall

629
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,360
have reached Mount Qi safely.

630
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,520
Got it.

631
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,400
The Violet Bureau
has encountered such a heavy blow.

632
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,400
I'm afraid it will take a long time
for them to recover.

633
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,640
You may rise.

634
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

635
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,320
Since the day Zheng Wu

636
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
was investigated

637
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,120
after revealing
the existence of the Violet Bureau,

638
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,120
I should have foreseen

639
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,320
that Yuzhen Hall, too,
would be exposed someday.

640
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,200
Cheng Xi underestimated Qiu Yanzhi.

641
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,720
Therefore, she lost the match

642
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,720
before she even started.

643
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,000
Fortunately,

644
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,000
Your Highness predicted

645
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,160
that Yuzhen Hall would be in danger

646
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,280
and had me observe them
in secret before the incident.

647
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,400
And sounded the bell the moment

648
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,520
the Chess of Generals Camp attacked.

649
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,720
We were able to save them
because of that.

650
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,160
And what of it then?

651
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,480
His Majesty's power is still inferior.

652
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
How will he be able
to act against Qiu Ziliang?

653
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,920
I must think of a way

654
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,600
to return to help him.

655
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,280
But...

656
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,360
the Empress Dowager
is wary of Your Highness.

657
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,000
His Majesty might not
trust you completely either.

658
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,560
And Qiu Ziliang...

659
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,200
he won't take any action

660
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,080
if you don't.

661
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
But if you do...

662
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,480
Why would you expose yourself
to such danger?

663
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,040
What if something happened to you?

664
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,640
You do not know
any martial arts after all.

665
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,360
What I pursue

666
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,240
is the peace, harmony,

667
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,760
and prosperity of this nation.

668
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,280
Everything else

669
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,000
matters not to me.
