You're going around Heng'an

Qi Yan told Little Fish

71
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,920
to return to Violet Bureau.

72
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,920
He commanded her

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,560
not to serve by his side anymore.

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
And this morning,

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,040
he took Liu Misha

76
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
out of the palace to have fun.

77
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,160
He didn't choose me

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,640
because he didn't want father
to be pleased.

79
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
He didn't choose Cheng Ruoyu

80
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,400
because he wants to protect her.

81
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,760
But why did he choose Misha?

82
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,080
Do you think

83
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Qi Yan did that

84
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,520
to protect Little Fish too?

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,840
Since he asked Cheng Ruoyu
to stay outside

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,280
the day we were interrogating
the posterity of the Zheng clan,

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
I knew it already.

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Interesting.

89
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,400
Qi Yan, who kills so ruthlessly,

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,680
can love someone too.

91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
Can't one who kills ruthlessly

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,640
love someone?

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
What is the progress on investigating
the background of Zhenwu?

94
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
I contacted our spies in the sentries
along the way.

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,400
We've confirmed that

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
after the Zhenwu royal retainers
crossed the border,

97
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,240
another group of traveling merchants
came from Lucong

98
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,960
to Heng'an.

99
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,440
They were less than 100 people.

100
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
They scattered
after entering the Capital.

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Some stayed at inns,

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,440
while others at homestays.

103
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
There doesn't seem
to be anything special with them.

104
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,520
Merchants from Lucong?

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
They claimed to come to Heng'an
for shelter,

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,000
but they spent money extravagantly.

107
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
They don't seem poor.

108
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,760
We tested two of them.

109
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,640
They know martial arts too.

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,240
The Zhenwu Military Adviser

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
might be among them.

112

(Violet Bureau)

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Greetings, Sword Bearer.

114
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
Since His Majesty already said so,

115
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
then you shall come back first.

116
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Those from Yuzhen Hall

117
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,560
also need to integrate slowly.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,520
By the way,

119
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,320
why don't I see Madam Jade
and the others?

120
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,360
It's too conspicuous

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,200
to suddenly get 300 people

122
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,200
to join Violet Bureau.

123
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,120
They're awaiting orders
back in Yuzhen Hall.

124
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Yuzhen Hall?

125
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
But,

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,920
isn't Yuzhen Hall sealed?

127
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,480
That's why it's even safer.

128
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,840
No one would think

129
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,880
that they'd return there.

130
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,040
Even though His Majesty
misunderstood you,

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
a person's heart
will be revealed in time.

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,400
He'll understand someday.

133
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,640
I think His Majesty was lying.

134
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,600
If he really suspects me,

135
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,720
why would he let me come back

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
to manage Violet Bureau?

137
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,560
He must have his reasons

138
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,880
for intentionally luring me away.

139
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,040
You're all grown up indeed.

140
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
You think maturely as well.

141
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
Aunt, don't worry.

142
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm fine.

143
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,400
I'll go and visit Madam Jade
and the others.

144
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,920
I'll get going then.

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,440

148

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,920
This is Kunlun slave mask?

171
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,160
Yes, it is.

172
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,000
It's very nice.

173
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
It's buy one, get one free, so...

174
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,480
I'll have one,
and you'll take the other.

175
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,360
Is it nice?

176
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,400
I want this one.

177
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,680
But I didn't bring money.

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,880
But I want it.

179
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,880
It's fine.

180
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,840
It's not worth much.

181
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,800
I'll give it to you, Princess.

182
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Who are you?

183
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,440
Who exactly are you?

184
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,400
(West Market)

185
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,420
(Qingyuan Inn)

186
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
Little Fish?

187
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,120
Little Fish is here.

188
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,680
She came just in time.

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
You can tell them to retreat.

190
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,080
Yes.

191
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,440
Your Majesty.

192
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,240
Let me see.

193
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,520
You're wounded.

194
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,760
Does it hurt?

195
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm fine.

196
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,840
Let me see.

197
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,400
Is it serious?

198
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,800
Your Majesty.

199
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,250
(Command)

200
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,560
Lucong's command token.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,320
They were surely aiming at me.

202
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,240
Let's return to the palace.

203
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,760
Clean up here.

204
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,800
(West Market)

205
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,600
Goodbye, Sword Bearer.

206
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,840
He must think

207
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,120
that I'm following him again.

208
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,160
It's really impossible
to clear my name anymore.

209
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,960
Xiu.

210
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
Go to Prefecture Court
for some official business.

211
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,600
Qiu Yanzhi.

212
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,560
What a coincidence.

213
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,480
You're here too.

214
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,640
Is it a coincidence?

215
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,640
Isn't it?

216
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
You told the assassins

217
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,520
to bring Lucong's command token.

218
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,920
And judging from
their martial arts skill,

219
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,640
they should be from Chess
of Generals Camp.

220
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,360
It seems like

221
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,840
not only did your martial arts
skill improve,

222
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
your way of thinking has improved too.

223
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,600
Why did you try
to assassinate His Majesty?

224
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,000
What do you think?

225
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
I think

226
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,560
that you weren't aiming at His Majesty,

227
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
but Zhengwu's Princess Misha.

228
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,600
Yes,

229
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,120
and no.

230
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,840
Xiu.

231
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,840
Go.

232
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
Wait for the show,

233
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Little Fish.

234
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,560
Listen carefully.

235
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,320
The assassins from Lucong

236
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,160
openly attempted to kill

237
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
His Majesty in plain clothes
and Zhenwu's princess

238
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
in the streets.

239
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,160
We're sealing the city
for an investigation.

240
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,800
Lucong's merchant groups
will be locked up.

241
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,960
We'll release them
after the investigation is done.

242
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,640
If anyone knows anything,

243
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,920
inform us immediately.

244
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,880
Move!

245
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,960
- Yes!
- Yes!

246
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,920
Come on.

247
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,560
Let's go, hurry.

248
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,600
You mean

249
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,240
you want to take this opportunity

250
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,480
to capture Lucong's merchant groups?

251
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,120
Yes.

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,240
Why?

253
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,760
I suspect

254
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,920
that the mastermind is Zhengwu's
Military Adviser.

255
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,200
And at this moment,

256
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,160
he's pretending to be one
of Lucong's merchant groups

257
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
and hiding in Heng'an.

258
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,520
Does His Majesty know?

259
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,840
What do you think?

260
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,000
Your Majesty.

261
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
Qiu Ziliang

262
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,520
seems to have noticed it too.

263
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
You must catch that person

264
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
and bring him to me

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,240
before they do.

266
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,200
Yes.

267
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,720
Also,

268
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,760
don't let Cheng Ruoyu

269
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,560
get involved in this matter anymore.

270
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,560
Yes.

271
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,039
- Go.
- Your Majesty.

272
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,680
Your Majesty.

273
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,400
Your Majesty.

274
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
Your Majesty.

275
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,040
Why did you

276
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,600
suddenly disappear?

277
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,080
My wound is aching.

278
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
- I'll assist you in going back.
- There's no need.

279
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
Your Majesty, I'll accompany you.

280
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,120
His Majesty was aware of it.

281
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,080
That's why he told me

282
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,920
not to follow the assassins

283
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,800
and investigate.

284
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,840
But why?

285
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
This is a critical moment.

286
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,880
He needs talented people.

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
I can do a lot of things.

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
Could it be

289
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,680
because

290
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,280
of the peony that Duke Chu gave me?

291
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,560
My father gave you the peony

292
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
to test

293
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,600
if His Majesty wants to take you
as his consort.

294
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,520
And His Majesty's response

295
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,560
was to transfer you back
to Violet Bureau

296
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,119
and get close with Princess Misha.

297
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,839
He's acting like he wants

298
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,400
to have a marriage connection
with Zhenwu.

299
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
What do you think

300
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,119
his real motive is?

301
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,800
Silly girl.

302
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,040
His Majesty is protecting you.

303
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,040
Where are you going?

304
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,640
I'm going back to the palace.

305
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
I don't need this kind of protection.

306
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,640
As the Sword Bearer,

307
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
this is my duty.

308
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,920
I won't have any personal relationships

309
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,800
with His Majesty.

310
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,280
And I won't become
His Majesty's consort.

311
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,680
Duke Chu can feel at ease.

312
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,440
He won't feel at ease.

313
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,240
And he'd rather mistakenly kill

314
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
those he doesn't feel at ease with

315
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,720
than spare them.

316
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,960
So,

317
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,520
if you're really considering
His Majesty's sake

318
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,440
and want to return to his side,

319
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,080
there's only one way.

320
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,240
What is it?

321
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,680
Let me

322
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,920
become his empress.

323
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,040
Grand Empress Dowager's birthday banquet

324
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,280
is coming soon.

325
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,640
Yet you injured yourself

326
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,680
this way.

327
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,160
Uncle.

328
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
Don't tell her about this.

329
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,880
She's not healthy.

330
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,680
And she's under too much stress

331
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040
because of Aunt Ninghe's illness.

332
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,520
She's still bedridden now.

333
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
What if

334
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,640
I go and visit her?

335
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,600
Your Majesty.

336
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,480
I'll visit her

337
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,200
and chat with her.

338
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,280
I'll tell her

339
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,680
anecdotes from the savanna.

340
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,760
Perhaps

341
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
her mood will lighten up,

342
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,880
and she'll recover.

343
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
That's a good idea.

344
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

345
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,160
I'll go there now.

346
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,680
Do you really want to make use
of Zhenwu's power?

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
No.

348
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,920
Then why did you make Yu'er leave?

349
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,880
You don't have to tell me
if it's not convenient.

350
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,680
Your Majesty, focus on recovering.

351
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,120
I'll go ahead.

352
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,640
Uncle.

353
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,040
Uncle.

354
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,520
Back then, you told me

355
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,760
that with Yu'er by my side,

356
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,280
she could block the sword

357
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,240
and die for me.

358
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,320
But now,

359
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,360
I want her to stay alive.

360
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,480
There are

361
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,480
too many dangers around me.

362
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,000
If we're not careful,

363
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,640
we'll die together.

364
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Qiu Yanzhi.

365
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,280
Do you really like His Majesty?

366
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,560
You're so silly.

367
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,480
What I like

368
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,640
is the position of empress.

369
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,960
No wonder you kept

370
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
helping His Majesty and me secretly.

371
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,760
Think about it.

372
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,560
I'm a good candidate.

373
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,400
If he marries me,

374
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,920
it can ease up His Majesty

375
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,240
and my father's relationship.

376
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,320
He'll get the support from Shencai Army

377
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,280
and Chess of Generals Camp.

378
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,800
His Majesty can quickly

379
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
secure his position.

380
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,320
He has nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

381
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,040
What's the use of telling me?

382
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,120
I don't call the shots.

383
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,880
It's up to His Majesty.

384
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,640
Qiu Yanzhi.

385
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,440
You're helping me so much.

386
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,160
Once Qiu Ziliang finds out,

387
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,000
he definitely won't spare you.

388
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
Are you doing these things

389
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
just to be the empress?

390
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,680
Yes.

391
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,800
What about him?

392
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,280
He likes you.

393
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm not blind.

394
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,280
If Chess Overseer becomes the empress,

395
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,360
then I'll be like the brother
of the empress.

396
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
I feel so excited
just thinking about it.

397
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,400
You two are really
the same type of people.

398
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,760
I get it.

399
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,800
I get it now.

400
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,640
You're really the same.

401
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,960
It's decided then.

402
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
Tell Yuzhen Hall to prepare

403
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,120
and wait for my message.

404
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,160
Well...

405
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,440
We almost captured all of them,

406
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,920
except for one.

407
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,880
The merchant group's messenger is gone.

408
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,960
You didn't find him?

409
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,520
I searched the inn

410
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
before Yan Xiu arrived.

411
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Everyone else was here.

412
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,040
He was the only one gone.

413
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,720
I was careless.

414
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I didn't expect that he'd blend

415
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,480
into Lucong's merchant groups
and enter the Capital.

416
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,560
Continue searching for him.

417
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,200
The Chess of Generals Camp

418
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
only suspects Zhenwu's Military Adviser.

419
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,160
But we

420
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,560
already knew

421
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
who the Military Adviser is.

422
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,400
In this aspect,

423
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,760
we have the upper hand already.

424
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes.

425
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,360
What if I return to the palace first?

426
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,200
No.

427
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,840
I must find Madam Jade
and the others first.

428
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,840
Cheng Ruoyu.

429
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,040
Ziyuan.

430
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,920
You went out of the palace too?

431
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,440
Madam Jade and the others
moved to another place.

432
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,480
She told me to bring you over.

433
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,040
Let's go.

434
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,800
Ziyuan.

435
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,760
Is it still far away?

436
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,480
We'll be there soon.

437
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,440
Who is it?

438
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Master.

439
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,720
This is

440
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,920
the new Sword Bearer of Violet Bureau,

441
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,760
Cheng Ruoyu.

442
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
Qi Yan likes her a lot.

443
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,920
There are rumors

444
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,360
that he even wants to make her
his consort.

445
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,320
Very good.

446
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,480
You can do the next thing then.

447
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,720
Yes.

448
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,880
Your Majesty.

449
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Shencai Army Military Protector
Lieutenant Yan Xiu

450
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,280
sent an urgent report.

451
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,400
Your Majesty.

452
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,640
Yu'er was captured.

453
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
Zhenwu captured her.

454
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,040
What should we do?

455
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
I'll personally go there.

456
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,400
Your Majesty, please be careful.

457
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,120
Huaizhi.

458
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,640
Inform the imperial guards

459
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,360
to gather at the palace gate.

460
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,880
Your Majesty.

461
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
Grand Empress Dowager is summoning you.

462
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,320
I don't have the time now.

463
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll pay her a visit a while later.

464
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,960
However,

465
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,280
Grand Empress Dowager is asking you

466
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,520
to go now.

467
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,680
All right.

468
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,000
(He's making cherry pastry.)

469
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,040
Military Adviser.

470
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,360
Why are you here?

471
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,120
Someone tried to assassinate
Princess today.

472
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,360
The assassin is from Lucong.

473
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
(It's Zhenwu's Military Adviser indeed.)

474
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,840
They came to kill us.

475
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,400
I heard that someone
is leading the rebel soldiers

476
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,520
out there

477
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,040
and wants to return to the position.

478
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
That's not important.

479
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,040
Heng'an has tight security.

480
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,120
People from Lucong can't make
much trouble.

481
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,320
As for Ninghe, how is she?

482
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,840
She's still unconscious.

483
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Don't tell anyone that I came,

484
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
including Misha.

485
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,240
The King told Misha to come here,

486
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,880
so that she can marry the emperor.

487
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,640
I'll find an opportunity
to make that happen.

488
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,880
Don't worry.

489
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,760
Yes.

490
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,400
Go.

491
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,000
Yes.

492
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,800
Stop pretending.

493
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,720
You're here, Your Majesty.

494
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Greetings, Grandmother.

495
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Misha is telling me

496
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,240
fun stories from the savanna.

497
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,520
Come and listen too.

498
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm wondering

499
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,880
what you want to talk to me about.

500
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,240
I have matters to attend to now.

501
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,480
You're very busy?

502
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,640
I originally wanted you
and Princess Misha

503
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,120
to have dinner together.

504
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,160
I don't have much time today.

505
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,520
What if

506
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,200
we prepare

507
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
a dinner banquet tomorrow

508
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,040
for Princess Misha

509
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,920
with the best food we have

510
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,000
as a host?

511
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,280
Sure.

512
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,600
Grand Empress Dowager.

513
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,120
Tomorrow night is fine too.

514
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,080
All right.

515
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,960
You may get to work then.

516
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,160
Thank you, Grandmother.

517
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,160
I'll go ahead.

518
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,960
Your Majesty.

519
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,440
You're so busy.

520
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,640
Are you going out of the palace?

521
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,160
Yes.

522
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,920
I will go hunting

523
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,720
to make knee pads for Grandmother.

524
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,960
Bring me along then.

525
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,320
I've long heard of how nice
palace hunts are.

526
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,920
I want to take a look too.

527
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,560
No.

528
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,080
Why not?

529
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,600
It's not convenient.

530
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,640
Grand Empress Dowager.

531
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,880
Your Majesty.

532
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
Bring Princess Misha along.

533
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,760
She's our guest.

534
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,840
And she's knowledgeable
in Heng'an culture.

535
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,680
It's obvious that she put in
a lot of effort since she was little.

536
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,160
Yes.

537
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,480
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

538
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,360
Go.

539
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,040
Handmaiden Xiu.

540
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,360
Yes.

541
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,400
Do you think

542
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,480
they suit each other?

543
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,280
Grand Empress Dowager.

544
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,520
Princess Misha
is innocent and unaffected.

545
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,680
She's very cute indeed.

546
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,360
But she's an outsider after all.

547
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,240
In terms of a suitable girl,

548
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,480
it must still be Li Deyun's daughter.

549
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,400
You mean Zening?

550
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,240
I like that girl too.

551
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,120
Eight years ago,

552
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,760
Qi Yan blinded my eye.

553
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,280
I escaped death and went to Zhenwu.

554
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,560
And over 300 people in my clan

555
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,760
were all killed.

556
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Don't you think

557
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,120
that I must seek revenge for that?

558
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,080
You're also a victim

559
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,960
of the Morning Dew Rebellion?

560
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,640
That's right.

561
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,400
You were also the one who instigated Wu?

562
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Wu and I share a deep hatred
for our enemy.

563
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,440
And she was very obedient.

564
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,680
What about Ziyuan?

565
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,560
Why is Ziyuan listening to you?

566
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,840
Since you're here,

567
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
why don't you come out?

568
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,280
I'm offering a cup of tea
on my Master's behalf.

569
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,680
And I am here
to bring a message to you.

570
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,800
Mengding Mountain Morning Dew Tea.

571
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
You're the spy

572
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,480
that person planted in Yuzhen Hall.

573
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,320
No wonder...

574
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,880
No wonder he knew everything

575
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,120
Yuzhen Hall did.

576
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,320
I was originally

577
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,560
that person's servant.

578
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
After Master left,

579
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,120
I've been staying at this place

580
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,160
to get in contact with him
more conveniently.

581
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,640
Now that he's finally back,

582
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,720
aren't you happy, Your Highness?

583
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,560
What is he planning to do
in coming back?

584
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,080
He told me to ask you

585
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
if the girl named Cheng Ruoyu

586
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,680
should be killed

587
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,880
or kept alive.

588
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,960
Your Majesty.

589
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,920
Aren't you going hunting?

590
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,480
Why did you come here?

591
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,520
Is there anything else you want to ask?

592
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,040
Do you want to kill His Majesty?

593
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,680
I just want him to return

594
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,520
what he shouldn't have.

595
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,480
Don't move.

596
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,120
His Majesty will come.

597
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,520
You can't escape.

598
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,560
What do you think this place is?

599
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,760
Where is she?

600
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Who?

601
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,440
Search the place!

602
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,440
Search it!

603
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,920
- Yes!
- Yes!

604
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,800
Hurry.

605
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,320
This way.

606
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,800
This is the hunt you were referring to?

607
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,800
Isn't your Sword Bearer

608
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,840
- at the West Market?
- Come on.

609
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,360
- Why are you looking for her here?
- Come here.

610
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Don't miss that area too.

611
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,760
Could it be

612
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,719
that you want to break

613
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,800
the promise we've agreed on?

614
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,480
This way.

615
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,000
- Coming.
- Search!

616
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,120
Isn't this the relay station?

617
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,360
There are eyes and ears everywhere
around the relay station.

618
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,920
I just

619
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,960
circled around with you.

620
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,280
Otherwise, how can I confuse them?

621
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,920
Where am I?

622
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
The guest is already here.

623
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,679
Why don't you come in?

624
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,920
Your Highness.

625
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,360
Yu'er?

626
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Yu'er, come.

627
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,040
Yu'er.

628
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,680
How are you feeling?

629
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,800
Let me check.

630
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm fine.

631
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Where are we?

632
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,120
Yuzhen Hall.

633
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,800
What did you do to Madam Jade
and the others?

634
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,040
Worry about yourself first.

635
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,920
Yu'er.

636
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,920
Her heart meridian is damaged.

637
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,680
You treated her so ruthlessly.

638
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
She has a good foundation.

639
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,000
I understand

640
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
why you taught her the martial arts.

641
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,680
I didn't teach her.

642
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,120
She learned it on her own.

643
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,800
Your Majesty.

644
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,000
We didn't find Ms. Yu'er.

645
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,240
All right.

646
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,080
Where is the Military Adviser?

647
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,560
What?

648
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,880
Where exactly is your Military Adviser?

649
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,640
He didn't come.

650
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,920
He did.

651
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,320
He's right here.

652
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,840
Tell me where he is.

653
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,560
Otherwise,

654
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,920
I'll capture and interrogate them all.

655
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,360
Yes.

656
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,520
Wait.

657
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,720
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

658
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,200
You're going to use baseless accusations

659
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,160
to capture us?

660
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,960
My Sword Bearer

661
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,840
went missing

662
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,480
in your relay station.

663
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,880
Where's your proof?

664
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,560
Who saw Cheng Ruoyu

665
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,360
come here?

666
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,240
And who saw our Military Adviser?

667
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,680
What's going on here?

668
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,360
Your Majesty.

669
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,160
Princess.

670
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,560
Why are you here?

671
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,560
His Majesty is claiming

672
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,680
that our Military Adviser

673
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,880
captured his Sword Bearer,

674
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,880
and he wants to capture
and interrogate us.

675
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,360
You know about this, don't you?

676
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,080
I...

677
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,360
I don't know.

678
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,960
Where did you come back from?

679
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,000
They're all here.

680
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,800
You're the only one who came back
from outside.

681
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,400
I...

682
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,920
I had some drinks outside.

683
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,160
I was a bit drunk,

684
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,600
so I slept a bit before returning.

685
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,760
Your Majesty.

686
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,320
Your Majesty.

687
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,440
Just because of a maid,

688
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,120
you're making such a big fuss.

689
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,600
Insulting the royal retainers
is like insulting Zhenwu.

690
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,520
Your Majesty, do you really want
to be so ruthless?

691
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,240
Your Majesty.

692
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,040
This person claimed
that he once saw Ms. Yu'er.

693
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,440
Where did you see her?

694
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,960
I was guarding the gate today,

695
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,000
and I saw someone

696
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,360
walk by carrying a girl.

697
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,320
Wait.

698
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Who was carrying her?

699
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,960
He kept his head low.

700
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,040
I didn't see it clearly.

701
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,720
Do you remember where he went?

702
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,080
He... He went towards the north.

703
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,480
Your Majesty!

704
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,160
You may disperse.

705
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,000
Princess.

706
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,640
Where is the Military Adviser?

707
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,000
You're not telling me too?

708
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,760
The Military Adviser

709
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,800
came to Heng'an indeed.

710
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,960
Why did he capture Cheng Ruoyu?

711
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,880
I don't know about that.

712
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,440
Where is he now?

713
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,520
Your Majesty.

714
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,680
We didn't find Cheng Ruoyu.

715
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,280
Your Majesty.

716
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
We didn't find Cheng Ruoyu
by the middle street.

717
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,760
Your Majesty.

718
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,800
We didn't find Cheng Ruoyu
around the West Market.

719
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Continue searching.

720
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,640
Even if you search
the entire Heng'an City,

721
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,720
find her!

722
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

723
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,520
Follow me.

724
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,160
(Where are you, Cheng Ruoyu?)

725
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,120
(Where are you?)

726
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,760
It seems like

727
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,680
Little Fish

728
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,880
is more important to Qi Yan

729
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,680
than you and I have imagined.

730
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,920
Morning Dew Tea

731
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,920
must be harvested
after the Qingming Festival.

732
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,240
Boiled spring water must be used
to make it.

733
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,920
Only after the second brew

734
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,920
will it fully reveal its flavor.

735
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,600
The aroma will linger in your mouth.

736
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Your Highness, try it.

737
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,840
What do you think?

738
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,480
I know what you want.

739
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,400
You can't do that.

740
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,080
Why not?

741
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,080
Since you escaped death,

742
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
you should treasure what you have.

743
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,800
Why are you so obsessed with revenge?

744
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,320
You even got Lucong

745
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,000
and Zhenwu involved,

746
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,120
putting Xing in a precarious state.

747
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,240
Xing has long been
in a precarious state.

748
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,080
It's Qiu Ziliang's fault.

749
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
It's Qi Yan's fault.

750
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
It's not my fault.

751
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,400
Even if they're at fault,

752
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,040
the citizens are unharmed.

753
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,600
The citizens have long been living

754
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,000
in misery.

755
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,440
In the past eight years,

756
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,000
I make this Morning Dew Tea daily

757
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,680
to remind me

758
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,480
not to forget Wang Yang's death,

759
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,480
the Morning Dew Rebellion,

760
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,320
and the mission

761
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,040
the late emperor gave me!

762
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,080
What about you?

763
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,440
As for you,

764
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,200
just like when we were little,

765
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,440
you're weak and feigning ignorance.

766
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,040
Why are you using the citizens
as an excuse?

767
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,800
You just don't have any guts at all!

768
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,120
You, Qi Chen,

769
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,280
don't deserve to be a descendant
of the Qi family!

770
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,780
(Qiu)

771
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,520
Your Majesty.

772
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
Prince Guang went missing.

773
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Since when?

774
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,360
His leg injury
just got a little better.

775
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,640
He doesn't go out unless it's necessary.

776
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,080
I went out to buy paper this morning.

777
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,520
It just took less than an hour.

778
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,160
He was gone when I came back.

779
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,880
Was Prince Guang also

780
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,360
kidnapped by Zhenwu's Military Adviser,

781
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,880
just like Little Fish?

782
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,240
A newborn calf makes little of a tiger.

783
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,920
This girl

784
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,440
has more guts than you.

785
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,640
She's innocent.

786
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,800
Let her go.

787
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,320
How can the one Qi Yan likes

788
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
be innocent?

789
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,400
That's nonsense.

790
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,240
If Qi Yan doesn't like you,

791
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,880
he won't come to save you.

792
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,360
We'll find out very soon.

793
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,320
I see.

794
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,840
He captured Yu'er

795
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,320
and Uncle.

796
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,360
So this is

797
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,960
what you want.

798
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,280
Let's return to the palace.

799
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,440
Your Majesty,
aren't we searching anymore?

800
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,760
Uncle will be fine.

801
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,120
He'll come to find me.

802
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,640
Your Majesty!

803
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,720
Your Majesty.

804
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,360
Your Majesty.

805
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,680
Someone sent this.

806
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,720
Where is he?

807
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,720
I didn't see him.

808
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,800
I just heard the sound of the wind,

809
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,400
and this arrow was on the stake.

810
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,600
