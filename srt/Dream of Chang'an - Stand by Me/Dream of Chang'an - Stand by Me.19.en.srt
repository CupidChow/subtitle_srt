- Yes.

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,400
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,840
If you let Aunt

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
pick up Official Li Deyun,

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,560
Qiu Ziliang will surely stop her.

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
That was why I let Misha go.

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,360
Isn't Liu Misha...

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,240
Cheng Ruoyu.

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
To you,

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,080
am I someone

00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,720
who just knows how to be compassionate
towards women?

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
No.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm letting her return

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
to inform her father

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,960
about Heng'an's situation,

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,520
so that he can

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,720
create a facade of chaos in the region.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,520
Then we can openly

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,560
let Official Li Deyun

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
return to resolve the conflict.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
Then Qiu Ziliang can't stop us,

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
just like

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,600
how Qiu Ziliang

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,800
couldn't stop you from returning
to the palace today.

39

What a great plan.

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,000
So,

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,480
did Liu Misha tell you?

00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
She...

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,560
What did she tell me?

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,560

00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm not going anywhere.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,040
I'll just stay here.

53
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,400

Yanzhi.

97
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,160
Because you're the only one
who can do this.

98
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Only I

99
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,360
can restore the Wang family's reputation.

100

Only I

101
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,560
can let the eunuch's faction

102
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,080
pay for what they did.

103
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,000
That's why I don't have the right

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
to forget pain,

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,840

106
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,640

Right Minister is here.

113
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,600

You're finally here.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,520
Sir.

119
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
Right Minister means

120
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
that he didn't do well.

121
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Please punish him.

122
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,880
That's not necessary.

123
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
Just tell me

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,320
how both Cannons died.

125
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
Zening.

126
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,440
Zening.

127
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
Your Majesty, are you thirsty?

128
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,600
Zening.

129
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,240
Zening?

130
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
Li Zening?

131
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,520
Uncle.

132
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,920
His Majesty was calling out
"Zening" just now.

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,040
Was he referring to Ms. Li Zening?

134
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,000
What kind of facial expression is that?

135
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,840
What's the matter?

136
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,760
It seems like His Majesty

137
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,920
still can't forget

138
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
Ms. Li.

139
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,240
What do you mean?

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,240
Back then, during the birthday banquet

141
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,680
of Grand Empress Dowager,

142
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,960
the six-year-old Li Zening

143
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,600
attended the banquet with her family.

144
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,920
She has such literary talent
at a young age.

145
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,440
You can say that poetry flowed
from her mouth.

146
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,600
Grand Empress Dowager
was very happy with her.

147
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,800
She wanted Li Zening
to marry His Majesty.

148
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,960
How old was His Majesty back then?

149
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,400
12.

150
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
Then Ms. Li

151
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,800
should be 19 now.

152
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,080
Is she still single?

153
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
Ms. Li said

154
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,200
that she'd only marry His Majesty.

155
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,360
That's good too.

156
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,080
His Majesty is recalling
Official Li Deyun.

157
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,080
There will be hope for them.

158
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
He's recalling them...

159
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,880
What does that have to do with you?

160
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,320
His Majesty favors you so much.

161
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,880
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,760
to be a concubine someday,

163
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,200
or be the empress?

164
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,280
Uncle, what are you talking about?

165
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
Stop discussing this matter.

166
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,640
Otherwise, I'll be angry.

167
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,560
Miss.

168
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,320
It's late.

169
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,160
It's time to sleep.

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,440
I can't sleep.

171
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,160
You must sleep no matter what.

172
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,120
Otherwise, you'll wake up

173
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,080
with dark circles
around your eyes tomorrow.

174
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
When you visit Grand Empress Dowager
in the palace

175
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,720
and happen to meet His Majesty...

176
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
It's precisely because

177
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,560
I might meet His Majesty tomorrow

178
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,440
that I can't sleep.

179
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,280
Is the bow I asked them to make ready?

180
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,800
Didn't you already see it?

181
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,520
It's done.

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
It's very nice.

183
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
It's even better than the one

184
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,680
His Majesty is using now.

185
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,960
I hope he'll like it.

186
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,080
He'll surely like it.

187
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,960
His Majesty likes two things the most.

188
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,720
First, horses.

189
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,480
Second, bows.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,680
Before,

191
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
you've already given His Majesty
the horse Ru Feng.

192
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,320
After giving him this bow,

193
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,360
it will be perfect.

194
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,320
I heard that he treats Ru Feng nicely.

195
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
His Majesty treasures

196
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,800
your gift so much.

197
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,040
Of course it's because of how he feels
about you.

198
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,440
But back then,

199
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,480
I did wrong thing after all.

200
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm afraid

201
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,160
that he might not forgive me.

202
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,120
Zening.

203
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,280
Zening.

204
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,960
Zening.

205
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,700
(Chess of Generals Camp)

206
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,640
Father.

207
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,640
You're looking for me?

208
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Come here.

209
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,120
Yes.

210
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,280
Tell me

211
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,520
everything you know.

212
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,640
Say it to me face-to-face.

213
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,240
Respond.

214
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,320
Yes.

215
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
We were summoned a year ago

216
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,400
to make mechanisms, railings,

217
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,080
and bombs.

218
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,640
One year ago?

219
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,160
Yes.

220
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,000
The mechanism is very complicated.

221
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,520
We just finished it last month.

222
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,480
Then we received a notice
to bring it here,

223
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,160
repair the vermiculite brick

224
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,200
in the martial arts training ground,

225
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,920
and also place the mechanism

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,520
in Eta Ulsae Majoris.

227
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,760
Then let me ask you.

228
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,400
Who were you coordinating with?

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,880
Was it her?

230
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,480
That's ridiculous!

231
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,600
Chess Overseer has a prestigious status.

232
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,280
How can she

233
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
coordinate with you directly?

234
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,200
No.

235
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,040
It was a young man in black.

236
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,320
I heard the foreman calling him

237
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Pawn Five.

238
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,640
Sir.

239
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
Pawn Five was buried with you that day.

240
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,480
We still can't find him.

241
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
He's intentionally framing
a dead person.

242
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,160
We can't believe him.

243
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,120
Shut up!

244
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,360
Tell me everything you know

245
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,400
clearly

246
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,480
and without ambiguity.

247
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,840
I'll stand up for you.

248
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,080
Let me ask you again.

249
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,760
Where is the controlling key

250
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,360
for this mechanism?

251
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
In that girl's room.

252
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,640
Well done.

253
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,000
Good job.

254
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,640
Father, what do you want to know?

255
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,960
Just tell me.

256
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,720
I only want to know

257
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
why the decision

258
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,920
to repair the training ground

259
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,319
was only made last month,

260
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,640
but one year ago,

261
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,560
the mechanism was already made.

262
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,800
And you added three layers
of mechanisms

263
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
without me knowing.

264
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,280
Even the controlling key

265
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,600
is set in your room.

266
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Shouldn't you

267
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,440
explain that to me?

268
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,000
Sir.

269
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,880
Han Yue surely bought

270
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,760
Pawn Five off a long time ago.

271
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,640
Han Yue gave him the mechanism sketch.

272
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,160
When the timing was right,

273
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,160
he told Pawn Five

274
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,880
to intentionally destroy
the training ground's vermiculite brick.

275
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,320
While we're repairing it,

276
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,560
he planted it in the mechanism.

277
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,040
Chess Overseer doesn't know
martial arts,

278
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,240
and she often goes out.

279
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,200
It's very normal for her not to know.

280
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Well said.

281
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,360
Right Advisor.

282
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,400
Bring Pawn Five.

283
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,840
Greetings, sir.

284
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,560
Tell me if this worker

285
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,240
is lying or not.

286
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,560
He's not.

287
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,760
I gave them

288
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,000
the sketch

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,880
a year ago indeed.

290
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
I was also the one who coordinated
with them

291
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,200
for repairing the training ground.

292
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,120
Let me ask you then.

293
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,600
Where did you get your sketch?

294
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,560
Left Advisor.

295
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,480
You want to kill
to shut people up again?

296
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,040
Sir.

297
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,160
Don't fall for their trick.

298
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,480
Someone must be

299
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,720
intentionally framing us.

300
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,480
This is unexpected,

301
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
Yanzhi.

302
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,120
One year ago,

303
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,880
you already planned all of this.

304
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,920
All right.

305
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,520
The sketch was from General Han.

306
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,680
What did you say?

307
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,120
Say that again.

308
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,640
Listen.

309
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,280
You must be responsible

310
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,760
for everything you say.

311
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,640
I wasn't able to kill you.

312
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,320
It seems like it's not the end
for you yet.

313
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,440
Forget it.

314
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,160
General Han and I

315
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,240
will wait for you in the netherworld.

316
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,160
Father.

317
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
I was puzzled about it just now.

318
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,200
The sketch I provided

319
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,640
was just an ordinary one

320
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
to be used for training soldiers.

321
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,160
Why would there be a bomb?

322
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,360
It's just that I couldn't
answer earlier.

323
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,160
And I was afraid
that you wouldn't believe me.

324
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,640
That was why I never spoke.

325
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,920
Sir.

326
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,240
In order to save you,

327
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,160
Chess Overseer spent a lot of effort
in dealing with Han Yue.

328
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,400
She even almost died

329
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,320
in going to save you.

330
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
Heaven and earth can attest

331
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,480
to her sincerity.

332
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,040
You can suspect anyone

333
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,680
but her, sir.

334
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,200
Are you all right?

335
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,720
Why is Pawn Five alive?

336
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
He even framed Han Yue instead.

337
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,040
Last night, where is the one

338
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,080
you sent to follow Right Minister?

339
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Did he find anything?

340
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,320
He shook him off.

341
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,280
What's the matter?

342
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,840
You're suspecting that Pawn Five's
story changed

343
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,640
because of him?

344
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,070
(Full moon night at Sunny Rain Pavilion)

345
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,600
It's from Right Minister.

346
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,360
Right Minister wrote you a letter?

347
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,320
What did he say?

348
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,200
He wants to meet me

349
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,560
on the full moon night

350
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,680
at Sunny Rain Pavilion.

351
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Full moon night?

352
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,920
That's today.

353
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,600
That's good too.

354
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,880
I can meet

355
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,800
Right Minister

356
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,640
who's so mysterious.

357
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,750
(Secret)

358
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,440
(Your Majesty.)

359
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,720
(I already checked Yanzhi's identity.)

360
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,920
(There's nothing suspicious about it.)

361
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,760
(Qiu Ziliang personally
chose her indeed.)

362
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
(Things are going according to plan.)

363
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,960
(However, we have a long way to go.)

364
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,000
(I'm afraid there might be obstacles.)

365
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,280
(I'll return to Heng'an
as soon as I can.)

366
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,160
Ru Feng.

367
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,240
Time to eat.

368
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,000
Ru Feng.

369
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,640
Eat more.

370
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,480
I'll place it here.

371
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,720
Good boy.

372
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,560
Watch out.

373
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,240
Cheng Ruoyu?

374
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,560
You know me?

375
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
I've heard a lot about you.

376
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,280
Ru Feng is fierce.

377
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,920
He doesn't usually let people
go near him.

378
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,400
But you're different.

379
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,440
Who are you?

380
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm his previous owner.

381
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,440
Ru Feng.

382
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,240
After being with His Majesty
all these years,

383
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,120
have you been well?

384
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,520
Did you miss me?

385
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,400
Previous owner?

386
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,760
But His Majesty said

387
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,840
that he personally tamed Ru Feng.

388
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,080
Back then, my father

389
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,560
gave me Ru Feng as a gift
for my 15th birthday.

390
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,360
But this horse was wild,

391
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,520
and I'm weak,

392
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,640
so His Majesty tamed him for me,

393
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,240
and even taught him to get close to me

394
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,040
little by little.

395
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
When I left the capital,

396
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,600
I left him to His Majesty

397
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,680
as a memento.

398
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,720
So

399
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
you're Ms. Li Zening.

400
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,560
Thank you for sending the sachet

401
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,520
and saving His Majesty.

402
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,920
What are you doing here?

403
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
Your Majesty.

404
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

405
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,320
Long live, Your Majesty.

406
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
Why are you here?

407
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,280
Grand Empress Dowager summoned me
to the palace,

408
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,360
and I also came to give you a gift.

409
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,720
You came to give me a gift?

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,120
What a great bow.

411
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,480
It's a great bow indeed.

412
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,720
It can shoot even farther
than my Sanchun bow.

413
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,480
Your Majesty's arm can pull
up to three picul.

414
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,920
The Sanchun bow can
only handle 1.2 picul.

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,320
It's time to change to a new one indeed.

416
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,080
Three picul?

417
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,440
Which flatterer told you that?

418
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,640
I calculated it

419
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,960
based on the target

420
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,080
that you usually practice with.

421
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,040
Bring this to the Shencai Army camp.

422
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,640
Reward this to the first one

423
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,680
who can use this bow

424
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,920
to shoot three arrows

425
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,440
on the bullseye.

426
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,120
Your Majesty.

427
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,000
Cheng Ruoyu.

428
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,680
Yes.

429
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,440
Prepare my horse.

430
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,040
Where are we going?

431
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,880
To my uncle.

432
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,840
Prepare the horse.

433
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,800
Miss.

434
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,720
Two years were spent

435
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
in making that bow.

436
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,400
His Majesty just gave it away.

437
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,360
He's still angry at me indeed.

438
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,760
He's angry that I didn't stay back then

439
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,920
and accompany him

440
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,320
in his most trying time.

441
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,320
Yu'er.

442
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,200
What's the matter?

443
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,640
Is your internal injury acting up again?

444
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
I'm fine, Your Majesty.

445
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,840
I can manage.

446
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,040
As for your injury...

447
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,280
Come.

448
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
I'll help you get off the horse.

449
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,320
Well...

450
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,640
It's fine.

451
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,920
I can get off myself.

452
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,840

458
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,760
such a nice bow?

464
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,880
I saw your bow and arrow skill

465
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,880
was the day I had a bet with Yanzhi.

466

was already one picul.

The second time was

473
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
when you

474
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,560
shot the soldier's helmet

Your arm strength at that time

Of course.

Your Majesty.

Ms. Li's speculation

495
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,240
that your arm strength is three picul

496
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
is not exaggerated.

497
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Why did you get angry?

498
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,760
There are

499
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,040

502
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,640
is being watched by Qiu Ziliang
and Cheng Xi.

503
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,680
Now, another person is added to that.

504
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
I'm very unhappy.

505
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,720
Stay away from her as much as you can.

506
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,680
She...

507
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,080
What's wrong with her?

508
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,080
Nothing.

509
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,800
This morning, Uncle sent news

510

that they have a clue where Qi Rong is.

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:10,960
Uncle.

517
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,680
How's it going?

518
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,560
I told the Dog Hall to send hounds
for help.

519
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,680
In this area,

520
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,320
they caught Qi Rong's smell.

521
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,560
All right, come on.

522
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,840
Rise.

523
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,880
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

524
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,800
Come.

525
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,920
Come here.

526
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,320
Sit down.

527
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,440
You've grown thin.

528
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
This time,

529
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
don't leave again.

530
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,840
I also miss Heng'an a lot,

531
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,440
and I miss you.

532
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,160
It's just that my father
is in Huainan alone.

533
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,640
After celebrating

534
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,680
my maternal grandmother's birthday,

535
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,960
I'll go back.

536
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,400
Where is His Majesty?

537
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,040
I saw him at the stable earlier.

538
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,920
He said that he's going
to see Prince Guang.

539
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,200
He's going to see Prince Guang again?

540
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,080
You're only here for a day,

541
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
and he can't stay in the palace.

542
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Seriously.

543
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,240
When His Majesty is back,

544
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,800
I'll talk to him.

545
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,640
His Majesty looks good.

546
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,440
Just seeing him well

547
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
makes me happy.

548
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,000
It's fine not to mention

549
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,680
the past.

550
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,200
Why are you here?

551
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,000
Why are you here too?

552
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,240
We're looking for Prince An.

553
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,080
Even if I know

554
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,360
Qimen Dunjia a bit,

555
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm not very confident.

556
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
I heard that you

557
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,640
are quite knowledgeable about this.

558
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
I wonder if you

559
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,280
can help me.

560
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,120
Why should I help you?

561
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,760
Even if I find Prince An,

562
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,239
I'll turn him over

563
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,280
to Father at once.

564
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,480
You...

565
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,280
You don't need to beg her.

566
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,159
Empress Dowager.

567
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,440
It's time for your medicine.

568
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,199
His Majesty isn't back yet?

569
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,679
Not yet.

570
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,199
Princess Misha left.

571
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,440
Zening is also leaving.

572
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,719
When can His Majesty get married?

573
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
My health

574
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,520
is deteriorating.

575
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,560
I heard

576
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
that His Majesty
likes Cheng Ruoyu a lot.

577
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
He brings her wherever he goes.

578
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,320
Cheng Ruoyu?

579
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,160
Cheng Xi and Cheng Huaizhi's niece.

580
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,520
The new Sword Bearer of Violet Bureau.

581
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,600
Now,

582
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,760
she's serving beside His Majesty.

583
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,240
Summon her some time

584
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,240
to let me meet her.

585
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,240
Yes.

586
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,680
I was wrong.

587
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,320
Miss, what did you do wrong?

588
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,840
I came so hastily,

589
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,320
groveling

590
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,840
and hoping for him to look at me.

591
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Yet I forgot

592
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,160
that His Majesty isn't someone

593
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,280
whom you can ingratiate.

594
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,960
He never is.

595
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,320
If you want him to value you,

596
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,360
you must let him yield to you.

597
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,560
You mean...

598
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,160
Don't worry.

599
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,280
He'll come to beg us very soon.

600
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Just wait.

601
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,600
(Violet Bureau)

602
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,760
His Majesty and Yu'er

603
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,360
aren't back yet?

604
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,960
Yes.

605
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,400
Grand Empress Dowager is very worried.

606
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,520
She commanded many people
to look for them.

607
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,920
She commanded us to do the same.

608
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,040
It's not appropriate
for Grand Empress Dowager to do this.

609
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,200
His Majesty only brought Yu'er
out of the palace.

610
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,120
It must be a personal matter.

611
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,400
He doesn't want others to know.

612
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,640
Grand Empress Dowager

613
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,120
is making such a big fuss
in looking for them.

614
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,920
What will happen

615
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,320
if Qiu Ziliang finds out?

616
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,360
I'm also very worried about that.

617
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,160
But what should we do now?

618
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,960
We can only try to find them

619
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,320
before Qiu Ziliang does.

620
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,200
I got it.

621
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,240
This pavilion is located
east of the forest.

622
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,960
East implies life.

623
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,280
However, there's nothing
in the southwest part.

624
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,120
There's nothing to decipher.

625
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,280
There's nothing
in the north direction either.

626
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,200
Uncle.

627
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,840
The five woods are connected.

628
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,640
They can't be disconnected.

629
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,640
The stone table is the eye.

630
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,480
We need to start from the eye.

631
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,240
It's right here.

632
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,240
There's a mechanism down here.

633
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Is anyone there?

634
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Who's outside?

635
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,960
Save me!

636
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,320
Help!

637
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Qi Rong!

638
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,000
Save me!

639
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,080
- We got the right place.
- Save me!

640
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,120
Your Majesty, I'll go down.

641
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,840
Wait.

642
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Save me!

643
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,520
Help!

644
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,120
I have something to say.

645
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,640
Grandfather.

646
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,400
This better be important.

647
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,240
It's a major matter.

648
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,560
Li Zening is in the palace.

649
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,720
Li Deyun's daughter is in the palace?

650
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,600
And everyone's saying

651
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,920
that Qi Yan went out of the palace

652
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
to hide from Li Zening.

653
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,000
Right Advisor.

654
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,000
Yes.

655
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,320
Right Minister

656
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,920
hasn't decided

657
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,720
who will replace both Cannons yet.

658
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,760
In the past few days,

659
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,600
who are watching Li Deyun
in Huainan then?

660
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,720
The replacements are already on the way.

661
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,240
Our spies in the sentries
reported last night

662
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,920
that Li Deyun is at home all along.

663
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,600
He didn't go out.

664
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,800
Because of the birthday

665
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,680
of her maternal grandmother,

666
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,080
Li Zening came back to the capital
in advance.

667
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,920
She arrived in Heng'an yesterday.

668
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,200
She arrived in Heng'an yesterday,

669
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,640
and she went to see
Grand Empress Dowager today.

670
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,840
It seems like Grand Empress Dowager
still won't give up.

671
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Grandfather, you're brilliant.

672
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,320
And it seems like

673
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,720
Qi Yan avoiding Li Zening

674
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,240
is really something.

675
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,760
You're stupid indeed.

676
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,320
Qi Yan must have gone out

677
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,560
to secretly plan something.

678
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,520
He let Li Zening go to the palace

679
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,240
as a cover for him.

680
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,000
Understand?

681
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,600
Tell the Shencai Army to investigate.

682
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,600
Report to me

683
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,400
where Qi Yan went

684
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,880
and what he did.

685
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,640
Yes,

686
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,200
Grandfather.

687
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,240
Right Advisor.

688
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,480
Yes.

689
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,640
Tell Yanzhi to see me at once.

690
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,040
Yes.

691
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,280
Wait.

692
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,000
I'll go myself.

693
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,280
Your Majesty, you know very well

694
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,400
that the reason Father let you return
to the palace

695
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,080
and didn't do anything
in the past few days

696
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,760
is that Prince An is missing.

697
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,320
Since you found Prince An,

698
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,200
what do you think

699
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,800
will happen

700
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,600
if you bring him back?

701
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,440
I'll give you another chance

702
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,480
to choose.

703
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,600
You don't know anything,

704
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,000
and just leave.

705
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,360
Or

706
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,600
take your life

707
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,600
in exchange for his.

708
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,160
Qiu Yanzhi.

709
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Don't go out of line.

710
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,120
I'm not the one who's out of line.

711
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,080
It's you!

712
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,320
You're giving him a chance?

713
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,360
I think

714
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,760
you just want to stay on the side
and mock us.

715
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,480
If not for you,

716
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,000
we've already jumped down

717
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,200
and saved him.

718
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,120
Now that I got you thinking,

719
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,360
you don't dare to save him anymore,

720
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,400
am I right?

721
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,840
Qi Yan.

722
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,320
I'll be straight with you.

723
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Even without Prince An,

724
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,320
other royal princes can replace you.

725
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,640
Your position is in a precarious state.

726
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,840
Only I can help you
with this situation.

727
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,040
Didn't you say that you won't help?

728
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,120
I changed my mind.

729
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,840
Why?

730
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,360
Someone asked me to come here

731
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,160
for a reason.

732
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,320
Without resolving this situation
with Prince An,

733
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,680
I won't be able to see his next step.

734
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,360
What is your plan?

735
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
To resolve this situation,

736
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,040
there's only one way.

737
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,960
Marry me.

738
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,640
I don't agree.

739
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,720
I only want

740
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,560
the empress position.

741
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,080
I won't care about
your personal relationship

742
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,320
with Cheng Ruoyu.

743
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,760
I can help you

744
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,040
with this situation now,

745
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
and hide it from Father,

746
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,320
then find an opportunity...

747
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,280
No matter how useless I am,

748
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,680
it never occurred to me

749
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,920
to rely on a woman

750
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,120
to stabilize my position.

751
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,320
Yet back then,

752
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,840
in order to get the throne,

753
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,880
you killed your brother

754
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,880
and teacher.

755
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,080
Say no more.

756
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:04,880
Cheng Ruoyu.

757
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,440
Save him.

758
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,760
Yes.

759
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,880
Qi Yan.

760
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,360
Don't regret this.

761
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,080
I've made many mistakes indeed,

762
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,040
but I never regretted it.

763
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,800
I found His Highness Prince An!

764
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,840
I found His Highness Prince An!

765
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,320
Madam Cheng?

766
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,840
Why are you here?

767
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,040
I'm looking for His Majesty.

768
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,240
Someone saw Ru Feng

769
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,960
go towards this direction.

770
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,680
Continue searching then.

771
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,720
Do you know

772
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,400
where His Majesty is?

773
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,840
This is urgent.

774
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,840
Please inform me.

775
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,000
It's urgent for you, not for me.

776
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,920
I also saw Eunuch's Qiu's carriage

777
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,480
going towards Chess of Generals Camp.

778
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,520
