Princess.

00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,280
Please have a seat.

16
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,720
Princess.

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
Enjoy your tea.

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,640
Is this where Princess Ninghe

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,560
used to live?

20
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,000
Princess,

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,200
no.

22
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
This is the Hanliang Hall.

23
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,560
It's a place where the consorts

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,600
used to live.

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,760
But there is no consort at the moment.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
So, no one lives here.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,080
However, this place is peaceful.

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,160
It's a place suitable for recovery.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,640
I've heard about it.

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,520
His Majesty is still unmarried.

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
Yes, Princess.

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
It's hasn't been long
since the coronation.

33
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,960
His Majesty doesn't have the time
to select a wife

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,320
for his harem.

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,000
Where does His Majesty live?

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
This is what you get for playing hero.

37
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,200
There were a bunch of guards

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,800
and soldiers from Zhenwu.

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,240
But you jumped out for the rescue.

40
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,080
Her life was in danger.

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,200
I didn't think too much.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,560
Cheng Ruoyu...

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,920
Your Majesty?

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,760
What's wrong?

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,360
What's wrong with the hand?

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,320
It's not a serious injury.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
Your Majesty's shoulder

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
was dislocated.

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,000
Uncle.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,640
Please don't embarrass me.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,400
Your Majesty.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
I'm giving you a hand.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,000
What's so funny?

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Nothing.

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,640
This minor injury can't kill me.

56
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
When I was taming Ru Feng,

57
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
the experience

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,360
was truly perilous

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
and thrilling.

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,160
Your Majesty tamed the horse personally?

61
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,280
Of course.

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,080
But how?

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,680
When I first got Ru Feng,

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
they told me the horse

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
was extremely aggressive.

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,840
It'd take a hero to tame it.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,760
Upon hearing that,

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
I took off my shirt...

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
- Your Majesty.
- I rode...

70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,880
Why would you take off the shirt?

71
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,080
That's not the point.

72
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't interrupt me.

73
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,440
- Pay attention to details.
- Your Majesty.

74
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,480
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,880
Princess Misha insists on

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
meeting you in person.

77
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,080
Your Majesty,

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Ninghe was assassinated.

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,880
Princess of Zhenwu

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
came to the Capital in advance.

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,360
She might have ill intentions.

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Send my words.

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,280
Hold a banquet at Zichen Parlor.

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,920
I must show my gratitude

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
to the soldiers of Zhenwu

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,160
for sending my aunt home.

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
Father, are you upset

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,320
because of Misha's insolence?

89
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Both Ninghe and Misha

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,000
have humiliated me.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Sparing their lives

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
can be interesting.

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,720
Please don't be mad.

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
It could be their trick.

95
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,600
Come closer, Yanzhi.

96
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,680
Sit down.

97
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,480
Father.

98
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,480
As far as we know,

99
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,960
there is a mastermind

100
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,200
who is competing against us.

101
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,040
There must be a reason

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,240
for the mastermind

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
to send Misha here.

104
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,800
Father, think about it.

105
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,320
Zheng Wu,

106
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,880
the Zheng clan,

107
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,320
the Yuzhen Hall,

108
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
and Ninghe...

109
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,800
Every step he took

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,160
was to alienate your relationship

111
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
with His Majesty.

112
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
Princess Misha

113
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,840
only cares about His Majesty.

114
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,320
She has no respect for you.

115
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
I believe she is acting

116
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,240
deliberately.

117
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,760
Do you suspect Prince Guang
to be the mastermind?

118
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
It may not be him,

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,000
but he is certainly involved.

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,080
Prince Guang's involvement concerns you.

121
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,080
Do you know why Prince Guang
and His Majesty

122
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,920
are still unmarried to this day?

123
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,400
It's because you won't allow it.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,720
I forbid Prince Guang
from getting married.

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,800
But Qi Yan refuses to get married.

126
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,240
When His Majesty was of age at 20,

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,480
Grand Empress Dowager
arranged a marriage for him.

128
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,040
It was Li Deyun's daughter.

129
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
How could I

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,440
allow

131
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,200
that old peasant's daughter

132
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,440
marry His Majesty?

133
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,600
So I employed some tricks

134
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,920
and demoted him to Huainan.

135
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,760
Hence, the arrangement was forfeited.

136
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,680
After that,
whenever candidates showed up,

137
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,440
he just turned them down.

138
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,560
Qi Yan still loves Li Deyun's daughter.

139
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
He is waiting.

140
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,400
He wants a wife

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,960
who can become his aide.

142
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,920
Could it be

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,440
Li Deyun's daughter?

144
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
Or perhaps it could be

145
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,040
Princess Misha.

146
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
It could even...

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Be you.

148
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,880
Your Majesty.

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,080
I've longed to visit Heng'an.

150
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,600
The grandeur of Changming Palace

151
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,680
has amazed me.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
Could I stay here

153
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,640
for a couple of days?

154
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,200
After all,

155
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,480
you saved my aunt.

156
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,040
You may stay

157
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,040
for as long as you wish.

158
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

159
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,800
I heard of Your Majesty's
splendid archery skill.

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
I love practicing archery too.

161
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,120
Do I have the honor of having a match

162
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,240
with Your Majesty?

163
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,080
His Majesty is still recovering

164
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,080
from the injury.

165
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
Perhaps I could compete
in His Majesty's place.

166
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,880
Why you?

167
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,320
She is the Sword Bearer

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,000
and also my disciple.

169
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,560
Very well.

170
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
I shall

171
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,000
test my skill

172
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
against the Sword Bearer.

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,880
However,

174
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
if she loses,

175
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,840
I hope Your Majesty and I
could have a rematch

176
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,520
after your recovery.

177
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,120
Make sure you win this.

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes.

179
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

180
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,560
Do well.

181
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,080
Do not let me down.

182
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,680
As per your order,

184
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,920
I searched the Jingzhou Relay Station.

185
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,720
I found this

186
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
inside Misha's room.

187
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,920
It's kumis?

188
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
Impressive.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,680
This pouch

190
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
contained kumis,

191
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
a product of Lucong.

192
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,480
Thank you for the arrow.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,000
Something is wrong
with Princess Ninghe's wound.

194
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,800
Am I right?

195
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,480
There was no poison on the sword.

196
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,720
The cut isn't very deep.

197
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,080
Yet, she doesn't wake up.

198
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,880
It's the scent of kumis.

199
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Kumis.

200
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,760
Is she intoxicated?

201
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,160
The wound was cleaned.

202
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,080
The scent and traces are minimal.

203
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,880
Why did they come here?

204
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
In the palace,

205
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,080
it's hard to continue intoxicating her.

206
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,840
They won't have to.

207
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
And she won't wake up either.

208
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,600
What do you mean?

209
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,760
She overdosed on alcohol.

210
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
And with the blood loss,

211
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,760
she had a stroke and went into a coma.

212
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,520
(Three qian of Chinese liquorice)
A bunch of worthless physicians.

213
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,760
They said she would be fine in days.

214
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,840
Are you really

215
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,360
not the mastermind?

216
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,840
In your eyes,

217
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
am I really the villain

218
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,040
who would even hurt my family

219
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,200
to reach my goal

220
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
by any means necessary?

221
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,120
Your Majesty.

222
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,200
Princess Misha has shot

223
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,400
seven arrows so far.

224
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,200
And Yu'er hasn't shot one yet.

225
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,000
You're not retaliating.

226
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
Are you mocking me?

227
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,720
I wouldn't dare.

228
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,320
Your arrows are as swift as meteors.

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,920
I could barely dodge your arrows.

230
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,480
I didn't have a chance to retaliate.

231
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,760
Spare me your excuses!

232
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,080
I'll make you

233
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,000
shoot the arrow at me!

234
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,200
(Name list of Zhenwu Officials)

235
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,160
The 500 royal retainers of Zhenwu...

236
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,620
(Commander: Princess Liu Misha)

237
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Liu Misha is a princess.

238
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,320
But Sun Lie gives most of the orders.

239
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
Sun Lie has been

240
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,320
staying in a relay station in Heng'an.

241
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,160
He hasn't left the relay station.

242
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,120
So whose orders are the retainers

243
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
following for the past few days?

244
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,160
My men brought in two retainers

245
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,960
for interrogation.

246
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
Their statements didn't match,

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
but they share one thing in common.

248
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
They have a Military Advisor.

249
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,120
A Military Advisor?

250
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,920
Your Majesty.

251
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,880
This brat has got some moves.

252
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,120
Her trip to Mount Qi

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
has improved her skill substantially.

254
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,920
But Misha...

255
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,760
It's nothing.

256
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,680
Princess Misha,

257
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,599
your archery skill is astounding.

258
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,680
May I know whom you learned it from?

259
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,119
I'm flattered.

260
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,960
Archery techniques from my hometown

261
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,920
have always been remarkable.

262
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,440
Indeed.

263
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,920
Cheng Ruoyu.

264
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,319
You should thank Princess Misha
for showing you mercy.

265
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,880
Much obliged, Princess Misha.

266
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,840
Princess?

267
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,040
Princess?

268
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,880
Excuse us.

269
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,800
Your Majesty,

270
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm sorry we must leave early.

271
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,680
Princess, wait.

272
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,360
Fine.

273
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
I know what you're going to say.

274
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,680
I unknowingly used

275
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
the Military Advisor's Three-way Sunshot

276
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,880
and His Majesty noticed!

277
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,480
I know it was a mistake.

278
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,880
Cheng Ruoyu

279
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
is merely a guard.

280
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,600
If you can't put up with

281
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,400
a mere guard,

282
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,560
you won't rise to become

283
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,320
- the Empress of Daxing.
- You...

284
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,440
Mind your own business.

285
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,360
I wouldn't dare.

286
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I hope you could

287
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,000
reflect on your mistake

288
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,600
and explain it to the Military Advisor.

289
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,920
Sun Lie, how could you...

290
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,840
This is Cheng Ruoyu's fault!

291
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,560
I must thank Your Majesty
for saving my skin.

292
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,280
Three-way Sunshot.

293
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,840
What does it mean?

294
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
The three arrows

295
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,960
Misha shot at you at the end...

296
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,640
It is a technique called
Three-way Sunshot.

297
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,040
It has a name?

298
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,720
But how did you know, Your Majesty?

299
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,680
I must talk to Misha now.

300
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,680
Stay here.

301
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,600
Why?

302
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,520
I'm the Sword Bearer.

303
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,760
Your safety is my responsibility.

304
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm ordering you to stay put.

305
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,000
I...

306
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,560
Stop!

307
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,680
Fine.

308
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,440
Fine, so be it.

309
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
What's the big deal?

310
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,280
Yu'er?

311
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,320
Duke Chu sent his men here.

312
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
His Majesty is away.

313
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,920
I'm not for His Majesty.

314
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,480
I'm here for you,

315
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,640
my little blossom.

316
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,240
Me?

317
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,800
Sir.

318
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Cheng Ruoyu is here.

319
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,160
Greetings, Duke Chu.

320
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,320
How may I be of your service?

321
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,480
It seems like

322
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,320
your martial arts skill
has improved greatly.

323
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,960
Cheng Xi actually taught you
some real deal

324
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,120
instead of

325
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,760
her fancy parlor tricks.

326
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,440
I don't understand.

327
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,760
Please enlighten me.

328
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,800
It's true that you have potential.

329
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,640
I can see now why Yanzhi

330
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,120
kept showing you clemency.

331
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,880
However,

332
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,520
Misha's master is a force
to be reckoned with.

333
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
So it's normal that she can beat you.

334
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,840
If she presents another opportunity,

335
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
you must not be as careless

336
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,880
as you were just now.

337
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,640
You may go now.

338
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,560
Yanzhi.

339
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
See her off.

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

341
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
This is the best spot

342
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
in Changming Palace to admire the moon.

343
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Indeed.

344
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,560
It's like I can pluck the stars
with my hands.

345
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,440
It's also a pleasant place
for a conversation.

346
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
Your Majesty,
you have questions for me?

347
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,840
Who taught you the Three-way Sunshot?

348
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,000
Your Majesty saw right through it.

349
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,680
It was my Military Advisor.

350
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,160
What is the motive?

351
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,120
Guess.

352
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,360
No.

353
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,120
You'd better come clean.

354
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,320
Your Majesty witnessed my prowess.

355
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,520
Well?

356
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,280
Am I better than your Sword Bearer?

357
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,280
Her skill is beneath you, for now.

358
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
But in the future,

359
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,200
she will surpass you.

360
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,000
Is that so?

361
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,840
But she is all alone.

362
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,560
On the other hand...

363
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,400
Your Majesty,

364
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
I have 80,000 soldiers in Zhenwu Army

365
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,440
that matches the might of Shencai Army.

366
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,200
Most importantly,

367
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,600
my soldiers are fearsome and powerful.

368
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,640
Each soldier can take on 100 men.

369
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,000
Your spoiled and corrupted Shencai Army

370
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,080
is no match for us.

371
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,160
Is this a threat?

372
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,760
I'm presenting

373
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
my dowry.

374
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,600
Your dowry?

375
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,880
Is this your intention

376
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,000
or your Military Advisor's plan?

377
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
You can say

378
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
it's both.

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
The main forces of Daxing

380
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,200
are controlled by the eunuchs.

381
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,320
The officers are cowards

382
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,040
and many sided with tyrants.

383
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:51,880
Warlords took over regions

384
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,360
and made themselves rulers.

385
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,280
With issues from all sides...

386
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,240
Your Majesty,

387
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,040
your brother Emperor Wenzong

388
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,520
needed

389
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,800
a capable wife as his aide.

390
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,400
That's how the Morning Dew Rebellion
ended in failure.

391
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,360
If you marry me,

392
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,640
the Zhenwu Army is yours to command.

393
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
(Shameless woman.)

394
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,080
(His Majesty would never agree
to her terms.)

395
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,040
Sure.

396
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,200
I agree with your terms.

397
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,160
You agree?

398
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,480
However,

399
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,000
I must meet the Military Advisor

400
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
before we seal the deal.

401
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,320
Very well.

402
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,480
Good.

403
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
Go get some rest.

404
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,880
Your Majesty, good night.

405
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,640
Come out.

406
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,960
Your Majesty.

407
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,480
What's with that look on your face?

408
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,960
I thought

409
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,840
only Yanzhi could employ a beauty trap.

410
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,360
I didn't expect
you could do the same, Your Majesty.

411
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,960
You were eavesdropping

412
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,040
and now you criticize my decision.

413
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,440
No.

414
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm the Sword Bearer.

415
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,600
It's my duty

416
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,640
to follow you.

417
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,680
Your Majesty.

418
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
Are you...

419
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,520
Really going to marry Princess Misha?

420
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,520
That would be quite a sacrifice to make.

421
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,000
What is this?

422
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,760
This?

423
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
Qiu Ziliang gave me this.

424
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,440
He summoned me to his study.

425
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,440
He even tested my martial arts skill.

426
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,600
He told me Princess Misha was stronger

427
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,080
than me,

428
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,080
that I should beware of her.

429
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,680
That's all?

430
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,200
I am confused too.

431
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,360
Who knows

432
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,480
what that old man is up to?

433
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,560
Let's go.

434
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,960
Where are we going?

435
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Visiting my aunt.

436
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Dismiss.

437
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,160
What's wrong?

438
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
When I was witnessing

439
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,920
the match between
Cheng Ruoyu and Misha,

440
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,920
I was thinking...

441
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,760
Perhaps things would be better,

442
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,880
had the Left Knight not shot that arrow

443
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
at you.

444
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,040
I can never be a warrior.

445
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,760
You must be very disappointed.

446
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,600
Cheng Ruoyu

447
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,680
has outstanding talents.

448
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,240
It will be a wise move

449
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,520
to make her your subordinate.

450
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,040
But I haven't convinced her yet.

451
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,240
She serves nothing more

452
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,680
than to monitor Qi Yan.

453
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,480
Did it cross your mind that His Majesty

454
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,760
was very fond of this girl?

455
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,640
Aren't you worried?

456
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,640
You summoned

457
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,080
Cheng Ruoyu to your study.

458
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,120
I failed to see the reason.

459
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,600
Please enlighten me.

460
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,560
If Cheng Ruoyu was merely a
skilled fighter,

461
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,680
keeping her next to His Majesty

462
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
would be a wise move.

463
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,680
However,

464
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
she is also a beautiful young lady.

465
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,320
Keeping her

466
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,520
next to the young and passionate Emperor

467
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
might invite troubles in the future.

468
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,320
I doubt she would become

469
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,800
an obstacle in my plan

470
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,760
to become the empress.

471
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,520
Is that so?

472
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,880
When I first met her three months ago,

473
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,040
I didn't expect

474
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,080
her martial arts prowess

475
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,240
would improve at such an
incredible pace.

476
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,560
Honestly,

477
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,640
my point is that

478
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,600
eliminating a powerful rival

479
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,440
can be very simple.

480
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,200
Before the rival becomes too powerful,

481
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,480
take her out.

482
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,400
Is that clear?

483
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,480
Yes.

484
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,360
I understand.

485
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,120
I'm glad you do.

486
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,480
You may go now.

487
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,520
Keep an eye on Yanzhi.

488
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,720
(Chess of Generals Camp, Right Advisor)

489
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,040
Your Majesty.

490
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,720
Uncle.

491
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,880
How is she now?

492
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
So,

493
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,840
they used kumis

494
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,520
to intoxicate my aunt

495
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,280
and stabbed her with a sword,

496
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,040
which caused great blood loss

497
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,280
and sent her into a coma.

498
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,080
Do you have any evidence?

499
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
Without Yanzhi's
incredible sense of smell,

500
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
I wouldn't have noticed it.

501
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,480
But Your Majesty,

502
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,560
we can't accuse Zhenwu

503
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,160
of this planned attack.

504
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,480
Doing so

505
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,200
won't benefit them at all.

506
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,720
Unless,

507
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,000
they want to wage war on Heng'an.

508
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,400
I understand.

509
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm counting on you to look after

510
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,200
my aunt.

511
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,920
I will get to the bottom of this

512
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,200
and bring the culprits to justice.

513
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Yes.

514
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,640
Dismiss.

515
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,720
Yes.

516
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,240
Dismiss.

517
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,200
Yes.

518
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,120
Cheng Ruoyu.

519
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,120
Come forth.

520
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,120
Your Majesty.

521
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,880
Is it gorgeous?

522
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,600
Yes.

523
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,720
I mean the flower.

524
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
The flower is gorgeous.

525
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,880
This flower

526
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,280
is a gift from Qiu Ziliang.

527
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,760
What was his intention?

528
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,440
I have no idea.

529
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,600
This is our national flower.

530
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,000
It symbolizes the "Empress."

531
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,680
Me?

532
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,920
I never knew Qiu Ziliang

533
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
had good taste in women.

534
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,640
I was kidding.

535
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,520
I mean,

536
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,480
he is very paranoid.

537
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,960
Qiu Ziliang is showing his goodwill.

538
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,320
If you want to be my empress,

539
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,520
he is willing to help you.

540
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,280
No.

541
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,440
This is also

542
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,680
his warning for me.

543
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,200
He gets to decide...

544
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,880
Who becomes my wife.

545
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,960
Cheng Ruoyu, listen closely.

546
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,440
You are the Sword Bearer
of the Violet Bureau.

547
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,160
We can never fall in love.

548
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,120
I will never have
any love interest in you.

549
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,320
I shall keep that in mind.

550
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,040
Dismiss.

551
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,240
Yes.

552
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,440
Come here.

553
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,120
Uncle.

554
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,960
What's wrong?

555
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,120
Yu'er.

556
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,120
My brilliant niece.

557
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,440
This is a critical moment

558
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,800
of your life,

559
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,560
do you get it?

560
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,880
I don't.

561
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,880
Now, listen to me.

562
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,600
My men

563
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,440
are spying on the people from Zhenwu.

564
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,440
It's a breaking news.

565
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,560
What was her name again?

566
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,600
The girl, Princess Misha,

567
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,080
wants to marry His Majesty.

568
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,280
You knew it?

569
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,960
Of course.

570
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,840
Aren't you worried?

571
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,360
Worried?

572
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,000
Why should I?

573
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,720
Uncle!

574
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
Even you thought His Majesty and I

575
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,880
are secretly in love?

576
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
Trust me,

577
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,440
it's not true.

578
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,000
But you two

579
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,120
have done all sorts of things together.

580
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
We were putting up an act.

581
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,200
You know about it too.

582
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,400
An act?

583
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,800
Anyway,

584
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,800
whoever His Majesty wants to marry

585
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,200
and whoever is marrying him

586
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,000
are none of my business.

587
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,840
Is that clear?

588
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,000
Are you sure?

589
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,960
Give me a break.

590
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,000
No one gets it.

591
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,000
Leave me alone!

592
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,760
But this and that...

593
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,960
The acting was too convincing.

594
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,920
Come out.

595
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,120
Your Majesty.

596
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,040
Why are you here?

597
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
The Chess Overseer

598
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
has a question for Your Majesty.

599
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,320
But now,

600
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,000
I already got the answer.

601
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,040
Really?

602
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,600
He thinks

603
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,640
you like Cheng Ruoyu.

604
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,360
But he already

605
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,160
arranged another candidate

606
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,200
to be your wife.

607
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,560
The Chess Overseer
sent me to confirm it.

608
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,000
Your Majesty,

609
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,120
you have clearly made a choice.

610
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,800
I'm not in love with her.

611
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
I've never thought about

612
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,080
making her my wife.

613
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,760
Very wise indeed.

614
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,760
I shall

615
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,520
report back to my duty.

616
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,560
Who is the candidate

617
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,720
Duke Chu has in mind?

618
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,080
Who is the candidate?

619
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,400
Your Majesty already got the answer.

620
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,120
Your Majesty.

621
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,240
What have you found?

622
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,200
Please, have a look.

623
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,040
Han Ding?

624
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,170
(Yue Han, appointed as
Military Advisor of Zhenwu)

625
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,400
(Qi Yan's personal guard, Han Ding)

626
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,750
(Capable of manipulating the Princess)

627
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,480
It's him.

628
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,640
Cheng Ruoyu.

629
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,800
Your Majesty.

630
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,520
You have a habit

631
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,640
of eavesdropping.

632
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,280
No.

633
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,280
I thought this man

634
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,240
was an assassin.

635
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,320
Forgive me, it was my mistake.

636
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,160
What did you hear?

637
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,360
Your Majesty.

638
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,600
She might be a spy

639
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
sent by Cheng Xi.

640
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,520
Your Majesty,

641
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,920
I am not a spy.

642
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,560
Your Majesty.

643
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,120
She followed me numerous times.

644
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,200
And she sneaks around

645
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,040
in the name of security.

646
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Her intention is vile.

647
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
She cannot be trusted!

648
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,320
You...

649
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,800
Your Majesty,

650
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,200
do you think so as well?

651
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,960
The 300 people of Yuzhen Hall
have entered the Capital.

652
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,440
From tomorrow on,

653
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,400
return to the Violet Bureau

654
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,280
to settle them down.

655
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,120
When I have need of you,

656
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,360
you will be summoned.

657
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,480
Your Majesty!

658
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,200
Go.

659
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,720
Yes.

660
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
Your wish is my command.

661
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Now that we can identify

662
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,480
who the culprit is,

663
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,640
where is the culprit?

664
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,920
He didn't come

665
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,840
to the Capital with

666
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
royal retainers of Zhenwu.

667
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,880
My men are searching

668
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,040
for his whereabouts.

669
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,400
Be quick.

670
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,160
I'm tired of

671
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,040
playing Liu Misha's games.

672
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,600
Your Majesty, I'm afraid you

673
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
must endure her tantrum for some days.

674
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,760
I don't make a move

675
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,600
unless they do.

676
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
Qiu Ziliang is monitoring

677
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,480
Zhenwu's every move.

678
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,000
If we use this chance

679
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,080
to merge

680
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,840
the Yuzhen Hall back

681
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,040
into the Violet Bureau,

682
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,440
the Bureau

683
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,600
will be a valuable asset.

684
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,240
Your Majesty,

685
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,440
from what I see, you should

686
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
tell Miss Cheng everything.

687
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,960
It's for the better.

688
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,320
Then she won't

689
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,280
mistake you as a villain.

690
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,880
Qiu Ziliang used

691
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
a peony blossom to sound me out.

692
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,760
But it was a warning.

693
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,600
Should I make Cheng Ruoyu

694
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,600
the Sword Bearer

695
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,120
or the future empress?

696
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Before that,

697
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,000
the thought never even crossed my mind.

698
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,560
So

699
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,640
what about now?

700
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,360
I must remind myself at all times

701
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,800
to never think about this question.

702
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,120
(It seems like)

703
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,160
(Cheng Ruoyu)

704
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,200
(is more than)

705
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,400
(a mere Sword Bearer.)

706
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,040
And you said I was your sword

707
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,280
and your final lifesaver.

708
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,680
What kind of man

709
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,280
would suspect his own sword?

710
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,160
You're putting everything you have

711
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,640
on the line,

712
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,080
while standing on countless bodies

713
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,920
to reach this part of the game

714
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,800
for the one and only

715
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,840
fighting chance.

716
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,560
If your heart

717
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,240
shows any weakness,

718
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,360
negligence

719
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,920
or doubts,

720
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,080
you will lose the game.

721
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,320
I...

722
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,120
I can't afford to lose.
