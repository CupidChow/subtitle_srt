00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,430
♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,530
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,530
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,740
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,910
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,530
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,270
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,790
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:30,910
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,750
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

14
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,220
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:51,050
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

16
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,520
♫ Dawn... ♫

00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,600
[Episode 9]

19
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,580
What are you playing with here?

20
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,520
Why didn't you take me along?

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,630
Which one of your eyes sees me playing?

22
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,330
To me, you look like you are enjoying yourself.

23
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,920
Swinging about, are you treating this as a swing?

24
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,980
Hurry and pull me up.

25
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,110
I can do that.

26
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,540
However, you must first answer a question.

27
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,490
Am I handsome or is your younger cousin handsome?

28
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,800
You are handsome.

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,830
Is she serious?

30
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,090
Can you pull me up now?

31
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,560
All right.

32
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,670
Gentle.

33
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,180
Come on.

34
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,360
Thank you.

35
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,180
I didn't want to carry you.

36
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,470
I meant, for saving me.

37
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,740
Then you do need to thank me.

38
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,720
A bunch of useless things.

39
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,010
How can you not be able to find them after so long?

40
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,520
Second Master, you know of De Shengchang's capabilities.

41
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,080
If they truly want to hide someone, then it will surely be difficult to find the person.

42
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,110
We've searched all the side courts that the Fang family owns in Zezhou.

43
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,190
There is no trace of Young Master.

44
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,710
Unless,

45
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,550
they left Zezhou to go to a place in the countryside.

46
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,260
Or they went somewhere even farther away.

47
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,770
Farther away?

48
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,940
Not possible.

49
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,860
Physician Sun would not lie to me.

50
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,040
Chengyu is already at the end of his life.

51
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,630
Based on his body's condition, he can't withstand a rough journey.

52
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,440
The old residences in the outskirts are possible places. Quickly get men to investigate those places.

53
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,770
Hurry.

54
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,220
Yes.

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you tired? Let me down and rest for a bit.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,610
I am not tired.

57
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,260
Is your foot better?

58
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,500
A bit better.

59
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,160
How did you find me?

60
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,760
I have accepted your money so I reluctantly came to find you.

61
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,240
Don't think too much of it.

62
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,340
I beg you.

63
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,460
- All right but don't speak.
- Just for a little bit.

64
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,520
Who else will spoil you like me?

65
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
Hurry, hurry.

66
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,390
A little bit higher.

67
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,210
I am the one doing the heavy labor yet I am not sighing.

68
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,170
Yet, you, who are enjoying yourself, are sighing.

69
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,570
I just remembered some things from the past.

70
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,870
Speaking of the past,

71
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,420
did Jiuling ever mention me to you?

72
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,990
Of course.

73
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,630
What did she say?

74
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,600
She said...

75
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,970
you always spoiled her.

76
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,190
You are her best elder brother.

77
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,850
How was I spoiling her?

78
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,880
She was merely being herself.

79
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,730
Every time I saw her,

80
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,820
I felt very content.

81
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,410
Just for that mere flower.

82
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,650
- Is it necessary?
- What do you mean a mere flower?

83
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,020
This is not just a mere flower.

84
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,530
This is a very precious medicinal herb. It is very difficult to find.

85
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,180
Immortal violet blossom.

86
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,840
- What are you doing?
- This is immortal violet blossom?

87
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,550
Return it to me. It is very important to me.

88
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,680
What do you want it for?

89
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,600
It is also very important to me.

90
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Can you let me have it?

91
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,350
All right.

92
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,850
I'll give it to you.

93
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,340
Let's go.

94
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,780
Don't you need me to carry you?

95
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,100
No need.

96
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,980
- Let's step forward.
- No need, no need.

97
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,840
Miss, you are back?

98
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,900
What is wrong with your foot? How did you get hurt?

99
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,320
It's nothing. I twisted it slightly.

100
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,780
Young Master Ling, did you not protect my miss?

101
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,250
Don't you wrongly accuse a good person.

102
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,710
She twisted it by herself while picking herbs.

103
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,400
Zhenzhen, are you all right?

104
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,060
Of course, I am all right.

105
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,500
It's a tiny bit less painful than your medicinal bath.

106
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,480
Is it that painful?

107
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,270
Do you finally admit that the medicinal bath is painful?

108
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,810
Second Brother!

109
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,860
Second Brother!

110
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,150
What is he doing here?

111
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,350
He finished his errands, so naturally, he's here.

112
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,660
One more person means one more set of hands.

113
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,570
Plus, there are no extra costs.

114
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,660
Miss Jun, we meet again.

115
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,000
Master Lei.

116
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,070
- We'd better get going now.
- Sure.

117
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,990
- Get on the horses. Let's go!
- Okay!

118
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,490
Come on. Let me help you.

119
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,910
This embroidery is not bad.

120
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,210
What is it?

121
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,570
Mother.

122
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,360
Who made you mad again?

123
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,970
None other than that senseless Jun Zhenzhen.

124
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,470
I can't believe my grandmother.

125
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,930
If Physician Sun cannot treat him, then we could ask another physician.

126
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,330
How could she let Jun Zhenzhen leave with my brother?

127
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,750
Ridiculous!

128
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,980
Your grandmother was left with no choice

129
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,630
but to use the Master's strategy.

130
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,920
I wonder if my younger brother's stay has been arranged at the old residence to the east of the city.

131
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,640
It's very windy and cold at this time of the year there.

132
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,510
Old residence to the east of the city?

133
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,080
I'm not sure whether they are going there.

134
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,850
I just happened to see Shaoyao

135
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,950
secretly pack Chengyu's clothes and head east.

136
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,190
Whether that is true or not, just pretend you did not see anything.

137
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,170
Didn't the Master say?

138
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,690
It is best that the people of the Fang family not know about Chengyu's whereabouts.

139
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:55,010
I understand, Mother. I just came to vent a bit.

140
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,000
I didn't even mention it to Yuxiu.

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,420
I know you're mature.

142
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,720
It's too late now. Mother, don't embroider anymore, or you'll hurt your eyes.

143
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,140
All right. I'll do as you say.

144
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,250
Okay. Go now.

145
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,470
Hurry and go tell Second Master Song about this news.

146
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,010
Yes.

147
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,450
Zhenzhen's plan indeed works.

148
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,080
The fox's tail has been revealed immediately.

149
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,460
Miss Jun, we've entered Ru'nan City.

150
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,070
Miss, we're home now.

151
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,220
Ru'nan, Master, Zhenzhen.

152
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,630
I've come home for you all.

153
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,300
What is it, Zhenzhen?

154
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,900
I'm fine.

155
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,240
Did you recall something?

156
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,850
Nothing much.

157
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,930
What happened?

158
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,200
Why did our Jun family's Jiuling Hall end up like this?

159
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,170
This plaque was passed down by our ancestors.

160
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,880
How did it end up in ruins like this?

161
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,610
Jiuling Hall. Jiuling. It looks like everything is destined.

162
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,700
Not only do I have a medicinal hall passed down by ancestors,

163
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,380
but the name Jiuling has been returned to me now.

164
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,200
Since this is my destiny,

165
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,900
I will reopen Jiuling Hall in Ru'nan.

166
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,770
From now on, when I go to the capital, I can do so using my identity as a physician.

167
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,780
It will be safer that way.

Who are you all?

169

Are you interested in this land?

170
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,750
Let me be frank.

171
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,560
The Jun family's land was sold to me long ago.

172
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,730
It's now mine.

173
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,190
Nonsense! Miss may not recognize you but would I not recognize you?

174
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,410
The Jun family's deed is still in our Miss's hands. Who sold you the land?

175
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,380
Who sold it to me?

176
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,690
The old servant of your family who guarded it sold it.

177
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,510
However, speaking of,

178

I don't care what descendants you are.

179
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,230
I've already paid the money

180
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,440
so this land naturally belongs to me. What are you going to do about it?

181
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,850
Miss, he's a notorious thug.

182
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,780
Obviously, he wants to occupy the Jun family's ancestral property.

183
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,060
I can give up the land

184
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,790
but I want this plaque.

[Jiuling Hall]

186
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,480
With the Jun family's Jiuling Hall gone, what's the point of keeping this broken plaque?

187
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,120
- Exactly.
- Right?

188

She doesn't want the large residence but wants the broken plaque.

This lady is sensible.

190
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,330
So reasonable.

Who says Jiuling Hall is gone?

192
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,210
From today onward, Jiuling Hall will reopen.

193

I'm Jiuling, so let's call you Ling Jiu. All right?

195
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,920
From now on, Jiuling Hall shall treat complicated illnesses

It cannot be wrong, Second Master. She's indeed Eldest Madam.

She changed her makeup and wore a hood.

She secretly left from the back door and headed to the eastern outskirts.

It looks like Mujin is right.

why don't we give him a hand?

I want to ask you about something.

331

Did you know that the Jun family reopened Jiuling Hall?

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,870
This is our first time in Ru'nan.

334

You are here to see a physician, right?

335

Yes. Yes.

She's a descendant of the Jun family.

Her medical skills are not bad at all.

Uncle, were you really a servant of the Jun family?

340
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,060
Of course.

341
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,250
I worked for the Jun family for years.

342

It's no longer what it was before.

343
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,990
The old residence is gone, and everyone has left.

344
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,840
Otherwise, I wouldn't have left the Jun residence.

345
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,430
There is no one in charge of the family.

346
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,070
It's understandable to want to find a way out.

347
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,660
Uncle, are you familiar with Miss Jun?

348
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,500
Of course.

349
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,740
Even though I left the residence many years ago,

350
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,500
she's already grown into a graceful young lady now.

351
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,400
She's the same as she was as a child.

352
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,330
She was so cordial to me when she was young.

Being able to see her again now,

354

I can rest assured.

From then on, he became famous in Ru'nan.

However, three years ago, he became strangely ill.

00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,950
I know.

484
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,540
There are some things you should learn to forget.

485
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,600
Forget?

486
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,270
Everyone wants me to forget her.

487
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,500
Even you want me to forget her.

488
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,060
♫ When I meet you again, love settles down ♫

489
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,310
Have you forgotten her then?

490
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,980
♫ This kiss puts us through thick and thin ♫

491
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:28,790
♫ Call my name again to cure my loneliness ♫

492
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,330
♫ The art of healing become edges used to guard
the mountains and rivers ♫

493
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,590
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

494
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,940
She passed away at such a young age.

495
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,430
Everyone has forgotten her

496
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,000
and wants to wipe out her existence.

497
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,210
If even I forget her,

498
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,270
how lonely would she be?

499
00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:03,750
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regard, waiting for dawn ♫

500
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:09,310
♫ Dawn... ♫

[Fang Residence]

502
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,030
It's so late. Mother, why are you here?

503
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,740
Su Qi, I do not understand.

504
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,930
The Fang family treats you well. Why did you do this?

505
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,660
I was forced.

506
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,320
Who ordered you to do such things? Was my son Nianjun killed by you?

507
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,460
No! No!

508
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,150
I did not kill him, it was—

509
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,320
Hurry up and look! Go!

510
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,050
Say, who ordered you to do such things?

511
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,830
Tell me! Who gave you orders?

512
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,410
Hurry!

513
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,200
Spare Jinxiu.

514
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,090
Go and look over there!

515
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,030
Mujin, who are you?

516
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,980
Who ordered you to kill Madam Su?

517
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,050
Old Madam, there was poison hidden in her teeth. It's too late.

518
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,510
Mother!

519
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,580
Mother!

520
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,660
Lock up Jinxiu.

521
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,470
Without my permission, nobody is allowed to see her.

522
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,880
Yes.

523
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,970
Go to the eastern outskirts.

524
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,240

♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

526
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,240
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

527
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,330
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

528
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:28,050
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

529

♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

530
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:39,800
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

531
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,850
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

532

♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

535
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,880
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

536
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,420
♫ If memories could speak ♫

537
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,370
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

538
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:16,430
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

545
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:11,950
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

551
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,560
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

552
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,880
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

553
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,920
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

554
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:50,090
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
