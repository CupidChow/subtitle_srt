[Episode 37]

19
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,600
What's the status of the task I handed over to you?

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,010
Due to the division of De Shengchang, Jun Jiuling has returned to Zezhou.

21
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,150
I have ordered Jin Shiba to go there.

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,300
The Fang family has failed and the Zhu family has collapsed.

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,020
This is a good opportunity.

24
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,290
We can't miss out on it anymore.

25
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,810
Yes.

26
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,760
Absolutely right.

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,150
The other places need to be monitored tightly.

28
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,750
Understood!

29
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,370
Greetings, Marquis Qinghe.

30
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,920
Since General Wei is here, tell him to go to the Yongjing Army.

31
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,120
- Lead your subordinates to Jiaohe.
- Understood.

32
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,850
My Lord, we have been deploying our soldiers frequently.

33
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,750
I think if we place our troops on defense on such a large scale,

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,060
we may provide Northern Qi with an opportunity.

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,860
General Wei, are you implying that Marquis Qinghe's defense is not comparable to Duke Cheng's arrangement?

36
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,370
This is not what I meant.

37
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,440
Are you implying...

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,260
you are reluctant to be deployed?

39
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,000
My Lord, it's not that I'm reluctant to be deployed.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,210
It's just that your deployment doesn't seem to be for defense. It's more for...

41
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,130
disarming and dividing the power of the army.

42
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,280
This...

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,990
My Lord, this is a taboo for the direct line of descendants of Duke Cheng.

44
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,850
I can understand that you are suppressing me,

45
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,440
but the people in Northern Qi are eyeing us covetously. We must not panic.

46
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,180
Arrest him.

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,920
Sir!

48
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,350
General Wei, do you know...

49
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,650
why Duke Cheng escaped from the capital?

50
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,640
Because he knows that the North is his kingdom.

51
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,830
Just because you are here,

52
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,630
he's convinced that he can definitely seek shelter here.

53
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,240
No. We are officials and soldiers of Tianyou.

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,680
If Duke Cheng is guilty, we will never protect each other.

55
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,970
Many officials and soldiers in the North were once under Duke Cheng.

56
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,470
- Enough!
- Let's go!

57
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,070
- My Lord.
- Let's go now.

58
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,480
- My Lord.
- Let's go.

59
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,740
- Let's go.
- My Lord!

60
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,920
Looks like as long as Zhu Shan doesn't fall into our net,

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,290
there won't be any peace in the North.

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,650
Who else doesn't want to obey military orders?

63
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,720
His Majesty has declared to the kingdom that

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,730
we have been convicted of treason.

65
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,360
Whoever sees us, can behead us in public.

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,800
In the future, every province

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,640
and city will be difficult for us to pass through.

68
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,880
No matter how difficult it was, we were fearless.

69
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,650
As long as the family was together, we could cross any hurdles.

70
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,910
However, this time, we have implicated Miss Jun.

71
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,860
That's right.

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,550
We should have resolved their marriage agreement earlier.

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,200
We dragged her into this.

74
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,370
Father. Mother. Don't blame yourselves.

75
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,970
Who can foresee the future?

76
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,280
Besides, she's a country princess

77
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,900
and a miracle physician. She will avert disaster, right?

78
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,520
I hope so.

79
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,230
Your Majesty, Marquis Qinghe replaced his defense without authority.

80
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,650
Crown Prince Yu Chihai of Northern Qi led his army to conduct a sudden assault and seized the opportunity.

81
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,200
Marquis Qinghe has fallen under the siege of Northern Qi's army. We lost news about him.

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Half of the previously arranged reinforcements

83
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,830
can't be accounted for.

84
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,160
What's happening?

85
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,920
How can this happen?

86
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,870
I don't want to know why they went back against their words.

87
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,170
I also don't want to know who committed the mistake.

88
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,200
I only want to know if they can be stopped.

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,300
The Northern Army has been divided among three routes to intercept the Northern Qi troops.

90
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,430
In addition, the commanders of Shandong and Shanxi rushed to help.

91
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,380
The two armies are in Hebei. We must totally wipe them out.

92
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,640
That's to say, we still didn't stop them.

93
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,110
A bunch of useless creatures!

94
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,070
Your Majesty, don't be angry!

95
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,100
My Lord, go in and take a break.

96
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,550
- How long has it been?
- Six days.

97
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,330
Based on the pre-deployment, the reinforcements should have been here earlier.

98
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,060
What do you mean? Speak now.

99
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,350
My Lord, we just received news that

100
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,140
our troops along the three routes absconded.

101
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,760
What?

102
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,580
These bunch of scoundrels. How many absconded?

103
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,930
Ten thousand from the east route, twenty thousand from the west route,

104
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,090
the south route... twenty thousand from the south route, too.

105
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,840
- A total of 100,000 reinforcements from those three routes and we are down by half. How can we fight?
- That's right.

106
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,630
When did those officials and soldiers in the North turn into such cowards?

107
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,660
They are not cowards.

108
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,790
Even if they wanted to abscond, it can't be that many at once.

109
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,830
I fear they followed another military order.

110
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,130
- Duke Cheng?
- That's right.

111
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,950
The only one who can make them so bold is Duke Cheng.

112
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,470
Yes, it's Duke Cheng.

113
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,360
Zhu Shan,

114
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,590
are you trying to kill us?

115
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,580
Duke Cheng, excluding the 30,000 soldiers and horses who are rushing to the capital,

116
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,080
there are still 20,000 waiting for your instructions

117
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,570
to rob the rations of the Northern Qi's army. We will meet up tonight.

118
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,090
Excellent. After we have assembled,

119
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,750
rescue Marquis Qinghe immediately

120
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,210
Understood.

121
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,180
It hasn't been easy for him to stand firm and defend for so long.

122
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,900
Will he convict you of privately deploying the troops?

123
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,350
So be it. I did the same, too.

124
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,420
Duke Cheng, you did this

125
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,400
because Marquis Qinghe deployed his troops without authorization to create disaster.

126
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,830
Without your deployment, we would have lost the state war earlier.

127
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,710
But is he willing to learn from this lesson?

128
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,570
Father, we can give them a taste of their own medicine.

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,390
Zan'er, explain.

130
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,680
Northern Qi is doing its best to raise the power of their country.

131
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,750
They will definitely want to smash our line of defense.

132
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,880
There must be some internal void in their defense troops that is not that tight.

133
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,490
I want to penetrate into the enemy's territory to assassinate the emperor of Northern Qi,

134
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,370
to solve our situation.

135
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,370
No. It's too risky for you to go alone.

136
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,300
Father, we can't hesitate anymore.

137
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,150
This is our only strategy now.

138
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,720
Duke Cheng, I'm willing to go with Heir Apparent.

139
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,930
Duke Cheng. Madam. We will protect Second Brother and bring him home safely.

140
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,930
We escaped death under the hands of His Majesty. Would we still fear that we won't succeed with the emperor of Northern Qi?

141
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,680
Father, I have been with you in the army since childhood.

142
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,080
I know what I should do and shouldn't do. I won't be reckless.

143
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,990
Zan'er.

144
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,700
All right, but you must come back safe and sound.

145
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,380
Zan'er,

146
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,210
promise me. Regardless if you succeed or not,

147
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,970
you must come home safe and sound.

148
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,870
All right. Don't worry.

149
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,070
Father. Mother. I'm not filial for going ahead first.

150
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,200
Father. Mother. Take care.

151
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,810
Son.

152
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,670
Father, I'm leaving.

153
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,370
You must come back safe and sound.

154
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,830
Don't worry.

155
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,070
Zan'er has fought with me since childhood. I believe he will come back safe and sound.

156
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,570
If he succeeds in the assassination,

157
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,410
I will rush back to the capital and you will remain in the North.

158
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,720
If it's the will of Heaven,

159
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,720
we will meet again in the North.

160
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,760
For decades, we have

161
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,770
supported each other and have been united as one.

162
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,460
If you are really afraid that I will worry,

163
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,540
you and Zan'er must survive.

164
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,380
I promise you.

165
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Zhu Zan, are you doing well in the North?

166
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,600
Jiuling, are you doing well in the capital?

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,500
I know it's extremely dangerous for me to go and I may not be able to return. But with you here,

168
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,600
I will hang in there and come back to see you.

169
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,100
Wait for me, Jiuling. Wait for me.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
My Lord, from my observation, the encirclement in the West is weak. Why don't I wait

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,400
to escort you out from the siege? Where there is life, there's hope.

172
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm willing to remain here to resist the enemy, fight through the siege for you and take revenge.

173
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,600
Absurd. When have I ever escaped when the enemy was in front of me?

174
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,000
My Lord, you are not fleeing from the battle. It's not worth it for you to die this way.

175
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,900
That's right, My Lord. It's not worth it.

176
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
My Lord, think carefully again before taking action.

177
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,900
- My Lord, leave now...
- Enough!

178
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,000
It's important to fight a defensive battle without a break.

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,600
If we break through the siege and this leaks out,

180
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,000
my army will immediately be defeated and scattered. Everyone will abscond.

181
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
When that time comes,

182
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,600
the army of Northern Qi will advance here without stopping and head straight to the capital.

183
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,000
Have you thought of this aftermath?

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,400
The enemy is powerful.

185
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,200
I only need to stay calm and hold on to the camp. Compared to escaping to the wilderness,

186
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,400
there are more hopes for survival.

187
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
When the reinforcements are here, we can do a flank attack

188
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,300
and fight our way out.

189
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,500
- Yes!
- Yes!

190
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
Report!

191
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,000
My Lord, the reinforcements... the reinforcements are here.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Great.

193
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,000
My Lord, the reinforcements are late and caused you to be stranded by the siege.

194
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,600
Zhu Shan, do you think you can earn merits to redeem your crime by doing this?

195
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,200
You privately deployed officials and soldiers and placed me in danger.

196
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,400
You detachedly watched our battle with the Northern Qi's army.

197
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,000
You waited till both parties were exhausted and suddenly fell from the sky.

198
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Is this how you earned your heroic and reputable name?

199
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,800
My Lord, it's not like this.

200
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,400
Duke Cheng deployed us because he guessed the plot of Northern Qi.

201
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,800
That's why we led soldiers to Mount Song to rob the rations of the Northern Qi's army.

202
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Duke Cheng intercepted the reinforcements in the north wing.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Duke Cheng instructed us to attack Northern Qi in the right wing.

204
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,400
My Lord, we were blocked and attacked by Northern Qi and couldn't advance or retreat. Duke Cheng rescued us.

205
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,100
Get up.

206
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,600
So, you already guessed the plot of the Northern Qi's army in advance.

207
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,000
So, to say, you guessed that I would be ambushed by the Northern Qi's army?

208
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400
Yes, I did.

209
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,200
- Why didn't you mention this to me...
- Sir,

210
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,000
now's not the time to argue about this. The top priority now is to rush to rescue the capital.

211
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Rush to rescue the capital?

212
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
How can this be?

213
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,700
Is Northern Qi attacking the capital?

214
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,500
The 60,000 cavalries of Northern Qi have already arrived at the east of the capital.

215
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,400
What?

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,300
We are doomed. So, the goal of Northern Qi

217
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,000
was not the northern territory but the capital instead.

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
60,000 cavalries? The capital is doomed.

219
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
It will not be the end of the capital.

220
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
When you were stranded by the siege,

221
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I already instructed the soldiers and horses at Suning Pass to head to the capital.

222
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm worried there's insufficient time.

223
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
The only hope now is that

224
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,800
they can hold on till our reinforcement arrives.

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,400
What has the military defense been doing?

226
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,000
Why did they allow the commander of Northern Qi's army to ride to the South?

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Your Majesty, after we lost communication with Marquis Qinghe,

228
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
it has been difficult to grasp news from the frontline.

229
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Your Majesty, please order the troops from the eastern route to resist the enemy and defend themselves till death.

230
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Permission given. Include the troops from the western route to form an overall defense.

231
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,800
Understood.

232
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Is there any reply from the Northern Qi's envoy?

233
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
We sent them letters but there were no replies.

234
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,800
Your Majesty, I'm willing to go to Northern Qi to negotiate with them.

235
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
I will wait for your good news.

236
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,800
I will do my best.

237
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Your Majesty, the North can't be without a general for a day. Please give Duke Cheng a chance.

238
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Are you telling me to hand over the army in the North to a criminal who's convicted of treason?

239
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
And then, wait for him to head south with the iron cavalry of Northern Qi

240
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
to engulf the capital?

241
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Your Majesty, Duke Cheng is not this kind of person.

242
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,190
I believe there's a misunderstanding.

243
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
This means I'm wrong.

244
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,400
Of course, Your Majesty is not wrong.

245
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,650
The one who's wrong is Duke Cheng who committed treason

246
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,000
and Lord Ning who made a verbal mistake.

247
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,200
Uncle.

248
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Move aside.

249
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,600
What happened?

250
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
Lord, the army from Northern Qi is here.

251
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,000
We couldn't resist the enemy along the eastern and western routes to the capital. We were ambushed.

252
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Lord Lu,

253
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
the army from Northern Qi is here.

254
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,700
Leave now.

255
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,200
Leave now.

256
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
What are you doing?

257
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,200
Come with me! They are about to invade the capital.

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
Northern Qi fought their way in?

259
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,400
It's said that the spy bribed the officials and soldiers

260
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,900
to open the gate of Baimang City. In order to cover up his crime, Marquis Qinghe

261
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,000
intends to frame Duke Cheng.

262
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,700
Come! If we don't go now, it'll be too late.

263
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,300
Wait, wait! I can't go.

264
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,170
You don't know how critical the situation is now?

265
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,400
Northern Qi planned and deployed all their garrisons.

266
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,000
The eastern route to the capital is now empty and defenseless. Lord Han has sent the troops there.

267
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,200
However, breaking into the city is only a matter of time.

268
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,800
The capital's defense is still stable.

269
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,200
Besides, it's guarded by the Forbidden Army. We won't have any problems.

270
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
We cannot wait!

271
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Your Majesty is leaving!

272
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,500
Chu Rang is leaving?

273
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,800
Once the emperor is gone, the people will naturally be demoralized.

274
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
The city cannot be defended anymore.

275
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,400
That is why I want you to leave now!

276
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,600
Only when you are at my side, will you be safe.

277
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,200
What are you hesitating for? Leave!

278
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,100
Today you have to leave whether you want to or not!

279
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,800
Lu Yunqi!

280
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,500
I want to defend Imperial Father's country.

281
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,000
At that time, Imperial Father swore in Qingshan that

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,800
he would protect the country's prosperity and the well-being of the people.

283
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,400
Royal Father has passed away but I can't forget his oath.

284
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,400
Jiuling...

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you finally admitted it. At that time in prison, I already wanted to leave with you.

286
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,600
But I missed it.

287
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,600
This time, I won't miss it.

288
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,000
So you leave with me, please?

289
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Like protecting Jiuli and Jiurong

290
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
I bore the infamy of everyone

291
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,400
to marry Princess Jiuli so that I could be beside them to guard them,

292
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,400
in order to protect them fully. I'm sitting in a high position in the civil service system.

293
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,600
Only this way can I then guard the important people.

294
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,400
I know, everyone is scolding me, saying that I'm evil.

295
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,600
I don't mind it. I don't care when people say I'm a lackey.

296
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,200
What I, Lu Yunqi, care about

297
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,200
is what everything you, Chu Jiuling, care about.

298
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Leave, please?

299
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,400
There's no time left. Leave.

300
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,200
Lu Yunqi,

301
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,800
humans throughout their lives not only need to live with life and death,

302
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,600
but also need to understand right from wrong.

303
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,200
What I need is never to peacefully survive.

304
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Follow Imperial Father's ambition, follow Imperial Father's boldness,

305
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,400
protect the safety of the common people. Even if I sacrifice my life, I will not hesitate.

306
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,300
This is my choice, and also the life that I want.

307
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,000
Tianyou is unstable and in a dangerous situation now. How can I be righteous without caring for others?

308
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Guarding the well-being of the common people is my responsibility, I cannot retreat for even half a step.

309
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,400
If you really want to help me, then please let me fulfill it.

310
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,530
I may be wrong.

311
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,900
Initially I thought only when I was by your side,

312
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,400
you would be very safe.

313
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,400
Jiuling,

314
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,200
you must promise me, to live your life well.

315
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,800
I will help you take good care of Jiuli and Jiurong.

316
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,000
The mistakes that I, Lu Yunqi, made originally,

317
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,400
I admit. But I will never make the same mistakes again.

318
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,000
I know what to do in the future.

319
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,220
Your Excellency, there's really no more time.

320
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,800
Second Brother, I personally feel that maybe—

321
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,000
- Is there news?
- Yes, I verified it. The Emperor of Northern Qi will go to the border tomorrow to reward the army.

322
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,100
We have a chance.

323
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,300
However, it's heavily guarded and it's in broad daylight. It won't be easy for us to take action.

324
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,200
So we can't have too many people; otherwise, it will be easy to be exposed. Is there news from the capital?

325
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,800
The capital's east and west roads cannot hold on anymore, soldiers from Northern Qi are nearing the capital.

326
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,300
Tomorrow, we must be successful. Go and find a path.

327
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,300
Jiuling, wait for me.

328
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Such a big thing like a siege from Northern Qi,

329
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,000
the imperial court is still hiding it from everyone.

330
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Incapable ruler. Only cared about escaping swiftly himself,

331
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,800
he didn't even give a chance for the common people to guard the city and escape.

332
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,000
Northern Qi is invading soon, do you know?

333
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,900
Are you crazy?

334
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,000
Northern Qi is invading soon, do you know!

335
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

336
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,500
Quick, quick!

337
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Dimwit!

338
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,200
You don't want your life?

339
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,800
I deserve to die! I deserve to die!

340
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,600
Eunuch Yuan.

341
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,700
Your Majesty asked you to go over.

342
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,200
Yes.

343
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,400
Eunuch Yuan, rest assured, I will take care of things for you here.

344
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,400
Many thanks, Lord Ning.

345
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,300
Be more efficient. Pick up and take things securely.

346
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,700
Lord Ning.

347
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,000
Lord Lu.

348
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
It's time to set off.

349
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,500
Yes.

350
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,200
Take these also.

351
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,200
Is everything ready?

352
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,400
Your Majesty, we can leave anytime.

353
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,200
- Was the news ever leaked?
- No.

354
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,600
Your Majesty, but the capital has so many people.

355
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,800
Can't look after it anymore. Quickly leave.

356
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,600
The amount of population left in this capital.

357
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,000
In your eyes, is it an empty city?

358
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,740
Jinxiu! Jinxiu!

359
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,130
- Jiuling! Jiuling! You're finally back!
- Where is everyone else?

360
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,610
Jiuling is back! Jiuling is back!

361
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,360
Miss is back!

362
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,880
Miss, you're finally back!

363
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,420
You're finally back. Where did you go?

364
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,150
I have no time to explain. The Northern Qi army is going to break in.

365
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,670
This... How did this happen?

366
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,270
The east and west paths of the capital have already been breached.

367
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,520
The latest would be tomorrow. Tomorrow, the Northern Qi army will reach the capital's borders

368
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,380
and attack the capital city.

369
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,010
But there hasn't been any activity in the capital. It does not seem like we are preparing for battle!

370
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,300
This is because Chu Rang has run off. He took his trusted men and secretly left the capital.

371
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,550
He is basically giving the capital away. He doesn't want the city or the people.

372
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,020
How could he be like that?

373
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,270
How is he fit to sit on the throne?

374
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,400
What a useless king!

375
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,920
Now all the citizens are unaware of this. What should we do?

376
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,020
Who in the capital now is capable of taking charge?

377
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,630
Such a useless king, a coward!

378
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,720
Should we go and inform everyone first?

379
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,540
What should we do, Miss?

380
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,910
I'll look for Prince Xian.

381
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,950
Jinxiu. Shopkeeper Liu. Go and get all of De Shengchang's excess cash.

382
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,470
- Think of a way to purchase all the weapons in the city.
- Yes!

383
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,910
Chen Qi, you will be in charge of distributing the weapons.

384
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,370
Also, go and get other materials that can be used to make weapons, too.

385
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,370
- Leave it to me.
- Miss, what about me?

386
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:23,260
Liu'er, use the name of Jiuling Hall and buy rations from all the city businesses. You have to be done before tonight.

387
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,480
In case a war really breaks out, the prices of all these resources will rise and the citizens will be left with nothing.

388
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,340
I understand, Miss.

389
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,600
Now that the capital is in danger, I can only rely on all of you.

390
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,560
We will live and die together. Show no fear and no retreat!

391
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,200
Show no fear and no retreat!

392
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,500
- Hurry and go!
- Yes!

393
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,230
Let's go, hurry!

394
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,330
Is this true?

395
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,060
The news cannot be hidden for too long. At most by tomorrow morning,

396
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,410
everyone in the capital will definitely know that His Majesty has already abandoned the city.

397
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,060
So, in other words, we only have tonight to prepare?

398
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,430
- Yes.
- In the city, the number of guards and horses

399
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,730
only number by the thousands. While outside there will be an army with tens of thousands.

400
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,560
How will we be able to block this?

401
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,630
Your Highness, don't forget that there are still tens of thousands of citizens in the city.

402
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,620
They share the same fate of life and death. Everyone can fight together.

403
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,510
Furthermore...

404
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,870
Furthermore, once the Northern army arrives we could have a chance of survival.

405
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,650
But the problem is, without His Majesty's command token,

406
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,540
the soldiers from the five counties may not listen to us.

407
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,470
Right now, whether they want to or not, they will have to obey. You need to display your strongest attitude to face them.

408
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,200
Your Highness, right now in the city only you are able to take charge.

409
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
The lives of over ten thousand citizens rest in your hands.

410
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,740
I believe as long as you are willing to lead, things will be as you said before.

411
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,360
Once the Northern Qi army is beaten, the lives of our citizens will be saved.

412
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,910
How would you know what I have said before?

413
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,960
Imperial Uncle, this is because I am Jiuling.

414
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
Chu Jiuling.

415
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,570
You are Jiuling?

416
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,590
- You didn't die?
- Yes.

417
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,730
I didn't die in the fire. I'm still alive.

418
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,970
But your appearance–

419
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,430
Imperial Uncle, I will definitely explain it to you in the future.

420
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,360
Right now, you need to get a handle on things!

421
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,050
Royal Uncle!

422
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,840
Do you remember the osmanthus cakes from Yushan Restaurant?

423
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,410
In the past, on my birthday every year,

424
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,880
you and Imperial Father would make it for me.

425
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,610
You are really Jiuling.

426
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:11,050
Jiuling, you must know that the most important things in leading an army to battle are

427
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,070
firstly, weapons. Secondly, rations.

428
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,650
I know. Rest assured on these two fronts.

429
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,040
I have already asked Jiuling Hall and De Shengchang to settle this.

430
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,030
If you were a boy,

431
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,880
you would definitely be a hero who can protect the country.

432
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,720
Let's do this, Jiuling.

433
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,230
I will go and mobilize the soldiers from the five counties.

434
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,980
If they insist on not obeying, I will mobilize my personal guards.

435
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,860
They will go to each city gate. I shall see who dares to open the city gates!

436
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,740
All right. Imperial Uncle, we shall meet at the eastern city gate at the hour of Mao.
(T/N : 5:00 a.m. - 7.00 a.m.)

437
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,190
- Then I will go and prepare.
- All right.

438
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:05,180
Royal Uncle, do you have news about Heir Apparent?

439
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,910
Ever since he and Duke Cheng escaped the capital,

440
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,490
I have not heard any news from them.

441
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,550
All right, I understand.

442
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,960
Then I shall take my leave.

443
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,390
Floral umbrellas!

444
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,690
Take a look at these floral umbrellas!

445
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,010
This one has a good meaning. Let's take this one.

446
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,600
If you asked me what were the best days of my life,

447
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,170
I would say that they were the days with you.

448
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,740
Me?

449
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,990
When did I become such an important person?

450
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:32,410
No news... That still counts as good news.

451
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,990
You are so smart. You would definitely not be caught.

452
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,920
Right now, do you know about the Northern Qi army coming to attack the capital?

453
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,130
If you were the one in charge of leading the people here, what would you do?

454
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,540
Zhu Zan...

455
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,100
Why hasn't His Majesty appeared in court?

456
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,200
Bad news! His Majesty is gone!

457
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,820
- His Majesty is gone!
- What?

458
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,000
I searched the entire royal palace, I just cannot find him!

459
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
- You checked everywhere?
- I checked everywhere!

460
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,380
Even Third Prince is missing!

461
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,520
We are finished!

462
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,860
Wouldn't that mean the Northern Qi army is going to break in?

463
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,190
Don't be scared. I am under Duke Cheng's orders.

464
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,820
Heir Apparent is injured. Where is Young Master Fang?

465
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,890
Young Master Fang!

466
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,970
Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law!

467
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,180
How did this happen?

468
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,690
Once he learned that our army was in danger, he got injured while trying to assassinate the Northern Qi emperor.

469
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,500
But the wanted order on him wasn't removed so we dared not wander around to find a physician.

470
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,170
Without any other methods, we can only come to Young Master Fang for help.

471
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,580
Santao, bring them in first. I will find a way to get a physician.

472
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,370
Young Master Fang, the physician must be someone reliable. If not, things will be worse.

473
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,940
I understand.

474
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,040
Then you come with me.

475
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,500
Master, what should we do now?

476
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,990
Stop crying and making a fuss.

477
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,110
Prince Xian has already stood out to lead the situation. The capital will not fall into chaos.

478
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,340
You also should not blame Yunzhao for bringing the news late.

479
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,390
It was already difficult for him to save himself.

480
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,940
I watched Yunzhao grow up; of course, I understand his personality.

481
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,770
- But Master, can you not go?
- I have to go.

482
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,150
I didn't go in the past. I received the blessings of others.

483
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,010
I appealed and His Majesty did not listen. I can only persevere till the end!

484
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,440
But even His Majesty has fled!

485
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,690
It is because he has fled!

486
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,830
That I have to go out even more!

487
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,260
For the sake of the right path and the sake of all the lives.

488
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,670
You are one of the common people.

489
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,810
Go and hide well at home with the kids. Don't run around outside.

490
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,650
These few days, the capital cannot fall into chaos.

491
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,040
We are willing to follow Lord to protect the city!

492
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,690
To protect the country is to protect our home!

493
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:45,430
To protect our home, we all have a duty!

494
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,770
In battle defense, it's most important to defend well. The greatest taboo is to be flustered and make mistakes.

495
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,660
We need to divide tasks immediately and ensure we make the best use of those who have been deployed.

496
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,740
- You know best about the defense layout. I will leave this to you.
- Sure.

497
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,260
- I'll take care of this.
- Select more strong people from the city

498
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,160
to supplement the four gates of the city and the manpower for the walls.

499
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,930
Especially the north gate where the wall is lower.

500
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,810
Northern Qi is most likely to attack the city there.

501
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:21,820
When that time comes, use the drum as the order for concentrated defense. The drumming and fighting must not stop.

502
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,250
Understood.

503
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,770
Chen Qi, lead the chosen people to De Shengchang to receive the weapons.

504
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,020
Jinxiu. Liu'er. Take charge of organizing the people who are willing to help to ensure the supplies.

505
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,260
- Go now.
- All right.

506
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,890
Prince Xian.

507
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,430
Lord Ning.

508
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,660
I'm ashamed that I was late.

509
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,980
It's not late as long as you are here.

510
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,240
Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

511
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,390
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

512
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:06,150
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

513
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:12,250
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

514
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:18,000
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

515
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,990
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

516
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:29,760
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

517
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,780
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

518
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:41,230
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,620
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

520
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,560
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

521
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,870
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

522
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,370
♫ If memories could speak ♫

523
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,320
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

524
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:05,280
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

525
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:32,950
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:38,780
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:50,170
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

529
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:53,590
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

530
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,650
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

531
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:01,900
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in
a deadlock with the sky ♫

532
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,290
♫ If memories could speak ♫

533

♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

536
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,230
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

537
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,500
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

538
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,810
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

539
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,910
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

540
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:39,870
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
