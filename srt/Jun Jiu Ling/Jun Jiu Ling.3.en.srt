19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,170
Miss, that seems to be

20
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,950
the eldest son of the Fang family, Fang Chengyu.

21
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,820
You're the so-called cousin,

22
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,810
Jun Zhenzhen. Right?

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,320
Actually, you should call me older cousin.

24
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,760
Has nobody told you

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,340
that only I'm allowed in this place

26
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,970
and others aren't allowed?

27
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,700
Miss Yuxiu seems to have said that before.

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,400
I forgot.

29
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,030
Today's scenery is so nice

30
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,710
that I took a longer walk than expected.

31
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,150
I hope my cousin doesn't mind it.

32
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,820
We'd better not meet again.

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,070
You said you come from a family of scholars.

34
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,170
Then you should know what

35
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,830
"out of sight, out of mind" means.

is fifteen years old but has never gone outside.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,710
I heard that he's diagnosed with a strange illness.

40
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,070
It looks like he won't live long.

Miss, I didn't know before I asked around.

47
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,020
It was shocking once I found out.

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,960
There's a curse on the Fang family's men.

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,210
You're a young girl. Don't spread rumors.

50
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,650
It's real.

51
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,180
The old master of the Fang family died a sudden death.

52
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,550
The master of the Fang family got robbed and killed.

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,870
The young master of the Fang family, who's the only son in their third generation,

54
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,750
is very frail.

55
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,100
When he was five years old, he got very sick.

56
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,330
The doctor said he wouldn't live past the age of sixteen.

57
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,700
Sixteen?

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,170
Doesn't that mean there's only less than one year left?

59
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,880
Exactly.

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,370
That's why I said it's a curse.

61
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,990
What's the point of having a big family?

62
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,260
It won't go past the third generation. No more descendants.

63

Watch your mouth!

A sick person like me can't criticize a healthy person like you.

No need.

105

You're not capable of treating it.

106

Giving him hope and letting him down,

107
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,430
it would be too cruel to the patient.

108

Chengyu isn't sick,

he has been poisoned.

110

Did you know he was poisoned?

111
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,240
Why do you think he was poisoned, not sick?

112
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,970
I took his pulse today and found that he has many toxins that have been in his body for years.

113
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Have you all been feeding him poison?

I don't get it.

115
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,830
May I ask why you've been doing this to him?

116
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,990
When Chengyu was five years old, he got really sick.

117
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,570
Since then, he's been taking this poison every day.

118
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,080
This poison can keep his illness under control.

119
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,050
If he doesn't take it,

120
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,230
he wouldn't be alive.

121
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,750
The famous doctor who prescribed him this died of an illness a long time ago.

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,090
Other people couldn't do anything about it.

In order for Chengyu to live on,

we're left with no choice.

125
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,450
This prescription looks good at first sight,

126
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,790
but it becomes a poison when combined with his illness.

127
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,320
If he doesn't take it, his illness won't get better.

128
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,430
But even if he does, he's only stable for now.

129
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,450
He'll die once he stops taking it.

130
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,730
He'll slowly wait to die if he takes it.

131

Someone misled you on purpose.

136
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,470
Chengyu ended up like this because he's been severely poisoned by taking this medicine.

137
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,710
Back then, he didn't have

138

139
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,420
Over the years, someone misled you with the poison

and actually destroyed my cousin's body.

141

What kind of person

142
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,010
is this evil and wants to harm our Fang family?

143

The culprit must be hiding.

If my guess is right,

145
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,600
this person should be in the Fang family.

146

Most importantly, we must treat my cousin's illness now.

147

Just let me try.

148

The Fang family, the stamp, and the seal.

164
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,060
How are these all connected? Is the Fang family also involved in the secrets of Zezhou?

165
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,850
Who is plotting to harm the Fang family?

166
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,470
Miss, what are you thinking about?

167
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,920
You've been lost in thoughts since we came out of Old Madam's room.

168
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,130
I was thinking about how to cure Chengyu.

169
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,320
Are you really going to cure him?

170
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,650
Regardless, my priority should be to cure Chengyu.

171
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,580
I will repay Zhenzhen's kindness and save the Fang family, too.

172
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,720
This is how I can earn Grandmother's full trust.

173
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,350
It will then be easy for me to figure out the Fang family's connection to the stamp.

174
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,790
Miss.

175
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,670
Steward Gao.

176
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,150
Steward Gao, please wait.

177
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,660
Miss, do you need anything?

178
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,510
- De Shengchang is in both the south and the north, right?
- That's right.

179
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,820
It is to facilitate our commerce activities.

180
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,640
Wherever we do business, we will have a bank branch, too.

181
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,830
Do you have branches in the capital, as well?

182
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,360
Of course. We have a number of branches there.

183
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,640
I see. By the way, is there anything interesting happening in the capital?

184
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,040
I don't think so.

185
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,270
But it will be very lively during the lantern festival.

186
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,080
There is a touring circus visiting the capital. There's always a crowd.

187
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,770
What about the palace?

188
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,160
I don't think there's anything new in the palace. It's just the ministers coming and going.

189
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,550
Businessmen like us don't care too much about that.

190
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,020
They don't interact with us either.

191
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,340
- Have you heard of anything in Prince Huai's Residence—
- Miss.

192
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,650
- Old Madam is waiting to go through the books with the steward.
- I see.

193
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,820
Miss, I'll report to my boss now.

194
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,580
Steward Gao, please.

195
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,830
Farewell.

196
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,520
What did she ask you?

197
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,710
It's natural that young people are curious. However, there are things that you can ask about and those you cannot.

198
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:56,370
Young people don't know their limits. If someone finds fault in this, it will be a disaster.

199
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,670
Steward Gao, if you have something to say, say it. Don't beat around the bush.

200
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,400
I don't think Miss Jun is only curious about the happenings in the capital.

201
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,740
She was asking about...

202
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,050
the imperial family.

203
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,530
Madam, as you know,

204
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,760
one cannot talk about the imperial family for fun.

205
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,880
He doesn't allow us to talk about the imperial family.

206
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,590
Moreover, she even asked about Prince Huai.

207
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,860
Second Brother, let's change our strategy.

208
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,530
For example, sneak into the Fang Residence at night

209
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,260
and have a chat.

210
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,360
No, no. Forget it. Sneaking into other people's homes is a bad idea.

211
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,480
Second Brother, look.

212
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,360
The first and second young ladies are both back.

213
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,660
I think Miss Jun won't come out today.

214
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,500
If she doesn't come out today, we will be here waiting tomorrow, too.

215
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,540
If she comes out, I have my plans.

216
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,750
Are there any news from Yunxiao Pavilion? What about the whereabouts of Jun Yingwen?

217
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,980
I haven't heard anything.

218
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,240
Before we hear anything else, Jun Zhenzhen is our only source of information.

219
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,980
Right.

220
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,860
Three qian.
(T/N : Qian is a unit of measurement, about 5 grams)

221
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,630
Sister Shaoyao.

222
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,070
Miss, Old Madam wants to see you.

223
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,590
Sure. I'll be there shortly.

224
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,390
I suggest you go now. Old Madam is waiting for you.

225
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,640
Sister Shaoyao, what's so urgent?

226
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,330
Do we have to go right now?

227
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,080
Can it wait until Miss finishes with the ingredients?

228
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,700
Liu'er,

229
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,210
tidy things up here for me.

230
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll go with you now.

231
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,950
Do you know why I called you here?

232
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,830
I know I was wrong.

233
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,920
Tell me what you did wrong.

234
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,540
I shouldn't have been curious about the happenings in the capital.

235
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,360
I shouldn't have asked about the imperial family.

236
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,810
You did it knowing that you shouldn't have.

237
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,700
How did you learn to knowingly violate the rules?

238
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
How dare you ask about the capital?

239
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,770
I visited the capital before with my father. That's why I was curious.

240
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,680
Why did you ask about the imperial family?

241
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,320
And about Prince Huai?

242
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,170
I'll be honest here. I am an old friend of Princess Jiuling.

243
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,870
I was thinking about her, so I asked Steward Gao about it.

244
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,630
Was that spontaneous?

245
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,420
- Or—
- Grandmother, I hope you won't be mad at me.

246
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,260
Even if she is an old friend of yours, you should not mention her name anymore.

247
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,090
It's hard to know what people are thinking.

248
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,420
Going forward, don't talk about the imperial family.

249
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,180
I will remember that. I will remember what Grandmother has taught me.

250
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,740
You can leave now.

251
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,280
Grandmother, I have one more request.

252
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,720
There are not many medicinal ingredients left at home. I want to purchase some from the pharmacy.

253
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,460
Can I ask Sister Yuxiu to accompany me?

254
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,380
This way, we can tell people that it's just girls shopping together.

255
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,710
Thank you, Grandmother.

256
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,150
Miss, it's so lively out there.

257
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,200
Where are we going?

258
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,280
There is an old jewelry shop, called Cuiyao Pavilion.

259
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,280
They have the latest styles, the master is very skillful as well.

260
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,670
Most of the young ladies in Zezhou love visiting there.

261
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,280
- Let's go there.
- Sounds good.

262
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,030
Purses and pendants!

263
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,860
Let's go.

264
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,780
Miss Fang, please come inside.

265
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,270
These are our latest hairpins.

266
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,490
- Please take a look.
- We will.

267
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,600
Zhenzhen,

268
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
which one do you like?

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,830
This one looks good.

270
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,930
This one looks pretty mediocre.

271
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,250
Pick a different one.

272
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,400
It is good. It's simple and tasteful.

273
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,270
I'll have this.

274
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,850
I'm taking this one.

275
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,640
Isn't this the cousin of the Fang family?

276
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,000
The Jun Zhenzhen who rejected the marriage proposal of Young Master Ning?

277
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,470
That's what the rumor said. We don't know who rejected who.

278
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,200
- Shut up!
- Liu'er.

279
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,380
It's fine. Let's go over there.

280
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,670
Miss, please come inside.

281
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,770
Sister, this looks nice.

282
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,800
- I want this.
- All right.

283
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,810
What a coincidence. I like this too.

284
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,240
Miss Ning, what do you mean?

285
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,020
What do you mean? I'm here to buy jewelry.

286
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,900
You can choose first.

287
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,760
How can I do this? This is not my family's shop.

288
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,680
Moreover, everyone here is a customer.

289
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,100
We both have the right to choose first.

290
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,130
However, when we let you have it, you reject it.

291
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,300
When we choose it, you choose it too.

292
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,310
Since we are interested in the same hairpin,

293
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,520
let's bid for it.

294
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,260
This is a good idea. Good idea!

295
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,080
Dear Ladies, this is a good idea. This hairpin is five taels.

296
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,060
Ten taels.

297
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,490
- Twenty taels.
- Thirty taels.

298
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,530
Forty taels.

299
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,740
- I...
- Who do you think will win?

300
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,710
No need to ask. Of course, it's Yanyan.

301
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,520
I can't wait to see Jun Zhenzhen cry.

302
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,740
100 taels.

303
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,020
150 taels.

304
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,930
It's good that Miss Ning is happy.

305
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,880
Want to compete with me?

306
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,690
But this hairpin is only worth five taels.

307
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,620
- Sister, don't be angry.
- I know, Zhenzhen.

308
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,700
Kind people are bullied by others. When facing such domineering and arrogant people,

309
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,830
not being outdone by them is the way to get along with each other.

310
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,010
Thinking about Ning Yunyan, she's really stupid.

311
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,820
She shot herself in her foot.

312
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,600
She paid thirty times the price of the hairpin. I don't even think that hairpin is that great.

313
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,810
Will she wear it or not?

314
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,580
By the way, Sister. For the past two days, I could see that Grandmother is still having chest discomfort.

315
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,660
We will be passing a medicine shop. I'm going to prepare some tonics for her.

316
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,250
All right.

317
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,190
[Long Chang Medicine Shop]

318
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,810
Miss, we have arrived at the medicine shop.

319
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,860
I will be back soon. Please wait for me here.

320
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,470
All right.

321
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,190
Miss, buying medicines?

322
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,440
Yes. Liu'er.

323
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,840
Here.

324
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,340
Two sets of what's written here.

325
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,030
Please wait for a moment.

326
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,900
[List and dosages of herbs]

327
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,580
Miss, about this...

328
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,860
I know. You may not have all the herbs listed here.

329
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,730
Let me have those that are available.

330
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,230
Thank you for being considerate. I won't lie.

331
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,560
Even if I have these herbs,

332
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,520
I can barely provide one set. Please wait.

333
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,880
It can be considered fruitful today.

334
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,500
Oh no.

335
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
What is she doing?

336
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,680
Miss, this is the last of our herbs.

337
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,620
Ning Yunyan, what are you trying to do?

338
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,720
What's the problem?

339
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,880
Jun Zhenzhen, you deserved it. This is your consequence for swindling us.

340
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,570
Seems like the 150 taels lesson is still not enough.

341
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,050
If I had known earlier, I would have increased the price.

342
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,800
For example, 5,000 taels.

343
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,650
5,000 taels? Wouldn't this be the same price as Young Master Ning?

344
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,370
Right?

345
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,150
- I...
- 10,000 taels.

346
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,990
She's being violent and hitting people! Look at her!

347
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,670
She's going to slap her! Look!

348
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,780
Look.

349
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,590
15,000 taels.

350
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,030
Look at her!

351
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,120
Swindler! Let me tell you! She's a swindler!

352
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,640
She swindled 5,000 taels from our Ning family.

353
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,170
She's violent and wants to slap me now!

354
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,450
That's right.

355
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,510
Miss Ning, don't forget.

356
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,580
At that time, your Ning family willingly

357
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,700
redeemed the marriage certificate for 5,000 taels. It was a deal with me.

358
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,980
Nonsense. It's total nonsense.

359
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,000
What do you mean by willingly? It's obvious that you came to threaten us.

360
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,090
She repeatedly raised the price as well!

361
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,920
The top artist in the capital, Wu Xiaoxiao, is worth 3,000 taels.

362
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,120
Young Master Ning is outstanding. No matter what, he's worth 5,000 taels. Right?

363
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,980
- Zhenzhen...
- A son from a rich family is on par with a woman from a brothel.

364
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,380
There's really something like this?

365
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,200
She's going to slap her again!

366
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,600
- Jun Zhenzhen, let me tell you.
- Let's go, Yanyan.

367
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,990
This matter is not over yet!

368
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,530
Let's talk again another day. Let's go.

369
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,410
Second Brother, this young lady is rather interesting.

370
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,780
- She really said that?
- Not only that,

371
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,990
Miss Ning was exasperated and furious.

372
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,980
Everyone came to watch and laugh.

373
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,650
Everyone was really satisfied.

374
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,170
I really couldn't tell that she was such an interesting person.

375
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,350
Young Master, what kind of person do you think I am?

376
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,550
Why are you here?

377
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,650
Santao, guard the door. Don't let anyone enter.

378
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,790
Yes.

379
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,290
Get back here.

380
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,960
Santao, are you my servant or hers?

381
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,780
Get back here.

382
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,560
Old Madam instructed me to obey her when she's here.

383
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,120
You!

384
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,750
You are still loathsome.

385
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,490
You, too.

386
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,100
Young Master, you asked for the unpleasantries yourself.

387
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,200
Then why are you willing to cure me?

388
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,040
You’re doing this in an attempt to continue the Fang family lineage, right?

389
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,940
Why would you think this way?

390
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,090
I know that I can't be cured.

391
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,750
This is probably the only reason for me

392
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,690
to stay in the Fang family.

393
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,900
A human's life is not long or short.

394
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,160
Although fireworks last for a short time, they are still dazzling.

395
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,020
Dead woods last for a long time but they are decayed.

396
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,350
- Mother!
- I already told you.

397
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,990
If this trouble continues, it won't be good for your brother.

398
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,990
Just find someone to teach her a lesson.

399
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,510
Why did you attack her on your own?

400
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,110
Letting others talk badly will tarnish your brother's reputation.

401
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,530
- Mother, I...
- It's my fault for spoiling you.

402
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,600
- Mother.
- Enough.

403
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,350
Mother, I'm back.

404
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,190
- Older Brother?
- Zhao'er.

405
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,420
Zhao'er, why did you suddenly come back from the capital?

406
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,080
You didn't even tell me. I could have sent someone to receive you.

407
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,890
I haven't been busy with homework lately. I'm back to celebrate the holidays with you for a few days and will leave thereafter.

408
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,030
- All right.
- Older Brother.

409
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,570
Yanyan, what's wrong?

410
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,920
It's nothing much. Just some quarrels between girls.

411
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,420
Zhao'er, are you hungry?

412
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,130
I will go prepare some snacks for you in the kitchen.

413
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,890
I'm not hungry, Mother.

414
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,800
I will get you a cup of water then.

415
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,890
Older Brother...

416
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,540
It's fine, Yanyan. Tell me who bullied you again.

417
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,740
- Older Brother...
- Yanyan!

418
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,410
I just want to tell him!

419
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:10,420
Older Brother, Jun Zhenzhen from the Fang family suddenly brought a marriage letter here to cancel your marriage agreement.

420
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,800
She even took 5,000 taels from us.

421
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,940
She even said that Wu Xiaoxiao, the top artist in the capital, is worth 3,000 taels.

422
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,680
Young Master Ning is so outstanding. No matter what, he's worth 5,000 taels.

423
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,210
Mother, what marriage agreement?

424
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,230
It's fine not to talk about it.

425
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,740
Yunzhao, there's no need to mention this again.

426
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,990
However, that Miss Jun is really rude.

427
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,880
Older Brother, she's really too much. You need to take revenge.

428
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,660
It was a moment of angry words from her mouth. Just ignore her.

429
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,620
If this trouble continues, this matter will go back and forth. Others will talk about it.

430
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,000
- Older Brother.
- Be good.

431
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,350
Yanyan, be obedient.

432
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,510
I already told you not to look at me with that pitiful expression.

433
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,210
Your bones are too fragile.

434
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,390
Other than this prescription, I will prescribe some tonics for you too.

435
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,020
It's a two-pronged approach.

436
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,820
It's not necessary.

437
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,830
- If your body is not treated, how will you continue the Fang family lineage?
- You!

438
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,490
Second Brother.

439
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,100
How is it?

440
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,790
The herbs that Miss Jun purchased are not complete, but the pairing of these herbs

441
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,660
is rarely seen in prescriptions. I can't tell you the specifics.

442
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,510
Deliver the herbs to Yunxiao Pavilion. You must investigate this.

443
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,980
All right.

444
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,850
Her herbs were ruined today.

445
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,600
She will definitely buy them again tomorrow.

446
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,430
I have already checked several small medicine shops in Zezhou,

447
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,400
This is the shop with the most complete stock of herbs.

448
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,650
Are you planning to block her again?

449
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,980
[Fu Xiang Medicine Shop]

450
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,520
We got them.

451
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,130
Hold it well.

452
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,990
You are such a swindler.

453
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,600
You even dared to harass Miss Jun in broad daylight?

454
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,800
- I...
- Do you know your crime?

455
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,180
- I... I do.
- If you do, kneel.

456
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,550
Second Brother, I...

457
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,520
- No need to kneel.
- Thank you.

458
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,840
Do you know your mistake?

459
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,040
My mistake was...

460
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,820
I shouldn't have teased her.

461
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,190
Let me tell you. Fortunately, you met a suave and admirable man like me

462
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,650
who's righteous and highly skilled in martial arts. I can fight and am good-looking, too.

463
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,690
That's how I can subdue you.

464
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,940
- Do you understand?
- I do.

465
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,960
How many are in your family?

466
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,760
- No one else.
- What?

467
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,760
I'm a worthless person without any conscience.

468
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,740
- I'm inferior to pigs and dogs.
- That's right.

469
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,520
I shouldn't learn from my second brother.

470
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,890
Your second brother must be very sad seeing you like this.

471
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,830
My second brother is not as good as me.

472
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,650
Kill me.

473
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,640
I don't want to live anymore.

474
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,100
- I want to die.
- You don't need to be so depressed.

475
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,230
You can start a new life.

476
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,000
But I don't have another choice.

477
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,900
- Is that so?
- Yes.

478
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,130
Do it.

479
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,200
Miss Jun,

480
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,920
please stay.

481
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,770
I wonder if I could chat with you.

482
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,430
You are unreasonable.

483
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,610
Our Young Lady is not close to you. What's there to chat?

484
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,520
Is it still regarding that matter?

485
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,420
Yes.

486
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,960
If I tell you the truth today, will you stop pestering me in the future?

487
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,760
I will definitely stop pestering you.

488
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,780
Fine.

489
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,660
- Buns.
- Fresh celery.
[Clear Virtues Teahouse]

490
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,920
The princess and I are old family friends. I will never do anything to harm her.

491
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,060
On the contrary, I will use my life to protect her.

492
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,780
Please tell me where she is. I will be responsible for the aftermath.

493
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,450
The princess definitely didn't die suddenly from an illness.

494
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,800
Do you know about the big fire that day?

495
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,270
I know, I know.

496
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,210
I know you used arson as a ploy. Did you rescue her?

497
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,360
If it was really like you said,

498
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,620
then the princess would have been fortunate.

499
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,280
What do you mean?

500
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,810
We did plan to rescue her.

501
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,140
But Heaven is stronger than the will of the people.

502
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,090
We were still too late.

503
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,640
I, Zhenzhen, am not filial. I shall be your daughter again in another life.

504
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,150
When we arrived,

505
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,830
I have no idea why the place where the princess was imprisoned caught fire.

506
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,960
The princess died.

507
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,910
That's impossible. That's impossible.

508
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,880
Absolutely impossible!

509
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,800
Jiuling is blessed.

510
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,310
How could she die in a fire?

511
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,040
Jun Zhenzhen,

512
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,730
I don't believe anything you've said today.

513
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,850
She's definitely still alive.

514
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,400
When you leave via the east gate of Zezhou, fifty miles towards the northwest,

515
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,360
there is a cliff.

516
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,050
My father's grave is at the bottom of the cliff.

517
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,700
Once my father failed in saving the princess,

518
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,170
he was chased the entire way

519
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,850
and accidentally fell off the cliff.

520
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,150
From now on,

521
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,700
you are no longer Chu Jiuling.

522
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,950
You will be Jun Zhenzhen.

523
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,520
If you don't believe me, go look for yourself.

524
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,170
Ling Jiu,

525
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,610
I'm sorry...

526
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,590
Jiuling,

527
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,890
when we were younger,

528
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,090
whenever you hit me, cursed me, pinched me, I didn't feel it.

529
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,310
Once we got older, every time I thought of you,

530
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,610
I was so happy.

531
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,000
Don't you think...

532
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,230
This is love?

533
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,000
I went to the north for eight years.

534
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,880
Eight years later, I received news about you.

535
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,840
Your engagement...

536
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,200
Second Brother.

537
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,310
Second Brother, are you crazy?

538
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,700
Are you okay?

539
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,420
What's wrong with you? What's wrong?

540
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,980
What do you think...

541
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,890
being burned feels like?

542
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,670
I never knew before...

543
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,080
But now I know.

544
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,440
Jiuling is beautiful, delicate, and fair.

545
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,890
I have never once bumped against her.

546
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,210
Princess Jiuling is already dead.

547
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,850
She's already dead. Dead!

548
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,260
What's the point of doing this now?

549
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,870
Is there a reason to torture yourself like this?

550
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,540
Second Brother.

551
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,180
No.

552
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,400
She's definitely not dead.

553
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,280
Baotang,

554
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,200
you have to believe me.

555
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,200
She's definitely not dead.

556
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,000
She's definitely waiting for me somewhere.

557
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,710
Jiuling,

558
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,500
no matter where,

559
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,760
I, Zhu Zan,

560
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,170
I will find you.

561
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,440
