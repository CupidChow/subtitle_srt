♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,490
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,760
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

Miss! Miss!

21
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,950
- Lord Lu is here.
- Why is he here again?

22
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,080
Physician Jun.

23
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,730
Lord Lu.

24
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,560
Can you give Prince Huai the inoculation now?

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,290
I planned to go in the next couple of days.

26
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,670
Liu'er, bring me my medical box.

27
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,480
Go on.

[Prince Huai Residence]

29
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,670
Your Highness, Physician Jun is here.

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,500
You can all go. Close the door.

31
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,950
Physician Jun, this way, please.

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,340
Come, Your Highness.

33
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,810
You've recovered very well, so you can get the inoculation now.

34
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,260
In a moment, I will blow the pox

35
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,290
into your nose.

36
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,380
It might be itchy but you must bear it.

37
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't sneeze.

38
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,390
Rest assured. Don't be afraid.

39
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,890
Here.

40
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,330
Just breathe so it enters your body.

41
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,670
In two hours, the pox will show up on Your Highness's body.

42
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,030
Tonight, I'll stay here with you to care for His Highness.

43
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,340
Thank you very much, Physician Jun.

44
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,240
Do you feel better now?

45
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,740
Rong'er, do you want to rest?

46
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,800
How are Jiurong's studies lately?

47
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,000
The prince is naturally smart and is diligent.

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,890
His studies are going very well.

49
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,920
Doesn't he also have horseback riding and archery?

50
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,460
As of now, he's not able to ride alone. Someone has to lead the horse.

51
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,610
As for archery... although his arms are a bit weak,

52
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,300
he's very accurate. He just needs more practice.

53
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,150
My Lord, may I be so bold as to ask a question?

54
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,040
Speak.

55
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,260
When Physician Jun previously left, she didn't mention any follow-ups.

56
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,400
Besides, the prince is all right now,

57
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,970
so why did you suddenly ask Physician Jun to come?

58
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:46,860
There are things you need not worry about, so don't ask.

59
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,970
Of course. I'll take my leave.

60
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,660
Your Highness the Princess!

61
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,300
I can't bear it.

62
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,790
So many physicians have come,

63
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,160
but only you were able to cure Jiurong's true underlying illness.

64
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,460
Physician Jun, you seem to care about Jiurong a lot.

65
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,830
A healer's heart. It is my duty.

66
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,380
After experiencing so many illnesses,

67
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,740
Rong'er isn't a child who trusts easily.

68
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,370
However, out of the ordinary,

69
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,690
he seems to have gotten close to you.

70
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,690
It takes two people to get along.

71
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,910
I feel like His Highness is familiar, so, of course, he feels that I'm familiar too.

72
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,420
I...

73
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,400
- feel the same.
- Did she notice something? Is she testing me?

74
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,080
Even though it's my wish to reunite with you and Rong'er, however,

75
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,910
Sister, it's still not the right time.

76
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,890
I'm going to go decoct the medicine now.

77
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
Your Highness.

78
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,150
Has he been inoculated?

79
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,080
By the way, Master Gu has some personal matters to take care of, so he's taken leave.

80
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,610
You should stay and care for Jiurong these next few days.

81
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,560
Okay.

82
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,980
You seem to get along with Physician Jun.

83
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,630
How about having her stay as well so you can have company?

84
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, I do indeed get along well with Physician Jun.

85
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,680
That's good.

86
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,340
I still have some work to do, so I'll take my leave.

87
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,550
Your Highness, get some rest.

88
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,990
- Come on.
- Second Elder Brother, drink a little slower.

89
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,990
I'm a little drunk already.

90
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,300
After what Miss Jun said last time, I really did give it some thought.

91
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,540
Look...

92
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,180
One must be upright, honest, and willing to stand up for the people but is not a supporter of the new emperor.

93
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,370
That person must also obtain His Majesty's trust.

94
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,060
- Difficult.
- Furthermore, one's status must be of high standing.

95
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,850
Even if "that person" is against it,

96
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,390
he cannot do anything.

97
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,060
Too difficult.

98
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,620
When you put it like that, I do have someone in mind.

99
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,900
But this person...

100
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,690
is not involved in state affairs and just lives his life.

101
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,850
But I'm afraid that going to him

102
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,290
for no reason will cause trouble.

103
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,210
Second Elder Brother... you're talking about Prince Xian, right?

104
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,050
Exactly, Twelfth Imperial Uncle.

105
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,790
Your Highness.

106
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,550
Everything with Prince Huai is normal.

107
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,050
That is the pox that appeared on his body.

108
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,720
His fever has receded.

109
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,140
Once the pox have gone,

110
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,910
then that means he's fully inoculated. Right?

111
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,210
I heard that the young heir apparent of the duke was with you during the inoculations

112
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,970
and even took the risk to test the inoculation.

113
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,520
He is righteous and admirable.

114
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,870
Then have you and him

115
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,190
known each other for a long time now?

116
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,940
After coming to the capital, we've run into each other a few times.

117
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,440
Is that so?

118
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,970
When my younger sister was alive,

119
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,980
she had a very good relationship with him.

120
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,240
At Qingshan Court, Lord Lu did not give you a hard time, did he?

121
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,430
Treating the pox is a serious matter,

122
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,740
so it is a part of his duty to thoroughly investigate.

123
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,810
Looks like he indeed gave you a hard time.

124
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,270
Compared to coming to my doorsteps to destroy my plaque,

125
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,290
this was not considered a hardship.

126
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,550
Physician Jun, you did not expect to stay here at the Prince Huai residence.

127
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,680
I believe you do not have any extra clothes to change into, right?

128
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,200
It is only one night. It is all right.

129
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,560
I do have some old clothes here.

130
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,050
If you don't mind, you can make do with them for the night.

131
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,870
I don't dare to ruin Your Highness's luxurious clothes.

132
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,100
It's just some casual clothes.

133
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,880
If you don't mind...

134
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,770
Princess, thank you for the care.

135
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,930
I can't believe Elder Sister still has this outfit.

136
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,330
These beautiful embroideries

137
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,640
were all hand-stitched by you working day and night.

138
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,980
Now you want me to wear it.

139
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,130
Is it an intentional test...

140
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,660
or just coincidence?

141
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,550
I have already changed my appearance.

142
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,700
I guess I shall wear it.

143
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,840
This outfit...

144
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,180
seems like it was custom-made for you.

145
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,810
Princess, you flatter me.

146
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,580
Second Older Sister, I dreamed about you again.

147
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,810
Your Highness, I'm afraid you mistook me for someone else because you just woke up.

148
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,230
I am not your second older sister.

149
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,650
Have her leave!

150
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,200
How could she wear Second Older Sister's clothes?

151
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,710
Rong'er, I had her do it.

152
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,180
I will go and take off the clothes.

153
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,800
Wait!

154
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,280
Just wear them.

155
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,240
Those are the only belongings that Second Older Sister left behind.

156
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,010
I don't want her to leave nothing behind.

157
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,460
Leave it on.

158
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,080
When you leave tomorrow...

159
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,600
just leave the clothes with me.

160
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,350
Jiuling, you are back!

161
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,360
How is the task I instructed you to do?

162
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,220
My Lord, don't worry. Everything has been prepared.

163
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,310
Since that is the case, do it tomorrow morning.

164
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,190
Yes, My Lord.

165
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,530
What is all this? Throw everything out.

166
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,640
I am back.

167
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,000
- Miss.
- Miss.

168
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,210
What is this?

169
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,790
What is going on with you all?

170
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,870
Miss Jun, Commander Lu had someone

171
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,640
deliver these here early this morning.

172
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,560
These aren't gifts of thanks for me visiting Prince Huai, are they?

173
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,730
What gifts of thanks?

174
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,710
This is that fool wanting to take you as his concubine.

175
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,440
This is truly absurd.

176
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,410
You are correct. From the looks of it, Miss really doesn't know about the matter.

177
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,780
I told you so.

178
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,670
However, what exactly is going on between you and that Lu fellow?

179
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,040
I am innocent, and I dislike him every time I see him.

180
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,390
Miss Jun, we believe you, but others may not.

181
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,470
After all, you were at Qingshan Court together and then you were at the Prince Huai Residence.

182
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,140
You two had a confrontation in front of everyone in the city.

183
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,340
The confrontation isn't considered much to them,

184
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,580
but your entanglement has become a topic of conversation.

185
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,430
Shopkeeper Liu is right.

186
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,580
You cured Prince Huai's illness, and you treated the difficult-to-cure smallpox.

187
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,280
Delivering betrothal gifts under these circumstances,

188
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,790
someone will inevitably think that you and Lu Yunqi have been close since the start,

189
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,000
and you already discussed being his concubine.

190
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,250
What?

191
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,180
Even if our miss wants to marry, it should be as a legal primary wife.

192
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,010
- Even if the other person is a princess.
- You brat, you cannot speak so casually.

193
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,880
If someone hears that and spread it around, there will be trouble.

194
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
That Lu person is truly digusting.

195
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,720
Miss Jun is a female physician. She first treats Prince Huai's illness.

196
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,750
Then, Prince Huai's brother-in-law takes a fancy towards her and wants her to be his concubine.

197
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,250
If this spreads, what will people think?

198
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,180
He probably doesn't really want to take me as his concubine.

199
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,000
Instead, he wants to ruin my reputation.

200
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,390
Lu Yunqi has always had a grudge towards Jiuling Hall.

201
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,520
Before, he was determined to destroy our plaque.

202
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,590
Now, he has thought of such a plan. He's truly disgusting.

203
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,960
He's clearly doesn't want us to run this medicinal hall.

204
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,430
Miss, can't you just reject him?

205
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,160
It's not as simple as merely rejecting him.

206
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,350
So what if you are righteous and save the world?

207
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,260
A pair of dirty hands wants to drag you into the mud.

208
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,000
You can't wash yourself clean even if you want to. Which one of those

209
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,620
madams will ask you to treat them then?

210
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,050
Then we won't treat them.

211
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,570
Our miss is a good person and beautiful, too. Must she ruin her face just to treat people?

212
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,510
- Those women...
- Enough.

213
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,160
Stop fighting.

214
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,980
Miss, what do you plan to do next?

215
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,240
We can't do the same thing as we did with the ten thousand tael note.

216
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,550
We can't reject it or change our name. We can only act as though nothing happened.

217
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,290
Of course, we can't do that. This is not as simple as accepting money.

218
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,680
If you accept the betrothal gifts, it means you have agreed to it.

219
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,030
Later on, there will be trouble when they are here to escort the bride to the wedding.

220
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,010
If you say you dare not refuse again at that time, then—

221
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,050
Then it will surely be a laughingstock.

222
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,850
Send them back the way they were delivered.

223
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,160
- Return them.
- Return them?

224
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,810
Yes, return them.

225
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,340
Then let's return them quietly.

226
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,750
Since it will be dark soon, we'll leave them and go.

227
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,330
Lu Yunqi used this tactic

228
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,950
because he wants everyone to know. Hence, let's not wait until it's dark.

229
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,130
Do it now.

230
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,140
Miss, are you joking?

231
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,330
You will truly offend and disgrace Lord Lu by doing that.

232
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,060
I'd offended him long ago.

233
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,090
There's no need to be polite.

234
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,220
We already have enough problems now.

235
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,100
The fewer troubles, the better. This needs to be resolved as soon as possible.

236
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,710
All right, Miss. We will do as you say.

237
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,560
Then... I'm going to prepare a carriage.

238
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,380
By the way, Jinxiu, give the eight thousand taels to Chen Qi to return with everything else.

239
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,830
All right.

240
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,730
What kind of clothes have you made me wear?

241
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,620
- It's scratching my skin—
- What you are wearing

242
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,960
are worn by wealthy families.

243
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,210
Look at what they are wearing.

244
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,340
T-This... What's in this person's mouth?

245
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,900
- Oil.
- Won't he burn his mouth?

246
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,370
Yes, but he's forced to do it by life.

247
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,220
Everyone, please donate.

248
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,030
- My family still needs...
- He's making a living.

249
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,080
Life is not easy.

250
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,960
Look! This is the acrobatics I was telling you about.

251
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,140
His hands are full of injuries.

252
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,660
They have wives and women at home.

253
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,750
If they don't sell their arts, what will their families survive on?

254
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,580
Come look, big steamed bun! Big steamed buns!

255
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,520
Take a look. These vegetables, umbrellas, and silks

256
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,760
are not expensive but not many people are buying them.

257
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,910
Delicious pancakes!

258
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,830
- Uncle, wait a moment.
- Fragrant and crispy pancakes.

259
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,160
- Young Master, how many would you like?
- Two.

260
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,750
Two? All right.

261
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,520
- Here.
- Thank you.

262
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,630
Uncle, try it.

263
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,730
What is this? It's so dirty.

264
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,440
Try it first.

265
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,490
Can people eat this?

266
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,950
They started making these starting at 3:00 a.m.

267
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,710
Every day, they spend four to six hours making them.

268
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,010
By morning, they are only able to make two baskets of these.

269
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,220
They can only keep repeating this, day after day, year after year.

270
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,830
You should also know about our current tax system.

271
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,090
There are only twenty pancakes in two baskets.

272
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,950
Each is sold for only one wen.
(T/N: wen is Chinese currency)

273
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,020
The money that they earn is not even enough to pay taxes.

274
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,210
There are better places over there. Let me show you.

275
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,000
Why did you stop walking?

276
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,640
The Huang residence is ahead. Huang Cheng has never gotten along with my father.

277
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,770
I don't want to pass by his door. I will lose my appetite.

278
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,190
Let the adults worry about their own matters.

279
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,070
You should learn from me.

280
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,830
I leave all the worries to my imperial brothers so I'm happy.

281
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,010
I'm not as magnanimous as you.

282
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,690
He targeted my father. As a son, how can I turn a blind eye?

283
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,690
That's right, too.

284
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,700
Uncle Yuan, since we are talking about Lord Huang,

285
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,760
what has he been busy with lately?

286
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,770
How would I know about palace matters? Don't ask me.

287
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,850
If you don't know, why are you smiling like that?

288
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,780
Don't say that I'm the one who told you.

289
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,070
A few days ago, I went to the palace to get the new satin from the south.

290
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,060
When I passed by the imperial study, I saw Huang Cheng in there.

291
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,700
He told my imperial brother that Duke Cheng was arrogant and despotic in the north,

292
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,970
not respecting my imperial brother at all.

293
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,560
Uncle Yuan, I got it.

294
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,080
Thank you.

295
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,190
Young lad, why did you find me regarding the taxes?

296
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,950
You can just enter the palace to discuss them yourself.

297
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,240
Uncle Yuan, you should know that I'm not very likable. His Majesty doesn't like to see me much.

298
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,740
In addition, with what that old man Huang Cheng said,

299
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,570
I will be beheaded before I can even open my mouth.

300
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,230
At least you are aware of yourself.

301
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,230
Hence, Uncle Yuan, do you agree to help?

302
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,420
You must let me think about this matter carefully.

303
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,420
How can I agree to help you that easily?

304
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,190
Yes, yes. Taxation is a serious matter.

305
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,860
It's good to be cautious.

306
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,200
Is the story you told me earlier true?

307
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,090
You didn't make it up to move me, right?

308
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,830
Of course, it's true.

309
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,910
If you don't believe me, I will take you to meet the mother and son next time,

310
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,530
and you will know.

311
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,020
What I'm most concerned about now

312
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,120
is that young lady with you. Who is she?

313
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,810
A friend.

314
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,060
- Uncle Yuan, drink your tea. Drink up.
- All right.

315
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,120
I won't be annoying and ask.

316
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,640
Second Elder Brother.

317
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,220
Your Highness.

318
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,470
He's on our side. Speak.

319
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,130
Lu Yunqi wants to take Jun Jiuling as his concubine.

320
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,070
The betrothal gifts have already been delivered to Jiuling Hall.

321
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,930
Uncle Yuan, I'm going there to take a look.

322
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,020
- You are not going to keep me company anymore?
- Your Highness.

323
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,010
Jun Jiuling?

324
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:31,040
You're that young lady?

325
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,330
Miss Jun!

326
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,800
Young Lord, please wait.

327
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,070
My miss didn't sleep for the whole night.

328
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,560
Miss Jun.

329
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,030
Miss, I already told him to wait.

330
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,710
He insisted on seeing you at all costs.

331
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,710
Where are the betrothal gifts? Give them to me.

332
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,740
What do you mean? You want her to marry you?

333
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,310
Are you dreaming? I'm referring to the betrothal gifts from Lu Yunqi.

334
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,770
Give them to me.

335
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,500
You're here because of that?

336
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,030
You're still laughing?

337
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,010
Do you know what rumors are being spread out there?

338
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,070
Give them to me now. I will throw them back to him.

339
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,300
Is this matter really worth your panic?

340
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,530
Marriage is the biggest and most important event in life.

341
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,480
How can you be so indifferent?

342
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,030
- May I ask if you saw any betrothal gifts on your way in?
- I...

343
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,290
Did you send them back?

344
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,890
I didn't.

345
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,710
I threw them back at him.

346
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,390
If I threw them at him, they can't do anything to me. However, if your people do that,

347
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,620
they most likely won't be able to come back.

348
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,340
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

349
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,380
How is Rong'er?

350
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,120
He's fine. Everything's fine.

351
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,140
My Lord.

352
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,490
I have an urgent matter.

353
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,650
Who could have imagined something like this would happen to the almighty Lu residence.

354
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,630
- Lord Lu.
- Look.

355
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,890
Since I have the imperial edict with me, then I'm not at liberty to salute you.
[Imperial handwritten edict by Chu Rang]

356
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,860
Lord Lu, please don't blame me.

357
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,230
These are what you sent to us.

358
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,650
We left everything intact and are returning them to you.

359
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,190
Lord Lu, do you want to personally check and receive them?
[Lu Residence]

360
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,860
By the way,
[Lu Residence]

361
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,820
this is a note for eight thousand taels. We are returning this, too.

362
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,770
Lord Lu, please don't make such a joke again.

363
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,850
That's right. Fortune circles around everyone.

364
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,170
I didn't expect to face Lord Lu—

365
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,970
Lord Lu, when I'm excited, it's easy for me to spout nonsense.

366
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,730
Rascal, the last person to spout nonsense

367
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,230
is now dead.

368
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,000
Lord Lu, please stop at this.

369
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Miss Jun has no intentions to continue these games with you.

370
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,200
Tell her that we have many days ahead of us.

371
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,730
I'm leaving.
[Lu Residence]

372
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,980
Let's go.
[Lu Residence]

373
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,690
My Lord, are we really not stopping them?

374
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,810
Disperse!

375
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,080
- Didn't that feel great?
- Yes, great!

376
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,860
This is His Majesty's handwritten letter from before he ascended the throne. It is the equivalent to his imperial edict.

377
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,560
Take this to avoid trouble.

378
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,070
Yes.

379
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:06,090
Look, Lord Lu is usually so arrogant and despotic.

380
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,350
Yet when he saw this handwritten edict, he couldn't do anything.

381
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,350
Isn't that so?

382
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,870
- Miss.
- Is Chen Qi not back yet?

383
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,940
He's not back yet.

384
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,650
Miss! Miss, I'm back.

385
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,280
- You are back.
- How was it?

386
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,760
No need to worry when I handle matters.

387
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,050
Usually that Lu fellow is expressionless.

388
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,190
However, from his eyes today,

389
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,000
I was able to read the word "helplessness."

390
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,260
I bet he was also able to read a word in your eyes.

391
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,380
- "Responsible"?
- "Afraid"!

392
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,020
That's right.

393
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,770
Stop being vain and trying to be impressive.

394
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,450
Our young lady didn't even expose me.

395
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,810
Enough. Stop laughing at Chen Qi.

396
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,080
Chen Qi, you have worked hard.

397
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,940
If that Yamla Lu thinks of any new tricks, what will happen to our young lady's reputation?
(T/N: a judge of the underworld)

398
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,960
Jiuling's current reputation isn't something he can easily ruin.

399
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,620
If he annoys Jiuling, we can report him to His Majesty.

400
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,710
Even if there's no consideration of the handwritten edict,

401
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,880
His Majesty can't disregard the public's opinions too.

402
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,820
That's right. Our miss is now the County Princess of Shanyang.

403
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,250
Chen Qi, thank you very much.

404
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,830
What's there to thank, Miss?

405
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,430
I'm going to put this away.

406
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,580
Sit down and drink some water.

407
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,800
I was scared to death.

408
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,370
I knew you would be scared to death.

409
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,040
This is great.

410
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,620
Miss Jun's actions today really made me see her in a new light.

411
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,270
I didn't expect her to be so brave.

412
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,690
She even thought of using the handwritten edict to return the betrothal gifts. She's truly remarkable.

413
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,150
I really can't figure her out.

414
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,560
Sometimes, she's not proper,

415
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,080
but she acts very boldly.

416
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,090
By the way, Lord Xiao Huang, the son of Huang Cheng has been causing trouble lately.

417
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,670
Lord Wan's family has been miserably harmed by him

418
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,650
because Lord Wan submitted a report with others accusing him of embezzlement of the fund to repair the river.

419
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,580
In the end, not only did the report get thrown out but there are countercharges against Lord Wan.

420
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,020
All evidence now points to Lord Wan embezzling from the fund for the river repairs.

421
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,960
Moreover, he said that Lord Wan accused him of theft to cover himself. After that...

422
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,980
Lord Wan's family was executed.

423
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,060
Lord Wan's whole family was loyal

424
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,940
yet they have been met with such a fate.

425
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,200
How could people not feel bitterly disappointed?

426
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,810
Fortunately, one of Lord Wan's granddaughters was not there at the time.

427
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,510
She escaped this fate and there's a descendant of the family.

428
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,370
- Can she be found?
- We have been searching;

429
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,260
however, we dare not make a scene for fear that the Martial Moral Ministry will find out.

430
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,430
Second Elder Brother, we will investigate as soon as possible. Don't worry.

431
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,950
All right.

432
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,730
Your Highness, I have something to discuss with you.

433
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,030
Can I disagree?

434
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,660
You can't.

435
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,250
But Physician Jun is not willing.

436
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,040
She even returned your betrothal gifts.

437
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,860
There are many things people are unwilling to do in this world.

438
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,180
No one is willing to enter the prison of the Martial Moral Ministry.

439
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,100
However, my Martial Moral Ministry's prison has never been vacant.

440
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,030
She did such great merit for the people.

441
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,850
By doing this, aren't you afraid to be scolded by others?

442
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,720
I'm used to being scolded by others.

443
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,940
Hence, please present a petition to His Majesty.

444
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,650
Is my approval considered some sort of honor?

445
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:10,440
At least, to a woman who will marry in, it is.

446
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,430
- Can I disagree?
- You can't.

447
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,110
Don't you want to see Princess Jiuling again?

448
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,680
- I don't.
- I do.

449
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,980
Do as you please.

450
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,620
You have never said anything about my keeping a mistress out there.

451
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:41,120
This time, it's because it's Physician Jun, right?

452
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,130
You think that she resembles her very much too, right?

453
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,220
She looks especially like her.

454
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,130
No matter how similar, she's not her.

455
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,860
Can't you let her go?

456
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,190
I can't.

457
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,960
I definitely can't!

458
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,470

♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

474
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:14,070
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

475
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:20,120
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

476
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,380
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

477
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,820
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

478
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,810
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

479
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:37,140
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

480
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,590
♫ If memories could speak ♫

481
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,520
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

482
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,080
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

483
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,850
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

484
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:55,480
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

485
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,700
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

486
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,040
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

487
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,130
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

488
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:15,170
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
