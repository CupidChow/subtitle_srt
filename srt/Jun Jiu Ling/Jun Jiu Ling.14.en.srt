00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,470
♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,550
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,540
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,820
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,990
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,930
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:12,440
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,370
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,980
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:31,010
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,760
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,320
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:51,100
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

16
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,900
♫ Dawn... ♫

[Episode 14]

19
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,450
- Young Masters, this way, please.
- Please.

20
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,740
How fragrant.

21
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,570
Why are you here?

22
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,960
- Why can't I be here?
- What's going on?

23
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,440
It's a long story.

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,850
- That... We'll go this way.
- This way. This way, please.

25
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,330
Sit. Sit.

26
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,240
I also want this one.

27
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,910
I went to Zezhou and you followed me.

28
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,100
I went to Prince Huai's residence and you followed me.

29
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,290
I came here to drink

30
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,830
and you still followed me.

31
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,260
What's the meaning of this?

32
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,210
I'm asking you, what's the meaning of this?

33
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,760
You must be suffering internally, coming here alone to get revenge for your family.

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
Aren't I the same?

35
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,880
Miss Jun, are you in a bad mood?

36
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,500
When it comes to drinking, it is all about one's mood.

37
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,250
No matter how much you are drinking, you are still drinking. A few drinks are all right.

38
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,930
Then, how much should one drink when in a good mood?

39
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,450
How much should one drink when in a bad mood?

40
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,080
That varies with each individual.

41
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,200
How about you tell me what's on your mind

42
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,300
and I'll help you analyze it?

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,830
The one who drinks it knows best

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,150
whether the water is hot or cold.
(T/N : One knows best by personal experiences)

45
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,830
If you don't say it, how will you know I don't understand you? Why don't you give it a try?

46
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,110
What if I do understand you?

47
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,630
I...

48
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,340
I won't tell you.

49
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,570
This is bad. Liu'er's grilled meat... is burned.

50
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,640
Shopkeeper, add two plates of meat. Put it on my tab.

51
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,190
Two plates of meat for table two.

52
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,840
I have money.

53
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,440
I know. However, didn't I distract you,

54
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,840
causing your meat to burn? Consider it my compensation.

55
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,420
Shopkeeper, add five plates of meat.

56
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,160
All right. Please wait for a moment.

57
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
Eat this first.

58
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,500
Then, I'll give you this to eat. Don't let Liu'er see.

59
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,150
Do you know that, in the past, when I was happy, I never drank?

60
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,650
Do you know why?

61
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,530
Why?

62
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,540
Because I felt that it's unnecessary to drink if one has nothing troubling on one's mind.

63
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,070
Right? Why should I drink when I'm happy?

64
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,170
In the past... In the past, I was very happy.

65
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,870
I was very happy every day. Hence, I didn't need to drink.

66
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,200
That is not right.

67
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,980
Look. You can drink when you are in a good mood.

68
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,490
When soldiers return from fighting a winning battle, they drink to their hearts' content.

69
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,020
When one is in a bad mood,

70
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,950
don't drink alone.

71
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,740
The more you drink, the more troubles that are on your mind.

72
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,710
Thus, you have to drink with a friend.

73
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,620
This way, everyone will be happy together and push the worries to the back of their minds.

74
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,410
How great is that?

75
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,400
That makes sense.

76
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,660
Baotang.

77
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,090
- Baotang.
- M-Miss Jun.

78
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,190
Let's drink together.

79
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,580
That's not a good idea, is it?

80
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,650
All right. Eldest Brother, come on. I can use this opportunity to introduce you.

81
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,530
Li Sanbing, our eldest brother.

82
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,210
He's the eldest, he's second, and I'm third.

83
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,790
- Eldest Brother.
- This is Miss Jun.

84
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,890
- Miss Jun, I have long heard of your famous name.
- What's going on?

85
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,190
- Bottoms up, Eldest Brother.
- Right.
- All right, Miss Jun. You should drink less.

86
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,230
Take a seat.

87
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,250
Eldest Brother, I cleared my drink.

88
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,780
Miss, here's the wine.

89
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,650
Liu'er, you are finally back.

90
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,930
Young Master Ling, you...

91
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,880
- Move the stools here.
- All right, all right. I will move the stools.

92
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,380
Move the stools over here.

93
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,940
Let's drink together. Hurry and pour the wine for Young Master Ling.

94
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,950
Here, Young Master Ling. Let me pour the wine for you.

95
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,910
- Let me do it.
- Come, let's drink.

96
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,740
- Let's drink.
- Let's drink.

[Fang Residence]

98
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,060
Chengyu, eat more.

99
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,880
You are going to the store to discuss business later, right? Eat more.

100
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,700
All right, Mother.

101
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,240
A letter from the capital.

102
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
It's a letter from Cousin. Give it to me now.

103
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,530
Read it after your meal. The food will be cold.

104
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,370
Grandmother, I'm done eating. Go ahead and eat.

105
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,310
Jiuling Hall has indeed opened for business in the capital.

106
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,810
Is everything going smoothly?

107
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,870
The beginning is always difficult. Everything will become better.

108
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,750
Hand over the letter to me. Let me take a look.

109
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,120
How is this a letter written by Jiuling? Isn't this a complaint letter by Shopkeeper Liu?

110
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,690
Grandmother, what's the complaint?

111
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,280
On the first day of business, she closed the shop and went on the streets to be a wandering physician.

112
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,750
On the next day, she got drunk and slept until noon.

113
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,850
Grandmother, Jiuling must have a reason for doing that.

114
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,280
Then, what do you plan to do?

115
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,540
I plan to write to Shopkeeper Liu

116
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,510
to instruct him to listen to Jiuling's arrangements.

117
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,940
They should do whatever Jiuling tells them to do.

118
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,090
If she tells them to not do anything, then they shouldn't do anything.

119
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,140
In the past, the person most strongly against her was you.

120
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,670
Now, the person who trusts her most is you.

121
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,200
Go on and write a letter to her. Tell Jiuling

122
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,420
to boldly do what she wants to do.

123
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,670
Thank you, Grandmother.

124
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,270
Go now.

125
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,120
Left, go left a little.

126
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,350
Push more with your right hand. Keep it balanced.

127
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,320
How many times have I taught you already? How come you still don't know how to push the cart?

128
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,400
Shut up.

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,430
I've practiced for a long time now. I also want to push it well, all right?

130
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,900
I'm not trying to criticize you but tilt it to the left a little more.

131
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,320
If you truly cannot do it, then let me. It doesn't matter who pushes the cart.

132
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,350
We don't need to separate responsibilities so clearly.

133
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,780
Your job is to provide the sugar figures, molds, and materials.

134

The one in charge of selling is me.

135

I didn't hire you to be my assistant.

136
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,510
Enough. Hurry and get to work. Go sell your sugar figures.

T-Then, I'm really going to go now.

138

- They're fresh.
- Give me some of those, too.

143
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,120
These are all homegrown. Eat them with ease, they're especially fresh.

No, no.

If it works well for you, come again next time.

- Here.
- Thank you, Older Sister.
- How much is it?

174
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,020
- 5 copper coins.

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
- There's enough for everyone. Slow down.
- Slow down.

192
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,250
- There's enough for everyone.
- Yes, yes.

193
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,900
Sister, what does that say?

194
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,830
This says Jiuling Hall. It's the name of our medicinal hall.

195
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,980
- Is it good?
- If it's good, then we will bring more for you all next time.

196
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,320
- Look. She really is being a folk practitioner.
- Take another.

197
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,530
It's been days already. She's been wandering around the city,

198
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,650
giving children candied fruits. A lot of people are going to her now.

199
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,980
Then that means they all know of Jiuling Hall now?

200
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,580
- They do know of it, but...
 - Then everyone gets two and no more than that.

201
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,760
But what? Tell me.

202
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,900
But they said if Jiuling Hall continues to disturb people like this,

203
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,090
- th-they'll report it to the local court.
- Slow down. There's enough for everyone.
- Exactly.

204
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,020
Shopkeeper, are we really not going to do anything about it?

205
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,990
What could we do? Young Master replied to the letter, saying we must follow Miss Jun's orders.

206
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,770
- Without her order, we must not act rashly.
- Tomorrow?

207
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,930
- Just let her be.
- We'll also come tomorrow.

208
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,500
Isn't that Jing Zhaoyin, Lord Zhou's wife?

209
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,720
Older Sister, you're so great.

210
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,910
If you eat too much, your teeth will rot. Slow down.

211
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,260
Give me two.

212
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,840
Madam, slow down.

213
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,690
Little kids, come play with me.

214
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,180
- Hurry and run!
- Wait, we didn't play yet!

215
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,250
Lord Zhou is great at creating trouble out of nothing.

216
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,410
Shopkeeper, why don't we go help?

217
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,440
Wait. Let's watch first.

218
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,210
They all ran away.

219
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,670
They won't play with me.

220
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,250
Madam.

221
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,790
Young Miss,

222
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,700
you've already wandered this alley for several days now.

223
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,420
You always make a ruckus. What are you trying to do?

224
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,530
Madam, I'm the wandering physician from Jiuling Hall.

225
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,330
Do you have anyone that needs medical attention?

226
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,020
"Specialized in treating various, mysterious and difficult illnesses."

227
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,650
"Bring one back to life. Curing illnesses."

228
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,380
Such big talk.

229
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,480
If I did not have the capabilities, then, naturally, I would not dare practice on my own.

230
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,550
However, since you have a medicinal hall,

231
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,890
then you should be sitting in a hall.

232
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,610
If you're a wandering physician, then there shouldn't be a hall for you to sit in.

233
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,030
You are wandering in the name of the medicinal hall,

234
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,770
what is the meaning of this?

235
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,370
Madam, Jiuling Hall just opened and not many people know about it.

236
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,690
Thus, I am acting as a wandering physician to make it easier for me to see everyone.

237
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,760
Young Miss, let me tell you.

238
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,680
This is the capital.

239
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,270
Just this one street has three medicinal halls.

240
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,230
Although not all of them have famous physicians,

241
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,300
they're well known.

242
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,530
If we get sick, we can just walk over and get seen.

243
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,200
We don't need a wandering physician like you at all.

244
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,100
Madam, there are some illnesses that I can treat, while others cannot.

245
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,120
For example,

246
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,350
it looks like you have an ill omen, Madam.

247
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,230
So ominous!

248
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,590
- Where did you scammers come from? Quickly leave!
- What are you doing?

249
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,830
If My Lady says you have an ill omen, then you do.

250
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,020
Madam, your complexion is dull, glabella is dark, and footsteps are unsteady.

251
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,620
I am guessing that you cannot sleep soundly at night.

252
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,300
If this continues, your body will not be able to endure it.

253
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,100
You're spewing nonsense!

254
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,850
Let me tell you. I-I'm warning you out of the kindness of my heart.

255
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,540
If you want to treat illnesses and save people, then you should go to the countryside, where there are hardly any physicians and medicines.

256
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,090
Don't be here, playing tricks.

257
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,240
You are just saying things to gain attention!

258
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,970
- Let's go, let's go. Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go.

259
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,010
Y-You go get someone to clean this area.

260
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,040
- Don't just let anyone come in.
- Yes.

261
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,550
- Madam, be careful.
- So strange.

262
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,980
[Zhou Residence]

263
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,590
- Liu'er, let's go.
- All right.

264
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:35,050
You don't say, Miss Jun is really patient and tolerant.

265
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,550
Shopkeeper Liu, d-do we keep following them?

266
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,960
No. Let's go back to Jiuling Hall.

267
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,050
When she is back for lunch,

268
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,070
I have some things I need to ask her face to face.

269
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,950
[Jiuling Hall]

270
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,440
Let me hold it.

271
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,500
Be careful.

272
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,770
- Miss Jun, you're back.
- Shopkeeper Liu.

273
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,860
We're back.

274
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,210
Shopkeeper Liu.

275
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,510
There are some things

276
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,350
I-I want to discuss with you.

277
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,980
Sure, go ahead.

278
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,270
Miss Jun, you're a physician.

279
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,220
Don't tell people they have ill omens the moment you see them.

280
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,520
That's inappropriate.

281
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,180
You know about it?

282
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,660
Miss Jun, forgive me for being straightforward.

283
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,660
A-Are you planning on scamming or pretending?

284
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,150
- Shopkeeper Liu, how can you call this a scam?
- Liu'er.

285
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,770
If this isn't a scam, what is it? Even supernatural things such as good or bad fortune have been brought up.

286
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,840
Heart bears ghosts, mind bears gods.
 (T/N: meaning that supernatural phenomena come from people's feelings and thoughts)

287
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,460
Illness disturbs the mind and having a weakened vitality lets evil spirits enter easily.

288
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,950
In Madam Zhou's case, her body is weak and her three energies are depleted,
(T/N: essence, qi, and spirit of Traditional Chinese Medicine)

289
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,930
thus she is easily absent-minded.

290
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,080
You mean to say Madam Zhou really is sick?

291
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,890
Yes.

292
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,830
Even if that's the case,

293
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,630
just directly tell her she is sick the next time you see her.

294
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,970
Don't mention an ill omen again.

295
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,010
Illness harms life.

296
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,260
It is an ill omen.

297
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,120
Let's go.

298
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,250
[Ning Residence]

299
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,100
Those who need to see a wandering physician will naturally trust you.

300
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,300
Xiao Ding, will Miss Jun go to the western part of the city today?

301
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,200
She should be. She didn't finish walking around the western part of the city yesterday.

302
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,000
I remember that Eleventh Brother's cousin's wet nurse's son lives in the western part of town.

303
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,700
Tell him to have Miss Jun take a look at him.

304
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,000
Do I tell him that's what you want?

305
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
No.

306
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,600
Find him to drink and chat with. Tell him about what happened in Ru'nan.

307
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Young Master, you are so smart.

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This way he wouldn't suspect anything.

309
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,200
In addition, Miss Jun will not suspect a thing either.

310
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,700
Young Master, you treat Miss Jun so well.

311
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,400
That's because she herself is great.

312
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,500
If she did not have her medical skills, then I would not do this.

313
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,000
Will you do the same if others had the same skills?

314
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,600
Hurry and go. Don't delay matters.

315
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,920
Others are not her so, naturally, I would not.

316
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Jiuling Hall! Miraculous Physician Jiuling!

317
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Bring one back to life! Curing illnesses!

318
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Older Sister, I want candy! I want candy!

319
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
We did not bring candied fruits today.

320
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,200
- We will bring them for you tomorrow.
- Just give me one.

321
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
We will bring some for you all next time.

322
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
Miss, are you Miss Jun?

323
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Yes, I am.

324
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,600
You are so young. Are you the daughter of Miraculous Physician Jun?

325
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,700
I guess I didn't drink the wine in vain.

326
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,000
I have fulfilled what Young Master asked me to do.

327
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Miss, she seems to know the late master.

328
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,100
That's right.

329
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,200
I know. Your Jun family is very well-known.

330
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,800
Here. Help me see

331
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,000
if my health is all right.

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,200
All right.

333
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Madam, you are in good health.

334
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,500
That's impossible.

335
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,200
Check again to see whether I have an ill omen.

336
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,100
Do I need to take any medicine?

337
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,800
Madam, I have felt your pulse. You are very healthy.

338
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,700
You have no ill omen. There is no need for me to do anything.

339
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,600
How can you... How can you be like this?

340
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
What kind of physician are you? What kind of miraculous physician are you?

341
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,000
If you are unwilling to see patients, why do you call yourself a miraculous physician?

342
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,600
What kind of person is she? Why is she even a physician?

343
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's go. Ignore her.

344
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,100
"Grandmother, you have no ill omen."

345
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,400
"There's no need for me to do anything."

346
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,600
Madam Wang Cao yelled at her in the streets for a long time.

347
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Young Master, you know how Madam Wang Cao is.

348
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,800
She will remember this grudge for the rest of her life. Now the entire capital knows

349
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,700
Miss Jun is a physician who has no conscience and only wants to scam people of their money.

350
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,200
Soon enough...

351
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,800
Jiuling Hall will not be able to stay in business.

352
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,600
Young Master, I did not do as you asked properly.

353
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,400
It's not your fault. It's mine.

354
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
What should we do now?

355
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,400
She has always been a strange girl.

356
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,220
She might be plotting something.

357
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,190
I think it best not to interfere with her. Let's just quietly observe.

358
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
What did she say?

359
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,800
"You have no ill omen."

360
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,900
"There's no need for me to do anything."

361
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,200
Did she really say that?

362
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Verbatim.

363
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,860
Second Brother, you may not know.

364
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,800
In just a brief period of time,

365
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,600
it has spread throughout the capital so that everyone knows.

366
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,800
No one is unaware.

367
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,200
She really is unpredictable.

368
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,800
Truly. I think this Miss Jun is truly a strange person.

369
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,600
Actually—

370
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Second Brother, my shoulder is suddenly hurting.

371
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,350
Say, should we have Miss June look at it?

372
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,800
Let's see if she'll take a look at me and see if I have an ill omen.

373
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,000
That is easy. I will treat it for you.

374
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,400
It is suddenly fine now.

375
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,600
There is actually a purpose to what she did.

376
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,000
What is it?

377
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
Doesn't everyone in the capital

378
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,400
know of Jiuling Hall this way? Although it's mostly criticism,

379
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,000
it's better than no one knowing of it. Right?

380
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,300
I understand now.

381
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,000
She wants to get famous this way.

382
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Then, as long as she finds a difficult illness

383
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,130
and cures it, people will forget the bad reputation.

384
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,600
They'll even praise her, saying she can bring one back to life.

385
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
- Second Brother.
- That's a genius strategy.

386
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,000
You really know

387
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,400
this Miss Jun very well.

388
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,700
She did the same thing in Ru'nan.

389
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,000
It's just that this strategy is a bit novel.

390
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,300
She might be attracting too much attention for her own good.

391
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,800
Enough about her. What are we going to eat?

392
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,600
I think that the grilled meat place we went to last time was not bad.

393
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,200
No. What if we run into a drunkard again?

394
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,900
Isn't that exactly what you want?

395
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,800
Madam, here's soup to calm the nerves.

396
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,400
Madam, are you tired? Why don't you go and rest now?

397
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm not tired yet. I'll go to sleep later.

398
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Then let me tell you something funny. It is very interesting.

399
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Everyone on the streets is talking about it.

400
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,300
What is it?

401
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,300
That Miss Jun, who always wanders the streets,

402
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,400
got into some trouble today.

403
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,800
Usually, no one finds her to get looked at and that is fine.

404
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,000
Madam Wang Cao who lives on the Huaihua Alley

405
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,300
went to her to be seen.

406
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,400
Yet she said that Madam Wang Cao has no ill omen.

407
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
There's no need for her to do anything.

408
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Everyone was laughing about it.

409
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
Nanny, what are you talking about?

410
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
You can leave now.

411
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,400
Did you tell anyone about what Miss Jun

412
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,800
said to me a few days ago?

413
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,600
Although it is said that all people are created equal,

414
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,000
Buddha only helps those who help themselves.

415
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,300
A couple of days ago, she stopped me of all people

416
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,200
and said those words about an ill omen.

417
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,920
Could it be that she really saw something?

418
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,410
Madam, what are you looking for?

419
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,170
There's a child crying.

420
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,100
It keeps crying.

421
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,200
Can't you hear it?

422
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,700
I don't hear anything.

423
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,000
Over there.

424
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,710
There.

425
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,600
There.

426
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Go.

427
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,800
Hurry. Hurry and get that physician here. Hurry and go!

428
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,200
Yes.

429
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,700
No.

430
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,800
No, no, no.

431
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,500
No, no, it can't be.

432
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,600
[Jiuling Hall]

433
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,000
Is Physician Jun here?

434
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,200
- Physician Jun!
- Coming!

435
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
It's so late. What is it?

436
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,600
I'm from Lord Zhou's residence, Jing Zhaoyin's servant. I am here to ask Miss Jun to make a trip.

437
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,300
- All right, wait a moment. I will go get her.
- All right.

438
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,700
Miss!

439
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Madam, I will write you a prescription.

440
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,400
You will fully recover after following my instructions for half a month.

441
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,100
Half a month?

442
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,590
I've been ill for years now.

443
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,200
I've seen the Imperial Physicians but nothing has changed.

444
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,800
Half a month? How could I recover in half a month?

445
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,500
Illness of the heart (mind) must be treated with medicine for the heart, Madam.

446
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,700
Since I see your ill omen, then I can resolve it.

447
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,600
Trust me.

448
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,220
May I dare ask...

449
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,000
do you have any children?

450
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,900
Back then, I really had no choice.

451
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,800
My husband was observing mourning for his parents.

452
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,400
If I gave birth to the child,

453
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,300
then my husband's future would have been ruined.

454
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,200
Help me tell him (the baby), it's not that I didn't want him.

455
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,600
I really... really had no choice.

456
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,600
Madam, he just came to see you because he is reminiscing about his relationship with you.

457
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,700
No.

458
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,080
Please send him away.

459
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,400
I beg you, Physician Jun.

460
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,800
- Madam, please stand up.
- Please, I'm begging you.

461
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,500
Madam, please stand up.

462
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,200
Please have a seat.

463
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,300
Liu'er.

464
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,600
Give these pills coupled with the calming incense

465
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,900
to Madam daily for half a month.

466
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,600
Miss Jun, is that all that needs to be done?

467
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,500
As long as you sleep well, you will be cured.

468
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Miss, how did you know about the child?

469
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,300
Can you really see things people don't?

470
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,200
Of course not.

471
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,400
I just observed, listened, questioned, and felt her pulse.
 (T/N: four methods of diagnosis)

472
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,000
In addition, there was the doll that never left her side.

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,400
Thus, I deduced what happened.

474
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I see.

475
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,000
[Jiuling Hall]

476
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Miss Jun, congratulations on receiving your first consultation fee.

477
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,000
I have heard about what happened yesterday.

478
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Shopkeeper Liu, your congratulations has come too early.

479
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,200
I have not yet collected the consultation fee from yesterday.

480
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,600
You have not yet collected it? What is going on?

481
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,800
Physician Jun, this is the consultation fee as promised.

482
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
Here, give it to me.

483
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,700
Please give my thanks to Madam.

484
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,300
Exactly five thousand taels.

485
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,700
Five thousand taels?

486
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,100
Miss Jun,

487
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,600
that much for a consultation fee?

488
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
That's right.

489
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,800
Not just anyone or any illness can be looked at by our young miss.

490
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,420
First, we must see if the illness is worth being treated by my young miss.

491
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,600
Then, it is the consultation fee.

492
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Moving forward, our Jiuling Hall can rise to fame.

493
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,900
Miss, will we wander the streets again today?

494
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,200
Yes.

495
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,600
People from the Yunxiao Pavilion said that Lord Huang doesn't go anywhere other than to the imperial court.

496
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
- How about Huang Ziqing?
- Same as always.

497
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,100
Leveraging on his father's power,

498
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,970
he is selling government positions for money and bullying commoners.

499
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,600
He is doing everything except humane acts.

500
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Someone needs to teach him a lesson. If I run into him one day...

501
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,700
Second Brother, do you want to see "you have no ill omen

502
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,900
and there's no need for me to do anything"?

503
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,040
No.

504
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,400
So beautiful. There are also these colors.

505
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Jiuling Hall! Miraculous Physician Jiuling!

506
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,200
Specialized in treating various, mysterious and difficult illnesses...

507
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,100
Miss, come and have a look here. Have a look.

508
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,200
Young Lord?

509
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,400
What a coincidence.

510
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,000
That's right. What a coincidence, Miss Jun.

511
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,200
There's no good food, wine, or entertainment here, so you all are...

512
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,640
In your eyes, do I only know how to eat, drink, and play?

513
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,700
Do I never do anything serious?

514
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,300
Young Lord, you have been easily angered recently.

515
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,000
Liu'er, get the Young Lord some medicine.

516
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,800
No need. Baotang's shoulder is injured. Take a look at him.

517
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,800
My shoulder is fine now. There is no need to trouble Physician Jun.

518
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,100
Miss Jun, how about you take a look at me?

519
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,600
Do I have any illness?

520
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,400
No, do I have any ill omen?

521
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Sure.

522
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,800
Take note of how you appear publicly. That's enough.

523
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Young Master, you are very healthy. There is nothing to be worried about.

524
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Miss Jun, are you teasing me?

525
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,300
Sanbing, who knew you would be in this predicament one day too.

526
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Turns out this is how it feels to be teased.

527
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,400
Why did you say "too"?

528
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,200
I understand now.

529
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,800
So Miss Jun has teased Second Brother before.

530
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,500
No wonder Second Brother doesn't like Miss Jun.

531
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,200
I am a physician.

532
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,600
Observing, listening, questioning, and feeling for pulse are my duties, so how would this be teasing?

533
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,200
You indeed are very composed.

534
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,600
Other than a general who's been in battles,

535
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,400
you are the only one so composed.

536
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,200
What composure? She is just thick-skinned and knows no shame.

537
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Speaking of thick-skinned, our young miss is no match for you, Young Lord.

538
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,600
I wonder who it was that barged into her bridal chamber

539
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,000
on our lady's wedding day.

540
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,200
I also wonder who it was that snuck into our lady's courtyard every other day.

541
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,800
He even scaled the wall to do it.

542
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,220
You may know a person's exterior but not his heart.

543
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,580
Say, isn't that person thick-skinned?

544
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,300
- Don't you two know why I went there?
- I don't.

545
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,800
Servants indeed take after their masters.

546
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,200
I'm leaving now.

547
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,720
By the way, Baotang and Sanbing want to invite you to have a few drinks with us.

548
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,600
Do you want to give them face and come?

549
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,400
Eldest Brother and I sincerely invite you.

550
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Second Brother as well.

551
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,800
I am very busy. Thank you for the invite.

552
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,000
Physician Jun! Physician Jun, I finally found you!

553
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,600
Look. Do I have an ill omen?

554
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
You do not, Madam.

555
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,400
I may not have it, but how about you came to my home to see who does?

556
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,200
I have heard about it. Lord Zhou's wife's

557
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,800
years of heart illness has been cured by you.

558
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,800
That is because you immediately saw she has an ill omen.

559
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,700
Miss Jun, please come with me to have a look.

560
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,910
Sure. Madam, please lead the way.

561
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Miss Jun's way of diagnosing illness is very strange.

562
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,400
That's right. She's still so frivolous.

563
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,600
Eldest Brother, I am a bit hungry. Let's go eat.

564
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,200
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

565
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Wait for me!

566
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,000
Physician Jun, this way, please.

567
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,400
If people like her come looking for me one by one,

568
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,600
then I can build a reputation among the inner courts of the residences.

569
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,800
Until I can reach the Prince Huai residence from here

570
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,000
and stand in front of Older Sister and Jiurong.

571
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,400
That day should not be far.

572
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,200
