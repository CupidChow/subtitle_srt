00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,400
♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,600
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,600
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,800
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,800
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,000
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,900
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,400
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,800
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:31,000
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,800
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,200
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:50,300
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,100
♫ Dawn... ♫

[Jun Jiu Ling]

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,500
[Episode 18]

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,040
Where are you going?
[Prince Huai Residence]

20
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,200
I am going to go decoct medicine for Prince Huai.

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Why don't you let someone else do it? Wouldn't that be faster?

22
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,100
I am not at ease with someone else doing it.

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,870
Lord Lu, as you know, I came on my own accord this time.

24
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,900
Many people are waiting to see me fail.

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,800
If I lose, wouldn't I look bad?

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,600
By the way, no one is allowed to touch the materials I use to decoct the medicine.

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,400
Otherwise, if Prince Huai's illness can't be cured,

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,800
then it is not my responsibility.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Including you, Lord Lu.

30
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,700
Your Highness.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
His body is very clear.

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Does Your Highness think that the prince has scrofula as well?

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
I do not know medicine.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
If the Imperial Physicians say it is, and Physician Jun says it is,

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,700
then it must be.

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,600
Does Your Highness know what the name of Physician Jun's medical hall is?

37
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,600
Her medicinal hall's name is Jiuling Hall.

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,200
And her name is Jun Jiuling. Don't you think it is a coincidence?

40
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,800
Yes.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,800
Back then, I felt that it was not appropriate for her to take this name.

42
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,600
But I didn't stop her, and now something has happened.

43
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,200
What's wrong with being called Zhenzhen? Why must she change her name?

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Mother, she changed her name because of the Jun family's ancestral business.

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,000
It is to show her determination to shoulder that responsibility.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
It is a name, not just a reckless game.

47
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,000
She has always been working tirelessly for this name's sake.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,600
Therefore, she cannot change this name.

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,400
Are you really willing to do so much for her? Even giving her the handwritten edict?

50
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,800
Yes.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Did she write to you asking for it, or are you giving it to her of your own accord?

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,000
She didn't ask me for it. I am the one who wants to give it to her.

53
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Grandmother. Mother.

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Jiuling is our Fang family's lucky star.

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,700
After she came, my illness was cured and our enemies were eliminated.

56
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,000
Our family and she depend on each other. We have to protect her life to the best of our abilities.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,200
In a way, we are also protecting our own lives.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,500
Chengyu,

59
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
did you say all that because you like her?

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,800
I can't hide anything from you all.

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,100
I thought I hid it pretty well.

62
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,000
Your eyes can't hide your feelings.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,600
Your eyes light up whenever you talk about her. We all know

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,800
you spread the news of the fake marriage because of her.

65
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
In fact, if you didn't say anything, no one would know about that.

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,700
Wouldn't doing that have been better for you?

67
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,500
It is because the marriage before, was a deal between you all and her.

68
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,700
I sincerely like her.

69
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,800
So, I want to wait for her return,

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
in hopes of truly marrying her.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,200
If she is willing, that is.

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,900
Chengyu, send her the handwritten edict.

73
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,400
Keep it in Jiuling Hall.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Thank you for your approval, Grandmother.

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Then, I will go and arrange it.

76
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,800
Mother.

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,000
If you were her, would you be willing to let go of the name "Jiuling Hall"?

78
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,400
For so many years, we lived so miserably.

79
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,000
Did you ever think of giving up?

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,300
Honestly, I did.

81
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,900
Yet you persevered and did not give up.

82
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,600
Why is that?

83
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Because I could not accept it.

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,800
That's right. We could not accept it. It was all for the sake of a name.

85
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,700
Why should we give up?

86
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Grandmother, would all that Chengyu is doing now

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,600
out of love be in vain?

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,200
How would it be in vain?

89
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,600
As long as he does what he can, then his love exists

90
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,000
and it is worth it.

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,400
Feelings are just feelings.

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,000
If you don't act on your feelings, then that is truly tragic.

93
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,200
Our Chengyu isn't the kind

94
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,600
who is fickle with his feelings.

95
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,700
I'll soothe Rong'er's breathing. You feed him the medicine.

96
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,400
All right.

97
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,950
Are you the only daughter in your family?

98
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,100
Yes.

99
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,430
- Is this medicinal hall passed down by your family?
- Yes.

100
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,000
Jiuling Hall has been passed down by my family.

101
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,300
Jiuling Hall...

102
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,990
This name is nice.

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,700
It is named that

104
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,200
because Jiuling means longevity.

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,880
I also hope that Prince Huai will live a long life.

106
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,630
I hope so, too.

107
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,610
Sister. Sister.

108
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,400
Sister.

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
- Rong'er.
- Your Highness.

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,300
Rong'er. Rong'er, you are awake?

111
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
You scared me to death.

112
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
You slept for many days.

113
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Elder Sister, I dreamed that you and Second Sister

115
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,400
kept me company.

116
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,800
I am here with you.

117
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I have been here with you the whole time.

118
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,600
It is good that you are awake.

119
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,400
Rong'er, good boy.

120
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
If you are ill in any way, tell me.

121
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
Are you hungry? Is there anything you want to eat?

122
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Rong'er.

123
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,200
W-Who are you?

124
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,000
I am the physician who came to treat you.

125
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,560
It is good that His Highness is awake.

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,800
Sister, I am hungry.

127
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Hungry?

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Physician Jun, can he eat solid food now?

129
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
He has overcome the most critical time. He can eat solid food now.

130
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,290
However, light food is better.

131
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,540
All right.

132
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,190
Rong'er, here.

133
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,800
Lie down and rest.

134
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,200
I will trouble Physician Jun to look after Rong'er. I will go make your favorite noodle soup.

135
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,710
I will trouble you, Physician Jun.

136
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,670
Rest assured, Your Highness.

137
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,390
Your Highness, do you feel ill anywhere?

138
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,590
No.

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,850
You were unconscious for such a long time,

140
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,360
so your body is most likely weak.

141
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,660
But it is fine.

142
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,250
After a few days, when your body feels better,

143
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,730
you can take a stroll outside.

144
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,970
I am a bit tired.

145
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,660
Physician Jun, please go outside.

146
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,770
All right. Then, get some good rest.

147
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,450
Rong'er.

148
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,330
Back then, I could not save Imperial Father.

149
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,520
However, I have saved you now.

150
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,400
You must persevere.

151
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,920
You must live on bravely.

152
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,870
You must wait for me.

153
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,850
Eldest Sister. Rong'er.

154
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,110
I promise you two...

155
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,210
that I will return.

156
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,490
I made a big bowl of noodle soup.

157
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,700
Let's see how much you can eat.

158
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,960
Elder Sister only knows how to make a few simple dishes.

159
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,000
So many complicated dishes and delicacies.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,110
Most likely, not all of them were made by her personally.

161
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,190
Your Highness, please wait.

162
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,290
What is wrong?

163
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,830
I want to see if he can eat these dishes.

164
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,480
Physician Jun, what do you mean by this?

165
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,070
Are you afraid that there is something wrong with the food in the Huai residence?

166
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,750
His Highness is still consuming medicine after all.

167
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,050
I'm merely afraid that some food will be incompatible with that.

168
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,620
Then, Physician Jun, can you let us know what restrictions there are?

169
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,130
Then, we can avoid them.

170
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,740
There are too many.

171
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,750
The medication changes every day. It is hard to say.

172
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,730
Your Highness, you can go ahead.

173
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,250
Here.

174
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,450
Is it good?

175
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,210
It has been a long time since I ate the noodle soup that you have made.

176
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,670
The last time was during your wedding.

177
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,650
Then, eat more today.

178
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,450
On the day of the wedding, you woke up early to make it for me.

179
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,560
You almost missed the auspicious hour to get dressed.

180
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,840
I am married now.

181
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,980
So, naturally, I cannot be by your side all the time.

182
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,340
I will make it for you every opportunity I get.

183
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,030
If you all didn't get married, then that would be great.

184
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,500
You shouldn't speak while eating, just as you wouldn't talk while trying to sleep.

185
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,470
If you keep on talking,

186
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,920
the food will get cold.

187
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,140
Your Highness, I will go decoct medicine for Prince Huai.

188
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,040
Here, take a big bite.

189
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,070
Reporting to Your Majesty. Commander Lu is asking to see you.

190
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,180
- Summon him.
- Yes.

191
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,780
Your Majesty, Physician Jun whom you sent, successfully cured Prince Huai's illness.

192
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,290
He's been cured?

193
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,530
Yes.

194
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,380
Even scrofula can be cured?

195
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,500
That Jun Jiuling is highly skilled in medicine.

196
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,320
Jun Jiuling.

197
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,620
She can really cause trouble.

198
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,750
I think this may not be a bad thing.

199
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,440
At this time, if Prince Huai dies of scrofula,

200
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,910
even if the whole world knows

201
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,380
that this illness is often life-threatening,

202
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,750
there may still be some unscrupulous people who may create malicious rumors out of this.

203
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,910
Even if you make a scapegoat of Physician Jun,

204
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,660
it may still affect your good reputation.

205
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,880
Now that Prince Huai has recovered from his illness,

206
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,270
the common people would only praise that you are merciful and humane

207
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,180
for pitying the late emperor's son.

208
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,610
Why do I feel that

209
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,990
you are making excuses for Prince Huai and Jun Jiuling?

210
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,790
I do not dare. Towards Your Majesty,

211
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,760
I am utterly loyal.

212
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,620
Is that so?

213
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,780
Prince Huai's body is fragile to start with.

214
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,880
He will be even weaker after this illness.

215
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,210
Death for a young man like that is a common occurrence.

216
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,780
At that time, the common people

217
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,510
will only mourn that Prince Huai died young,

218
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,090
and will not suspect your intentions.

219
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,020
This Miss Jun is truly amazing.

220
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,510
She is truly capable.

221
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,880
That's scrofula!

222
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,790
Miraculous Physician Jun is indeed Miraculous Physician Jun. Bring one back to life. Truly.

223
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,800
- Come on.
- Yes, yes, yes!

224
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,160
The same place, the same roasted meat.

225
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,840
Although it's not all the same people, we still have to drink the same Meixin wine from Sanyuan Restaurant.

226
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,950
Where did you learn that from? You are always so frivolous.

227
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,680
Second Brother, I'm not being frivolous.

228
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,230
I'm talking about wine. Are you talking about a person?

229
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,770
Don't push your luck.

230
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,510
You're guilty.

231
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,740
Miss Jun has cured Prince Huai.

232
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,940
But will that person... just leave it at that?

233
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,360
That's right.

234
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,350
Unless someone helps her ask for forgiveness...

235
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,170
You two definitely cannot guess

236
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,250
who asked for forgiveness for her.

237
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,860
There's really someone who asked for forgiveness for her?

238
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,550
Who?

239
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,180
Lu Xiaozao.

240
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,360
No way.

241
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,400
Isn't that Lu person on bad terms with

242
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,910
Miss Jun because of the Jiuling Hall plaque?

243
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,160
For him to not kick her while she is down is already great. Yet he even risked himself to ask for forgiveness?

244
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,900
What logic is that?

245
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,450
Is it because Miss Jun cured Prince Huai?

246
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,090
So he asked for forgiveness in order to avoid His Majesty's wrath?

247
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,190
He is afraid of being implicated.

248
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,590
I keep feeling that it's related to their discussion at Jiuling Hall.

249
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,370
I got it.

250
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,000
That's definitely it. It's because

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,300
that Lu person is afraid that if Miss Jun is sentenced, there will be no one to cure his ill omen.

252
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,200
- You're becoming more and more outrageous.
- Let's drink. Let's drink.

253
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,400
I am speaking the truth.

254
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,820
I hope that Rong'er can sleep well tonight.

255
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,300
He will.

256
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,300
Jiuling.

257
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,790
I had a younger sister who was also named Jiuling.

258
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
However, she was not as obedient as you.

259
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
She was a child who caused headaches to others.

260
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,200
Nonsense, I did not.

261
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,600
Then... is Your Highness's younger sister—

262
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,400
Lord Lu.

263
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Your Highness.

264
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,400
Since Prince Huai is much better, and you have been with him for so many days,

265
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,200
don't tire yourself out.

266
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,780
Please return home, Princess.

267
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,630
All right.

268
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,000
You've worked hard, Physician Jun.

269
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,220
Your Highness, rest assured.

270
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,980
Do you believe in reincarnation?

271
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I do not know.

272
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,000
I did not believe it before either.

273
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,600
However, I really want to believe in it now.

274
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,200
The same name and age.

275
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,500
Could Lu Yunqi have been speaking about her?

276
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,800
[Prince Huai Residence]

277
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,800
Your Highness, you are awake.

278
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,300
Has my older sister left?

279
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,400
Yes, Your Highness. The princess has already ordered us to prepare your favorite pastries.

280
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
I will get them for you now.

281
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,100
His Highness is still taking medicine. He should wait a few days before eating sweets.

282
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Then we shall wait for His Highness to get better so he can eat whatever he wants.

283
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,450
You're awake?

284
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,180
Do you feel better today, Your Highness?

285
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,400
However, you cannot lie down like this all the time.

286
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,360
You should go out to walk more.

287
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,200
That way your body will strengthen.

288
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I see that the weather is great today.

289
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How about I take you out to move around?

290
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
C-Can I?

291
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,400
Of course.

292
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,800
All right.

293
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,600
Go prepare some clothes for His Highness.

294
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes.

295
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,800
Then let's drink the medicine first.

296
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Be careful.

297
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,600
Your Highness, do you want to go on the swing?

298
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Can I?

299
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
Let's go.

300
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,400
Here.

301
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
Be careful.

302
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
- Should I push you?
- Yes.

303
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,000
Be careful. Come on.

304
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,440
One.

305
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,500
Two.

306
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,800
Three.

307
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,700
Is this all right? Are you scared?

308
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,600
This is so fun! Push me higher.

309
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,200
Higher? Is Your Highness not scared?

310
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,800
All right then. I will you push higher now.

311
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,900
One.

312
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
Two.

313
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,500
Your Highness is so courageous!

314
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,300
I'm going so high.

315
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,600
I used to sit on this frequently in the past.

316
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,800
Why did you stop later on?

317
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Because they said I must be like adults.

318
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,400
I must be mature and steady.

319
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Your Highness hasn't come of age yet,

320
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,200
so you can play!

321
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,250
They all say I'm an adult. Only you say I'm not.

322
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,600
That's right.

323
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,200
Your Highness will have plenty of time in the future to be an adult,

324
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,600
so you should play now. Isn't that right?

325
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Physician Jun, I hid a toy here in the past.

326
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Do you know where I hid it?

327
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Let me guess.

328
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,800
Your Highness hid it... under the bamboos!

329
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,300
Nope.

330
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
No?

331
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,500
Then...Your Highness hid it behind the rock!

332
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,400
Also wrong!

333
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
At the time...

334
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,100
Then where did you hide it?

335
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,500
At the time, Second Sister and I

336
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,800
hid it underneath this swing.

337
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,880
Your Highness sure is amazing.

338
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,700
Your Highness.

339
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,800
Do you want to hear stories about the outside world?

340
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,100
Yes!

341
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,800
You're like Second Sister. Whenever she returned from outside,

342
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,000
she would always tell me stories about the outside world!

343
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,200
- Really?
- Your Highness.

344
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,400
Lord Lu.

345
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,800
People from the palace have come to check on you.

346
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,400
How about... you return to your room first?

347
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,100
Prince Huai has never gotten close to anyone.

348
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,400
However, you and he act as though you two are old friends.

349
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,310
Perhaps I'm just to His Highness' liking.

350
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
Is that so?

351
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,100
Yes. I will go decoct medicine for His Highness.

352
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,400
Since Prince Huai's illness is getting better day by day,
 [Jiuling Hall]

353
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,700
then Miss should be back in the next few days.

354
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,900
This won't do. I have to go get a set of clothes for her.

355
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,000
This is the correct type of medicines.

356
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,100
Go take inventory of things again. Be careful to get the quantities correct.

357
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,780
- Chen Qi.
- Jinxiu.

358
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,500
When do you intend to leave? So that I can make preparations earlier.

359
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,500
After the lunar new year. I just have to make it home for the Double Third Festival.

360
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,000
You should know that the Double Third Festival is more important to my Chen family than Lunar New Year.

361
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,600
Chen Qi.

362
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
How much have they offered you?

363
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,900
That is not up to them. It would depend on how well business goes for Jinyun Restaurant that day.

364
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:05,400
I mean, how much did my family give you to take care of me?

365
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,530
- Why would your family give me money? I was your boss for selling sugar figures.
- Chen Qi!

366
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,540
Just... not a lot.

367
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,820
Young Master Fang said about ten thousand taels of silver.

368
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,790
Younger Brother still doesn't quite know how to do business.

369
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,340
He made a loss.

370
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,940
Not a loss! You are worth a lot more!

371
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,040
Imperial Physician Jiang, how is he?

372
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,420
Prince Huai has been cured.

373
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,000
What is left is for him to be nourished back to good health.

374
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,500
His Majesty can rest assured now.

375
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,970
I will return to the palace to report this to His Majesty now.

376
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,620
Physician Jun can return home as well.

377
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,030
You can leave his nourishment to our Imperial Physicians Hall.

378
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,570
Let's go.

379
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,720
Physician Jun, do you have any other instructions for us?

380
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,150
Prince Huai's scrofula

381
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,710
was cured by me. However, if any other problems arise,

382
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,320
I hope Physician Jiang won't put the blame on me.

383
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,090
That will be the responsibility of the Imperial Physicians Hall.

384
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,610
How dare you! Are you cursing Prince Huai?

385
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:43,540
I don't dare. It's just that, a curse won't cause Prince Huai to be sick.

386
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,290
However, if a physician shirks from his responsibility and is incompetent, then it will cause the illness to never go away.

387
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,620
You!

388
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,460
Physician Jun's medicinal skills are exceptional.

389
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,700
I will surely ask His Majesty for recognition on your behalf.

390
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,570
Thank you, Imperial Physician Jiang.

391
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,160
His Majesty rewards heavily.

392
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,860
Physician Jun, you must be able to bear it.

393
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,610
Your Highness, you are cured now.

394
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,470
I must leave now.

395
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:56,240
From now on, you must take good care of yourself.

396
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,520
You cannot eat carelessly.

397
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,830
I will keep that in mind.

398
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,490
After you grind this, put it together with that.

399
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,530
Liu'er.

400
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,260
Miss, you are back!

401
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,980
- Jiuling, you are back.
- Miss.

402
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,900
Jinxiu. Chen Qi.

403
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,210
Why didn't you let us know in advance? We could have picked you up.

404
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,720
It's not far. I just walked back.

405
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,000
We were all worried about you. Especially Young Master.

406
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,650
He wrote many letters to ask about you.

407
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,900
I have caused you all to worry. I will go write a reply to him now.

408
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,100
Miss, do you know? Young Master sent His Majesty's handwritten edict here.

409
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,750
It will be placed here in Jiuling Hall. Let's see who dares to come here to cause trouble again.

410
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,520
Chengyu sent the handwritten edict here?

411
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,900
That's right.

412
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,860
Grandmother actually allowed him to do that?

413
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,720
Younger Brother knows what he is doing.

414
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,630
Curing Rong'er has angered Chu Rang to begin with.

415
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,550
Now, there is this handwritten edict.

416
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,140
Although we can block many troubles from Lu Yunqi

417
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,370
and protect Jiuling Hall's plaque,

418
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:22,310
I'm afraid this will make Chu Rang more unhappy.

419
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,730
What is the Fang family thinking?

420
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,980
They actually sent the handwritten edict to Jiuling Hall.

421
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,460
That handwritten edict is the family's life-preserving charm.

422
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,340
If they were to lose it,

423
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,880
are they not afraid of Your Majesty ending their lives?

424
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,570
If that seal still exists, then it will be very troublesome.

425
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,140
Even the late emperor was not able to find it.

426
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,480
it must be long gone.

427
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:58,580
That Jun Jiuling is just a granddaughter of the Fang family.

428
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,400
Yet that Old Madam treats her

429
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,180
more importantly than her only grandson

430
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,930
of three generations.

431
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,860
The Fang family isn't bold enough to tell her

432
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,940
the secret from back then, right?

433
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,070
However, this girl changed her name

434
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,810
and came to the capital to open Jiuling Hall.

435
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,560
She even asked to treat Prince Huai.

436
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,230
Now there is this handwritten edict.

437
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,760
All these are too coincidental, are they not?

438
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,410
She's famous now.

439
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,270
This... This is not easy to take care of.

440
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,800
Miss Jun's medicinal skills are indeed exceptional.

441
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,610
It looks like your grandfather

442
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,790
being treated by her grandfather was not a lie.

443
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,590
I have never thought that her words were lies.

444
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,530
Uncle, did you think it was a lie?

445
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,370
In your mother's letters, she mentions

446
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,220
that Miss Jun spoke rudely and without thinking.

447
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,700
Her personality is dubious. If she were really such a girl,

448
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,130
it is a definite possibility that she could have created a lie to fool us.

449
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,260
It was just a misunderstanding.

450
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,290
The marriage arrangement was real.

451
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:24,610
Of course, the marriage arrangement being canceled is also a reality.

452
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,500
It is good that you know this.

453
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,140
What you can do and what you can't do, you should know clearly.

454
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,690
Yes.

For the Ning family and for yourself,

I won't keep you for dinner. Pack some clothes

♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

485
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,040
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

486
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,490
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

487
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,510
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

488
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,790
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

489
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,260
♫ If memories could speak ♫

490
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,250
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

491
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:57,550
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

492
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:24,790
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

493
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,800
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

494
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,600
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

495
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:42,200
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

496
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,400
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

497
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,400
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

498
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,000
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

499
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,200
♫ If memories could speak ♫

500
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,200
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

501
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,600
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

502
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,000
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

503
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,200
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

504
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,600
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

505
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,800
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

506
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

507
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:32,000
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
