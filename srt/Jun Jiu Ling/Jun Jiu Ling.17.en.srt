♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,500
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

[Episode 17]

19
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,780
Miss Jun.

20
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,770

[Jiuling Hall]

22
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,920
Lord Lu, what is the meaning of this?

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,050
You know what I mean.

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
I will ask you again.

25
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,210
Will you change your name or not?

26
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,480
Lord Lu.

27
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,920
Jiuling Hall is our Jun family's business that has been passed down for generations.

28
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,170
Now, my grandfather and father are no longer with me,

29
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,200
and so I am the only person who remains in the family.

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,020
Therefore, I must fulfill my ancestor's wishes and continue Jiuling Hall.

31
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,930
Please be understanding, Lord Lu.

32
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,400
I am not able to carry out your orders.

33
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,630
Lord Lu, all of Jiuling's family members have passed away.

34
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,450
She is an orphan continuing her family business.

35
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,970
Please have mercy, Lord Lu.

36
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,510
Jinxiu.

37
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,160
Let's end this matter here.

38
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,320
In front of Physician Jun,

39
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,670
destroy the plaque.

40
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,510
You dare?

41
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,150
You've got some nerve.

42
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,890
Jiuling!

43
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,020
Xiao Zao Lu, you are quite arrogant.

44
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,400
Bullying a young girl on the streets.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,870
I don't need to explain the Martial Moral Ministry investigating a case to you.

46
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,720
You want to destroy it, but I just won't let you.

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,860
Whoever is more capable gets to do as he wishes.

48
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,020
Let's see if you have such capabilities.

49
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,070
- Miss Jun!
- JiuIing!

50
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,550
Are you crazy? Do you not want to live?

51
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,280
I'll protect this plaque with my life.

52
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,160
Some things cannot be protected just because you want to protect them.

Zhu Zan.
[Jiuling Hall]

54
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,010
Lord Lu, can we talk in private?

55
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,400
That's not necessary, is it?

56
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,250
Whether it's necessary, you will only know after you do it.

57
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,460
Afterward, if you still want to destroy the plaque,

58
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,120
- Jiuling Hall will let you!
- Miss.

59
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,220
Lord Lu, I can tell you have a bad omen.

60
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,780
Do you think I will believe this nonsense you spout to trick others?

61
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,600
She... has never shown up in your dreams, right?

62
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,850
Who is "she"?

63
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,760
You know who I am talking about. She is your bad omen.

64
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,620
Is that so?

65
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,130
If that is so, then there's no need for me to be treated. It is a good thing.

66
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,200
Having such great resentment is not a good thing, Lord Lu.

67
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,160
Resentment?

68
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,410
Are you saying that she resents me?

69
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,920
To be more accurate, it is hate.

70
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,660
- Let me tell you.
- Hate you to the core.

71
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,020
I don't know from where you heard of these things

72
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,560
in order to make up this story;

73
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,580
however, I won't believe

74
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,450
any of the words you speak.

75
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,220
Whether you believe it or not,

76
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,840
you will know after you consume the medication, Lord.

77
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,560
Please wait a bit, Lord,

78
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,810
to see the prescription I write for you.

79
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,140
Lord...

80
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,680
your prescription.

[Bai Zi Ren Wan]
(T/N: prescription given to young lady with worries in their heart)

82
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,220
Jun Jiuling, you are something.

83
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,680
I shall remember you now.

84
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,760
Lord, take care.

85
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,990
Thank you for today.

86
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,800
Don't flatter yourself.

87
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,870
I just don't like Lu Yunqi.

88
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,860
I'll do the same for anyone.

89
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,880
I want to thank you,

90
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,930
that someone who helps anyone treated unfairly that he happens upon.

91
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,780
What did you say to Lu Yunqi today?

92
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,860
Why was his face so pale when he left?

93
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,890
That's right, Miss. At that time, even our heir apparent here could not chase him away.

94
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,340
What did you say to scare him away?

95
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,330
If you want to ask, just ask. Why mention me?

96
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,680
I just told him that he had an ill omen, gave him a prescription, and he left.

97
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,190
Will a person like him believe that?

98
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,110
He has no choice but to believe in my words.

99
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,650
As I said, our miss is the most capable.

100
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,870
You really know how to flatter others.

101
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,840
In any case, after such a scene,

102
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,180
no one would dare bully Jiuling Hall anymore.

103
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,890
I'm leaving now.

104
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,680
Does it still hurt?

105
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,910
It's much better.

106
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,110
Cousin, Prince Huai is sick, and it's very difficult to treat.

107
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,280
An imperial physician sold all his assets at the De Shengchang in the capital

108
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
for a banknote. A secret investigation revealed that

109
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,260
it is because of the difficulty of Prince Huai's illness.

110
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,000
He is worried that His Majesty will become angry, expelling him from the Imperial Physicians Hall.

111
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,020
Hence, he exchanged everything for a banknote in advance

112
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,040
so he can readily leave.

113
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,630
I remember you asked about Prince Huai before.

114
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,620
So I paid extra attention to this matter

115
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,810
and wanted to tell you of it.

116
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,840
Grandmother doesn't know about this. Remember not to mention this.

117
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,520
Originally, Prince Huai was not critically ill.

118
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,910
However, after being repeatedly sick, his illness became serious.

119
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,710
Jiuling, treating illnesses is easy, but saving lives is difficult.

120
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,150
You must be careful.

121
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,660
These imperial physicians are already running away at the first sign of trouble.

122
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,890
Looks like Rong'er illness is more serious than I thought.

123
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,880
Today, I deliberately showed Lu Yunqi my previous handwriting.

124
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,860
He will surely think of a way to test me again.

125
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,400
To get closer to Rong'er, I can only walk this dangerous road.

126
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,920
Why is her writing so similar to Princess Jiuling's?

127
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,520
She even changed her name to that of the princess.

128
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,950
What is she trying to do?

129
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,380
[Banknote]

130
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,970
Is there a problem with this banknote?

131
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,080
This is not fake.

132
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,640
Of course, it is not fake.

133
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,100
However, the consultation fee for that day was 2,000 taels.

134
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,800
No one would give you so much money for no reason.

135
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,370
Then, what are the extra 8,000 taels for?

136
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,840
That extra 8,000 taels,

137
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,230
was to ask me to change the name of Jiuling Hall.

138
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,810
Are you worried about Prince Huai's illness?

139
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,640
These past few days, he's gotten worse.

140
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,450
It's now hard for him to get out of bed.

141
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,790
Princess, please rest assured. There will be a way.

142
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,680
Do you believe... in the reincarnation of the soul?

143
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,590
- I don't know.
- I didn't believe it before.

144
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,430
However, I really want to believe that now.

145
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,220
You want her to come back?

146
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,710
Yes.

147
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,610
I really want to believe that, too.

148
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,590
However... that is not possible.

149
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,470
Why is it not possible?

150
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,010
The world is big.

151
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,880
There can be coincidences.

152
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,240
Perhaps the eyes are similar.

153
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,560
Perhaps the voice is similar.

154
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,650
Perhaps the demeanor is similar.

155
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,310
However, being similar is just similar.

156
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,500
It is not the same.

157
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,310
It is late.

158
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,490
Rest early, Your Highness.

159
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,800
Even if I believe it,

160
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,800
how would I be willing

161
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,000
to have her come back again?

162
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,510
It has been some time since we've come here from Zezhou.

163
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,400
Second Brother, the fate between you and Miss Jun is quite deep.

164
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,300
Eldest Brother, I really hope that I can have such a fate, too.

165
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,250
You?

166
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,770
Who says our Baotang can't have such a thing?

167
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,180
Second Brother, I want it,

168
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,030
but there are some things that I can't have just because I want them.

169
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,220
However, for someone, he may not want something yet he will still get it.

170
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,580
Are we talking about Sanbing?

171
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,900
- Then, who is it? Why didn't you tell me?
- Scram.

172
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,660
In this lifetime, I would never go looking for such trouble.

173
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,310
Let me tell you two. As long as it is a woman—

174
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,920
- She will be very troublesome.
- She will be very troublesome.

175
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,050
You know me very well.

176
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,160
I thought he became enlightened.

177
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,260
It's you who's not enlightened.

178
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,050
Baotang is talking about you.

179
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,450
- Me?
- Yes.

180
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:45,180
Second Brother, you... like her.

181
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,560
Don't spout nonsense.

182
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,310
Keep talking nonsense and I'll bring you to her to be treated.

183
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,490
Look, he wants to go see her.

184
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,620
Baotang, let me tell you.

185
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,260
When you like someone, you must hold onto her.

186
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,540
Got it, Eldest Brother.

187
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,670
That is such a serious matter. Why are you only telling me now?

188
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,470
Young Master, didn't you say you wanted to concentrate on your studies and didn't want me to disturb you?

189
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,420
Besides, after the last time, didn't you stop me from getting news about Miss Jun?

190
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,280
How is that the same? Not pestering her and not inquiring news about her is different from this matter.

191
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,520
Commander Lu is too dangerous. How could you not tell me about this kind of situation?

192
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,960
Yes, Young Master.

193
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,920
I was wrong.

194
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,630
I heard that the matter arose because something went wrong with treating Lord Lu's mistress.

195
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,600
There are also people who say that it is because Lord Lu and the heir apparent of Duke Cheng have taken a liking to Miss Jun.

196
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,760
- Thus...
- Nonsense! How laughable!

197
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,080
When you see a woman at odds with a man,

198
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,690
you all can only think of such things.

199
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,920
I didn't see it. I only heard about it.

200
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,180
Is the reason not simple? It is because of Jiuling Hall's name.

201
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,170
Then what about Heir Apparent?

202
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,150
- I invited Miss Jun to see the lanterns on the night of the 15th.
- Oh?

203
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,000
- Miss Jun rejected.
- Oh.

204
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,830
It's probably because of Lord Lu.

205
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,100
He will do anything that would make Lord Lu unhappy.

206
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Young Master, then we should go see Miss Jun.

207
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,640
She doesn't need me to go to her.

208
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,250
Lord Lu didn't accomplish his objective this time.

209
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,490
Perhaps there will be a next time.

210
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,110
T-Then, isn't Miss Jun in great danger?

211
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,560
Heir Apparent can't protect her every time.

212
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,640
This matter will depend on the Fang family's thoughts.

213
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,080
If the Fang family is willing...

214
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,530
Sister.

215
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,950
Rong'er, I am here.

216
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,000
Sister.

217
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,020
Rong'er.

218
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,510
Your Highness.

219
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,980
Time for medicine, Rong'er.

220
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,960
Here, Rong'er. Let's drink the medicine.

221
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,340
Rong'er, let's drink the medicine, all right?

222
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,980
Sister, I feel uncomfortable.

223
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,000
I know. Let's drink the medicine.

224
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,120
You will be better after drinking the medicine. Here.

225
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,100
Rong'er, here.

226
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,220
Rong'er.

227
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,480
He was able to swallow yesterday. Why can't he drink the medicine today?

228
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,870
Princess, this cannot continue.

229
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,170
How about we try using the crane-mouthed pot to give him the medicine?

230
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,250
Crane-mouthed pot?

231
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,120
All right.

232
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,020
Rong'er.

233
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,510
Princess, the diagnosis from the Imperial Physician has come.

234
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,960
They said... They said it is scrofula.

235
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,050
Scrofula?

236
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,110
Lord, Miss Jun is here. She said she wants to see you.

237
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,400
You dare to refer a female physician so casually for treating Prince Huai?

238
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,730
Have you gone crazy?

239
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,480
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

240
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,120
The reason why I recommend Physician Jun

241
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,590
is because she is the descendant of a famous Ru'nan physician,

242
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,300
Jun Yingwen. Her medical skills are excellent.

243
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,770
To be honest with Your Majesty, the wife of Marquis Dingyuan whom I could not cure

244
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,260
was cured by her.

245
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,770
Your Majesty, Commander Lu begs to see you.

246
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,200
- Let him in.
- Yes.

247
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,240
Your subject, Lu Yunqi, greets Your Majesty.

248
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,050
You came at just the right time.

249
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,340
Just now, Imperial Physician Jiang

250
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,900
just recommended someone surnamed Jun,

251
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,820
a female physician,

252
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,310
to treat Prince Huai. Go investigate.

253
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,790
See if this person truly possesses great medical skills.

254
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,070
To answer Your Majesty, the reason I came

255
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,930
is also regarding this matter.

256
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,180
This Physician Jun personally requested to treat Prince Huai.

257
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,600
- Personally requested?
- Yes.

258
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,290
This Physician Jun is also the maternal granddaughter of the Fang family that owns De Shengchang.

259
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,550
Fang family?

260
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,850
You may leave.

261
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,360
I take my leave.

262
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,560
This maternal granddaughter of the Fang family,

263
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,610
is she the Jun Zhenchen who helped the Fang family turn over a new leaf?

264
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,130
She actually understands medicine?

266
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,760
This Physician Jun inherited her family's medical hall

267
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,870
and even renamed herself.

268
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,450
She's now named... Jun Jiuling.

269
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,290
- Jun Jiuling?
- Yes.

270
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,980
Jiuling?

271
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
Why would she have this name?

272
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,900
She also opened a Jiuling Hall in the capital.

273
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,920
The medicinal shop is called Jiuling Hall?

274
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,530
She renamed herself Jiuling

275
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,550
to match the medicinal hall.

276
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,050
What is the Fang family doing now?

277
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,910
To answer Your Majesty, the Fang family has been well behaved recently.

278
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,280
De Shengchang is open for business as usual.

279
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,530
Other than having an additional identity as an imperial merchant,

280
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,480
there are no other changes.

281
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,870
If I were to allow this granddaughter of the Fang family,

282
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,730
this Jun Jiuling,

283
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,430
to treat Prince Huai, and the treatment is ineffective,

284
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,870
then what punishment should be given out?

285
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,020
Your Majesty, for such matters,

286
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,920
there was a precedence.

287
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,590
An imperial physician mistreated a noble lady and implicated his entire family.
 (T/N: noble lady is a rank amongst the concubine of the imperial harem)

288
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,240
The result is the death of nine generations of the family.

289
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,350
Scrofula is not an easy illness to treat.

290
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,470
If this Jun Jiuling improperly treats Prince Huai,

291
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,640
the child of the late emperor,

292
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,060
then the people will surely be hysterical.

293
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,310
Eliminating nine generations of the family will most likely satisfy the people.

294
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,330
Then, let this Jun Jiuling

295
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,390
give it a try.

296
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,330
[Jiuling Hall]

298
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,870
Miss, you really don't need me to accompany you?

299
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,700
No need.

300
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,580
This is not a regular illness. It's scrofula.

301
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,760
Are you sure you can do it?

302
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,930
I have to give it a try.

303
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,440
- But if you...
- All right.

304
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
Don't worry. Wait for my return.

305
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,060
I'm leaving.

306
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,220
It's scrofula. It wouldn't be strange if he couldn't be cured.

307
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,260
Isn't this just a gamble? If we win, we will gain fame and fortune.

308
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,720
If we lose, that would be normal as well.

309
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,720
We will gain fame and fortune if we win. However, if we lose, it's not as simple as losing face.

310
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,630
Why don't we make public momentum?

311
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,360
What kind of momentum?

312
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,120
Let everyone know that scrofula

313
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,460
is an incurable disease.

314
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,620
- Zhu Zan, why are you here?
- Come with me.

315
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,060
What is it?

316
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,730
I have a business proposal for you.

317
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,940
If you cure Jiurong, I will protect your life.

318
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,150
If you can't cure Jiurong,

319
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,830
I'll protect the lives of the Fang family.

320
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,330
If you cure him, that person will surely be unhappy and your life will be in danger.

If you can't cure him,

Please do everything you can to save him.

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,280
Yunzhao, since when have you taken such a big interest in the matters of Prince Huai's residence?

340
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,530
I was merely feeling a bit emotional

341
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,520
about Prince Huai's misfortune.

342

"Timing is also fate." One can't say it's ill-fated.

343
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,800
An illness is an illness. It can't be regarded as fate.

Countless children have lost their parents.

How can you be emotional

347
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,230
and sigh in sorrow because he is Prince Huai? There are many ways to better the nation and its people.

Yes, Uncle.

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,460
I heard that His Majesty allowed Physician Jun of Jiuling Hall to treat Prince Huai's illness.

351
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,910
Rest assured. Return to the imperial academy to study.

Yes, Uncle.

353

Physician Jun is known to be skilled. I believe Prince Huai's illness will have taken a turn for the better.

However, everyone outside is saying that scrofula is an incurable illness.

- Go on.

Prince Huai's illness is indeed a bit difficult to treat.

Yes, it is.

Your Highness the Princess, I have some previous experience with scrofula.

I have a way to cure it.

I heard there are many different, effective prescriptions among folk physicians.

404
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,110
Since you have come so confidently, then there must be a way to cure it.

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,180
Let me know of any medicine or help you need.

Yes. Then, I will go and decoct the medicine now.

Now, everyone is saying how serious scrofula is and how difficult it is to treat it.

410
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,850
It must be Jiuling Hall's acting behind the scenes again.

411
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,800
Isn't that so? They just want everyone to know

412
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,960
how serious scrofula is. Then, when they cannot treat it,

413
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,790
they can step away from the situation without any harm.

Physician Jun personally cleaned the herbs and decocted the medicine.

422
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:23,260
She didn't allow the medicine to leave her sight for even a minute. She also didn't allow anyone into the kitchen.

- He drank it!
- He drank it.

depends on whether his fever breaks tonight or not.

You have come to ask for the handwritten imperial order.

469
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,720
That Lord Lu wants to destroy Jiuling's plaque.

470
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,040
Lord Lu has a strange temper. I believe that sending the handwritten imperial order

471
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,130
to Jiuling Hall is the only way to counter him.

472

How did operating a regular medicinal hall

anger the Martial Moral Ministry?

474
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,530

481
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:19,270
Why don't you let someone else do it? Wouldn't that be faster?

482
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:23,260
I am not at ease with someone else doing it. Lord Lu, as you know,

483
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,050
I came on my own accord this time. Many people are waiting to see me fail.

484
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,020
If I lose, wouldn't I look bad?

485
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,650
By the way, no one is allowed to touch the materials I use to decoct the medicine.

486
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,550
Otherwise, if Prince Huai's illness can't be cured,

487
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,810
then it is not my responsibility.

488
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,230
Including you, Lord Lu.

489
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,510

490
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:19,740
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

491
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:25,310
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

492
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:31,470
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for
and indescribable cause and effect ♫

493
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:36,390
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

494
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,300
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

495
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:48,990
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

496
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:55,060
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

497
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,430
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

498
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,840
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

499
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,860
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

500
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:12,120
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in a deadlock with the sky ♫

501
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,590
♫ If memories could speak ♫

502
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,650
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

503
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:25,170
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

504
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:52,230
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

505
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:58,190
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

506
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:03,980
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

507
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,390
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

508
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,880
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

509
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,810
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

510
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:21,220
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in a deadlock with the sky ♫

511
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,520
♫ If memories could speak ♫

512
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,560
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

513
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:33,070
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

514
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,340
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

515
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,520
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

516
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,920
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

517
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,980
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

518
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,240
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

519
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:59,160
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
