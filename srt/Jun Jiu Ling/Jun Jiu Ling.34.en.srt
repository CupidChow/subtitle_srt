00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,900
Chu Rang doesn't know my identity. It's good too.

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,500
However, Duke Cheng has always

21
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,700
been old friends with the previous emperor. I fear he will be implicated.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
So what if he knows?

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,800
He has already given up his military power. What else does he still want?

24
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,530
Sometimes, one fears the hearts of the people more than military power.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,490
Do you have a solution?

26
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,230
There's one for a county princess.

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,900
As for a royal princess, it's still far away.

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,000
It's not that far.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Chengyu is arriving today. I'm receiving him later.

30
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,200
All right. I will go with you.

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
- Jiuling.
- Chengyu,

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,600
it must have been a tiring journey for you.

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
I'm fine.

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Heir Apparent.

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Perhaps, I should call you "Brother-in-law."

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,200
Haven't seen you for a few days

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,400
and you are so sensible. It's so gratifying.

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Well done.

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,800
You should still call him "Heir Apparent."

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
I think so, too. Your letter states that

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,800
this marriage contract is similar to the one in the past.

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,400
It doesn't count either. Hence, I should still call him "Heir Apparent."

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,700
It will reduce gossip later.

44
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,600
Baotang already calls you "Sister-in-law." Why can't he call me "Brother-in-law"?

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,200
I already told my family that our marriage arrangement was just a stop-gap measure.

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,800
It's the same as a form of address.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
We hadn't recognized each other then.

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,200
Wife's younger brother, are you thirsty?

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,700
No. I merely think that,

50
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,700
before we are a family, we don't need to be that close.

51
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,400
Moreover, just like Jiuling, you should call me "Chengyu."

52
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,840
Fine, wife's younger brother.

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,600
You just arrived. Have a nice time catching up with your older sister.

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
As your brother-in-law, I'm leaving.

Take care, Older Brother.

Where's Eldest Sister?

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Jinxiu was busy this morning tidying up your room

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,900
and went to deliver medicines after that.

70
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,000
Young Master, you are not aware.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,800
When she knew you were coming, she prepared four layers of padding for you.

She has always treated me very well. I know.

Not only that. When Jiuling Hall started business,

She usually doesn't touch it and banned us from touching it, too. She even specially prepared...

you keep talking about Miss Jinxiu.

Chengyu,

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
the conditions here are incomparable to home; however,

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,000
Jinxiu has provided you with the best.

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
It's already great.

Chengyu, sit.

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,200
I want to chat with you regarding meeting His Majesty in two days.

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,400
His Majesty summoned you. It seems like a commendation and reward, but, in fact, a dangerous crisis lurks in four corners.

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Since he doesn't want us to take his superior's written instructions,

90
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,100
why don't we use this opportunity to take the initiative and hand them over to him?

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Seems like we both think this is a good idea.

92

Jiuling, if you hadn't brought this up, I would still have done as you said.

Jiuling, we are really soulmates.

94
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,500
I am rather nervous to enter the palace.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,900
Don't worry. I'm here.

96
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,500
Heir Apparent, can you tell me again what else I should take note of when I meet His Majesty?

97
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,000
Didn't the staff from the Ministry of Rites teach you all that?

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm nervous and afraid that I will forget.

99
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,200
In fact, there's no need to be nervous.

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Jiuling's going to the palace with you. She will teach you.

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Jiuling is a woman. She's still different from a man.

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,000
Moreover, you always enter the palace and are familiar with His Majesty.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
I should listen more to you.

104
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
Forget it, Young Master. You must not learn Heir Apparent's methods.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Be careful or you will be taken to prison for interrogation.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You are being more extreme and even dare to make fun of me.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
I was wrong, Heir Apparent.

108
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,500
Chengyu, don't worry. I'm here.

109
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,840
It's almost time. We are setting out.

- Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

113
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
You are indeed young and outstanding.

114
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,200
Courageous and knowledgeable. De Shengchang did such virtuous merits.

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,500
I will reward you generously.

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,600
It's my blessing to share Your Majesty's worries. I dare not take credit.

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,400
De Shengchang is willing to serve Your Majesty.

118
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,200
I know the distinction between rewards and punishments.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Speak. What rewards do you want?

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Since this is the case, I will be bold to request a scroll of your beautiful calligraphy.

121
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,800
Your Majesty's calligraphy is

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,400
powerful and vigorous. Being able to obtain your calligraphy

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,700
is the greatest gift to De Shengchang.

124
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,600
The late emperor placed this under the care of the Fang family.

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,800
When De Shengchang was the Imperial Merchant, this was bestowed by His Majesty.

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,400
As of today, De Shengchang is no longer in-charge of imperial trading.

127
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,900
It's inappropriate to retain this.

128
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,000
Your Majesty, please take this back and gift us with beautiful calligraphy instead.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,500
Since this is the case, fine.

130
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,200
I will take back the written instruction of the late emperor.

131
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,300
Speak. What words do you want?

132
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,800
"A kind and charitable family." Is that good?

133
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,200
I would like to request the "Fu" character from Your Majesty.
(T/N : Fu means good fortune)

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,400
Your Majesty's virtue carries great blessings. People’s fortune and longevity are destined by Heaven.

135
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,200
It's my honor to obtain your blessing.

136
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,200
I will allow this.

137
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000

Jiuling, I thank you on behalf of Grandmother.

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank me for what?

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,500
For handing over the written instruction to me yesterday, in exchange for saving the Fang family again.

142
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,400
Of course, I must thank you on behalf of Grandmother.

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
No need to thank me, because our Chengyu has grown up

144
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,000
and is able to undertake tasks alone for the Fang family.

145
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,780
This written instruction was the royal decree.

146
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,700
His Majesty intended to bestow this. Hence, there's this fate.

147
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,800
If His Majesty is set on recalling this, it will lose its meaning.

148
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,100
It's not a blessing to retain something which is meaningless. It's a calamity instead.

149
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,800
You are right.

150
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,600
Hence, exchanging this written instruction for this scroll of calligraphy is worth it.

151
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,700
Of course, it's worth it.

152
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Is this Huang Cheng?

153
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,900
What does this crazy person want to do?

154
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,000
Jiuling. Younger Brother. Come here.

155
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Xiaozao, what are you looking at?

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,400
This is my wife.

157
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Perhaps soon she will not be.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Even if she's not, you will not get your turn either.

159
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Right, Younger Brother?

160
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
Yes.

161
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,800
Do you still remember what today is?

162
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,660
[Red Phoenix Gate]

163
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Today is the first anniversary of Jiuling Hall's opening.

164
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,600
That's it?

165
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Or the first anniversary of the big marriage between Lord Lu and Princess Jiuli.

166
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
Do you invite us to the celebration?

167
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,400
Today is her birthday,

168
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,600
and also the second anniversary of the day we got married.

169
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,300
Did you forget, Heir Apparent?

170
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,000
How could I forget?

171
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
I thought...

172
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,000
you only remembered the new guy who was smiling and had forgotten the old guy who was crying.

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Let's go, Younger Brother.

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Happy birthday.

175
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,900
Congratulations, Your Majesty, for getting what you wanted.

176
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,300
With this manuscript in my hand, only the dead cannot talk.

177
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,600
I will go and arrange now.

178
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
Go.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes.

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,100
Previously I was wrong; too childish.

181
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,400
Today in the palace, many thanks to Heir Apparent for protecting Jiuling.

182
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,140
No need to thank me.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,300
Why not let me listen to you call me "Brother-in-law"?

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,300
I can call you brother-in-law, but you must promise me some things.

185
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,200
Tell me. I'm listening.

186
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
Our Fang family is grateful for Jiuling.

187
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,700
If you treat her badly, the Fang family will give it all

188
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,100
to go against you, this is the first.

189
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes. What's the second one?

190
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Jiuling has quite a lot of enemies.

191
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,200
You must be in front of everything to protect her fully.

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
- This is the second.
- That comes naturally.

193
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,400
Even though the Fang family is Jiuling's maternal side, Jiuling's family

194
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,100
has no one else. She might feel desolate.

195
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,400
You have to make her happy throughout her life.

196
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,850
I will definitely do it.

197
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,700
Brother-in-law.

198
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,200
Come, come! Drink tea, drink tea.

199
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,400
What are you chatting about?

200
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,500
Oh, nothing much.

201
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,420
So secretive.

202
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,800
Chengyu,

203
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm thinking now that the imperial edict has been returned to His Majesty,

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
shouldn't you go back earlier?

205
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I finally came to the capital, I want to accompany you for a few more days.

206
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
It's still not the time to be lax.

207
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm afraid...

208
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Jiuling, the manuscript was already been returned,

209
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
what are you worried about?

210
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,400
This secret is connected to His Majesty?

211
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes.

212
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,200
All these years, the person who framed our Fang family behind the scenes,

213
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,400
don't tell me it's His Majesty?

214
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
So you are worried that as His Majesty has taken back the manuscript,

215
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,600
and has no leverage and worries, his target will be Grandmother?

216
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Exactly.

217
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,100
So do you have enough manpower in the family?

218
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,000
Manpower in the family...

219
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Before I left, I especially increased people to protect the courtyard, and asked Master Lei to help.

220
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,800
But if His Majesty starts his attack, I'm afraid it'll be hard to defend.

221
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,200
How about this? I'll go back with you.

222
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
No way, you cannot leave the capital.

223
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,600
Not to mention once you leave, it'll cause His Majesty to suspect.

224
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,810
You two don't have to worry.

225
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,400
I will arrange manpower.

226
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,690
One more thing.

227
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,000
I want to discuss this with you two.

228
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What is it?

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,600
My Lord, if I may be so bold, today is the first anniversary of your marriage to Her Highness.

230
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,400
The kitchen has prepared wine and food. Do you want to stay and have a meal together with Madam?

231
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,600
She knows where I'm going.

232
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,100
Almost done.

233
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,600
- Let me try.
- Put it down.

234
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,700
- Put it here.
- Put it down, put it down.

235
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,000
Food is here.

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Come.

237
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
We are back.

238
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,800
- You are back.
- Miss.

239
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
Mei Xin wine?

240
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,300
Yes.

241
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,000
Jiuling said you told her

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
only this wine accompanying your meats will make them delicious,

243
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,100
so she especially pulled me to Three Yuan Building to buy it.

244
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,630
What are you all doing?

245
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,900
Its almost done, wait a while.

246
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,600
- Scalded, right? Let me do it.
- It's okay, let me do it.

247
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
- Let me do it.
- It's okay.

248
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,000
Why are you so careless?

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
It's full.

250
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,000
Sister.

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm leaving tomorrow. Let's chat.

252
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
The kitchen has two more dishes. I'll go and bring them.

253
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,400
Leave it to me, you don't need to take care of it.

254
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Heir Master, your meat is left.

255
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
All right.

256
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
Yes, yes! Let me and Liu handle the things in the kitchen.

257
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,000
You go to the front and take a look if the door is locked. We are closed.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Okay? Go, go.

259
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,000
Miss, I'll go and prepare two more dishes.

260
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,800
I'll go and help too.

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's okay, it's okay.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Can you be more careful?

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Why are you making noise? A toothache?

264
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,100
Painful, sour,

265
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,800
so sour that I have a toothache.

266
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Sweet toothache.

267
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,600
That's good. I don't have anything here, but I have medicine.

268
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,400
When you have a toothache don't eat meat, eat medicine.

269
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,800
Then I will continue to have a toothache.

270
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,200
Is it hot?

271
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
It's okay.

272
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,000
I suddenly feel like I have a stomachache.

273
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm going to the toilet.

274
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,800
What about you?

275
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Eldest Brother, don't you have a stomachache?

276
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,000
Third Brother,

277
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
I cannot control it anymore.

278
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
- I will go first.
- Yes.

279
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
- Yes.
- Everyone is leaving, why?

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Why are you all leaving?

281
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Why did they leave? Really!

282
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,100
Looks like today's scene has some deeper meaning.

283
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,600
Yes, there's a deeper meaning.

284
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
Jiuling.

285
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,210
Happy birthday.

286
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,600
In the past years, your birthday used to have a lot of people.

287
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,800
But this time, the situation doesn't allow it, so we cannot make it big.

288
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,600
I can only take this opportunity to wish you a happy birthday.

289
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,200
I've prepared a present, you take a look.

290
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Must be serious.

291
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,100
Jiuling, I know every year on your birthday,

292
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,400
you would go to the imperial dining room to eat longevity cake.

293
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,280
So I asked someone for the recipe.

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,800
I made it myself. You taste it.

295
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
If it does not taste good, don't dislike it.

296
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,000
Just make do with it and eat.

297
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,030
You can try it.

298
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,150
Previously on my birthday every year,

299
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,400
Imperial Father would ask the imperial kitchen to make this.

300
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,000
Last year, I didn't get to eat it, I thought this year...

301
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,420
Zhu Zan, thank you.

302
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,200
In the past, it was your Imperial Father who protected you.

303
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,700
In the future,

304
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,800
I will protect you.

305
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
You taste it.

306
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,570
What do you think?

307
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,120
Is it delicious?

308
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,070
- Very sweet.
- Very sweet?

309
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,620
I didn't put sugar in it.

310
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,050
I mean, your love is very sweet.

311
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,150
Jiuling,

312
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,730
when did you learn to say things like this?

313
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,100
Sister.

314
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,260
Chengyu.

315
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,640
How is it? Are you used to living here?

316
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,790
Pretty good.

317
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,860
I didn't get to ask you. Is everything okay back home?

318
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,050
Everything's fine. Grandmother is still healthy.

319
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,480
Look at you. You've really grown up.

320
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,370
Yes, I'm different from what I used to be.

321
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,720
Now that I've recovered, I'm no longer the Chengyu who needs to be taken care of at all times.

322
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,640
I can ride a horse, shoot arrows, and even come all the way here to visit you now.

323
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,620
Chengyu,

324
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,830
I'm sorry.

325
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,110
You're saying something silly again.

326
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,520
Didn't we agree on it at home?

327
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,300
We have all gotten over this matter.

328
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,250
You're always free and easy. Can't you get over it?

329
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,560
I... I got over it a long time ago.

330
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,160
Thank you, Chengyu.

331
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,190
I used to not understand why you started your business on June 18th,

332
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,250
but now I do.

333
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,450
I used to not understand

334
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,420
why Lu Yunqi chose June 18th as his wedding day either,

335
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,820
but now I do too.

336
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,490
Did you know his feelings for you?

337
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,000
I agreed to the marriage arranged by the emperor for revenge.

338
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,480
To me, there's no difference between him and others.

339
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,260
I'm very satisfied with this answer.

340
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,850
What am I to you then?

341
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,150
Not as good as others.

342
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,340
That was a punishment for your lie.

343
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,160
Someone's here.

344
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,930
Nobody's here.

345
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,250
Another chance for you. Give me a good answer.

346
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,800
You...

347
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,490
You...

348
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,310
You're so beautiful.

349
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,070
They're kissing.

350
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,830
Young Lady, our dishes...

351
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,960
are ready.

352
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,670
Everyone, come and eat. The food is ready.

353
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,010
Let's eat.

354
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,930
Let's eat.

355
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,200
- All right.
- All right.

356
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,580
- Take a seat.
- Here. Sit down.

357
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,490
Jiuling, why don't you say something?

358
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,040
- Say something.
- Say a little.

359
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,660
Yes, say something.

360
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,020
Today marks the first anniversary of the opening of Jiuling Hall.

361
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,690
Over the past year, everyone has gone through a lot of things.

362
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,840
I'd say Jiuling Hall wouldn't be here without you all.

363
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,550
Here. Let me thank all of you.

364
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,030
- Here.
- Here.

365
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,250
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

366
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,720
Jiuling, happy birthday.
[Wife Princess Jiuling's Memorial Tablet]

367
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,780
I've met another girl.

368
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,170
She... is very much like you.

369
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,190
Every time I see her,

370
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,830
I think of you.

371
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,570
Next time, I'll bring her here to see you. Okay?

372
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,200
Ling Jiu,

373
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,460
I feel really happy now

374
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,520
with you by my side.

375
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,420
Same here.

376
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,770
I never thought

377
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:26,890
I would still be able to see you again, eat, drink wine and stargaze with you.

378
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,160
Why do you look shocked?

379
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,000
When did you start having a crush on me? Why didn't you tell me?

380
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,530
I liked you a little when I was a kid.

381
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,240
Only a little?

382
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,690
It was a little when I was a kid, but I liked you more as I grew up.

383
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,630
I wanted to tell you at the right time,

384
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,320
but I never knew I'd spend eight years in the North.

385
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,000
When I came back, everything had changed.

386
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,520
Can you promise me one thing?

387
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,200
From now on, no matter what happens,

388
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,790
no matter who it is,

389
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,410
don't get separated from me.

390
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,750
♫ The past is like smoke, and youth is like a dream ♫

391
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,420
Let's make a pinky promise that can't change for 100 years.

392
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,570
We've agreed.

393
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,700
We've made a promise. You're not allowed to break it.

394
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,660
♫ Don't forget what I used to look like ♫

395
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm no longer alone.

396
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,680
When you weren't with me,

397
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,830
I had to pretend to be strong in front of everyone,

398
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,930
because I needed to help them,

399
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,910
so that everyone could rely on me.

400
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:25,530
♫ Don't forget what I used to look like ♫

401
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,500
But I actually wanted a shoulder to lean on.

402
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,920
Then there you were.

403
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,220
When I'm with you, I can be what I like to be most,

404
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,230
what I used to be,

405
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,280
and be as relaxed as possible.

406
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,880
You're annoying.

407
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,620
Because even if I have tough armor, you're my weakness.

408
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,390
♫ The past is like smoke, and youth is like a dream ♫

409
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,470
From now on, you won't have any weaknesses anymore

410
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,910
because I'm your toughest armor.

411
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:18,120
♫ Don't forget what I used to look like ♫

412
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,300
How beautiful.

413
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,580
I'll add two more herbs to your prescription.

414
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,960
Stick your tongue out for me.

415
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,920
Take her over there for the medicine.

416
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,200
Sure.

417
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,550
- Come with me.
- Thank you, Physician.

418
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,320
This is your favorite. You eat it first.

419
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,210
You can eat it.

420
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,540
Sister, come here and visit me often.

421
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,470
Is it delicious?

422
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,600
Uncle, please take a look.

423
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,890
Chengyu can finally retreat on this trip.

424
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,550
The imperial decree is gone, but our people are the most important.

425
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,480
Yes, it's good as long as Chengyu is safe.

426
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,080
The imperial decree turned into a blessing,

427
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,890
and it helped the government settle the refugees in the North.

428
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,120
We suffered financial loss but avoided misfortune.

429
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,680
- That's right.
- His Majesty let our Fang family help settle refugees, which is our Fang family's honor.

430
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,030
Don't say things like that outside.

431
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,080
Yes, Mother.

432
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,850
Madam... Madam...

433
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,410
Madam... Young Master...

434
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,100
What's wrong with Young Master? Tell us now.

435
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,190
The inn Young Master stayed at caught fire. He is gone.

436
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,060
Madam.

437
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,800
Madam.

438
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,910
His Majesty summoned me to go to the capital. I'm the only man in the family.

439
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,780
It's a long trip as well.

440
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,080
Grandmother, you're already old. I can't let you risk it again.

441
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,210
Chengyu, this time you're summoned for rewards. We have to be careful.

442
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,190
This is the exact reason why only I can go, not you.

443
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,580
Impossible. Impossible.

444
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,620
Chengyu, Young Master Ning helped Jiuling.

445
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,630
Are you happy?

446
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,990
The fish delivered to the capital tastes even better.

447
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,180
Chengyu.

448
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,250
God is unfair.

449
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,600
God is unfair

450
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,810
to our Fang family!

451
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,960
Chengyu!

452
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,610
The inn Young Master of the Fang family stayed at

453
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,130
had a fire by accident. He died in the fire.

454
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,260
- Any mistakes?
- According to the Fang family,

455
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,210
Young Master Fang brought a jade pendant with him.

456
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,060
It was passed down from his ancestors. He never left it behind.

457
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,920
The Fang family found this jade pendant on the dead body.

458
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,880
Despite being damaged, it was recognizable.

459
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
Send someone there to take another look.

460
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,280
Yes.

461
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,210
When Young Master left,

462
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,790
he was still...

463
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,250
God is so unfair!

464
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,420
I think the family has received the letter now.

465
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,870
I wonder if Old Madam

466
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,080
can deal with this blow.

467
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,860
Since something awful happened, I have to go back and visit my grandmother.

468
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,120
- I'll go back, too.
- I'll go with you both.

469
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,530
When are you leaving? I'll have the carriage ready.

470
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,340
Tomorrow morning.

471
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,610
I'll have the carriage ready.

472
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,430
You're smart and skillful.

473
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,790
You're my very good sister.

474
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,310
You're my sister forever.

475
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,940
Look at you. You've grown up.

476
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,660
Yes, I'm different from what I used to be.

477
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,420
Now that I've recovered, I'm no longer the Chengyu who needed to be taken care of at all times.

478
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,560
Did Chengyu die in an accident...

479
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,130
or in someone's trap?

480
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,030
Are you doubting if someone set it on fire?

481
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,080
Chengyu went to the capital this time, which was dangerous already.

482
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,130
He finally handed over the imperial decree and did all kinds of work.

483
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,120
He sort of prevented His Majesty from fearing De Shengchang.

484
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,310
Look! What a coincidence.

485
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,670
On his way back to Zezhou,

486
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,260
he got into trouble.

487
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:48,850
Chengyu!

488
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,130
Chengyu!

489
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:03,820
[Jiuling Hall]

490
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,630
In this world, no preparation is completely safe, and no promise is always the same.

491
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,970
Are you still deceiving yourself?

492
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,160
You're well aware that His Majesty sent him here

493
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,580
not only to keep an eye on the Fang family, but also to get rid of the Fang family.

494
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,810
Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

495
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:25,940
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

496
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:31,800
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

497
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,850
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

498
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:43,610
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

499
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:49,650
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

500
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:55,380
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

501
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,480
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

502
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,720
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

503
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,240
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

504
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,250
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

505
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,340
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

506
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,940
♫ If memories could speak ♫

507
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,990
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

508
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:31,860
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

509
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:58,620
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

510
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:04,500
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

511
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,440
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

512
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,830
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

513
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,260
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

514
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,100
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

515
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,380
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in
a deadlock with the sky ♫

516
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,940
♫ If memories could speak ♫

517
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,010
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

518
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:39,420
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

519
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,770
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

520
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,820
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

521
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,150
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

522
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,440
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

523
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,610
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

524
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:04,690
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
