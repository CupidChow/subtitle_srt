00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,540
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,520
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,780
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,830
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,960
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,000
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12

♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

[Jiuling Hall]

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,450
- What do you come here for?
- Summon Physician Jun.

21
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,950
Why do you summon Physician Jun?

22
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,050
Prince Huai developed a high fever last night.

23
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,920
It hasn't come down since.

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,540
I'll wait for you outside.

25
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,110
This...

26
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,700
Liu'er, get the medicinal box.

27
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,950
Miss, do you still want to go at a time like this?

28
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,140
This is my patient, so I need to go at any time.

29
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,990
But this is really not a good time.

30
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,950
- Let Physician Feng go.
- That's right.

31
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,670
At this time, Lu Yunqi is surely waiting at the residence for you to walk into the trap yourself. You must not go.

32
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,130
I was conferred as the County Princess of Shanyang by His Majesty.

33
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,740
He cannot do anything to me.

34
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,560
Do you think you can reason with those lunatics?

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,090
Enough. Rest assured and wait for my return.

36
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,950
Chen Qi, prepare the carriage.

37
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,560
All right.

38
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,410
My Lord.

39
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,000
You're here.

40
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,500
Where is Prince Huai?

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,560
Physician Jun is smart.

42
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,090
You must have been able to guess that I tricked you here

43
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,150
with an excuse.

44
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,480
Lord Lu,

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,210
I have come to Prince Huai's residence as a physician's duty.

46
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,100
Is it your duty to humiliate me like this?

47
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,760
Physician's duty? You changed your name,

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,050
made a lot of inquiries about various noble and imperial families,

49
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,170
and even went against the Imperial Physicians Hall.

50
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,900
Isn't it in order to arrive here?

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,690
Lord Lu, you most likely have become too detail-oriented after working at the Martial Moral Ministry for so long.

52
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm quite simple.

53
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,260
Since you want to come, I'll let you.

54
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,740
Moreover, I'll keep you here forever.

55
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,090
What do you mean?

56
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,560
Very soon you'll know what I mean.

57
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,580
Prince Huai is fishing in the back courtyard.

58
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,390
Your Highness, Physician Jun is here.

59
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,970
Greetings, Your Highness Prince Huai.

60
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,050
Your Highness, do you like fishing?

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,990
Let me see how many fish Your Highness has caught.

62
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,570
Go away! You scared my fish away!

63
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,390
You seem to hate me very much.

64
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,770
So what? I do hate you! Go away!

65
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,300
You seduce my brother-in-law and bully my sister. Go away!

66
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,810
Go away! Go away! Go away!

67
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,330
Go away! Get lost!

68
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,870
Go away! Go away! Go away!

72
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,100
Rong'er!

73
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,910
Second Elder Sister!

74
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,980
- I missed you so much.
- I did too.

75
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,470
A few days ago, I dreamed that you bought me a lot of delicious food,

76
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,330
and even told me lots of stories.

77
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,990
- Really?
- Really.

78
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,510
It just so happens that I brought you some tasty food.

79
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,690
- Come.
- Really?

80
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,500
Second Elder Sister treats me the best.

81
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,800
- Have some.
- Thank you, Second Elder Sister.

82
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,280
Second Elder Sister, you have some first.

83
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,130
I especially bought this for you.

84
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,100
Rong'er, you've grown taller.

85
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,530
Let me see if you have done your work correctly.

86
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,040
Show me.

87
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,560
Second Elder Sister.

88
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,850
Written quite well.

89
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,740
Are you my Second Elder Sister?

90
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm not your Second Elder Sister.

91
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,590
However, I'm a very good friend of hers.

92
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,810
Your sister told me to take good care of you.

93
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,570
I don't want it.

94
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,610
My eldest sister has gotten married and my second elder sister is dead.

95
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,600
You bullied my sister.

96
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,540
You all have been bullying my sister this whole time.

97
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,350
Your Highness Prince Huai...

98
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,700
In this lifetime, I would never bully you or your sister.

99
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,510
I would never.

100
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,980
I wonder who spread the rumor

101
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,480
that Miss Jun returned safely from Prince Huai Residence

102
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,900
because Lord Lu didn't make things difficult for her.

103
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,210
They even said that Lord Lu... has genuine and sincere feelings for Miss Jun.

104
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,640
Do we even need to think about who it is?

105
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,420
Besides the people from the Martial Moral Ministry and the Imperial Physicians Hall,

106
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,710
who else could it be?

107
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,600
How disgusting. Those low lives!

108
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,590
They can't win righteously so they play tricks using the affairs between men and women.

109
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,820
If this continues, I'm afraid it won't be good for Miss's reputation.

110
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,200
Who cares? Our Miss doesn't rely on her reputation to cure diseases or save lives.

111
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,420
That's true. When she was first in Zezhou,

112
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,690
her reputation wasn't all that great either.

113

- Lord Lu sent people to deliver betrothal gifts again.

116
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,800
The heir apparent stopped it, so he was dragged back to the Martial Moral Ministry.

Ridiculous! You all are in such close proximity to the imperial city.

Did you think His Majesty wouldn't know about this?

My Young Lord the Heir Apparent,

What's going on today?

133
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,550
Why did you fight in front of the Martial Moral Ministry?

134
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,520
Because he's shameless.

135
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,300
- What did the ministry do that is shameful?
- Whatever he does is shameful.

Fine.

Then, you must clear things up today.

138
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,580
Since you can fight in front of a crowd,

139
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,480
then, naturally, you can speak in front of a crowd.

Hold on. Why?

146

Lu Xiaozao, aren't you aware

149
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,920
of what you've done?

150
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,960
I don't understand why you broke the doors of my Martial Moral Ministry and you even used

151
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,660
my betrothal gifts to do it.

152
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,510
I like Miss Jun and sincerely want to marry her. What does it have to do with you?

153
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,410
Can you marry a woman just because you say you like her?

154
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,490
If you like the princess of Northern Qi and send your betrothal gifts to Northern Qi,

155
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,010
does that mean the princess of Northern Qi should marry you happily?

156
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,300
- That's right.
- Exactly.

You all have wives and daughters at home.

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,750
without asking or seeing how you feel, will you agree to it?

162
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,000
- I won't agree!
- I won't agree!
- I won't agree!

163
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,630
- I won't agree!
- I won't agree!
- I won't agree!

164
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,140
Do you hear that? Miss Jun doesn't agree to it.

165
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,590
That's why I threw the betrothal gifts at your door.

166
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,600
Do you still not know what the meaning of this is?

167
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,460
You keep sending betrothal gifts again and again shamelessly.

168
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,980
What is this considered? Forcing a marriage.

169
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,220
Even if she is unwilling to accept,

170
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,340
this matter is between her and me.

171
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,290
As for you, what right do you have to interfere?

172
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,430
Commander Lu dares to say such words. However, the heir apparent of Duke Cheng dares not.

173
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,110
As heir apparent, he will take over the duke's position.

174
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,940
How could he decide his marriage on his own? If he says such things

175
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,860
and his parents don't agree to it,

176
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,240
then Miss Jun will become a laughingstock.

177
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,220
If he doesn't confess,

178
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,580
how will he explain his actions now?

179
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,070
It's like fighting for a courtesan in a brothel.

180
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,100
- Because I am—
- Because Miss Jun

181
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,620
is my fiancée.

182
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,590
- What?
- Is he crazy?

183
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,640
Miss Jun and I have had a marriage arrangement since childhood.

184
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,220
We decided to discuss it after the imperial court examination.

185
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,460
Unexpectedly, Lord Lu has misunderstood.

186
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,040
The young lord knows of this matter

187
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,750
so he helped me. I hope Lord Lu won't blame him for interfering.

188
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,950
Thank you, Young Lord, for helping me. I really appreciate it.

189
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,860
Everyone,

190
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,810
I swear in front of all of you as the newest first-ranked scholar,

191
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,190
that my marriage arrangement with Miss Jun is still valid

192
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,620
and we'll get married soon.

193
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,450
A marriage arrangement?

194
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,250
What a surprise.

195
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,210
I really did not expect our newest first-ranked scholar to be an affectionate person.

196
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,900
Yes, but this matter is actually beneficial to Your Majesty.

197
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,850
Think about it. Jun Jiuling is a woman after all.

198
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,960
Three men fought on the street over her. Her reputation is considered ruined.

199
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,840
What's the point of her making huge contributions? Civilians are more interested

200
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,160
in those private affairs between men and women.

201
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,430
Such a mess.

202
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,240
The Fang family, the Zhu family, and now the Ning family.

203
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,950
Later on, tell Lu Yunqi

204
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,370
not to do anything that disappoints me again.

205
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,670
Yes.

206
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,540
Do you have something on your mind? You've drunk a lot.

207
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,720
The last time I saw you drink like this, it was because of Princess Jiuling–

208
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,230
I...

209
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,650
It's because of Miss Jun, isn't it?

210
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,990
Of course not.

211
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,370
What does this have to do with her?

212
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,150
He's crying.

213
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,170
Okay. Okay. That's not it, it's not.

214
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,110
Then, why did you throw things at the Martial Moral Ministry's doors today?

215
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,750
I... can't stand Lu Yunqi.

216
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,610
I just happened to help her as well.

217
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,260
I see.

218
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,460
Go ahead and cry. Cry for a bit.

219
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,740
Second Brother,

220
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,760
if it isn't because of Miss Jun,

221
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,640
then there's nothing troubling you.

222
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,240
So then let's not cry like this. Okay, Second Brother?

223
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,110
Frankly,

224
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,330
I want to go back to the North.

225
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,260
I want to ride horses,

226
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,390
practice martial arts,

227
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,620
and go fight men from Northern Qi.

228
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,610
I'm going to be bored to death in the capital.

229
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,000
You should know why that person

230
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,780
is trapping you here in the capital. Try to let it go.

231
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,510
Second Brother has been suffocating for a while now.

232
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,110
Let him vent.

233
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,940
He's obviously troubled by love, Eldest Brother.

234
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,620
Do you think

235
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,910
it's because Young Master Ning claimed to be Miss Jun's fiancé

236
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,220
that he's gotten so depressed?

237
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,200
I want to know

238
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,490
what he would've said

239
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,580
if Young Master Ning hadn't shown up.

240
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,880
I guess...

241
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,800
- Second Brother.
- Forget it. Forget it.

242
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,220
Forget it. Let him drink.

243
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,770
- How about another—
- If you don't let me drink, I'll beat you up.

244
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:03,360
All right. Beat me up. If you're truly upset, why don't you beat me up then?

245
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,930
Here.

246
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,820
I'm afraid what happened today is the talk of the town and everyone knows it. What do you plan to do?

247
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,050
One is the newest first-ranked scholar, one is the Commander of the Martial Moral Ministry,

248
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,000
and one is Duke Cheng's heir apparent.

249
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,810
Three men like that fighting on the street over our miss,

250
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,320
I wonder how many women are jealous.

251
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,000
Are you a fool?

252
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you think this is some kind of blessing?

253
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,570
This proves that our miss is likable.

254
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,520
Isn't being liked a blessing?

255
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,890
Being liked is a blessing indeed, but

256
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,690
one shouldn't "overfill a cup with water."

257
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,440
- What does that mean?
- You won't understand even if I explain it.

258
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,310
Young Master Ning.

259
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,730
Miss Jun.

260
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,020
Are you here because of what happened during the day?

261
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,740
Yes. I would like to discuss it with you.

262
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,600
Thank you for helping me today.

263
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,820
I said such a thing without discussing it with you in advance,

264
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,740
I hope you don't blame me.

265
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Of course not.

266
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,370
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Why?

267
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,250
Young Master Ning, take a seat.

268
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,840
Under those circumstances, I didn't have any choice except to use the previous marriage contract to stop him.

269
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
I have no intention to ask you to fulfill the marriage contract.

270
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,990
Of course, I understand.

271
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,810
After coming to the capital for so long, you haven't returned to Zezhou, have you?

272
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,550
Young Master Ning, do you wish I go to Zezhou to lie low until this blows over?

273
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,590
Miss Jun, you are indeed smart. Those rumors and slander...

274
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:53,210
From Zezhou to the capital, it seems that rumors about me have never stopped.

275
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,050
I'm used to it now.

276
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:00,580
However, I have wronged you. You are now the newly appointed first-rank scholar by His Majesty and in the limelight,

277
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,670
yet I have implicated you.

278
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,760
Fame is just a superficial thing.

279
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,740
Miss Jun, you don't even care, so why should I be afraid?

280
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,350
As for the marriage arrangement, only we know it's fake.

281
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,280
If it's inconvenient for you, I can clarify at any time.

282
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,450
It's not inconvenient for me. I'm concerned that it is inconvenient for you.

283
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,550
How would it be inconvenient for me?

284
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,740
This is what the Ning Family owed you from the beginning.

285
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,580
It should be returned.

286
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,190
You have never owed me anything.

287
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,370
Zhu Zan?

288
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,440
How much did you drink?

289
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,490
Why did you come here so late?

290
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,450
Enough, enough. Sit.

291
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,510
Hurry and sit.

292
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,690
How many... husbands do you actually have?

293
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,200
What?

294
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,600
How many husbands do you have?

295
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,210
Chengyu is the first one. You've met him.

296
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,180
Confess... the second one.

297
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,360
I also know him.

298
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,250
- You've also met the third one.
- Is it me?

299
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,270
That's right.

300
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,830
Don't flatter yourself.

301
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,970
Also, don't make casual jokes. I have someone in my heart already.

302
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,790
I'm not joking.

303
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:50,350
Today, if Young Master Ning hadn't said it, then wouldn't you have?

304
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,740
You're still flattering yourself.

305
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,410
Let me list it out for you. The first one...

306
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,020
is the rich young kid.

307
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,410
Another is the talented first-rank scholar.

308
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,460
How dare you even imagine me,

309
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,480
a young and handsome hero being another?

310
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,100
Hero, quickly drink this tea to clear your drunkenness.

311
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,450
W-What are you looking at?

312
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,700
I'm thinking...

313
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,450
What caused that Lu Yunqi, that lunatic, to be so deranged?

314
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,060
Merely because of a name?

315
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,590
That is not enough to cause that crazy man to be so deranged.

316
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,710
Why is he so stubborn

317
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,040
and insists on marrying you?

318
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,280
H-Have another cup.

319
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,860
Then clear your head and go home. It's very late now.

320
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,390
That's the wrong one. Zhu Zan!

321
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,530
You're not allowed to drink anymore.

322
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,500
It's too late. You better hurry back.

323
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,020
You're not going to tell me, are you?

324
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,680
Don't lie down!

325
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,340
If you don't say, I won't leave.

326
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,320
You can't stay here.

327
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,720
Don't mess around. Don't mess around.

328
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,140
Zhu Zan, hurry put your clothes back on!

329
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,970
Zhu Zan, can you please put your clothes back on?

330
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,110
Zhu Zan?

331
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,070
You even know that Lu Yunqi is the third husband.

332
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,310
Are you awake?

333
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,080
Why are you in my room?

334
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,020
Take another look.

335
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,880
You came here in the middle of the night uninvited,

336
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,580
asking me how many husbands I have.

337
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,900
So... did you answer?

338
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,130
I did, I said I have had two.

339
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,340
Impossible. I was drinking with Zhang Baotang last night.

340
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,690
He must've said it.

341
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,330
You also said that you already have someone in your heart

342
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,650
and told me to not flatter myself by liking you.

343
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,330
Miss Jun, you are too improper.

344
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,290
You were able to say such an answer out loud?

345
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,790
Since you dared to ask, then why should I be ashamed to answer?

346
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,880
This bed is quite large.

347
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,360
There was only one bed last night.

348
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,130
Did you and I... I...

349
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,010
You're not asking me to take responsibility for you, are you?

350
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,010
Yesterday, thank you for helping me out.

351
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,340
No need to thank me.

352
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,970
You should thank your first-ranked scholar husband. He was the one who helped you.

353
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,830
I did thank him.

354
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,170
It happened at 1:00 p.m. yesterday,

355
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,110
yet you already saw him afterward?

356
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,880
Didn't I also see you after?

357
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,000
Second Brother's alcohol tolerance now is quite surprising.

358
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,900
He even slept in someone else's bedroom.

359
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,000
Do you want to drink some more, Second Brother?

360
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,400
Second Brother, don't be angry.

361
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Did you both have nothing better to do than come here to laugh at me in the morning?

362
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,800
Stop messing around. Speak of serious matters.

363
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,400
How's my father? Has he replied to my letter?

364
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,900
Duke Cheng hasn't replied to your letter.

365
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,200
But calculating the time, it should arrive in the next few days.

366
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,400
There's also news about Yunxiao Pavilion. The orphan of the Wan family, Wan Qing,

367
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,200
appeared in Nanyuan Town once but there have been no traces of her after that.

368
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,400
Nanyuan Town is over twenty miles away from the capital.

369
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,600
Two possibilities.

370
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,100
One, she got captured by those from the Martial Moral Ministry.

371
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:07,800
Two, she took a risk and entered the capital to try to avenge the Wan family.

372
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,200
If that's the case, I'll ask around at the imperial prison.

373
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
However, knowing Lu Yunqi's personality,

374
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm afraid even if she was captured, she would be locked up somewhere else,

375
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,200
or... was executed on the spot.

376
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,600
Baotang,

377
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,300
ask around. You must do it secretly.

378
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,600
Have someone from Yunxiao Pavilion make inquiries in the capital. If she truly came to the capital for revenge,

379
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,100
she will definitely make an appearance near Huang Cheng and his son.

380
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,800
You must stop her before she gets there;

381
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,000
otherwise, she'll only sacrifice her life for nothing since she is alone.

382
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
- Baotang, you'll take care of the imperial prison.
- Sure.

383
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,000
Sanbing, you'll be responsible for looking for her in the capital.

384
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,300
Okay.

385
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,800
Young Master, I don't think what you're doing is appropriate.

386
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,100
You don't understand. My way of doing things

387
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,000
can't be determined good or bad by the judgment those standing on the sidelines make.

388
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Then, how do we determine whether it is good or bad?

389
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,600
By whether you follow your heart.

390
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,400
As long as it's what you want to do, you'll do it despite facing tens of thousands of people.

391
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,800
Even if there are many disadvantages,

392
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,400
it's the best, as long as you want to do it.

393
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,370
Young Master, maybe it's good for you,

394
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,900
but it's not good for Miss Jun.

395
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Why not?

396
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,600
Doing this will cause Miss Jun and Madam to not get along.

397
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,400
This future relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will not be harmonious.

398
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,900
Look! Matters between women are very troublesome.

399
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,000
Madam doesn't like Miss Jun. Right?

400
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,200
But you suddenly said your marriage arrangement with Miss Jun is still valid.

401
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,400
If Madam knows about this in Zezhou,

402
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,000
she'll certainly be furious.

403
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,400
Then Mother will be angry at me since it is my doing.

404
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
Why do you still not get it?

405
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,370
Madam won't get angry at you.

406
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,200
She'll surely hate Miss Jun.

407
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,000
Even if Miss Jun does nothing,

408
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
it is not all right either. In Madam's eyes,

409
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,000
everything is her fault and she does everything wrong.

410
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,200
That... That is a bit unreasonable.

411
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,400
Exactly.

412
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,200
Things between a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law are unreasonable just like that.

413
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,100
If you first make Madam happy

414
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,930
and have her approval,

415
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,400
then go to Miss Jun to make the marriage proposal,

416
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,600
I believe it'll be easier to accomplish.

417
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,400
Yunzhao isn't the kind of child who causes trouble for his family. Why did he do that?

418
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,800
That's because he doesn't know he's causing trouble.

419
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,600
If he hadn't said anything back then, would it have been as serious as he says?

420
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
It doesn't matter anymore.

421
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,000
The most important thing now is we cannot deny it

422
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,800
or the consequence will be more serious.

423
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,200
Do we just acknowledge it then?

424
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,800
Acknowledge it. Furthermore, we acknowledge it seriously.

425
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,200
Even within the family, we must keep it a secret.

426
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,600
Sister-in-Law was waiting

427
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,200
to be a matchmaker after Yunzhao passed the imperial court examination.

428
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Maybe we'd have grandchildren next year.

429
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,600
Now, this is great. Can we hide it even though it's fake?

430
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
We can make it come true.

431
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,800
My Lord!

432
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,000
Madam, Miss Jun is not bad.

433
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,400
Back then, you all said she did ridiculous things. Maybe she was young.

434
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,500
What about now?

435
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,800
Even now, she won't do.

436
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,600
Do you men only know to weigh the benefits and drawbacks

437
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,100
without taking relationships into consideration?

438
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,600
Even if Miss Jun is wonderful now, Sister-in-Law won't agree.

439
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,700
First, pass on the news that he's become the first-ranked scholar for now.

440
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,600
We can't put it off.

441
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Do you mean we hide it from Sister-in-Law and the others for now?

442
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,600
How could we hide such an important matter?

443
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,600
We cannot speak of this matter in the letter.

444
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,200
You should know the dirty tricks

445
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,600
the Martial Moral Ministry use. It's better to be careful.

446
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,500
We'll hide it for as long as we can.

447
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,700
Grandmother, Jiuling's problem has finally been resolved.

448
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,200
That is great news.

449
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,800
Now you won't have to go to the capital and play the victim.

450
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,200
What do you mean?

451
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,600
Were you planning on going to the capital if Young Master Ning hadn't helped her?

452
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,400
I was thinking if we were truly left with no choice,

453
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,400
I would go to the capital, share my pitiful story,

454
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,200
and complain that Lord Lu is stealing another man's wife.

455
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,800
You, child, are possessed.

456
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,730
What does the Ning family want to do?

457
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,400
Grandmother, what you said would hurt Young Master Ning.

458
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,900
He had no other intentions, he simply wanted to help Jiuling.

459
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,400
Based on his status and the fact that he and Jiuling are friends, he's the perfect person for it.

460
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,800
Not only does it avoid doubts,

461
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
but it also solves the problem. It makes sense.

462
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,300
I know all that.

463
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,000
I just don't understand why he did that.

464
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,500
Exactly. Why did he do that?

465
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,100
To help Jiuling of course.

466
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,000
Grandmother. Mother.

467
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,500
Since Young Master Ning was willing to help, he's must be sincere.

468
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,400
How could it be sincere?

469
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Breaking off their marriage arrangement made Madam Ning furious.

470
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,820
On the streets, they joke that he's worth 5,000 taels,

471
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,200
the same price as a famous courtesan.

472
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,600
There's also what happened at Jinyun Restaurant.

473
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,200
How could they forget

474
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,500
all those things in the past?

475
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,800
This Young Master Ning has just become a first-ranked scholar.

476
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Frankly, it doesn't make sense.

477
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,000
Grandmother. Mother.

478
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,600
You may not trust Young Master Ning, but do you not trust Jiuling as well?

479
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,600
She said he helped, so surely he must have helped.

480
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,000
Jiuling is so intelligent. How could she let herself be at a disadvantage?

481
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,200
That's why I think

482
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,000
Jiuling and Young Master Ning had discussed it in advance.

483
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,800
Maybe it was Jiuling's idea.

484
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,800
This child. One thing happens after another.

485
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,100
I can't be bothered with them all.

486
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,000
By the way, Grandmother, I need to go to De Shengchang with Second Sister later.

487
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,400
We're leaving now.

488
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,600
All right. Learn more from your second sister.

489
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Yes, Grandmother. Mother.

490
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Ending OST: Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

491
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,200
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

492
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,000
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

493
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

494
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,800
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

495
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,800
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

496
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,600
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

497
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:52,800
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

498
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,000
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

499
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,400
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

500
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

501
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,800
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

502
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,300
♫ If memories could speak ♫

503
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,200
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

504
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,000
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

505
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,800
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

506
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,700
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

507
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:01,600
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

508
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,000
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

509
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,400
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

510
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,400
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

511
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,800
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

512
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,200
♫ If memories could speak ♫

513
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,200
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

514
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,600
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

515
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,000
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

516
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

517
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,400
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

518
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,600
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

519
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,800
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

520
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:57,000
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
