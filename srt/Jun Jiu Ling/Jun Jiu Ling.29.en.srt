♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,550
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,520
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,780
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,870
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

♫ The art of healing become edges used

[Jun Jiu Ling]

00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,730
[Episode 29]

19
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,130
From what I see, Miss Jun has no fear of death and has an extraordinary spirit.

20
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,340
You do not seem like a lady from a normal family.

21
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,750
Madam, my name is Jun Jiuling.

22
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,430
Jun Jiuling?

23
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,940
Are you the Jun Jiuling who came up with a solution to control the smallpox epidemic?

24
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,140
Madam, you are too kind.

25
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,710
If my guess is correct,

26
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,180
you are Madam Yu. Right?

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,850
Madam, don't worry. I'll tell you the truth.

28
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,440
I have come to the North to investigate the smallpox issues

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,480
and to help Duke Cheng resolve any worries.

30
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,390
You and Duke Cheng have done many great deeds. We all naturally know that.

31
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,420
It's just that there is one thing I don't understand.

32
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,170
Right now, Duke Cheng is on the frontlines defending against the enemy.

33
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,400
Why are you here?

34
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,870
I'm going to Daming Prefecture

35
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,680
to seek an audience with Earl of Qinghe.

36
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,250
Seek an audience with Earl of Qinghe?

37
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,560
Duke Cheng and I have been defending the Northern frontier for many years.

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,020
Honestly speaking, no matter how many changes there are in battles, it is easy to control.

39
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,270
The hardest thing to control is a person's heart.

40
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,150
Especially this time,

41
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,690
where there are many changes to the soldiers and generals of the North. There are also restrictions on the troops and provisions.

42
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,820
Duke Cheng can't step away.

43
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,960
If we wait for the court to distribute what we need, we don't know how long we need to wait.

44
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,390
I'm rushing to Daming Prefecture to seek an audience with Earl of Qinghe

45
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,070
because I want to borrow some soldiers and rations from him

46
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,050
to support the battles for now.

47
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,060
Madam, both you and Duke Cheng both put your own safety aside

48
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,910
in order to prioritize the well-being of common people.

49
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,590
It is very admirable.

50
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,690
Don't worry. I will discuss the route with Master Lei

51
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,430
to see if we can take smaller paths that are faster than the official route.

52
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,270
Then, I will impose on Miss Jun.

53
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,420
Second Brother!

54
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,100
Second Brother, you are quite fast.

55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,070
- How are the preparations?
- Our men have already snuck into Kaide Prefecture.

56
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,630
We're just waiting for them to relax their vigilance.

57
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,960
- We will coordinate from inside and outside to wipe out the Northern Qi troop.
- Good.

58
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,690
We will take action tonight.

59
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,880
[Chaohua Hall]

60
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,350
[Honest and Prudent]

61
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,130
Your Majesty, there's a report from Kaide Prefecture.

62
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,580
[Duke Cheng dispatched a soldier to command the defense of Kaide Prefecture from a siege. We hereby report a victory.]

63
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,310
Kaide Prefecture has been protected.

64
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,920
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,710
This shows that Northern Qi is strong in appearance but weak in reality.

66
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm looking forward to the day when our brave soldiers expel the thieves.

67
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,180
Your Majesty, without Duke Cheng, we could still have guarded it.

68
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,290
No.

69
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,130
It's precisely because Duke Cheng sent men to protect the city.

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,750
This war report says that he sent a small messenger

71
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,310
to command the garrison.

72
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,520
That's right.

73
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,490
That is still because Your Majesty is wise, and the people are blessed.

74
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,740
Your Majesty, from what I see,

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,680
we should take the opportunity to negotiate peace with Northern Qi.

76
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,760
Before this, we were at war so the situation was delicate and peace talks would not have benefitted us.

77
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,960
However, now that we have high morale, it is the perfect time to negotiate.

78
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,830
Otherwise, if we prolong the war,

79
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,310
then the people will be the ones to suffer.

80
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,480
If our side first initiates the peace negotiations,

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,430
we will lose face. However, it just so happens that

82
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,800
Northern Qi send an envoy to make a request to the Ministry of Rites

83
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,330
to meet Your Majesty to discuss peace.

84
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,730
They seem very earnest.

85
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,510
Let him in.

86
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,170
Yes.

87
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,610
Master.

88
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,710
Is there any news about Zhu Zan?

89
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,870
Not right now.

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
Zhu Shan's military messenger?

91
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,690
I'm guessing that this military messenger must be Zhu Zan who is playing tricks at Kaide Prefecture.

92
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,910
Relay my order. Even if you have to dig three feet into the ground, you must find him.

93
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,250
- Then, kill him.
- Yes, Master.

94
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,030
Here.

95
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,530
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,710
- Be careful, it's hot.
- Thank you.

97
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,780
Here, this is yours. Hold onto it.

98
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,850
Thank you, thank you.

99
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,900
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

100
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,580
Take it.

101
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,200
Here.

102
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
- It's so tasty!
- Don't burn yourself.

103
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,950
How much longer must we be here?

104
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,400
What's our purpose for going to Daming Prefecture?

105
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,570
It's all for the people in the North.

106
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,740
The refugees are our people.

107
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,350
Since we've crossed paths with them, we naturally cannot ignore them.

108
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,990
Lord Jin, we are already ahead of our schedule by two days.

109
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,420
So, you can be at ease and tend to your matters first. We'll discuss the rest later on.

110
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,380
You spent a lot of money on these rations.

111
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,460
Don't worry, Madam. I can afford it.

112
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,390
You're escorting me to Daming Prefecture without accepting any money.

113
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,030
On the contrary, you're spending a lot. Why are you doing this?

114
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,210
I do it for the same reason as you.

115
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,770
We have seen devastation everywhere along the journey.

116
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,490
For the sake of the people of the North, Duke Cheng

117
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,350
is fighting without retreating.

118
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,860
Even if we make whatever meager efforts we have, it'll help.

119
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,760
Here.

120
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,410
You've been suspended from your post yet you can still read?

121
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,790
If not, then what should I do? Learn to go on a hunger strike like Sister-in-law?

122
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,610
I reminded you before to not anger His Majesty.

123
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,190
You didn't listen. You really...

124
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,630
Fortunately, Yunzhao was smart and didn't state his stance.

125
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,620
Otherwise, he will be like you sooner or later.

126
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,270
Uncle.

127
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,080
- Something bad has happened.
- Did we get defeated?

128
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,760
No. His Majesty met with the Northern Qi envoy. He wants to negotiate peace.

129
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,050
No more war? That is a good thing.

130
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,990
This is state affairs and you are a woman.

131
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,860
Leave. Leave.

132
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,290
Yunzhao, continue speaking.

133
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,780
They say they want to negotiate peace, but the conditions raised by the Northern Qi envoy are too much.

134
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,730
First, they want the two countries to be of equal status and to establish a trade market. Second, they want the boundaries to be redrawn.

135
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,380
They want our Imperial Court to return Baozhou, Xiongzhou, and Bazhou to them.

136
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,240
Absurd!

137
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,340
When we established a trade market in the past,

138
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,210
so many spies came to collect intel on our military situation.

139
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,910
Did we forget about that?

140
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,360
Return the three counties? They have been our lands since ancient times. When did they become theirs?

141
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,710
His Majesty was originally outraged. But in the end, the Northern Qi envoy said one thing.

142
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,980
- What did he say?
- If we don't agree,

143
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,420
Northern Qi will gather another 50,000 men and head towards the south.

144
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,670
They won't stop unless they regain their old land.

145
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,060
From His Majesty's reaction, he'll agree to it

146
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,210
sooner or later.

147
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,750
Does it hurt?

148
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,600
It's all right.

149
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Madam, your ankle has been recovering relatively well these last few days.

150
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,000
But you can't work yourself so hard. You must rest more.

151
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,500
I can't care too much about that.

152
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,100
Here. Be careful.

153
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Speaking of which, recently, the young lord is wanted as a criminal everywhere.

154
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,400
Are you worried?

155
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,400
It would be a lie if I said I wasn't.

156
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,600
What mother wouldn't worry about her son?

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,400
However, he's gotten used to being away from home. He's very clever.

158
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
He won't be caught that easily.

159
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
The young lord is alert and intelligent.

160
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,200
I believe he will return to your side unscathed.

161
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,600
You know him?

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Before, in the capital,

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the young lord helped me.

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,800
I've always said, many people judge him to be

165
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,400
a scoundrel and devil incarnate.

166
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Only those close to him know his true character.

167
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,600
He didn't cause any trouble for you, did he?

168
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
How would he?

169
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
The young lord values camaraderie.

170
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,700
He's also warm-hearted. During the smallpox epidemic, we were fortunate he was there to help test the inoculation.

171
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,900
That's how we now have the inoculation and saved the people.

172
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,400
This is all a part of his duties. I'm sorry he's troubled you.

173
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,100
Madam, it is not that serious.

174
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,800
Miss Jun, an urgent report from the De Shengchang shopkeeper.

175
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
If the late emperor were still here,

176
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,400
he would have immediately beheaded those involved in this,

177
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,800
and thrown their bastard head back to Northern Qi.

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
They really agreed to those conditions?

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,900
This is basically humiliation.

180
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,200
Negotiate peace? Turns out what they're negotiating is

181
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,500
surrending the three counties of Baozhou, Xiongzhou, and Bazhou.

182
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
He killed his older brother to seize the country.

183
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,200
To get this nation, he was malevolent, unjust, disloyal, and unfilial.

184
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,800
He's no better than an animal.

185
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Why is that when someone has come to steal his nation,

186
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
he is unexpectedly negotiating peace?

187
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
It's a shame I didn't kill him back then.

188
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,400
Now the lives of those in the three counties are in the hands of others.

189
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,300
Say, what is wrong with this world?

190
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,400
It's not the world's fault.

191
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,800
This is a man-made disaster. So many of the territories and people of the three counties

192
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,400
were obtained in an exchange using so much blood of so many soldiers.

193
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,200
He abandoned them on a whim.

194
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
Madam, Duke Cheng didn't lose.

195
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,700
Regardless of how many invaders, Duke Cheng doesn't fear them.

196
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,200
Unfortunately, Heaven (emperor) doesn't follow man's wishes. If you fight against it,
(T/N: it's believed that the emperor is someone sent from Heaven)

197
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,000
then you must face it head-on and fight a bloody battle.

198
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The soldiers on the frontline aren't afraid of death,

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,400
so what is it that they in the back are afraid of?

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,900
Madam, are you still going to go to Daming Prefecture?

201
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,000
There's no longer a meaning to that anymore.

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,700
Madam, I have a favor to ask.

203
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,000
Please speak.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,200
There are many people in the three counties. Although the land was given up, the people were not given up.

205
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,800
I would like to ask Madam to make an appearance and lead the people through Hejian.

206
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,400
We can abandon the land, but not the people.

207
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Since they're trapped in the North, we'll take everyone and leave.

208
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,600
Give up the land, but not the people?

209
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,600
Guarding the border is guarding the people.

210
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
I believe all the soldiers will admire your action here.

211
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll go with you.

212
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,000
Thank you, Madam.

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,600
With your and Duke Cheng's reputation, I believe this will certainly succeed.

214
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,200
What's wrong?

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,600
That old wicked Huang actually convinced the emperor to negotiate peace and give up the three counties.

216
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,200
What a blow to my military morale!

217
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,900
That old Huang deserves to die!

218
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,500
What should we do next?

219
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,300
We continue going north.

220
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,400
Madam is still at Daming Prefecture.

221
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,300
Earl of Qinghe and Duke Cheng have never gotten along.

222
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,800
- If he takes this chance to—
- Madam should have already received the news.

223
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,200
She will protect herself.

224
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,710
Second Brother, are we really going to continue north?

225
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,400
Once the defense in the North is withdrawn, the Northern Qi soldier will surely break through and head south.

226
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Then the people will suffer.

227
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,100
It's decided. This matter relates to the lives and safety of thousands of common people.

228
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,900
Flower umbrellas. Beautiful umbrellas.

229
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,800
Spare me some food.

230
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,700
Young Master, please give me some food.

231
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
Listening to your accent, you're not a local.

232
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm from the Liu Family in Bazhou.

233
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
I came out to do business but lost everything.

234
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,000
I want to gather some money to go home.

235
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,000
Xiao Ding.

236
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,400
Thank you, Young Master! Thank you!

237
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,000
Use it to buy some food. Remain in the capital and live well.

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,100
Thank you. Thank you.

239
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,200
- Xiao Ding.
- Please spare some food.

240
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Hello, young master, please spare some food.
- Here.

241
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Hello, young master, please spare some food.
- Here.

242
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,100
Thank you. Thank you.

243
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
Hello, Young Master.

244
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,200
Hello, young master, please spare some food.

245
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,600
What's wrong, Mother? Is something not right?

246
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,800
What is Jiuling doing in southwestern Hebei?

247
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Her expense is so great. She could buy a whole city.

248
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,500
The last time she sent a letter, I think she said she was escorting a madam to Daming Prefecture.

249
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,600
Could escorting a madam require this much money?

250
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Recently, the Northern Lands aren't stable. Hopefully, she isn't being scammed.

251
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,300
She won't be, Grandmother.

252
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Grandmother, Jiuling sent a letter.

253
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Hurry and give it to me.

254
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
What does the letter say?

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,600
Grandmother, Jiuling spent all that money

256
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,200
to help escort the people of the three counties back.

257
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Escort the people of the three counties back?

258
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,700
Take a look.

259
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
Wonderful.

260
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,500
Indeed, she's my granddaughter.

261
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,800
I thought you would get mad.

262
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
In your heart,

263
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
am I someone without discernment?

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
No, Grandmother. You told us before that

265
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,000
our Fang Family's assets were earned by our ancestors.

266
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So we can't let anyone shake our roots.

267
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Plus,

268
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,600
business is business. You've been in charge of De Shengchang for so many years.

269
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,800
You've never done business that doesn't profit, right?

270
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,600
As business people,

271
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,300
we should indeed do good business.

272
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,000
Business is not only about profits.

273
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Some things can't be done even if you have money.

274
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,200
Relay my order.

275
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Aside from normal expenses, De Shengchang's profit

276
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,400
will all be directed to southwestern Hebei for Jiuling to use.

277
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,410
Yes, Grandmother.

278
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
[Baimang City Local Government]

279
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,300
We need to remain cautious these days.

280
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,700
Lord Tian, Madam Yu has arrived.

281
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,800
Greetings, Madam.

282
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't know you would come so I wasn't able to receive you at the gate.

283
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,300
Lord Tian, no need to be so courteous.

284
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
This is?

285
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,000
- I am—
- She's Jun Jiuling, my soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So this is Miss Jun.

287
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,400
I didn't know you would also be the Heir Apparent's madam.

288
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,000
You're the perfect match for the young lord.

289
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,200
- That's right.
- That's right.

290
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,100
Lord Tian, I came with her to discuss something with you.

291
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Please speak.

292
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,800
Lord Tian, we would like to ask you to send the Hejian Garrison

293
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,200
to escort the people of the three counties south to the capital.

294
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
This...

295
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
Young Madam, it's not that we're afraid to go into battle.

296
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
It's because the imperial court—

297
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,800
The imperial gave up the lands of the three counties, not the people.

298
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,200
You escorting them south should be a given.

299
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,600
You wouldn't be going against imperial edicts, but respecting His Majesty's order.

300
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,800
This is an urgent matter.

301
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,600
Lords, this isn't going against imperial orders but doing merit.

302
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Escorting the people of the three counties is showing His Majesty's kindness.

303
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
"My people, my nation." You can only have a nation when you have the people.

304
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,400
We can give up land, but people cannot be abandoned.

305
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,600
Lord, why can't we welcome back our own people?

306
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,800
What are you afraid of?

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's true.

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
You two have a point.

309
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,100
I never expected Young Madam to be so heroic.

310
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,800
Just as Madam Yu said,

311
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
we have stopped fighting with Northern Qi to negotiate peace.

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
What was given up was the lands of the three counties.

313
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,000
The people of the three counties are our people with whom we share flesh and blood with.

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
When our people are suffering,

315
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,200
how could we turn a blind eye to them?

316
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
Lords, you're all wise.

317
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,600
It is imperative to welcome back the people of the three counties.

318
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,270
Madam.

319
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,800
Sit.

320
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,000
Madam, is something bothering you?

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
The Northern Qi soldiers have now reached Bazhou.

322
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
They can come to Hejian at any time.

323
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,300
So Baimang City has become the last barrier before Hejian.

324
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,400
Once they break through, then Hejian is done for.

325
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,000
As of now, Lord Tian can still take in refugees.

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,800
It's truly not an easy task.

327
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,430
So I was thinking,

328
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,390
the defense in Baimang City must not be relaxed.

329
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,410
I'm only worried that among the refugees,

330
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,520
there will be Northern Qi spies. Then that'll be our mistake.

331
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,550
I understand. Your worries are valid.

332
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,960
Madam, I have an idea.

333
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,720
We can have Lord Tian set up another checkpoint in the city.

334
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,890
We'll first settle the refugees within the checkpoint area.

335
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,030
After verifying each one of their identities, we can then release them.

336
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:23,380
During this time, we can use porridge and free examinations to appease everyone.

337
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,060
All right. We'll do that.

338
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,140
Miss Jun, I apologize for earlier.

339
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,070
Those people have been officials for too long and care too much about your identity and background.

340
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,940
I did that because I didn't know what else to do.

341
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,690
But in the Northern Lands, with the identity of being the Heir Apparent's wife,

342
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,040
it'll be easier for you to do things and you'll be more respected.

343
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,110
Madam, no need to say too much. I understand.

344
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,020
If you can really become my daughter-in-law one day,

345
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,620
it will be my blessing.

346
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,050
Madam, you're too kind.

347
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,870
Please enjoy.

348
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,620
Come on in.

349
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,760
Please.

350
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,670
I never imagined the Heir Apparent's wife to be so brave and wise at such a young age.

351
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,140
Together with the Heir Apparent of Duke Cheng,

352
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,250
- they are really a match made in heaven.
- That's right.

353
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,430
Fellow brother,

354
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,890
did you say the Heir Apparent's wife?

355
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,710
Yes. The Heir Apparent's wife.

356
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,780
- What?
- The Heir Apparent's wife not only rescued the Northern refugees,

357
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,120
she also said she wants to bring back all the people of the North.

358
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,810
She's a woman,

359
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,650
but isn't afraid of putting herself in danger. Very admirable.

360
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,610
I heard she also went to Bazhou and rescued tens of thousands of people.

361
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,620
Didn't the Northern Qi thieves reach Bazhou?

362
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,920
Yes. The Heir Apparent's wife isn't afraid.

363
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,190
She's young

364
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,170
yet has astounding talents.

365
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,890
She's wise and knows military strategies.

366
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,430
Which shameless imposter is pretending to be my wife?

367
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,120
The news is spreading so quickly.

368
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,770
Miss Jun probably heard about it, too.

369
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,880
She better not misunderstand me, an innocent boy.

370
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,630
All right. Thank you, brother.

371
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,740
Second Brother, what's going on?

372
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,620
How would I know?

373
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,880
Let's go and get moving.

374
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,970
- We're not eating anymore?
- No.

375
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,880
Hey, Eldest Brother. Eldest Brother!

376
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,690
How did an Heir Apparent's wife suddenly appear?

377
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,980
You're too young, so you don't understand.

378
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,560
Do you understand?

379
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,660
Still no news about her?

380
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,580
Yes, My Lord.

381
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,700
My Lord, the Northern Lands are currently unstable.

382
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,850
Could it be that Jin Shiba is in some kind of danger?

383
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,320
Her subordinates are no match for Jin Shiba.

384
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,450
Unless... she has people helping her.

385
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,220
Could it be that Zhu Zan and Miss Jun have met up with each other?

386
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,840
It's probably not Zhu Zan. The great victory at Kaide Prefecture

387
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,900
Is most likely related to him.

388
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,450
In just a few days,

389
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,030
there's no way he could have gone from Kaide Prefecture to Anding, even if he flew.

390
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,380
Send more people there and figure out what the situation is.

391
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,150
If there are changes to the situation, even if you need to tie her up, bring her back.

392
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,540
Yes.

393
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,380
Princess.

394
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,370
You just recovered. Why aren't you resting?

395
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,370
I am fine.

396
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,310
Is she well in the Northern Lands?

397
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,580
Yes.

398
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,280
Second Brother, there's news from the Yunxiao Pavillion.

399
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,910
My mother went to Hejian?

400
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:15,060
Upon hearing about the peace negotiation, Madam no longer went to Daming Residence and went to Hejian?

401
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,980
She's also with the so-called Heir Apparent's wife.

402
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,880
Then has Madam acknowledged the person as the Heir Apparent's wife?

403
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,740
Hejian is relatively dangerous.

404
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,460
Could Mother have been tricked?

405
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,350
- Let's get going.
- All right.

406
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,810
You two want to separately lead troops out of the city?

407
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,890
Yes. The situation is urgent. The sooner we leave, the more people we bring back.

408
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,940
That's right. I'll depart from the west. Madam will depart from the southeast side.

409
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,180
The people will be escorted back. You should prepare to receive them.

410
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,700
Also, the people who are rescued should continue going south. You must not retain them.

411
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
This will also reduce the pressure on you.

412
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,860
Yes, Madam.

413
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,090
I'll entrust my son's wife to you two.

414
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,850
Please rest assured, Madam. I, Li Guorui,

415
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,920
will ensure her safety at all times.

416
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,420
Rest assured. I will protect you.

417
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,540
Jiuling, the trip will be dangerous. Be careful.

418
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,260
- You too.
- I'll wait for you to meet up with me.

419
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,820
All right.

420
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,790
Let's go! Hurry and walk!

421
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,150
Hurry!

422
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,820
Keep up! What are you dilly-dallying for? Hurry!

423
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,980
- Hurry!
- Do you hear me?

424
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,090
- Walk!
- Walk!

425
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,660
Hurry!

426
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,350
Walk! Don't stop! Keep walking! Get up!

427
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,360
Stand up!

428
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,300
Hurry!

429
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,430
Behave.

430
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,010
- Don't move.
- Did you all see?

431
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,850
Whoever is slow and delays the trip

432
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,880
will end up like this. If you don't want to die, then hurry and get going.

433
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,020
- Go!
- Hurry!

434
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,150
Hurry! Quickly!

435
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,900
Stop dilly-dallying! Hurry and walk! Get going!

436
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,100
Hurry up! Walk!

437
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,880
Keep up! Quickly!

438
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,380
Let's go!

439
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,890
Walk!

440
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,840
I'm from Tianyou Army and under Duke Cheng's order, I'm here to defend the nation and protect its people.

441
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,530
I order you to surrender these people; otherwise, you will be severely punished.

442
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,160
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

443
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,920
Stop talking!

444
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,220
This is already Northern Qi's territory.

445
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,440
These people are our slaves.

446
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,880
You want to take them away? Keep dreaming!

447
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,370
As long as the peace treaty is not signed,

448
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,540
Bazhou is still Tianyou's land.

449
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,710
These people are also still Tianyou's citizens.

450
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,130
Today, I must take them with me.

451
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,590
What? Are there no men

452
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,070
in your dignified Tianyou?

453
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,580
They actually let a woman come fight?

454
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,930
A cowardly Tianyou

455
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,920
has raised cowardly soldiers?

456
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,340
And cowardly—

457
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,680
Charge!

458
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,800
Charge!

459
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,520
Charge!

460
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,470
Save the people.

461
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,140
Old Lei, be careful!

462
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,670
Everyone, help untie them!

463
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,250
Everyone, help. Don't panic!

464
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,220
Don't panic! Come with me!
- Follow along!

465
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,160
Come on! Come with me!
- Keep up!

466
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,980
- Let's go!
- Hurry and follow along!

467
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,880
Hurry! Keep up!

468
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,620
They're escaping! Hurry and chase them!

469
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,730
Everyone, follow tightly!

470
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,510
Be careful!

471
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,200
Let's go!

472
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,060
- Charge!
- Watch your step. Those behind, keep up!

473
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,050
Come, this way.

474
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,660
Be careful.

475
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,390
Here, be careful.

476
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,080
Be careful.

477
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,310
Here. Be careful.

478
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,520
Come.

479
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,310
- Be careful.
- Hurry!

480
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,950
Hurry!

481
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,330
Be careful.

482
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,940
This place is safe for the time being. Everyone can take a break.

483
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,360
Savior, who are you?

484
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,020
When I get back, I will set up a longevity tablet for you.

485
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,110
I'm here under the orders of Duke Cheng.

486
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,930
Who exactly are you?

487
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,370
She's the wife of the Heir Apparent of Duke Cheng.

488
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,430
Thank you, Young Madam!

489
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,580
Everyone, please get up. Please hurry and get up.

490
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,410
Don't thank me. If you want to, thank Duke Cheng.

491
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,280
Please hurry and get up.

492
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,190
Second Brother, there's news from Yunxiao Pavilion.

493
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,750
They said the soldiers led by the Heir Apparent's wife were invincible, and she's regarded as a goddess by the people now.

494
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,900
Countless people have already returned safely to Hejian Prefecture now.

495
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,320
She sounds very impressive.

496
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,640
That's right. They also said that this young madam

497
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,400
even dared to snatch the people from Northern Qi soldiers. She brought back all those who were abducted.

498
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,790
I really want to see what kind of mysterious goddess this young madam is.

499
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,460
Looking at it now, she's definitely an impressive person.

500
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,350
There's still no news about Miss Jun.

501
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,360
Miss Jun, are you still safe? Could it be that she was captured by Xiao Zao Lu's people on the road?

502
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,530
Second Brother, where should we go now?

503
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:55,110
Up ahead is Jiang Cheng, a disciple of my father who is stationed at Baozhou. We need men.

504
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,540
Let's quickly set out and aim to meet up with my father as soon as possible.

505
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,770
This peace treaty has already been agreed upon. Why is Northern Qi causing trouble again?

506
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,260
Huang Cheng, where is he? What is he doing?

507
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Your Majesty, Lord Huang has always been negotiating with the Northern Qi's envoy.

508
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,230
As for why Northern Qi is causing trouble again...

509
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,690
that's because Duke Cheng refused to withdraw his soldiers.

510
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,960
He even sent his wife and the Heir Apparent's wife to Bazhou

511
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,240
to escort the people back here.

512
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,020
What is he trying to do?

513
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,350
Does he want the entire Tianyou to be ruined before he's satisfied?

514
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,870
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

515
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,440
I think everything is still under your control.

516
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,680
If escorting the people is successful,

517
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,350
the people of the nation will praise you for your benevolence,

518
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,280
treating his people kindly. If it fails,

519
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,220
then that means Duke Cheng disobeyed your decree and harmed the nation and its people.

520
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,130
He truly knows how to win over people's hearts.

521
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,070
My Lord, there's news from the Northern Lands.

522
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,060
Where is she?

523
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,190
She went to Baozhou.

524
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,960
Baozhou?

525
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,880
From Qingyuan Prefecture to Baozhou, why didn't Jin Shiba send any news back?

526
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,850
My Lord, it's the Heir Apparent who went to Baozhou.

527
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,720
Zhu Zan?

528
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,250
Madam Yu and the wife of the Heir Apparent went to Bazhou.

529
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,660
As a man, he's actually hiding behind a woman.

530
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,990
This is the so-called loyal soldier.

531
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,530
He's really admirable.

532
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,080
My Lord, are we still capturing him?

533
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,720
No need.

534
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,210
Kill him.

535
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,720
Yes.

536
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,320
I, Guard Jiang Cheng of Baozhou, have been waiting for you for a long time, Young Lord.

537
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:24,560
Young Lord, rest assured. The soldiers of Tianyou have withdrawn from the North. Many people are homeless.

538
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,880
As soldiers of Tianyou , we await your commands to head to the North together

539
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,000
to receive the people of Tianyou.

540
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,480
I'm now a wanted criminal. Aren't you afraid?

541
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,560
Frankly speaking, I wanted to report to the Imperial Court.

542
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,060
However, it's an unusual period now.

543
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,430
Taking a longer time to make the report is excusable.

544
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,970
If there's an accident along the way and the report was never submitted to the capital,

545
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,340
they can't punish me.

546
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,370
Heading there, life and death are uncertain.

547
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,820
Everyone, is there anyone who's not willing to go?

548
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:32,740
Excellent! You are indeed men of the Tianyou imperial court.

549
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,270
Everyone, you are all elite soldiers of Tianyou.

550
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,440
We will rely on you to protect Tianyou.

551
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,540
On behalf of Duke Cheng, I thank everyone.

552
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,010
We are willing to follow the young lord.

553
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,970
We are willing to follow the young lord!

554
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,610
We are willing to follow the young lord!

555
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,190
Zhu Zan, are you doing well?

556
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,060
I wonder where you are now and if you are in danger.

557
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:21,710
Do you know? I'm very worried about you.

558
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:33,520
By the way, there's something I want to tell you.

559
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,230
I'm now the wife of Duke Cheng's heir apparent.

560
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,390
Do you think this is fate playing tricks on people?

561
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:49,140
How I wish you could appear in front of me immediately.

562
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,380
I really miss you.

563
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,660
You must come back alive.

564
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,080
I will wait for you.

565
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,110
The Northern Qi's army at the border has withdrawn and returned to Northern Qi.

566
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,920
- Withdrawn?
- Yes. The war report stated that Duke Cheng pretended to retreat.

567
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,700
In fact, they raided the left-wing of their army.

568
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,660
This left-wing army is led by their crown prince.

569
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,930
Hence, the Northern Qi's army had no choice but to return to defend them.

570
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,880
Duke Cheng is helping us resolve our troubles. Now that the army has withdrawn,

571
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,880
it looks like there is currently only a small group of soldiers here that can be easily dealt with.

572
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,820
Doesn't Duke Cheng have only 10,000 soldiers? Then isn't he trapped in the North with them?

573
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,680
If the reinforcements don't rush there in time, wouldn't...

574
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,520
- Miss, there's a letter from the young lord.
- Where is he?

575
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,390
He's heading north. Looking at the situation, he's moving towards Duke Cheng.

576
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:59,280
Also, there's news from Hejian Prefecture. The peace treaty has been signed.

577
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,210
The troops of Northern Qi will enter the three counties very soon. All garrisons in the North will withdraw immediately.

578
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,630
Any violations of the decree are punishable as treason.

579
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,400
Treason?

580
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,430
