19
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,100
Young Miss, you are back.

20
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,770
Sorry to have woken you.

21
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,580
Where did you go all night? I've been so worried about you.

22
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,420
I told you that I was meeting up with an old acquaintance.

23
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,260
I forgot about it. I'm glad that you are back.

24
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,970
Are you hungry? I can prepare some food for you.

25
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,960
- Let's eat out.
- Sounds good.

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,780
There is a restaurant which is known for Ru'nan cuisines. Shall we try it out?

27
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,460
Can I order dried tofu in chicken broth?

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,640
Whatever you want.

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,310
After the meal, I want to check out some locations for the shop.

30
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,640
Sounds good. I'll help you clean up first.

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,680
Why did you defy my orders?

32
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,710
You were at the gate of the capital.

33
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,580
Why did you turn around and leave?

34
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,120
Your Majesty, I heard that there was a group of wandering bandits from the north.

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,240
They were robbing common people.

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,910
I overheard a traveler

37
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,530
talking about it. They said that the bandits showed up in the rural areas around the capital.

38
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,090
I thought that I shouldn't let this good opportunity go.

39
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,520
In order to find out more, I left behind those who were escorting me and followed the bandits.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,800
I have wiped out all of the bandits.

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,670
You were in the north.

42
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,710
Yet you are very well informed on the happenings around the capital.

43
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,330
You and your father are very well informed.

44
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,780
Although you are in the north physically,

45
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,640
your heart is connected to the capital.

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,900
Big Brother, what should we do now?

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,340
No wonder Second Brother wrote to me and asked me to take care of the bandits.

48
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,050
He must have foreseen that he would be questioned.

49
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,330
This is a good strategy, killing two birds with one stone.

50
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,510
It created an excuse for him, and also took care of the bandits.

51
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,390
No matter what good strategies that we come up with, we cannot rid His Majesty of his paranoia.

52
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,070
It's too early to celebrate.

53
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,810
We should wait until we can confirm that Second Brother has survived this incident.

54
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,290
I think it worked.

55
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,500
Your Majesty, my father is unaware of this.

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,850
I planned to capture the bandit chief in secret.

57
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,420
That's when I heard that they were near the capital.

58
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,060
However, I didn't want to disturb Your Majesty.

59
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,310
So I made the decision myself to face the bandits alone.

60
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,770
Why didn't you bring men from the Martial Moral Ministry to support you?

61
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,210
That way, you could have captured the bandits.

62
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,610
Your Majesty, please hear me out. If I had brought men from the Martial Moral Ministry,

63
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,330
the bandits would have scattered as soon as they saw the uniforms.

64
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,690
Fine.

65
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,890

71

Young Miss, the shop looks a bit shabby.

72

It is indeed a bit shabby. But this is a good location.

73
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,940
This is very close to the palace.

74
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,040
People living in the area are dignitaries.

75

If I were you, I'd do what we did in Ru'nan.

78
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,810
We should pick a place in the market, where there is a lot of traffic.

79

The capital is a big city and it's hard to make a living here.

If we want to establish ourselves here,

159
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,860
If Official Lu doesn't believe it, you can go check the account books.

160
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,590
Is it even meaningful, since the books from the Ministry of War can be either real or fake?

161
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,910
What is the meaning for Official Lu to speak thus?

162
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,300
Are you saying our Ministry of War faked accounts?

163
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,530
Isn't today a trial for me?

164
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,140
Official Tan, you should step in.

165
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,820
Officials, we all work for the same court, peace is of absolute priority.

166
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,930
Peace is of absolute priority.

167
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,950
Continue.

168
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,400
Having the capital's travel maps for sale

169
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,540
and even being circulated in Northern Qi areas,

170
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,120
is indeed dangerous.

171
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,500
Young Lord, as a member of the military who is supposed to protect the kingdom,

172
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,750
do you not understand what that means?

173
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,560
Official, it is because I am an officer,

174
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,950
that I know what I can do and what I shouldn't do.

175
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,570
There are only entertainment places displayed on the map.

176
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,140
Nothing at all is revealed about the locations of security posts, government offices, or royal palaces.

177
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,930
It is of no use even if the Northern Qi people hold it in their hands.

178
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,960
But it still is a map of the capital. To have it in enemy...

179
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,150
All it displays is our capital's prosperity and riches.

180
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,960
A Northern Qi person must be salivating and endlessly wanting,

181
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,130
to the point of insanity.

182
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:11,410
Therefore, you presented a fat piece of meat to a hunting dog to invite it over?

183
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,510
Look at that, you think alike for sure.

184
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,930
Once you encounter something good, you immediately think of eating it and looting it.

185
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,900
Young Lord, since you know it

186
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,490
is such a temptation to Northern Qi,

187
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,680
- then why do you...
- So what if it's a temptation!

188
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,890
Our Tianyou Kingdom is of such prosperity and riches,

189
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,740
I want Northern Qi to know. I want everyone under the heavens to know.

190
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,490
In the Northern region,

191
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,620
many people will never have a chance to come to the capital.

192
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,660
Also, unable to come.

193
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,890
Only through this map, can they

194
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:01,380
see that the Tianyou capital they are protecting is of such prosperity.

195
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,250
This prosperity is for all of us to enjoy.

196
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,080
This is the reason they are washed in blood and kill the enemy on the frontlines.

197
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,530
How could we bear to let it be invaded? We surely will not let them suffer even a small invasion!

198
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,860
Officials, if you think this will tempt Northern Qi to invade,

199
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,280
then what do you take the soldiers at the frontlines for?

200
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,430
What do you take the Tianyou military for?

201
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,330
What do you take the might of Tianyou for?

202
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,320
If they want to come,

203
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,890
then let them come.

204
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,030
If they really dare to come, let's make sure they can't return back.

205
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,640
A trip of no return!

206
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:14,930
Later, Official Tan said that it is up to Your Majesty to decide on this case.

207
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,110
Official Lu and Official Han both agreed as well.

208
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,410
Then, was the capital map investigated?

209
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,240
Indeed Young Lord Zhu was quite absurd in this capital map fiasco.

210
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,840
The Ministry of Municipality Defense also went to check.

211
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,460
But... this matter...

212
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,510
could be large or small.

213
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,520
Your Majesty, even if you don't punish him, you shouldn't let him go.

214
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,840
Duke Cheng's power is rising.

215
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,470
Having his son kept in the capital

216
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,640
will be a restraint on him.

217
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,720
Quite unexpectedly...

218
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,400
that this Three Ministries trial ended in such a manner.

219

[Ning Residence]

220
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,330
That is the end of this matter?

221
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,650
It's not the final result.

222
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,130
It is just as well. One is heartless, the other is preposterous.

223
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,500
Let them balance one another out.

224
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,530
If this heir apparent remains in the capital, the capital will be quite convivial.

225
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,420
Yunzhao, you are not to get involved in the capital's festivities.

Uncle. Aunt. I will return to my room.

235

This child, he has seemed strange lately.

236
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,600
He is probably tired from his studies. It's all right.

237
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,820
Let's reduce some of the list, we are not that close with Commander Lu.

00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,420
All right.

239
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,850
Miss Jun, there's a guest looking for you.

240
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,330
Miss Jun, are you there?

241
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,610
Coming.

242
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,130
- Young Master Ning!
- Miss Jun.

243
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,730
How did you find me here?

244
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,440
Earlier today you said the place you're staying isn't far from the city gate,

245
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,040
so I went house by house until I got here.

246
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,140
You are here so late, is there an emergency?

247
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,590
Yes.

248
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,440
Then please come in, Young Master Ning.

249
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,270
Sorry to bother you.

250
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,630
Sit.

251
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,950
Oh, okay.

252
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,600
Miss Jun, I heard your medicinal shop in Ru'nan was called Jiuling Hall?

253
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,210
Are you going to give the same name to your new medicinal shop in the capital?

254
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,390
You already know, Young Master Ning?

255
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,800
Yes.

256
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,670
Miss Jun, this is not a good name.

257
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,700
It's the same name as the late Princess Jiuling.

258
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,650
The name of Jiuling Hall came from my father, not from the princess.

259
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,590
So I don't think officials would blame me for it.

260
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,580
But Miss Jun, this Princess Jiuling is the deceased wife of Commander Lu of the Martial Moral Ministry.

261
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,390
Commander Lu is very unpredictable.

262
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,680
Jiuling Hall was fine for Ru'nan, but this is the capital.

263
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,990
Besides, your opening day happens to be the same day as Commander Lu's wedding day.

264
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,260
It might be conflicting.

265
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,550
Miss Jun, you should change to a different name.

266
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,540
Young Master is afraid that Commander Lu will come after me?

267
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,340
Yes.

268
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,900
If that happens, Jiuling Hall will be famous.

269
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,120
Miss Jun, but...

270
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,140
Young Master, I know you mean well,

271
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,330
but I have already made up my mind.

272
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,520
Since you insist, I won't say anymore.

273
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,880
Perhaps I am overthinking, and thought the capital would be vast and hard to make a living in.

274
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,940
It's better to play it safe.

277
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,170
Maybe at the beginning, but you will find a way.

Jiuling Hall. Jiuling, the miraculous physician.

476
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,290
Cure all diseases.

[Lu Residence]

478
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,720
Jiuling.

479
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,060
Official Lu, I'm Jiuli.

480
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,820
Your Highness.

481
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,800
She never drank alcohol.

482
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,530
Young Miss, looks like your alcohol tolerance is pretty good.

483
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,300
You might not even believe it,

484
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,420
but this is actually my

485
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,940
first time drinking.

486
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,430
Then, why are you drinking so fast? Be careful of passing out.

487
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,670
Here,

488
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,830
cheers.

489
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,550
Y-You drinking like this,

490
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,310
is there something you're unhappy about?

491
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,390
I am unhappy.

492
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,490
What is it?

493
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,420
There's no way to protect

494
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,470
the one most important to me.

495
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,830
- I'm so useless.
- Young Miss.

496
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,710
Young Lady, what are you saying?

497
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,040
I didn't hear you.

498
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,800
It's nothing.

499
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,430
It ran out so fast.

500
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,690
Liu'er, go buy me some more alcohol.

501
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,880
Will you be all right by yourself?

502
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,470
- Young man, get a pot of wine.
- Coming.

503
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,160
Relax,

504
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,330
I will help you

505
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,140
grill all this meat. You can eat it

506
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,260
- when you come back.
- Be careful, you'll burn yourself.

507
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,890
I promise. Before you get back,

508
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,300
I'll finish grilling all of it.

509
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,660
The meat's not important. Don't burn yourself. Then—

510
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,610
- Enough, enough. Relax.
- I'll hurry and get back. Wait for me.

511
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,340
All right.

512
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,440
Hurry.

513
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,720
Be good and wait for me.

514
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,700
Goodbye.

515
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,380
Your Highness, rest early.

♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

518
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:03,030
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

519
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:09,120
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

520
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,850
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

521
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:20,940
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

522
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,700
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

523
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,620
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

524
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:38,060
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

525
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,450
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

526
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,440
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

527
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,750
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

528
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,300
♫ If memories could speak ♫

529
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,340
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

530
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:04,410
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

531
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:29,830
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

532
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:35,800
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

533
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,700
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

534
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,080
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

535
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,470
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

536
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,560
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

537
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,800
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

538
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,210
♫ If memories could speak ♫

539

♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

540

♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

541
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,190
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

542
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,140
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

543
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:22,420
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

544
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,710
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

545
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,870
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

546
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:37,050
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
