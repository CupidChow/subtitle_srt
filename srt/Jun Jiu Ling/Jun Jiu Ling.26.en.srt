♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,470
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,490
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,740
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,830
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,020
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,980
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:11,320
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,350
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,760
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:31,040
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

[Jun Jiu Ling]

18
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,800
[Episode 26]

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,570
Pinwheels. Come and take a look.

20
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,780
Pinwheels.

21
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,580
Pendants and small toys. Come and take a look.
[Jiuling Hall]

22
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,230
I think there's a deeper meaning to Prince Xian's personal visit to Jiuling Hall.
[Jiuling Hall]

23
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,210
Did you just realize that?

24
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,830
To have Prince Xian some here in person,

25
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,510
means that Jiuling's medicinal skills are so great

26
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,870
that even the imperial family and relatives think highly of her.

27
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,140
Also, if Jiuling can please Prince Xian,

28
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,860
then perhaps she can ask him to help her see the young lord.

29
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,320
It has to be better than asking Lu Yunqi.

30
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,260
If you can think of it, I bet Miss Jun has already thought of it.

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,390
Miss Jun is truly blessed. Whenever she's in trouble,
[Jiuling Hall]

32
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,000
there's always someone to help her.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,980
She herself is her biggest savior.

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,140
Let's go back to work.

35
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,450
[Jiuling Hall]

36
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,050
Come, come. Let me give you a kiss.

37
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,940
Prince!

38
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,920
Have some grapes.

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,760
- Yes.
- Here.

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,450
Good.

41
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,800
- Here. Another one.
- It smells good.

42
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,130
To Twelfth Imperial Uncle,

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,100
it's safest for him to pretend to be an extravagant and lustful prince.

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,710
Otherwise, Chu Rang will treat him the way he treated my father.

45
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,130
- He would show no mercy to his own family. 
- So bad.

46
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,600
Twelfth Imperial Uncle who used to study hard and be ambitious

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,720
can only pretend to be a good-for-nothing.

48
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,220
Is this Jiurong's future as well?

49
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,100
Physician Jun, are you done looking over everyone?

50
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,870
Yes, Princess Consort is healthy. You're truly lucky and blessed.

51
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,960
I've brought some medicine for nourishment and recuperation,

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,240
and I've written down the directions.

53
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,130
You truly are a thoughtful person. Thank you, Miss Jun.

54
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,750
This is my job. Actually, I should be the one thanking you.

55
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,180
Thank me? For what?

56
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,560
Exactly.

57
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,010
Why don't you all leave first? Go on.

58
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,030
- Prince!
- Leave for now. Be good and listen.

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,870
Go ahead.

60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,160
May I be so bold to guess that you personally came to Jiuling Hall

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,740
because Duke Cheng's heir apparent asked you for a favor, right?

62
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,520
Nonsense! Do I need to follow someone's orders to do things?

63
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,620
I invited you to my residence for a diagnosis because I've long heard of your reputation.

64
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,340
Besides, he's currently in the imperial prison, so he can't ask me for much of anything.

65
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,090
Whether he asked you a favor, you came to me for a diagnosis.

66
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,700
That's in line with the will of the public, but not that of His Majesty.

67
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,690
That's why I thank you for treating me sincerely

68
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,930
and helping out wholeheartedly.

69
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,520
I didn't expect Zhu Zan who is strong and straightforward

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,250
to know such a smart person.

71
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,040
You were able to understand my meaning instantly. Good.

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,990
But I should help you.

73
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,320
You cured Prince Huai of his disease. That's a great achievement.

74
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,870
I'm grateful to you from the bottom of my heart.

75
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,640
Prince Huai has been weak since he was young.

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,770
I may have to trouble you often in the future.

77
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,190
Turns out that besides Zhu Zan, Twelfth Imperial Uncle cares about my brother, sister, and me.

78
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,100
Thank you for trusting me, but I'm afraid I can't help you anymore.

79
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,390
- Why's that?
- I'm planning to leave the capital.

80
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,380
Leave? You've gone through such hard times in the past.

81
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,890
There's a saying that goes, "After extreme bad luck, comes good luck."

82
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,410
Everyone knows of your reputation as the miraculous physician now.

83
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,550
From now on, everything should go smoothly. Don't be afraid!

84
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,520
I don't know about other people. Look, my entire family

85
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,780
will rely on you from now on.

86
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,790
I'll punish whoever bullies you, immediately.

87
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,320
Thank you for your comfort, but... I'm not afraid.

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,610
I just have to leave.

89
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,630
I was wondering why you gifted me a big box of medicine today.

90
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,060
Were you bidding me farewell?

91
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,950
Don't worry. I'll definitely come back.

92
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,800
But I have a favor to ask you.

93
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
Go ahead.

94
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,520
I beg you to find a way to protect the heir apparent's life.

95
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,130
It's probably not a good idea for me to get involved.

96
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,270
If Lu Yunqi does something...

97
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,770
You coming to Jiuling Hall has already drawn a lot of attention.

98
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,650
If you go see Lu Yunqi, His Majesty will definitely speculate.

99
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,320
Thus, you must not take action unless it's absolutely necessary.

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,360
I understand your real intention of coming to see me.

101
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,910
Baotang! Sanbing!

102
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,560
- Miss Jun.
- Where are you going?

103
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,580
We're going to save Second Brother. The Martial Moral Ministry is using severe punishments on him.

104
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,030
- What?
- The punishment rod.

105
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,050
Those savages are actually using the punishment rod on Second Brother.

106
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,050
- I'll kill them all!
- Can you go in like this?

107
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,180
We must go in even if we can't. We'll break into the prison if we have to.

108
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,280
Worse comes to worst, we'll fight them!

109
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,040
Hold on!

110
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,210
The Martial Moral Ministry is heavily guarded. You'll have no chance of winning if you go now.

111
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,210
- He's already inside. I can't let you both get into trouble as well.
- What should we do then?

112
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,420
Second Brother is being punished in there.

113
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,850
I'll talk to Lu Yunqi.

114
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,560
Are you confident you can help him?

115
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,340
Wait for my news.

116
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,390
Let's go see the people of Yunxiao Pavilion.

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,160
You're here.

118
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,270
You knew I would come, didn't you?

119
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,010
Since you're here, why don't we sit down and talk?

120
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,990
He's Duke Cheng's heir apparent. You punished him without a proper interrogation.

121
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,650
- I'm afraid that'll be difficult to explain.
- Do you think I care?

122
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,290
I want to see him. I want to prescribe him medicine.

123
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,880
You caring so much for another man will upset me.

124
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,270
But... it's good that you came.

125
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,440
So it doesn't matter what my intentions or feelings are. As long as I'm here

126
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,190
and am under your control, you're getting what you want. Isn't that so?

127
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,090
Then let me tell you again, Lu Yunqi.

128
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,570
I'm not Princess Jiuling.

129
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,790
You just want a substitute for her, which has nothing to do with me.

130
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,810
You won't understand.

131
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,790
Do you think His Majesty really wants to take his life because of the death of Huang Cheng's son?

132
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,870
What uncanny things would Duke Cheng do if his heir apparent died?

133
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,120
What would His Majesty think of you all? Have you thought of it?

134
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,000
That's why keeping the heir apparent alive

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,590
doesn't cater to Lord Huang,

136
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,620
but to His Majesty.

137
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,060
If you don't care about any of that,

138
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,100
then I'll leave the capital. It'll be more convenient for you to do anything to me.

139
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,030
- You'll leave the capital?
- Yes.

140
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,870
This is the condition I wanted to discuss with you.

141
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,300
You keep him alive, and I will leave the capital.

142
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,880
Immediately.

143
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,550
Take her to the imperial prison.

144
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,370
Yes, My Lord.

145
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,540
[Jiuling Hall]

146
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,310
We need to restock the betel nuts again.
 [Betel Nut]

147
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,750
Insecticide, stimulant, enhancing circulation, diuretic. It's a high-quality herbal medicine.

148
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,920
What are you thinking of?

149
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,510
I was thinking, will this medicinal hall really close because Lu Yunqi is making trouble?

150
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,860
Never mind the entire world, there are so many people in the capital.

151
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,870
Can he stop them all from coming here?

152
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,650
That's true.

153
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,490
You are back so quickly!

154
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,860
Where is Jiuling?

155
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,820
She went to Martial Moral Ministry. She refused to let me follow her.

156
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,990
Did Prince Xian send her there?

157
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,840
Miss went there on her own after leaving the Prince Xian Residence.

158
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,370
On her own?

159
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,150
Didn't she mention the young lord to Prince Xian?

160
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,870
I don't know. She told me to wait at the entrance of the residence.

161
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,340
Going to see Lu Yunqi at this time, has she gone crazy?

162
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,290
By the way, she told me to come back to pack her things.

163
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,450
It seems like she wants to go somewhere far.

164
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,940
Zhu Zan.

165
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,100
Can just anyone come into the prison of the Martial Moral Ministry?!

166
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,380
Take this person away! I refuse to see her!

167
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,600
It's Lu Yunqi who told me to come and treat you.

168
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,540
What is it? Are you afraid we'll escape?

169
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,810
Let's go.

170
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,070
Why didn't you save Wan Qing?

171
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,450
Wan Qing isn't dead. She's already left the city safely.

172
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,330
Just endure it for a bit.

173
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,100
My Lord, I don't understand, are we really letting her go?

174
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,750
The people of my ministry are everywhere in this nation.

175
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,010
As long as she's alive, she cannot escape from my grasp.

176
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,350
When Miss Jun leaves the capital, it will be easier for you to control her.

177
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,800
I know you did it for me. You were afraid I would be criticized by everyone for saving Huang Ziqing.

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,850
But you shouldn't have.

179
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,960
You shouldn't have been so impulsive and taken such risks.

180
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,830
Did you even think of Duke Cheng?

181
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,090
Did you think of the people in the northern parts? If they get implicated

182
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,180
and something goes wrong, what would they do?

183
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,080
Earlier, I shouted at you

184
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,860
because I didn't want you to be implicated.

185
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,630
Huang Cheng will surely take revenge on the people near me.

186
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,490
I went to see Lu Yunqi.

187
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,790
I will leave the capital once I finish treating you.

188
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,340
You made a deal with Lu Yunqi?

189
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,740
What bargaining chip do I have to make a deal with him?

190
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,630
You leave the capital and he will let me live.

191
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,060
Endure it for a bit.

192
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
No.

193
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,650
Lu Yunqi has an especially complicated network.

194
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,820
You will never escape regardless of where you go.

195
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,680
Also, I'm unable to leave right now. If something happens to you,

196
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,250
I will not be able to save you. You cannot trust him.

197
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,460
- No.
- Don't say anymore.

198
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,890
Zhu Zan, listen to me.

199
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,850
You must stay alive here. Nothing can happen to you.

200
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,300
As long as you are alive,

201
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,440
we will have a chance to get you out.

202
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,080
Regardless of whether it's for my sake or Duke Cheng's.

203
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,800
Physician Jun, you've finished applying the medicine, so it's time for you to leave.

204
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,880
Imperial Brother.
[Chaohua Hall]

205
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,640
There's such good weather outside.

206
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,290
You should go for a scroll in the garden.

207
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,850
How am I as free as you?

208
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,590
Imperial Brother, that's where you're wrong.

209
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,240
You are busy with state affairs every day. That is exactly why

210
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,670
you need to make time to relax.

211
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,670
Then you will have more energy to read the reports.

212
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,300
Why are you here?

213
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,120
One doesn't go to the temple for nothing. I'm guessing you've spent all your money again. Isn't that so?

214
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,810
Imperial Brother understands me well. I never have enough spending money.

215
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,090
But... this time...

216
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,570
I didn't come only because of spending money.

217
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,760
Then what is it?

218
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,880
No matter what it was you wanted,

219
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,500
you were always so straightforward. What makes you so hesitant?

220
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,510
This matter... is really difficult for me to bring up.

221
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,480
Go ahead. No matter what it is, I won't make a fuss.

222
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,360
Then I shall speak.

223
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,500
I ask Imperial Brother to spare Zhu Zan's life.

224
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,640
I truly didn't expect

225
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,440
you to be the first to plead for him.

226
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,300
Didn't he hit you before?

227
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,420
If you plead for him, isn't that returning animosity with kindness?

228
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,400
The two of us bonded through fighting. You may not know

229
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,240
but this fellow is an expert in all manners of food and entertainment. I admire him greatly.

230
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,720
I was thinking that if I had someone like him

231
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,410
to have fun all day, wouldn't that be great?

232
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,040
Imperial Brother, just let him experience some hardships in prison.

233
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,480
Then let him keep his life for now in order to keep me company every day.

234
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,410
I guarantee that he will not disturb you anymore.

235
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,670
You needn't get involved in this matter.

236
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,090
You don't understand the complexity of what is at stake.

237
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,000
- Imperial Brother–
- As for your stipend,

238
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,750
I'll have Yuan Bao deliver some over to you later.

239
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,120
Enough, I am busy.

240
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,150
I will take my leave.

241
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,340
Are you escaping from something?

242
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,660
Eldest Young Lady, Young Lady Jun isn't that kind of person.

243
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,950
I'm sure there is a reason why she has to go back to Zezhou.

244
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,860
Besides, you've been away for a while. It's time for you to go back to visit.

245
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,750
Young Master and Old Madam will surely be happy.

246
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,230
Then will we keep Jiuling Hall open? We can't open without her.

247
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,060
No one is asking to see a physician anyway. We're just selling medicine.

248
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,130
What do you mean we can't open without someone?

249
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,230
Exactly. Without me at Jiuling Hall, just keep selling medicine.

250
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,230
But once you're gone, Miss Jinxiu will be the only one here.

251
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,690
I'm worried that she can't handle it.

252
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,110
I can.

253
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,830
Let Chen Qi go back to Zezhou with you all.

254
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,080
That way you all can look after each other.

255
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,750
It's fine. I can just go with Miss.

256
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,210
Let me go with you. If you two ladies go on your own,

257
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,220
we will worry.

258
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,650
When are you planning to come back?

259
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,620
Right now, I have no plans to come back.

260
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,640
So you're scared, aren't you?

261
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm not scared. It's just that famous physicians are liked by the people,

262
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,900
but many of them are killed by those in power.

263
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,850
Wen Zhi was boiled to death by King Min of Qi (ruled 300–284 BC). Bian Que (physician 407 – 310 BC) was killed by Imperial Physician Qin's trap.

264
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,630
Hua Tuo died in an unexpected disaster.
(Eastern Han Dynasty physician 140–208 AD)

265
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,830
Jiuling Hall has gained a reputation now. If I stay in the capital,

266
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,250
I'm afraid Lu Yunqi won't let me go.

267
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,250
But if I fight against a maniac, I'll become a maniac sooner or later.

268
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,420
I don't know how much more trouble he's going to cause.

269
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,700
So from now on, Jiuling Hall won't offer consultation, but keep selling medicine.

270
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,010
That way physicians in and outside the capital will come for medicines.

271
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,680
Even if Lu Yunqi wants to cause trouble, it won't be easy.

272
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,220
Consider this making concessions in order to gain advantages.

273
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,640
Since that's the case, I'll go back now

274
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,680
to prepare for your journey back.

275
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,860
- I'll help out.
- Thank you, Shopkeeper Liu, for your hard work.

276
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,100
I'll start packing then, Miss.

277
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,580
Go ahead.

278
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,350
You knew this day would come, didn't you?

279
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,900
You told us to come to the capital to be the shopkeeper and accountant.

280
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,290
In actuality, you wanted to hand Jiuling Hall to us when you left.

281
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,300
You're always more thoughtful than others.

282
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,880
Well, you still have time to consider whether you want to continue to be Jiuling Hall's accountant.

283
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,820
You've thought about it all, so what is there for me to think about?

284
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,150
From now on, be extra careful here in the capital.

285
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,420
Jinxiu, if anything happens here,

286
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,920
you cannot pretend to be brave.

287
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,270
If there is any trouble, go find Prince Xian. He is trustworthy.

288
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,950
I've also told Chengyu to ask De Shengchang to keep an eye out.

289
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,610
Keep in mind that except for people,

290
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,020
everything can be abandoned.

291
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,930
I know. I just work with money as an accountant.

292
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,120
There's no reason for me to risk my life, right?

293
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,130
Speaking of, I really want to see

294
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,850
the angry expression on your future mother-in-law after knowing about your marriage contract.

295
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,480
When are you leaving?

296
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,760
Immediately.

297
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,200
How's Zhu Zan?

298
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,920
The punishment was severe indeed,

299
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,520
but his life is not in danger.

300
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,380
Lu Yunqi and Zhu Zan have fought several times before.

301
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,930
It's possible he's taking this advantage to get revenge for personal grudges.

302
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,290
Tell him not to beat the person to death.

303
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,050
Yes.

304
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,400
I wanted to see who would plead for mercy for Zhu Zan.

305
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,360
In the end?

306
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,230
Since it has to do with Huang Cheng, it's tricky.

307
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,250
There's some discussion in the imperial court,

308
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,310
but nobody dares to say anything.

309
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,700
I'm guessing they want to protect themselves.

310
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,730
All court officials are like that.

311
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,060
Do you think I should be happy

312
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,090
or worried?

313
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,710
What? Are you the same?

314
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,070
Your Majesty, you make your own decisions.

315
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,310
I don't dare to judge.

316
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,140
I went to see Lu Yunqi. I will leave the capital once I finish treating you.

317
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,950
You made a deal with Lu Yunqi?

318
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,200
What bargaining chip do I have to make a deal with him?

319
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,650
Zhu Zan, listen to me.

320
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,440
You must stay alive here.

321
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,750
Nothing can happen to you. As long as you are alive,

322
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,740
we will have a chance to get you out.

323
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,820
It's quite strange. It's been a whole day,

324
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,450
yet no one from the Martial Moral Ministry has shown up.

325
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,910
Since no one has shown up,

326
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,430
someone must have helped us obstruct them.

327
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,200
To obstruct the Martial Moral Ministry is not something ordinary people can do.

328
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,210
Could it be Prince Xian?

329
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,030
Could it be someone under the young lord?

330
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,610
If it was the heir apparent, he should've had someone protect you in advance.

331
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,240
He's really thoughtful and cares about Miss very much.

332
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,430
Lu Yunqi received my letter. He should keep his promise

333
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,200
in persuading Huang Cheng in a manner I've outlined in the letter

334
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,470
to keep Zhu Zan alive.

335
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,940
Let's hurry and eat. After that, we'll keep going.

336
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,660
Zhu Zan's people again.

337
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,880
Yes, Li Sanbing and Zhang Baotang stopped us.

338
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,320
He must've arranged that. My Lord,

339
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,040
do we need to send more people there?

340
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,160
No rush.

341
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,610
Let her bid a farewell.

342
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,660
She won't be able to see them again.

343
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,110
Yes.

344
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,830
Are you asking me to let Zhu Zan go?

345
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,840
Your Majesty, the investigation

346
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,170
shows that my son's death was indeed caused by the startled horse.

347
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,780
It was an accident.

348
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,800
The young lord was there just to stop the startled horse.

349
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,410
No.

350
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,470
Even so, we should let him suffer a bit more in the imperial prison.

351
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,850
Your Majesty, we must not.

352
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,900
Losing a son is a trivial family matter of mine.

353
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,400
Duke Cheng is carrying out the important task of guarding the border.

354
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,150
He can't be affected by my family matter.

355
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,450
Right now, this matter is being discussed throughout the court.

356
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,300
We should properly and quickly take care of this matter.

357
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,890
Then I will have wronged you.

358
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,230
Thank you, Your Majesty, for being understanding. State affairs are of utmost importance.

359
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,190
I hope Your Majesty will take my advice.

360
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,070
Let's do this.

361
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,270
Send him to the Ministry of Livestock to breed horses so he can reflect on his mistakes.

362
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,380
What do you think?

363
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,680
Your Majesty is wise.

364
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,470
[Fang Residence]

365
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,460
Grandmother. Mother.

366
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,990
Chen Qi had someone come ahead of them with a letter, saying Jiuling will arrive in Zezhou in a few days.

367
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,330
Great news. Jiuling is coming back.

368
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,600
Then we should discuss her arrangements here.

369
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,190
Just tidy up the courtyard she's lived in before.

370
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,450
Should we choose a courtyard closer to you?

371
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,540
This is Fang Residence. We'll see each other everywhere anyway.

372
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,910
What difference would that make?

373
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,700
I wonder how long that child can stay.

374
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,320
Does Jiuling know your feelings for her?

375
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,660
Naturally, I'll make it clear to Jiuling.

376
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,430
Grandmother. Mother. Please don't pay too much attention to that.

377
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,730
If she doesn't have feelings for me, it'll make her stay awkward.

378
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,490
By the way, I was going to report to you, Grandmother.

379
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,600
I've dealt with De Shengchang's accounts for this month.

380
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,010
Tomorrow, I'll go to the stage station outside the city to wait for her.

381
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,900
Isn't that too early? Didn't you just say she'll arrive in a few days?

382
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,410
It's estimated to be in a few days,

383
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,730
but things don't always go as planned. What if she travels faster and arrives sooner?

384
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,110
Go ahead. Pick her up.

385
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,000
Yes, Grandmother.

386
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,570
Young Lord, just admit your mistake.

387
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,270
This time you did act up and cross the line.

388
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,660
Eunuch Yuan,

389
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,650
I know I was wrong.

390
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,290
If I see a startled horse or a startled donkey in the future,

391
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,120
I won't get myself involved anymore.

392
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,200
That's the right attitude.

393
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,060
Speak properly from now on.

394
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,560
They beat me without letting me speak.

395
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,060
Don't worry, Eunuch Yuan.

396
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,680
I'll definitely keep His Majesty's teachings in mind.

397
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,930
Actually, His Majesty sending you to the Ministry of Livestock to reflect

398
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,220
is already him showing mercy.

399
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,960
Really?

400
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,980
Then thank His Majesty for showing mercy.

401
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,850
So, Eunuch Yuan, can I go to the Ministry of Livestock now?

402
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,520
Sure.

403
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,760
The punishment was quite painful, Lord Lu.

404
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,650
That's fine. I forgive you.

405
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,580
We have a lot of time ahead of us.

406
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,320
He's actually able to get out of bed.

407
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,670
Is Physician Jun's medicine that great?

408
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,490
Stop.

409
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,730
Young Master, are you tired? Should we rest?

410
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,590
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

411
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,710
There's a stage station up ahead. Why don't we take a break there?

412
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,860
Steward Gao, I said I would wait for Jiuling at the stage station

413
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,590
just to please my grandmother so she could rest assured.

414
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,260
I want to keep going to pick up Jiuling.

415
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,920
Keep going?

416
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,120
Yes. Steward Gao, don't worry.

417
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,440
I've completely recovered.

418
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,480
I can ride a horse and shoot arrows.

419
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,350
I will keep going to show Jiuling.

420
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,680
All right. Since Young Master has made a decision, we'll keep going.

421
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,660
Master, I'm here to visit you.

422
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,210
I've brought your favorite pastries for you.

423
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,640
This year...

424
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,810
many things have happened to me.

425
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,390
I've felt long-lost warmth

426
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,680
and encountered many difficulties.

427
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,780
But none of these will defeat me.

428
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,490
Rest assured.

429
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,400
I'll surely seek justice from Chu Rang.

430
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,410
The hidden secret of Zezhou that you entrusted to me, has to do with the Fang family.

431
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,460
I have to gather more evidence of Chu Rang's crimes now.

432
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,480
I hope you will keep me safe from up above.

433
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,980
Master, rest assured. When I get my revenge,

434
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,160
I'll definitely come back to see you.

435
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,090
[Loving Father Jun Yingwen's Grave]

436
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,850
Young Master! Young Master!

437
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,130
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

438
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,100
- Liu'er.
- Young Master.

439
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,200
Where's Jiuling?

440
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,250
Miss went to visit Old Master Jun's grave on her own. She should arrive in Zezhou very soon.

441
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,190
She... She should.

442
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,950
Young Master, why did you come all the way here to pick her up?

443
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,160
Isn't it fine to just wait at the city gate?

444
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,240
I think Young Master wants to see Miss Jun as soon as possible.

445
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,580
I haven't seen her in over a year.

446
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,890
Young Master, what do you have in your hands?

447
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,120
These are plums I picked on my way here.

448
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,410
You must be tired from traveling all the way here. I picked them so you could quench your thirst.

449
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,760
Since Miss isn't here, we can only enjoy them by ourselves.

450
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,420
Take them.

451
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,050
Where are you going to meet up with Jiuling?

452
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,980
A stage station ten miles away from the city.
(T/N: Chinese miles; 1 mile = 1/2 kilometer)

453
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,800
We were going to wait at the stage station, but we changed our mind and came all the way here.

454
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,930
Exactly. I thought I could see Jiuling sooner.

455
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,030
But unexpectedly, I ended up delaying it by some strange combination of events.

456
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,740
That's fine. It's not considered a delay.

457
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,840
If we hurry, maybe we will get there before she does.

458
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,950
That's right. Let's go now.

459
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,480
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

460
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,190
Mother, eat something. You haven't eaten for several days.

461
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,760
If I eat and then recall the praise they gave that woman,

462
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,250
I will vomit again.

463
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,380
- Mother!
- Mother, Yan Yan.

464
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,770
Brother.

465
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,060
Brother, because of the marriage between you and Jun Zhenzhen,

466
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,680
Mother has fallen sick from anger.

467
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,100
- Mother.
- I have something to ask you.

468
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,950
Don't need to ask. I just asked him outside.

469
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,600
The marriage agreement is fake.

470
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,080
That was also his second uncle's idea. The situation at the time was critical,

471
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,590
so it was the most appropriate thing to do.

472
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,870
Is it really fake?

473
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,800
Yes.

474
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,610
Since it's fake, when are you going to announce it?

475
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:28,130
I need to discuss it with Miss Jun before we know before deciding when.

476
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,340
You need to discuss it with her?

477
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,420
In order to get out of trouble, she's using this marriage agreement

478
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,800
to gain our family's protection.

479
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,260
You've helped her already,

480
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,970
but you still need to discuss it with her.

481
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,790
Mother, she's established a great reputation and I've become a first-ranked scholar.

482
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,700
Even if there was no trouble, our marriage agreement would still be talked about.

483
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,140
I would eventually be dragged into it.

484
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,730
So... So I might as well take the initiative

485
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:00,540
and shut people's mouths to keep a good reputation.

486
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,840
Also, if anyone wanted to take advantage of the marriage agreement,

487
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,590
they would surely call me unfaithful.

488
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,930
Then my career would be in trouble.

489
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,700
That's right.

490
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,300
That's not right. Brother,

491
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,440
you haven't fallen for Jun Zhenzhen, have you?

492
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,990
What?

493
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,430
Brother, you're so smart and capable.

494
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,920
Why would you be scared of people making a fuss about your marriage?

495
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,090
Brother.

496
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,990
Say something, Brother.

497
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,690
Yes!

498
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,340
I do like her.

499
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,210
Brother!

500
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,830
My son is as precious as a treasure.

501
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,700
My son who shall bring honor to our family has actually fallen for that vixen.

502
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,950
- Mother, you've misunderstood her. She's actually–
- Shut your mouth!

503
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,940
Mother!

504
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,070
Ending OST: Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

505
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:28,220
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

506
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:34,100
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

507
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:40,110
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

508
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:45,850
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

509
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:51,850
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

510
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:57,750
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

511
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:03,650
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

512
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:09,080
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

513
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,480
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

514
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,430
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

515
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:20,780
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

516
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,220
♫ If memories could speak ♫

517
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,270
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

518
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:33,430
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

519
00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:00,800
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

520
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,780
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

521
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:12,640
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

522
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,990
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

523
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,480
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

524
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,470
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

525
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,810
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

526
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,330
♫ If memories could speak ♫

527
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:36,260
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

528
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:41,680
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

529
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,070
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

530
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,100
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

531
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,360
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

532
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,700
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

533
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,860
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

534
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:07,830
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
