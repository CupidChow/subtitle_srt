He wants to gift Tianyou to Northern Qi.

20
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,060
Your Majesty, after Duke Cheng returned to the capital,

21
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,170
I received many memorials from the officials and generals of the North.

22
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,400
They are oppressing the Imperial Court and ignoring the orders of the government officials.

23
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,530
Marquis Qinghe is in a difficult situation in the North.

24
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,010
The officials and generals agreed overtly but secretly opposed.

25
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,560
Your Majesty, as long as Duke Cheng is there,

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,300
there won't be any peace at the border.

27
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,720
Your Majesty, please dismiss Duke Cheng from his military duties.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,800
I request you to control Duke Cheng's domineering abuse of power

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
and convict him of unauthorized authority.

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,690
I support.

31
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,880
I also support.

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,150
Your Majesty, please decide.

33
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,210
- That's right.
- No.

34
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,410
We shouldn't make wild guesses regarding this.

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,630
Towards Your Majesty and the Imperial Court,

36
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,880
I am completely loyal. Heaven is my witness.

37
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,130
I do not want to explain, and only have one thing

38
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,680
to ask from Your Majesty.

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,000
I am old...

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,340
and also when fighting the battle

41
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,550
was inadvertently injured. The wound now has a dull pain.

42
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,570
I ask for grace from Your Majesty

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,650
to allow me to resign, and not lead soldiers in the future.

44
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,920
I did not expect Zhu Qing and I to think the same.

45
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,550
I've always thought of you

46
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,180
perennially fighting outside, working so hard.

47
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,550
You now have injuries on your body.

48
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,950
Very well.

49
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,080
You stay in the capital to recuperate properly.

50
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

51
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,980
Recuperate well, speedy recovery.

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,080
Your Majesty, if the Imperial Court ever needs my old body,

53
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
this servant will not shirk commitment even if I were to die ten thousand deaths.

54
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,520
Duke Cheng resigned?

55
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,300
He said he resigned, but actually, he is leaving the military and going back to civilian life. Only to save face, that's all.

56
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,690
Duke Cheng must have had his own considerations when he did that.

57
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,850
Nothing was kept, only a false nobility rank, no other official positions at all.

58
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,330
Duke Cheng resigned from his rank, supposedly to lead a civilian life.

59
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,870
But this time the Imperial Court was very straightforward, totally dismissed.

60
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,590
This is to let everybody know

61
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,630
Duke Cheng's resignation is not a normal resignation, but guilt.

62
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,750
Now, people are talking on the streets, saying Duke Cheng covets battle achievements,

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,840
with an intent to provoke warfare between the two countries again. As it's easier to force His Majesty to return military rights to him.

64
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,220
His Majesty has no choice but to dismiss him in disguise.

65
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,260
I will go see Duke Cheng.

66
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,640
- Miss Jun.
- Miss Jun.

68
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,480
I was looking for you.

69
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,070
How is Duke Cheng?

70
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,870
Out of official duties, feeling relaxed. He's good.

71
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,420
You all are leaving?

72
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,560
Yes, they are leaving.

73
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Are you not leaving?

74
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,650
If I leave,

75
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,430
what will you do?

76
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,380
Zhu Zan, even though Duke Cheng handed over military rights already,

77
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,610
His Majesty and Huang Cheng will definitely not leave him alone.

78
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,500
You must escort Duke Cheng and Madam safely away.

79
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,670
That is the most important.

80
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,730
Rest assured. I am all right.

81
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,450
As for the big revenge plan, I will slowly plot it as well.

82
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,410
Jiuling is here.

83
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,360
Father. Mother.

84
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,260
- Duke Cheng.
- Miss Jun.

85
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,060
You do not need to worry about me. I had expected this day long ago.

86
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,750
Duke Cheng, you shared your tasks with me, surely you will leave leverage for others.

87
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,770
You are supposed to have half of the credit. And they are coming for me.

88
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,010
But the work is still there.

89
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,290
But now His Majesty is reducing your prestige.

90
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,630
This time you shared everything with me, I'm afraid...

91
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,330
What's this? It's better than both of us having nothing.

92
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,590
I am only afraid that His Majesty will not let this thing last long.

93
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,410
For the things that you need to do, it's enough.

94
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,480
Use prestige to get bigger prestige. When you have a bigger prestige, you can do more things.

95
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,630
Not to mention you are a physician curing illnesses, saving people.

96
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,690
Even if His Majesty doesn't like you, in the end, the public opinion is hard to beat also.

97
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,710
Miss Jun, the palace sent someone to Jiuling Hall. They say that Her Majesty the Empress is summoning you.

98
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,730
Shopkeeper Qi's carriage is waiting outside the door.

99
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
I got it.

100
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,920
Duke Cheng. Madam. I bid farewell.

101
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,060
Take care on the road.

102
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,330
We will leave first.

103
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,340
Jiuling, promise me one thing.

104
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,860
- Go on.
- This time when you enter the palace, you must not be foolish like before.

105
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,270
Now, staying alive means more possibilities.

106
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,430
Besides, I've already died once, I will not be impulsive anymore.

Miss, you go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

110
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,940
All right.

111
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,340
We left the court not long ago, but His Majesty has urgently summoned us to the palace again.

112
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,110
Perhaps there's a big thing happening again.

113
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,970
This hypocritical emperor finally wants to act calmly.

114
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,980
Now the emperor's position is getting more and more stable, dissent is eliminated.

115
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,910
Even if he does not have worries, he also does not need to pretend to be affable and kind.

116
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,700
Young Master Ning, you must protect yourself fully.

117
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,740
Duke Cheng's quick retreat might not be a bad thing.

118
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,790
But I am afraid that with each step backward, it will push him to a dead end. Jiuling,

119
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,610
your involvement with Duke Cheng is deep. You have to be very careful.

120

State affairs are chaotic, everybody is protecting themselves.

121

Young Master Ning is willing to play against the Imperial Court.

122
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,850
On this occasion, heal the hearts of people. Time and tide wait for no man.

123

Loyal servants are disappointed, treacherous servants in power, a country not stable, civilians are uneasy.

Common people suffer, the vitality of the landscape harmed.

I will surely do all that I can.

126
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,080
Your Majesty, please convict Zhu Shan of treason.

127
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,640
What?

128
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,310
Lord Huang, you cannot speak casually. Do you have evidence?

129
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,050
Your Majesty, I dare not speak casually.

130
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,130
After Zhu Shan left the North, the officers and soldiers there

131
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,910
have no longer felt oppressed. Thus, one after another, they reported him for his evil deeds.

132
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,810
I know of that matter.

133
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,980
In the past, there were indeed many memorials to impeach Zhu Shan.

134
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,830
Your Majesty, the impeachment this time is not the same as before.

135
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,160
The past impeachments were requested by the civil officials in the North.

136
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,090
It's now from the officers and soldiers in the North.

137
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,510
I haven't been willing to submit the memorials.

138
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,200
One, I didn't believe that Zhu Shan would be that bold and reckless.

139
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,370
Second, Your Majesty rewarded him handsomely.

140
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,820
Hence, I privately conducted a secret investigation.

141
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,440
In the end, I unraveled more.

142
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,080
Zhu Shan became more arrogant and instigated the two countries.

143
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,490
I dare not hide it anymore.

144
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,620
No, no, no.

145
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,760
Duke Cheng is a military commander that the late emperor relied heavily upon,

146
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,440
and a person of good morals and reputation. I don't believe this.

147
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,110
Your Majesty, I have evidence of Zhu Shan's crimes. Please take a look.

148
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,000
Your Majesty, this is the correspondence between Zhu Shan and the Crown Prince of Northern Qi.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,750
It has his secret communication with Northern Qi and the crime of betraying the Imperial Court.

150
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,540
Jiuling is in the palace. She is Duke Cheng's future daughter-in-law.

151
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,100
I wonder if she will be implicated.

152
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,180
I truly dare not believe this. This Zhu Shan...

153
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,440
How bold!

154
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,170
Please arrest Zhu Shan immediately.

155
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,980
Please arrest Zhu Shan immediately.

- Thank you, Physician Jun.

- Physician Jun, I'm going back to work.

Where are you going in such a panic?

Is it because of this face of yours that you do not recognize me anymore?

Everyone knows this. Stop being passionate.

Are you saying that when you tried to assassinate His Majesty back then

you blamed me? You blamed me for not saving you.

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
Treason!

252
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,200
Treason?

253
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,500
We've worked hard for the Imperial Court for years.

I've had this sword for most of my life.

257
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,300
It's covered with blood,

258
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,000
but it's the blood of raiders from Northern Qi who invaded my nation.

259
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,800
Today, I've reached a dead end.

260
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,800
All I'm asking for is to save face. If it happens to you one day,

261
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,200
will you be willing to be humiliated?

262
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,300
I used this sword on my enemies, not my people.

263
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,200
But if you all force me,

264
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,000
I'd rather die

265
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
than return to the capital and be humiliated.

266

267
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,000
if you leave?

268
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,600
It means that I will then become a rebel in your eyes.

269
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
That's right.

270
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,000
It means you're escaping to avoid punishment.

271
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,800
It means that you did commit the crime of treason.

272
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,700
Duke Cheng, you'll no longer have power,

273
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,700
and will be disliked by the civilians. Over ten years of success on the battlefield,

274
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,600
will go up in smoke.

275
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
I, Zhu Shan, have protected the land and people all my life.

276
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
I have never gone after fame and fortune.

277
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,590
Duke Cheng, you're very selfless.

278

Please return to the capital with me to tell the world.

Everyone hates traitors and thieves.

281

What I, Zhu Shan, hate the most in my life,

282
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,570
is also those who are disloyal, unjust, and unfilial.

283
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,870
I never expected myself

284
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,300
to become a traitor as well.

285
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,700
However, let me ask you all!

286
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,800
In your eyes,

287
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,800
am I, Zhu Shan, a rebel?

288
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,400
I've spent all my life in the military

289
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,800
to keep Tianyou safe. I've almost died many times

290
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,400
and faced numerous spears and arrows, just to hope that Tianyou's people

291
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,200
can live a rich and safe life.

292
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,800
But today I have to run away

293
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,000
after being called a traitor!

294
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,400
Whether I'm a loyal general or a traitor,

295
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
God knows

296
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,400
and I know. That's good enough. I have a clear conscience.

297
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Duke Cheng, if you return with me,

298
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
I'll definitely try my best to beg His Majesty for mercy.

299
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,000
Please don't run away. There's no turning back.

300
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,600
This path...

301
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,400
Since I've chosen it,

302
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,600
I'll walk to the end of it.

303
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Our Tianyou is safe today,

304
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600

305
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,660

How is it? Is there news of Miss?

312
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,800
I've asked around several times. They were all certain

313
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,000
that Young Lady Jun left from the south gate in the late afternoon.

314
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,800
Impossible. Miss knows that I am waiting here for her.

315
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,200
Even if she did not come here, she would have had someone notify me.

316
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
How could she possibly let me wait here until nightfall?

317

Could it be that Miss Jun has something important to take care of

s-so she could not notify us in advance?

319
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,600
Ever since the last time Miss left the city to get herbs for Young Master

320
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,200
and didn't come home that night because of some delay, making us all worried,

321
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,600
she's never been inconsiderate.

322
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,200
How is it possible? It's...

323
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,800
Why don't you look around nearby?

324
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,400
What if Miss comes back? Look around again.

325
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,600
Okay.

326
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,300
Shopkeeper Liu.

327
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,700
It's...

328
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,600
Shopkeeper Liu, it's not a good idea to stop at the palace gate, so I had to do it this way.

329
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,200
Lord Ning, why are you looking for me?

330
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,400
Is Jiuling missing?

331
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,200
Why do you say that?

332
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
When I left the palace during the day, I saw Chen Qi very worried.

333
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
I couldn't go back assured, so I asked around at the palace gate again.

334
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,700
I saw you still waiting there, so I knew something was wrong.

335
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,000
Lord Ning, to be honest,

336
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Miss has indeed gone missing.

337
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,600
There's nothing I can do.

338
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,500
Could you find an opportunity to return to the palace

339
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,000
and help us inquire about her?

340
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
No need.

341
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I think I know where she is.

342
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,600
It must be Lu Yunqi. It can only be him.

343
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,100
Lord Lu? What should we do then?

344
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,200
Heir Apparent is not here at this time.

345
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,400
I fear no one can save Miss.

346
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,200
- It's...
- Shopkeeper Liu, don't worry.

347
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Tomorrow, I'll talk to Lu Yunqi and probe for information.

348
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,500
Then I'll see what I can do.

349
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,200
Thank you, Lord Ning. I'm sorry for what happened earlier.

350
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,800
Shopkeeper Liu, don't take it to heart. Jiuling and I were only acting as we discussed.

351
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,200
Of course, I still must maintain a distance from Jiuling in public.

352
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,400
If there's any news in a day or two, I'll have Xiao Ding deliver a letter secretly.

353
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,700
All right. Then I'll return first and wait.

354
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,800
Shopkeeper Liu, take care.

355
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
He's a traitor!

356
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,900
Your Majesty, please calm down!

357
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,400
I trusted him so much and treated him very well.

358
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,800
How did I not treat him well? Why did he do this to me?

359
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,600
Your Majesty, Zhu Shan is rebellious.

360
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,200
I hope Your Majesty won't be merciful anymore. Please give an order immediately

361
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,600
to arrest Zhu Shan and execute him on the spot.

362
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,200
Go ahead.

363
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,430
You took her away, right?

364
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,390
Lord Lu!

365
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,300
Doing that is not appropriate.

366
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,000
Duke Cheng disobeyed the imperial decree and ran away. It means he admitted to committing the crime of treason.

367
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Now she's disappeared suddenly.

368
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,700
What do you think His Majesty would think?

369
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Are you threatening me?

370
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600
I'm not threatening you.

371
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm telling you that when it comes to matters between her and me,

372
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,800
you need not worry.

373
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,600
Lord Lu, I know you will not hurt her.

374
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,900
But if you can make who you love happy,

375
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,700
isn't that better?

376
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,400
That is you,

377
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,040
not me.

378
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is the message that Young Master Ning had someone deliver just now.

379
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Miss Jun is indeed in his hands.

380
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,200
I'll go find her! I'll go to the Martial Moral Ministry to ask for her!

381
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,800
Chen Qi, don't be rash!

382
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,400
Isn't going there now walking to your death? Calm down.

383
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,800
Then, what do we do?

384
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,200
Let's tell everyone about this so they can put pressure on him.

385
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
That's what I was thinking at first, too. However, that won't do now.

386
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,900
Duke Cheng has been convicted of the crime of treason.

387
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,400
The news should be announced to the public soon.

388
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,600
Then they will defame Duke Cheng.

389
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,200
Miss Jun has a close relationship with Duke Cheng and his family.

390
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,800
Her disappearance will definitely be taken advantage of by some people.

391
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,900
Then it would be even more difficult to clear up.

392
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
This won't do and that won't do.

393
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
Then, what exactly should we do now?

394
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,000
We can only wait for the right time. The good thing is

395
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Miss Jun is in the hands of Lu Yunqi, not His Majesty's.

396
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
That... What's the difference?

397
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,400
Lord Lu and His Majesty are in the same boat.

398
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,400
He has a really deep obsession with Jiuling.

399
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,200
His obsession means he has a conscience,

400
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,400
which is better than those without a conscience.

401
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
[Jiuling Hall]

402
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Physician Jun.

403
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Is Physician Jun here?

404
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
She's not here.

405
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Didn't Physician Jun just return?

406
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,800
My master had me invite her to come over. It's a wasted trip.

407
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Something happened in her family back in Zezhou, so she hasn't come back.

408
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,200
Then, when will she be back?

409
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,000
I truly do not know.

410
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,100
Why don't you go to another clinic?

411
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,200
I'm really sorry.

412
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,800
All right.

413
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,400
When can I...

414
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,800
stop lying like this?

415
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,600
I don't know how Jinxiu is doing in Zezhou either.

416
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,600
- Miss!
- Liu'er.

417
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
- Miss!
- Stop shouting!

418
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,800
Chen Qi, why are you in a panic when I call for Miss?

419
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,200
Come with me to the back courtyard. I'll explain to you.

420
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,800
Let's go.

421
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Come take a look.

422
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,450
Lord Lu.

423
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,400
Lord Lu, are you heading home or to the Martial Moral Ministry?

424
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Who are they?

425
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Is that Young Master Ning?

426
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,400
Yes, that's him.

427
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,000
- He still looks the same.
- Exactly.

428
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,600
Lord Lu, guess what they are all thinking.

429
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,200
They are probably thinking that I'm quite bold.

430
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,500
Lord Lu,

431
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,200
can I see her?

432
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,200
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

433
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,000
Jiuling, I'm sorry.

434
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,600
I came back late. You must be hungry.

435
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,600
I remember you liked eating Cao's specialty.

436
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
Last time, you said it was delicious.

437
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
Today, I brought it home specifically for you. Try it.

438
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,600
Let me go.

439
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,800
They didn't open till late.

440
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,200
I didn't want to force or disturb them

441
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
as they might ruin the food, so I waited a long time.

442
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,200
You're not hungry waiting for me, are you?

443
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,400
Here. Try it. It tastes good.

444
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,800
I know you want to know about Duke Cheng's matters.

445
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,600
His Majesty convicted him of the crime of treason.

446
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,000
He will be executed when sent back to the capital.

447
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,800
The crime of treason?

448
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,500
How is that possible?

449
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,400
There's nothing that is impossible.

450
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,600
Are these things important when he dies?

451
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Duke Cheng no longer dominates

452
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,800
the North. The world

453
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,600
belongs to His Majesty only.

454
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,200
The North never belonged to anyone but to all the civilians.

455
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
That's not important.

456
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,300
Let them fight for it, which has nothing to do with us.

457
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,000
Come on, have a bite. Otherwise, it'll get cold and won't taste good anymore.

458
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
- Let me go.
- Try it. We'll talk about it later.

459
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,730
Jiuling, I'm your husband.

460
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,600
You should call me Yunqi.

461
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,600
You'll never win my heart in your life.

462
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,250
You make me feel disgusted.

463
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's all right. It's all right.

464
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,100
No matter what, I'm still your family. Right?

465
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I can protect you well.

466
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
- I'll always keep you safe.
- Get out.

467
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,600
Look at you. You've lost weight.

468
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Eat some.

469
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,000
I told you to get out!

470
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,200
Don't get angry.

471
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,600
By the way,

472
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,500
those at Jiuling Hall told people you returned to Zezhou, in order to protect you.

473
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,300
And Ning Yunzhao asked me today if he could come and see you.

474
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,800
Say, isn't that laughable?

475
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,400
I know Ning Yunzhao likes you.

476
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,000
Furthermore, he not only likes you as a person

477
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,300
but also likes this face of yours.

478
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,980
Through your appearance,

479
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,400
he can see your soul.

480
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:35,700
Those scholars are truly more capable than I am.

481
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Scram.

482
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,000
He's nowhere to be found?

483
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
Did he grow wings and fly away?

484
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,400
Your Majesty,

485
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Duke Cheng spent tens of years

486
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,200
making connections. This time

487
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,400
I don't know how many people covered him so he could escape.

488
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,800
Investigate it and see who helped him secretly.

489
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,400
Your Majesty, rest assured.

490
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,000
With Lord Lu here, it's only a matter of time before we arrest him.

491
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Your Majesty,

492
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,900
Duke Cheng was last seen near Malue Pass.

493
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,400
He should be heading to Baozhou.

494
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,500
The North? Does he still dare to go to the North?

495
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Isn't he throwing himself into the trap?

496
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:06,010
Your Majesty, I'm going to notify Marquis Qinghe.

497
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,600
[Sincere and Careful]

498
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,400
Lord Huang, you may leave.

499
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,000
Yes.

500
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,200
What's the status of the task I handed over to you?

501
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,000
Due to the division of De Shengchang,

502
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,600
Jun Jiuling has returned to Zezhou.

503
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,600
I have ordered Jin Shiba to go there.

504
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,000
The Fang family has failed and the Zhu family has collapsed.

505
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,200
This is a good opportunity.

506
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
We can't miss out on it anymore.

507
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
Yes.

508
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,800
Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

509
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,000
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

510
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,800
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

511
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,800
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

512
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,600
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

513
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:35,600
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

514
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,400
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

515
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,400
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

516
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,800
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

517
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,200
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

518
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,200
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

519
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,400
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

520
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,000
♫ If memories could speak ♫

521
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

522
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

523
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:44,580
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

524
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,400
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

525
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,400
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

526
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,800
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

527
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,200
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

528
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,200
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

529
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,600
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in
a deadlock with the sky ♫

530
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,000
♫ If memories could speak ♫

531
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

532
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,400
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

533
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,600
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

534
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,800
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

535
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,000
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

536
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,400
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

537
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,600
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

538
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:51,000
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
