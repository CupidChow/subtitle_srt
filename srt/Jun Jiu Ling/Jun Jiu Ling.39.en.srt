General, something bad happened in the Imperial Court.

General, please go back to the capital immediately.

Go back now?

I want to wait till the capital city is defeated before I go back.

General, if we face the battle alone,

50
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,870
there's bound to be many tragic deaths, General.

51

General, the nation cannot be governed by no one.

52

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,840
Really unexpected. Quick tell me! How it was guarded?

64
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,310
Zhu Zan killed the Northern Qi's emperor.

65
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,400
Additionally, Duke Cheng and Marquis Qinghe led their armies to rush to the rescue.

66
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,570
Northern Qi suffered a crushing defeat.

67
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,320
Zhu Shan committed the crime of conspiracy for treason.

68
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,700
This matter has long spread everywhere.

But now, he led people to the successful defense of the capital.

You tell me... What will my people think?

71
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,210
Your Majesty, the crime of conspiracy for treason was mentioned by Lord Huang.

72
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,690
The evidence was also presented by him.

73
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,430
You only trusted Lord Huang, that's all.

74
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,340
Furthermore, you also gave Duke Cheng a chance, and summoned him back to explain clearly.

75
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,050
Also, Duke Cheng insisted on not coming back, defying the imperial decree, then fled.

76
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,220
All these misunderstandings led to the current situation.

77
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,590
It was also not your responsibility.

78
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,510
And now Lord Huang is missing.

79
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,550
Maybe he has a guilty conscience, having the chance of leaving the city in disguise.

80
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,610
When in fact, he already escaped.

81
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,110
Huang Cheng is missing?

82
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,400
Yes.

83
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,180
If what you said is true,

84
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,200
that means I believed some villain's one-sided story

85
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,530
and wronged Duke Cheng. What a huge mistake!

86
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,590
I left the capital to avoid the war, which everyone knows.

87
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,570
Now the capital has survived it.

88
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,960
Tell me.

89

How should I go back?

90
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,190
Your Majesty, Physician Jun and Prince Xian explained to the public

91
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,160
that before Northern Qi surrounded the city, Your Majesty left to take the blame at the Imperial Mausoleum

92
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,490
to apologize to the ancestors for the hard times caused by the war between two nations.

93
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,050
Unexpectedly, before you returned to the capital, Northern Qi had surrounded the city.

94
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,180
You couldn't physically go back to the capital, but you've been spiritually with the capital.

Even the assassination carried out by Zhu Zan

96

and Duke Cheng and Marquis Qinghe's strategy to take the army back and defend the city

97
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,220
were Your Majesty's orders.

98
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,690
Did they really say that?

99
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,170
Yes.

100
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,740
Your Majesty, a nation can't go a day without an emperor. Since the capital is out of trouble,

101
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,680
they still need you to go back and take over the reins.

102
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,510
Everyone, get the guard of honor ready.

103
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,080
We'll get going early in the morning.

104
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,460

Tell me why Jun Jiuling did that.

108
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,930
I don't know what you mean, Your Majesty.

109
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,600
Prince Xian surely said it for my sake.

110
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,870
But Jun Jiuling said it.

111
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,500
Why?

112
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,460
Maybe she wants to beg for mercy for Duke Cheng.

113
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,090
No.

114
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,650
I'm starting to find

115
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,270
this woman to be not simple at all.

116
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,190
She let Prince Huai out.

117
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,570
What Prince Huai said on the streets

118
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,130
such as "I'm with you all."

119
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,570
and "Everyone's suffering because the Imperial Court didn't do well"

120
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,720
must've been taught by her.

121
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,610
Can't you tell?

122
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,810
It obviously alluded to me.

123
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,140
She could incite everyone in the capital

124
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,510
to guard the city with her.

125
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:45,270
Maybe she'll be able to incite everyone tomorrow

126
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,490
to do something else with her.

127
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,890
Kill her.

128
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,550
Lord Lu,

130
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,090
- did His Majesty want to have her killed?
- Yes.

131
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,870
- Did you say yes?
- I can't disobey His Majesty's orders.

132
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,140
- When are you going to do it?
- You can't help her.

133
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,430
What about both of us?

134
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,990
Ning Yunzhao, do you know what you're talking about?

135
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,780
I know very well.

136
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,920
Do you want to keep her alive no matter what?

137
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,470
The way you put it isn't wrong.

138
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,510
It's just a bit narrow. What I want

139
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,980
is just peaceful times with a sensible emperor and virtuous ministers.

140
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,010
I see.

141
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,160
Did you hide the Imperial Jade Seal for this reason?

142
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,930
Lord Lu, you guessed it a long time ago, didn't you? That's why you didn't tell on me?

143
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,900
Who is the sensible emperor to you?

144
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,510
The late emperor died of an illness. Prince Huai should've come to the throne.

145
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,690
This is the right way.

146
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,530
I understand.

147
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,570
When is His Majesty going to take action?

148
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,830

I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

163
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,140
You're not hurt, are you?

164
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,360
Did you get injured?

165
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,480
No, no.

166
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,710
Why is everyone here?

167
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,540
What happened to me?

168
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
It was tough for you to guard the city.

169
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,540
You were so stressed out that once you relaxed, your body couldn't take it anymore.

170
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,750
Sister Jun, you finally woke up.

171
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,780
Your Highness, you were very brave at the gate tower.

172
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,150
Because you encouraged me.

173
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,190
Thank you, Sister Jun, for protecting me at the gate tower.

174
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,460
You're welcome, Your Highness.

175
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,430
Physician Jun, you've done so much.

176
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,870
Why did you let His Majesty take all the credit?

177
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,780
If I hadn't done it, he wouldn't come back.

178
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,420
We should put an end to some things.

179
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,630
But everyone in the city has seen Jiurong.

180
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,860
I don't know what will happen when His Majesty comes back.

181
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,620
We could guard the capital because of your effort.

182
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,340
On behalf of the Chu family, I'd like to thank you.

183
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm also happy to be able to protect our home.

184
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,840
Lady Flower, Lady Grass,

185
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,560
Lady Rock, Lady Soil.

186
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,380
Which lady comes? Which lady goes?

187
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,780
Lady Flower, Lady Grass,

188
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,560
Lady Rock, Lady Soil. Which lady comes?

189
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,970
Jiuling, what are you doing?

190
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,200
- Sister, I'm looking for Lady Bug. Do you know what Lady Bug is?
- So dirty.

191
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,660
Here.

192
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,870
As a princess, you should behave like a princess.

193
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,330
See how dirty you are? Father will scold you if he sees it.

194
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,960
If I have to behave well every day, it'll be boring.

195
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,840
As a descendant of the imperial family, this is a rule you should follow.

196
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,150
Sister, I don't want to follow rules.

197
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,280
I want to go out for fun.

198
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,490
Jiuling, what did you say just now?

199
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,160
It sounded nice.

200
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,800
Why don't you say it to me again?

201
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,480
Sure.

202
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,990
Lady Flower, Lady Grass...

203
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,490
Lady Rock, Lady Soil.

204
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,300
Which lady comes? Which lady goes?

205
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,930
Which lady comes?

206
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,420
Which lady goes?

207
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,620
Lady Red, Lady White, Lady Yellow.

208
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,540
Sister, it's Lady Bug.

209
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,320
Jiuling, what's that?

210
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,590
It's Lady Bug, sister. Look.

211
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,680
- Jiuling, don't come to me.
- Sister. Sister, look!

212
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,240
Jiuling, don't come to me!

213
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,170
- Sister, don't be afraid!
- I don't like bugs.

214
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,460
Don't be afraid!

215
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,500
You are Ling'er?

216
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Sister.

217
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,100
Since that time you reprimanded me,

218
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,600
I did not play with Lady Bug ever again.

219
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,200
But...

220
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,100
But your appearance and voice, how did it become like this now?

221
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,130
It's a long story.

222
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
After all, if not for Master Jin and his daughter's help,

223
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,060
I probably wouldn't have been able to see you guys in this lifetime.

224
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,800
Rong'er, come here.

225
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,600
Second Older Sister, you came back.

226
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,380
Rong'er.

227
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
You finally came back.

228
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,300
Second Older Sister, is it really you?

229
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,900
Yes, it's me.

230
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,600
I came back.

231
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Second Sister.

232
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Rong'er, don't cry. Shouldn't we be smiling?

233
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
You say, you are still alive.

234
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,100
Why didn't you come forward earlier?

235
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,800
You married Lu Yunqi, it already put you in a tough situation.

236
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,000
How could I make it even worse for you?

237
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,700
Besides,

238
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,000
I already made Lu Yunqi suspect me because of the name Jiuling.

239
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,500
He has been watching me secretly.

240
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,800
So I couldn't show any flaws.

241
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,200
I actually was trying to find a chance

242
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
to tell you guys everything.

243
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,880
You suffered so much by yourself.

244
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,010
I feel so bad as an older sister.

245
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,200
So sorry.

246
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,000
We are a family,

247
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,100
so from now on,

248
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,200
don't take on so much by yourself.

249
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Everything, we will deal with it together.

250
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,300
All right?

251
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Yes, Older sister.

252
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,580
Jiuling, you will go to the palace tomorrow. Are you nervous?

253
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,700
I waited for so long,

254
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,000
finally waiting for this day for the truth to be revealed.

255
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,300
God is fair, you will get what you wish for.

256
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Chengyu came back with me,

257
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,700
but I was afraid he would get noticed going in and out of Jiuling Hall.

258
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,000
I let him stay at Yunxiao Pavilion.

259
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,500
How is he? Is he all right?

260
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,300
He is fine.

261
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,800
He became much more mature after going through so much.

262
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,000
After all those things,

263
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,500
everyone has matured so much.

264
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,190
I'm not the old Chu Jiuling anymore.

265
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,800
This is not a bad thing, this is growing up.

266
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,600
But you are still you, my Jiuling.

267
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,400
Nothing has changed.

268
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Assassinating the Northern Qi Emperor must have been dangerous?

269
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,500
Not dangerous.

270
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,200
I came and went freely, no injury at all.

271
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,100
Is that true?

272
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,800
To be able to protect the people's safety and wellbeing,

273
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,000
even if I die, I'd be willing. If it were you,

274
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,600
you would definitely feel the same.

275
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,540
If you take any risks in the future,

276
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,400
you have to remember that I'll always be worrying about you.

277
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Only these past few days when you weren't here, did I realize how much I missed you.

278
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
I realized how scared I am of losing you.

279
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,800
I kept wondering when I would hear from you.

280
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,400
When you would be able to return to my side, I imagined our reunion

281
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,800
hundreds of thousands of times. Every time, I told myself

282
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,500
if it really happened,

283
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,200
I want to hold your hand forever and never let go.

284
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,080
Jiuling,

285
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
do you know how much I missed you?

286
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,400
Every time you're not by me, I feel empty.

287
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
I don't even know what you're doing.

288
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I wondered what would happen if you were bored and no one was there to make you laugh.

289
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,500
I wondered what would happen if you got bullied and I wasn't there.

290
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,800
During the assassination of Northern Qi's Emperor,

291
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,000
my only will to survive was you.

292
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,100
Jiuling, I prepared a lot of things to say when I saw you,

293
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,600
but I don't know what to say.

294
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,600
♫ The art of healing becomes edges used to guard
the mountains and rivers ♫

295
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,000
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

296
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,200
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

297
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,000
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

298
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,400
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

299
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:35,800
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regard, waiting for dawn ♫

300
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,400
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

301
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,850
I love you.

302
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,140
I didn't hear you. Say it again.

303
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,200
I love you.

304
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,100
I didn't hear you. Say it again.

305
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,200
I love you, Jiuling!

306
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,000
Announcing, Duke Cheng, Zhu Shan, Marquis Qinghe

307
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,400
Duke Cheng's heir, Zhu Zan, Commandery Princess of Shanyang, Jun Jiuling

308
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,000
presenting themselves to His Majesty.

309
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,660
Greetings, Your Majesty!

310
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,300
Rise.

311
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,400
This battle caused Northern Qi to collapse and unable to recover.

312
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,300
It brings great satisfaction to all.

313
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,700
Duke Cheng, you've worked really hard and made significant contributions.

314
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,400
Also, Marquis Qinghe, the imperial court has a good general like you,

315
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,000
I‘m gratified.

316
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,000
Commandery Princess of Shanyang did a lot of things as well.

317
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,600
Very good. Clever, resolute, meticulous, phenomenal.

318
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,200
She is a role model for every girl.

319
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,200
I have decided to appoint you as Princess Shanyang.

320
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,600
Your Highness the Princess, quickly reply.

321
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,200
Thank His Majesty for His Grace.

322
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,600
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

323
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,600
My father's act of protecting the country,

324
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,400
is it sufficient enough to prove that father's crime of conspiracy for treason

325
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,000
was slander and that he was being framed?

326
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,700
Of course, I trust Duke Cheng.

327
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,400
But there are tens of thousands of people out there gossiping.

328
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,900
I need to present concrete evidence before I can appease the hearts of the common people.

329
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,800
There are also the army generals.

330
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,200
But Huang Cheng

331
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,200
seized the opportunity during the peace negotiation to escape.

332
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,500
As of today, we don't even know where he is.

333
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,400
Rest assured.

334
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,450
I have already asked people to arrest him.

335
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,900
When the arrest is completed,

336
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,100
I will get justice for Duke Cheng.

337
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,600
Duke Cheng,

338
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,700
but don't hold any grudges because of this.

339
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,600
I understand your intentions.

340
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,230
Princess Jiuli and Prince Huai came to present themselves.

341
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,100
We came here late. I seek Your Majesty's forgiveness.

342
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,190
You both did a great job guarding the city.

343
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,780
You're really the descendants of my imperial brother

344
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,030
and a glory to the Chu family.

345
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:15,340
Your Majesty, I'm flattered. How could we leave the city when faced with the enemy?

346
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,260
Prince Huai and I had to fight at all costs.

347
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,810
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

348
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,050
Go. Imperial Brother!

349
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,490
Imperial Brother. Go!

350
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,810
It's Grand Councilor Huang.

351
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,390
Kneel down.

352
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,510
Imperial Brother, you know what?

353
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,060
This man almost got killed by the Northern Qi people.

354
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,040
He told everyone outside the city

355
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,240
that he knew Yu Chihai and begged to see him.

356
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,300
But Northern Qi soldiers thought of him as a joke.

357
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,680
As they wielded their swords, my guards happened to arrive

358
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,450
and even saved this old man.

359
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:51,460
Your Majesty, I've been wronged! I've been wronged!

360
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,830
Huang Cheng, you dared to collude with the enemy and do the Imperial Court harm.

361
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,250
- Your Majesty, I–
- Shut up! Lock him up.

362
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,830
Hold on.

363
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,840
Your Majesty, Huang Cheng is already here in the palace.

364
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,470
I haven't proven myself innocent yet.

365
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:15,120
If we don't find out the truth at the Imperial Court,

366
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,730
I'm afraid it'll be hard for the Imperial Court and civilians to settle down. We can find out the truth and prove that I am innocent.

367
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,780
It's a way for the Imperial Court to convince people.

368
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,980
I've led thousands of soldiers to fight in the north several times.

369
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,970
Whether I have the intention to rebel and whether I reinforce my power,

370
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,610
soldiers will pass judgment on me.

371
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,680
If it's ignored, not only will I feel frustrated,

372
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,920
but thousands of soldiers will also feel the same.

373
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,020
Your Majesty's reputation and the nation's political stability

374
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,380
will be damaged as well. I seek an interrogation at the Imperial Court.

375
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,740
- I second it.
- I also second it.

376
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,090
- I second it.
- I second it.

377
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,800
- I second it.
- I also second it.

378
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,000
I also second it.

379
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,490
I second it.

380
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,120
Huang Cheng, let me ask you.

381
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,010
Did you make up a story and frame Duke Cheng

382
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,170
for treason?

383
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,370
Your Majesty,

384
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:29,500
I... It's all personal enmity between me and Duke Cheng.

385
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,970
His son, Zhu Zan, killed my son.

386
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,130
I could never let it go, so I took revenge on him.

387
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,520
- I hope Duke Cheng can understand.
- Ridiculous!

388
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,300
I can't believe you did it.

389
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,940
Let the Court of Judicial Review try him.

390
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,360
Imperial Brother, hold on. This old man colluded with the enemy and framed someone innocent.

391
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,500
According to the Imperial Court's law, he should be sentenced to death by a thousand cuts.

392
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,630
We should abide by the law. Imperial Brother, please make a decision.

393
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:15,090
Prince Xian just said that you colluded with the enemy.

394
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,280
Huang Cheng, do you admit it?

395
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,980
- Your Majesty, I've been wronged!
- Huang Cheng, you met Yu Chihai secretly

396
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,750
and defected to Northern Qi. Prince Xian's people saw it already.

397
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,540
How did I treat you?

398
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,460
I trusted you completely. Hand him over to the Ministry of Justice

399
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,380
and pick a day to execute him.

400
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,770
Execute him?

401
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,490
Your Majesty, how cruel you are.

402
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,840
Don't you remember what happened in the third year of Taiyan?

403
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,260
What happened?

404
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,770
What does it have to do with His Majesty?

405
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,300
- Lock him up!
- Hold on!

406
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,680
Huang Cheng, you just mentioned the third year of Taiyan.

407
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,100
What happened back then?

408
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,790
Keep talking.

409
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,650
Huang Cheng, what are you afraid of?

410
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,560
What happened in the third year of Taiyan? Can't everyone know about it?

411
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,910
Your Majesty, if my memory serves me right,

412
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,710
the only big event that happened in the third year of Taiyan

413
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,530
was that Northern Qi got a ransom and were ungrateful,

414
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,200
which caused the emperor emeritus and a number of princes to die.

415
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,790
Huang Cheng,

416
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,060
what happened in the third year of Taiyan?

417
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,220
Say it.

418
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:14,000
Are you too scared to say it because of someone in the palace?

419
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,810
Just say it. I'll help you.

420
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,200
Do you think you can stay alive by keeping quiet?

421
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,270
Whatever happened in the third year of Taiyan,

422
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,540
is there anything hidden behind it?

423
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,130
Say it!

424
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,970
Let me tell you what happened in the third year of Taiyan.

425
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,810
Your Majesty, are you wondering why I'm here?

426
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,570
If I had left a little later,

427
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,560
I would've really died

428
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,760
in the fire Your Majesty caused.

429
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,960
What? How dare you!

430
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,630
I, Fang Chengyu, came to show gratitude on behalf of the Fang family. I thank Your Majesty for your trust.

431
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,030
You gave the money to the Fang family in the third year of Taiyan.

432
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,130
After that, De Shengchang started being prosperous.

433
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,010
Nonsense!

434
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,750
Back then, I sent the money to Zezhou by myself.

435
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,870
This must be fake.

436
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,690
The third year of Taiyan. The palace treasury.

437
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,230
The silver isn't fake.

438
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,510
This is truly the only batch of silver forged by the Imperial Court in the third year of Taiyan,

439
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,840
and sent to Zezhou to get the emperor emeritus back.

440
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,510
It looks like Northern Qi killed the emperor emeritus,

441
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,170
not because they got the ransom and were treacherous,

442
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,970
but because the money didn't get sent to Zezhou at all!

443
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,010
