00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,540
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,620
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,870
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,900
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,820
[Episode 30]

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,680
Miss.

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,760
- There's a letter from the young lord.
- Where is he?

21
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,680
He's heading north. From the look of it, he's moving towards Duke Cheng.

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,470
Also, Hejian Prefecture delivered news that the peace treaty has been signed.

23
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,690
The soldiers and horses from Northern Qi will enter the three provinces soon.

24
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,160
All garrisons in the North are to be withdrawn immediately. Any violations of the decree...

25
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,670
will be punished as treason.

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,450
Treason?

27
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,750
Isn't this targeting Duke Cheng?

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,390
Miss, by the looks of it now,

29
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,790
many people may not be able to evacuate.

30
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,400
So that's what Duke Cheng is doing.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,880
Old Lei and General Li, let's continue north.

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,550
But, Miss, based on the map, once we pass three more towns,

33
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,080
we will be able to meet up with the wife of Duke Cheng.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,570
Let's continue north and change our route. Furthermore, secretly inquire the whereabouts of Duke Cheng and his heir apparent along the way.

35
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,920
You're thinking...

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm thinking we must not disappoint Duke Cheng.

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,090
He trapped himself in the North just to buy time to evacuate the people.

38
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,710
But with our limited soldiers and horses, we won't be able to help evacuate the people at all.

39
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,450
- Ensure you have an accurate count of the people. Go on.
- Yes, Sir!
[Benevolent Winds, Auspicious Clouds]

40
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,360
Lord Tian.

41
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,820
Madam Yu.

42
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,590
Most of the people of Bazhou have been brought back.

43
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,240
As of yesterday, 190,000 people have entered Hejian Prefecture.

44
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,080
We are still counting the people you have brought back today.

45
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,590
It has been tough for you. With the influx of so many people, it's a big burden to you.

46
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,430
Our burden is nothing.

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,640
Besides, Miss Jun and you have ordered

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,700
that we guide and disperse the people in advance so many of them have already gone south.

49
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,570
We can still manage here.

50
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,150
That's good.

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,350
Where's Miss Jun now?

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,320
Based on the schedule, she should be back.

53
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,180
Yizhou is in the North.

54
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,980
It's most likely that the child went to Yizhou.

55
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,840
Yizhou?

56
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,680
Isn't that the place Duke Cheng is currently trapped at from his surprise attack on the Northern Qi troops?

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,080
Yes.

58
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,850
The Northern Qi's great army hasn't crossed the border yet,

59
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,340
so Duke Cheng's power is still at work.

60
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,240
That means he and his troops are still there.

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,290
This child must have gone there alone to rescue them.

62
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,310
Madam, don't worry. I'll request the Imperial Court

63
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,060
send troops and reinforcement of Daming Prefecture to the North.

64
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,230
Thank you for your trouble, Lord Tian.

65
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,960
Madam, take a break. I shall go and count the people.

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
- You go on then.
- It has been tough for you.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,560
Madam.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,000
It's impossible that the Imperial Court will agree to Lord Tian's request.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,020
We already signed the peace treaty with Northern Qi. Yizhou is their territory now.

70
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,730
How could His Majesty possibly expand the war? What's more,

71
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,530
Daming Prefecture is under the control of the Earl of Qinghe.

72
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,550
He won't possibly agree to send out the troops, especially if it's for our Duke Cheng.

73
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,780
- Madam Yu.
- Madam.

74
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,480
Where is our young lady? Didn't she come back with you?

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,140
Did she not meet up with you?

76
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,130
She's worried about the refugees at the border and went to rescue them.

77
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,440
Don't worry too much.

78
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,300
Thank you, Madam Yu.

79
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,670
[Tianyou - Baozhou Border]

80
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,170
Second Brother,

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,430
thanks to Duke Cheng for taking the risk to gain more time,

82
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,070
we were able to evacuate the people safely.

83
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,900
Where are we going next?

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,300
Yizhou.

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,890
Yizhou is Northern Qi's territory now. There are tens of thousands of troops surrounding it.

86
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,580
It's impossible for the few of us to help Duke Cheng.

87
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,890
Why don't we go back to ask for reinforcements?

88
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,190
We escorted tens of thousands of people. The Imperial Court should pardon our crimes because of our good deeds.

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,020
They most likely will send reinforcements.

90
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,360
If there's a reinforcement troop, would today's situation exist?

91
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,930
Let's go. We must not delay reaching my father.

92
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,530
What were the casualities from last night's battle?

93
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,710
Duke Cheng,

94
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,700
there are 120 survivors in our right-wing troops.

95
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,030
This group of soldiers must be recorded in detail. We must remember them.

96
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,890
They used their lives to exchange for the hundreds of thousands of lives in the three counties.

97
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,720
How much longer can our provisions last?

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,780
Duke Cheng, it can last at most three days.

99
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,450
Let's rest for a day and think of a way to break through the siege.

100
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,860
Duke Cheng, we will absolutely follow your commands.

101
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,140
You all have followed me for decades.

102
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,100
For the people of Tianyou, you all must again—

103
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,950
Duke Cheng, for the people of Tianyou, what's there to fear about death?

104
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,360
What's there to fear about death?

105
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,060
Yesterday, Duke Cheng had a battle with Northern Qi and suffered heavy losses.

106
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,550
Yizhou is now besieged and in jeopardy.

107
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,610
There must be at least 10,000 Northern Qi soldiers to put Duke Cheng in such a dangerous situation.

108
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,500
Your judgment is right.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,660
Miss, why don't we do this?

110
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,930
You wait on the outskirts, and I will lead our men to kill our way through.

111
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,930
There's no other way at this time.

112
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,690
That's right. Worse comes to worst, we'll die. Miss,

113
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,680
we can't watch Duke Cheng and his army be annihilated.

114
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,290
What if the Northern Qi's military camp have a false impression of a smallpox outbreak?

115
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,950
Miss, what do you mean?

116
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,690
The plan now

117
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,280
is to make a dangerous move to disrupt the morale of the army.

118
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,090
Old Lei, find a few men who can be trusted. I will prescribe a dose of medicine.

119
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,470
After they consume it, they will have the same symptoms as the pox.

120
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,860
Then take them to Northern Qi's military camp and exchange them with their soldiers.

121
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,070
Let their military camp think they have a smallpox outbreak.

122
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,490
- What is going on? This...
- What's going on?

123
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,090
- Over here too!
- What do we do?

124
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,760
Duke Cheng, there's a sudden smallpox outbreak in Northern Qi's military camp. It's chaos over there now.

125
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,410
Smallpox?

126
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,280
- Is the news reliable?
- It is.

127
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,390
Duke Cheng, Heaven would never seal off all the exits.
 (T/N:There is always a way out.)

128
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,830
- Should we break out of the siege now?
- He's right, Duke Cheng.

129
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,450
Relay my orders. Gather our troops immediately and break out of the siege!

130
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,030
Yes, Sir!

131
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,880
I've already applied medicine to your wound. You mustn't let it come in contact with water for the next two days.

132
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,560
Miss Jun! Miss Jun! Duke Cheng has successfully broken out of the siege,

133
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,800
but he's been injured.

134
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,270
Where is he now? How serious are his injuries?

135
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,750
He suffered external wounds and is in his room resting now.

136
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,930
His Majesty repeatedly ordered to retreat.

137
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,450
Only Duke Cheng did not retreat.

138
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,330
Why is that?

139
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,950
- Why is that?
- This... This...

140
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,430
- Because Duke Cheng is concerned for the North.
- Nonsense!

141
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,440
He did it for his own sake.

142
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,450
Once he retreats and there's peace,

143
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,050
how is Duke Cheng going to continue making a show of his authority in the North?

144
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,280
Everyone, let me tell you. The person who loves being in war most

145
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,690
is he, Duke Cheng!

146
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,210
- How can he say that?
- It can't be true.

147
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,290
It's already the third month, the height of springtime.

148
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,560
But why does one's heart still feel chilled to the core?

149
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,080
That is why Duke Cheng must have

150
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,720
purposefully gone to Yizhou

151
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,020
with the goal of disturbing the peace!

152
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,080
- He's deliberately insulting Duke Cheng.
- Precisely!

153
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,750
- Who did that?!
- Exactly.

154
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,990
What are you doing?

155
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,110
- Why are you slandering Duke Cheng?
- Duke Cheng put the nation in peril and caused the people to suffer!

156
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,450
You are not allowed to disrespect Duke Cheng!

157
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,500
We would not have been able to stay alive and come to the capital if not for Duke Cheng,

158
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,940
yet you claim Duke Cheng put the nation in peril and caused the people to suffer.

159
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,030
You're spouting nonsense. Spouting nonsense!

160
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,970
You're spouting nonsense. Spouting nonse!

161
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,320
Duke Cheng clearly went to Yizhou to fight against Northern Qi.

162
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,050
He did not hesitate to put his life in danger for us.

163
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,920
The wife of Duke Cheng and their Heir Apparent's wife distributed porridge during the entire journey

164
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,210
and even told people not to shut their doors on us.

165
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,490
You've all been living well and comfortably!

166
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,510
You don't know the hardships of those who live in the North.

167
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,750
Yet you're slandering people like this!

168
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,520
- He's really gone overboard.
- That's right!

169
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,980
Urgent report! Urgent report!

170
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,560
Duke Cheng has escaped danger in Yizhou and has obtained great victory!

171
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,820
- Wonderful!
- Outstanding!

172
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,840
Get down from there, you!

173
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,960
Spring is coming after all.

174
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,910
- The weather won't be cold much longer.
- The people in the capital have not seen

175
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,610
what Duke Cheng has done,

176
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,720
but all the Northerners have all certainly witnessed it.

177
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,340
It is as Miss Jun said, justice does exist in Heaven and on Earth.

178
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,870
She's finally going to return.

179
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,710
[Baimang City Local Government]

180
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,100
Stop right there! Who are you?

181
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,290
- How dare you barge into the government building!
- He is Duke Cheng's Heir Apparent.

182
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,050
You're the Heir Apparent? I have eye sockets yet no eyeballs.
(T/N: I was blind.)

183
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,460
- My apologies for not recognising you, Young Lord.
- Where is my father?

184
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,430
Duke Cheng was injured and is recuperating now. He's prohibited from seeing anyone unless his physician permits.

185
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,930
Duke Cheng's Madam is currently distributing porridge at the temple of the City God.

186
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,940
Your wife is available though. I will notify her immediately.

187
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,070
Where is she? I'll go and look for her myself.

188
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,920
She's in the second chamber on the left side of the rear courtyard.

189
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,270
- I sense an impending foul wind and a rain of blood.
- What do you mean?

190
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,120
It doesn't matter who she is. This "Heir Apparent's wife" is in a lot of trouble.

191
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,150
You have a point.

192
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,810
My wife, I have returned!

193
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,800
I wonder if you've seen my letter.

194
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,030
I won't ask how you became the Heir Apparent's wife,

195
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,310
for the time being.

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,530
I just want to say that I admire what you've done very much.

197
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,960
However, I am unable to comply with this marriage much to my embarrassment.

198
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,890
I will notify my parents and let them explain everything.

199
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Also, to prevent your innocent reputation from being ruined.

Why is it you?

203
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,750
So, were you hoping it would be me?

204
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,540
Yes! Yes, I was.

205
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,550
How is my father's injury?

206
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,020
Don't worry, Duke Cheng is all right now. He will be fine after resting for a few days.

No matter what,

210
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,100
I must thank you on behalf of my father and the people of the three counties.

You.

214
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,660
Why did you run all the way to the North after resolving the issue with the inoculations?

215
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,620
So dangerous.

216
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,750
It wasn't dangerous at all.

217
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,560
Didn't I have Master Lei and the others protecting me?

218
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,990
Nothing happened to me at all.

219
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,240
Then... the Martial Moral Ministry was watching you closely,

220
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,130
and I didn't receive any news about you.

221
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,690
How was I supposed to know if you were in trouble or not?

222

00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,650
So, what's this about you being the Heir Apparent's wife?

225
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,570
Do my parents not know who you are?

226
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,230
It was never mentioned in the letters.

227
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,540
How could they not know who I am?

228
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,060
It's just... I don't know why

229
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,410
they didn't tell you either.

230
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,560
So are you delighted to see me?

231
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,470
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

232
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,050
I am very delighted.

233
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm not used to seeing you so serious.

234
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,030
I've always been this serious, didn't you know?

235
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,640
All right.

236
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,450
Enough. Duke Cheng is just next door, so you'd better go and visit him.

237
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,740
I won't intrude on the both of you.

238
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,540
- All right.
- Go.

239
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,490
Father!

240
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,950
Your injury...

241
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,580
Zan'er.

242
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,050
You've returned.

243
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,370
My injury is not serious. It's only a small wound.

244
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,430
Miss Jun has taken very good care of me.

245
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,310
Here.

246
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,090
Father, you've... aged so much.

247
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,190
I'm glad you've returned.

248
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,300
Go get some wine!

249
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,640
Today, you and I shall drink well.

250
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,310
Sure.

251
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,460
Father.

252
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,120
I haven't had a good drink in a long time.

253
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,050
Today, we father and son will drink to our hearts' content.

254
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,680
Here.

255
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,260
Zan'er?

256
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:07,340
Father, this cup is for those soldiers who have passed away.

257
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,840
They should be venerated.

258
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,410
They were willing to sacrifice themselves for their nation.

259
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,080
They should be remembered.

260
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,810
They should be admired by all of our people.

261
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,230
Father, I was a bad son in the past...

262
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,270
and caused you to worry.

263
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,130
Zan'er,

264
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,710
in my heart,

265
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,450
you have always been the pride and joy of your mother and me.

266
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,650
You entered the capital by yourself and resolutely showed up on the battlefield.

267
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,770
Your mother and I are both aware.

268
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,470
You did extremely well. You're indeed my son.

269
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,420
Father, I have neglected my obligations

270
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,410
by failing to go into battle with you. I have returned now.

271
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,720
I won't let you become injured again,

272
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,860
or let Mother have any reason to be worried and afraid.

273
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,820
Father, thank you.

274
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,700
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

275
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,630
Zan'er,

276
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,010
you have grown up.

277
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,100
As I said,

278
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,150
we shall rest and get drunk today.

279
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,130
- All right.
- Here.

280
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,190
Another one.

281
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,190
Here.

282
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,230
Your Majesty, the return of the people to the three counties displayed your saintly prestige.

283
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,830
In addition, Northern Qi's army has been seriously wounded,

284
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,510
so they should be more passive now.

285
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,020
Duke Cheng will enter the capital soon

286
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,070
to receive his rewards.

287
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,720
Huang Cheng said we can use this opportunity

288
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,500
to let Earl of Qinghe temporarily

289
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,400
act as the guardian of the North. What do you think?

290
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,780
I think this is a good strategy.

291
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,690
What happened with Zhu Zan?

292
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,110
Your Majesty, Zhu Zan is not alone.

293
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,400
With him is a group of highly skilled martial art experts.

294
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,690
Also, after he returned to the North,

295
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,240
he encouraged the governor of Baozhou to lead the army to save the people.

296
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,870
There were many people around, so I...

297
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,840
found it hard to take action.

298
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,040
Regarding them, father and son, returning to the capital,

299
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,780
let Huang Cheng take care of it.

300
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,100
Yes.

301
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,520
Jun!

302
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,240
Why are you so drunk?

303
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,890
Let's go...

304
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,610
over there first. Let's first sit there.

305
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,810
How come you've fallen into the water?

306
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,840
I'm here to save you!

307
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,710
You are so drunk.

308
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,760
Quickly, quickly! Sit over here.

309
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,290
Get up. Hurry and sit there.

310
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,110
Why are you sinking?

311
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,110
Sit down right now.

312
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,970
Quick.

313
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,280
- Wine.
- Wine.

314
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,060
Pour the wine. The wine.

315
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm pouring the wine. I'm pouring the wine.

316
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,060
Here.

317
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,850
Am I handsome?

318
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,380
Too handsome.

319
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,800
You have good taste.

320
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,500
Let's drink another cup. All right.

321
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,010
Here, drink another cup.

322
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,430
W-What's wrong?

323
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,530
Why do you...

324
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,190
look so much like her?

325
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,620
Hury and drink the wine.

326
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,080
I will pour some more for you.

327
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm going to sleep now.

328
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,030
You are not sleeping here.

329
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,500
Zhu Zan, you...

330
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,340
You're over there. Wait.

331
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,180
You're over there. You—

332
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,550
Bed.

333
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,530
Zhu Zan, g-get up.

334
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,980
What that Jiuling...

335
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,310
owes you....

336
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,270
will be repaid by that Jiuling.

337
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,730
What that Jiuling doesn't owe you,

338
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,980
I will compensate instead.

339
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,240
You are drunk.

340
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,730
Come.

341
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,910
Hurry and get up.

342
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,830
Jiuling.

343
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,090
- Jiuling.
- Madam.

344
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,370
Zhu Zan, hurry and get up.

345
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,670
Madam, it's not what you think! Madam!

346
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,820
Jiuling, I didn't see anything.
- Ma—

347
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,140
I left the snacks on the table. Remember to eat them.

348
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,410
Zhu Zan.

349
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,880
Zhu—

350
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,560
Zhu Zan.

351
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,820
Jiuling.

352
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,380
You're awake?

353
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,690
Jun...

354
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,700
Jun...

355
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,210
W-What am I doing in your room again?

356
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,900
You have to ask yourself that.

357
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,190
You didn't take advantage of me, right?

358
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,740
It's not entirely sure who took advantage of whom.

359
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,550
So that's what happened.

360
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,910
While I was drunk, you took the chance

361
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,950
"to cook the rice."
 (T/N: to do something which can't be undone)

362
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:54,460
Then, your fake identity as the Heir Apparent's wife

363
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,870
becomes real.

364
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,680
Dream on.

365
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,130
Here.

366
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,440
Earlier I decocted some hangover soup for you.

367
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,660
Hurry and drink it. Quickly.

368
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,620
By the way,

369
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,350
Duke Cheng Madam may have seen.

370
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,480
What?

371
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,510
What else did she see?

372
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,790
She saw everything.

373
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,200
The young madam who escorted the people of the three counties back

374
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,500
turns out to be Physician Jun.

375
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,200
Thinking about it, that is not strange at all.

376
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,400
Physician Jun would never just watch the people suffer.

377
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,600
Or else, would she be able to do things like creating inoculations

378
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,400
to save the world and its people?

379
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,000
Save the world and its people? That's an exaggeration, right?

380
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,800
Everyone has his own selfish goals.

381
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Even if she has other thoughts,

382
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,900
what she has done has benefited everyone.

383
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,100
Then it is good work.

384
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,400
Physician Jun and the Duke's Heir Apparent are indeed well matched.

385
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,200
Execellent.

386
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,200
Mere excuses under dire circumstances.

387
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,800
Regardless if it's true or false,

388
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,700
her identity now is the Heir Apparent's wife.

389
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,400
Looks like you do not really understand me, Princess.

390
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,200
What is it to me whether it is true or false?

391
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,500
Lu Yunqi, is there any meaning in deluding yourself like this?

392
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,600
Then, what is the meaning of your existence?

393
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,800
My entire life is as is.

394
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Being able to see the people around me be happy is the meaning of my existence.

395
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,300
Well, that's not me.

396
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,800
The meaning of my existence is to control everything I deem beautiful.

397
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,600
My Lord.

398
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,000
News from the North says Miss Jun is at Baimang City.

399
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
Do you want our men there to make a move?

400
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
No need.

401
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,700
Didn't she do so much in order to come back?

402
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,410
Your Majesty is summoning you back to the capital?

403
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,000
Having such serious events happen,

404
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
it's only natural that your father needs to report back.

405
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,100
If it's just a simple report,

406
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,600
then why is Earl of Qinghe taking the place of the Grand Marshal in leading the troops?

407
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,340
Since it's a royal decree, then we shall follow.

408
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Father, you can't go back.

409
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Only with an army, do you have power. Without an army, you have no power.

410
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,200
Isn't it like a tiger without teeth?

411
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,220
But what else can we do if we don't return?

412
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,200
This must be the work of that Huang Cheng.

413
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,400
Maybe this is not bad news.

414
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,200
What do you mean?

415
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,400
After His Majesty found out that Duke Cheng survived the calamity,

416
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
he cried tears of joy right there in court.

417
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,600
He said Duke Cheng was brave and that the nation having a great general such as you,

418
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,000
was the fortune of the nation and people. Thus, you must be properly rewarded.

419
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,400
From the looks of it, Your Majesty will not slap his own face.
(T/N: slap face mean go back on one's words)

420
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,600
On the contrary, it proves that Duke Cheng is safe for now.

421
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,400
His Majesty is still like this after so many years.

422
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,500
He still lies to the people like this, but who knows what he's done behind—

423
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,200
Zan'er.

424
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,040
It's been so many years now.

425
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,600
I also want go back and take a look.

426
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,800
See His Majesty, see the capital.

427
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,000
Fine. It's unavoidable.

428
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,440
Since we can't avoid returning to the capital,

429
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,300
let's devise a good plan.

430
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,600
Duke Cheng has been in the North for many years, and he is open and honest.

431
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,800
However, that Huang Cheng has been laying in ambush in the capital for a very long time,

432
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,800
so he has advantages in all areas.

433
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Therefore Duke Cheng, if the young lord and I return first to the capital to make arrangements,

434
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,900
and you and the Madam can follow with the army, what do you think?

435
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,800
This plan will work.

436
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,600
If Huang Cheng takes any devious actions, we can find out in advance in order to foil his plans.

437
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,300
It's better than to receive blows in the back.

438
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,600
In addition, there's another matter that I made, a decision for myself.

439
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,000
I hope Duke Cheng and Madam will forgive me.

440
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,700
What is it?

441
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,200
Various branches of De Shengchang reported that

442
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,000
there are still many refugees wandering the three counties.

443
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,200
Therefore, I have privately arranged for

444
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,200
the refugees to accompany Duke Cheng to the capital.

445
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,800
I think we should let the imperial court see as well as the citizens of the capital see

446
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,800
these are also the people of Tianyou. Why must they suffer homelessness?

447
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,800
These are the people that the Northern soldiers risked their lives to save.

448
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,600
Without the lands of the three counties, where would the people come from?

449
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,800
Without the people, how is there Tianyou?

450
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Well said.

451
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,600
Then we shall trouble you, Miss Jun.

452
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,200
- Mother.
- Zan'er.

453
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Come, sit.

454
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,600
All right.

455
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,370
Our son has really grown up.

456
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,400
Then... you didn't call me over just to praise me, right?

457
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,600
I want to say that the events in the capital involving you and Miss Jun,

458
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
I've heard about some of them.

459
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,900
Mother, what is heard may not be the facts.

460
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,500
It's hard to explain all those matters.

461
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:01,230
I was thinking that this time when we go into the capital,

462
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,000
I am worried that you might have some regrets.

463
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I know the matter that you have kept hidden in your heart all these years.

464
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,600
But you didn't have a marriage arrangement with Princess Jiuling.

465
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,800
Now that the two of you are separated by Heaven and Earth,

466
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,470
it's truly a twist of fate.

467
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,400
If in Heaven, she knows of the feelings you have for her,

468
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
she will surely be comforted.

469
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,000
But feelings cannot become shackles.

470
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We need to look forward in life.

471
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,400
- Mother...
- Listen to everything I have to say.

472
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,400
In regards to your feelings for Miss Jun,

473
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,200
I can see them.

474
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Miss Jun is adept in both pen and sword. Even I am in great admiration.

475
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,000
Zan'er, being able to meet is fate.

476
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You must understand how to appreciate the people in front of you.

477
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,400
Mother, I have another matter to discuss.

478
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
The matter regarding my wife, by chance,

479
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,800
has become widespread.

480
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,500
It now affects her innocent reputation.

481
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,900
Mother, I also want to be an upstanding man.

482
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,200
Therefore, in front of everyone, I want

483
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,600
to clarify this misunderstanding in order to return to her an innocent reputation.

484
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,200

485
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,400
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

486
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,200
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

487
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,200
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

488
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,100
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

489
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:21,000
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

490
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,900
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

491
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:33,000
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

492
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,200
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

493
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,600
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

494
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

495
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,000
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

496
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,600
♫ If memories could speak ♫

497
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,400
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

498
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,000
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

499
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:30,000
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

500
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

501
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,800
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

502
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,200
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

503
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,700
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

504
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,600
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

505
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,000
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

506
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,400
♫ If memories could speak ♫

507
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,400
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

508
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,800
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

509
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,000
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

510
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,200
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

511
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,600
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

512
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,800
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

513
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,000
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

514
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
