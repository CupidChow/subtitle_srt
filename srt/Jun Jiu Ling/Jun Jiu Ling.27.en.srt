- Jiuling?
- Chengyu.

20
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,570
You're back finally!

21
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,980
All right, all right, all right.

22
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,690
I haven't seen you for so long, you've gotten much thinner.

23
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,470
I haven't seen you for so long, our Chengyu has become a fine-looking man.

24
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,870
Won't the family be worried that you came such a long away here?

25
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,090
Not at all! I had to come and pick you up, no matter how far it was.

26
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,660
As for you, you must be very tired after walking such a long distance.

27
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,130
- Miss!
- Miss! Young Master.

28
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,570
How come you all arrived together?

29
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,520
Miss, you should know that Young Master went all the way to pick you up.

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,950
However, he didn't expect us to go separate ways.

31
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right. Young Master even brought plums for you that are very sweet,

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,650
but I ate them all.

33
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,560
Young Master Fang, he looked so happy when he first saw us.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,090
But when he found out it was only me and Chen Qi, his face changed instantly.

35
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,110
It looked like an iceberg; emotionless.

36
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,410
Liu'er, why don't you go out first?

37
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,050
- I still have a lot of things to talk to Jiuling about.
- All right, all right.

38
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,130
- Miss, then we will go tidy up first.
- Go on.

39
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,750
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,600
There are lots of things I want to ask you.

42
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Ask away.

43
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,050
After being in the capital for so long and doing so many good deeds,

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,180
aren't you very tired?

45
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,170
Is there anything that can be accomplished easily?

46
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,450
Besides, if you are to go out there, then you must not be afraid of hardships.

47
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,240
That's true. But you did very well and were outstanding.

48
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,920
By the way, I did something without consulting you first.

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,230
Don't blame me.

50
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,300
What is it?

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,520
It's like this. You coming back has made me

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,420
and the family happy. I'm sure everyone in Zezhou is happy!

53
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,780
Hence, I sent someone to inform everyone in advance

54
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,670
that you're back.

55
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,820

We haven't seen each other in so long.

Our Lady Jiuling has become more and more attractive.

62

You were originally a beauty to start with so now, you're even more beautiful.

How is Jinxiu in the capital?

Old Madam, Jinxiu has been living very freely and happily in the capital.

00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,580
Moreover, with her skills, she's naturally taking care of Jiuling Hall very well.

- Is that so?
- Jinxiu has returned to her "eldest young lady" demeanor again.

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,440
but she refused.

Your mother has always had a good temperament.

I don't know what has gotten into her this time.

It's my fault for being rash.

It's natural that Mother is angry.

86
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,640
However, I think that your liking her

87
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,700
is a good thing.

Father, do you also think she is a great girl?

89
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,980
A miraculous matter such as inoculation is something that will be recorded in the history records.

90
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,920
Think about it. Ning-Jun clan,

how glorious would that be?

It turns out what Father means is that.

93
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,260
However, written in the history records should be Jiuling Hall.

94
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,020
It should be Jiuling Hall of the Ning-Jun clan.

It's just that, Father, the marriage contract has been terminated already.

At the end of the day, the marriage is fake.

97

The marriage is fake,

98
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,640
but your heart is true, isn't it?

99
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,630
I have confessed my feelings to Miss Jun once.

100
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,670
However, she rejected me.

101
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,970
Are you going to give up just like that?

102

Second Brother, this Ministry of Livestock is managed by Huang Cheng's people.

103
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,560
You must have suffered a lot here, haven't you?

104
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,900
This is far better than the North.

105

How has it been going at the bookstore? Does Huang Cheng still meet with that mysterious man?

106
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,780
Huang Cheng hasn't gone back to that bookstore since.

107
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,050
However, we found the owner behind the bookstore.

108
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,120
It's that scholar named Zhang Siming.

109
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,130
We suspect...

110
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,270
We suspect that this person is most likely the spy whom Northern Qi has placed in the capital.

111
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,900
We were there for two days but only saw the workers of the bookstore.

112
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,300
The person behind the scenes never showed up.

113

- If there is any movement, report to me immediately.
- All right.

Rest assured.

119
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,260
You must not let her fall into Lu Yunqi's hands.

120
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,640
There are many people here, so you should leave first.

121

Steward Gao, I've finished reading all the account books today, is there anything else?

Other account books haven't been delivered yet.

Young Master, you've been busy all morning, why don't you go back to rest for a bit?

127
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,990
I'll send those account books to the residence in the afternoon.

That's fine, too. Once Santao is back, I'll head home.

Where did he go?

I asked him to buy something for me.

Young Master! Young Master, I've bought it.

- Give it to me!

- Be careful, it may burn you.
- It won't taste good after it's cooled.

135
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,800
You said that you didn't plan to leave the capital. Why did you come back so suddenly?

136
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,100
Is it because of Lu Yunqi?

You can say that.

But it is not just because of him.

I have heard of your great name long ago, but I just haven't had the chance to meet you.

Miss Jun has already thanked me.

Jiuling thanking you is her showing you her own appreciation.

I naturally should thank you as well.

By the way, I told you before

153
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
about a newly opened stall. Their buns are especially good.

154
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,400
Here, eat it while it's hot. It'll get cold soon.

Here, you eat one.

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
Jiuling and I can just share one.

158
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,500
Here, Jiuling.

159
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,400
All right.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Young Master Ning, do you want to have a meal before leaving?

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,200
That wouldn't hold you up, will it?

162
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,500
No, it's fine. I came to specifically ask about something.

163
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
I will return after asking.

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,400
Ask about something? What is it?

165
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,100
He asked me already. It's about my sudden return.

166
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
So you're done asking.

167
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,000
Young Master Ning, you don't have to worry.

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,400
The marriage was not able to stop Lu Yunqi,

169
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
but we won't be afraid of him.

170
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,300
That's right. We won't be afraid of him.

171
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,000
Moreover, we'll return to the capital, too.

172
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Then how about we return to the capital together in a few days?

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you thinking of seeking revenge for my injustice for me?

174
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,990
He won't give up, so why should we endure the insult without protest?

175
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,400
Young Master Ning, can you really return to the capital in a few days?

176
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,200
Your mother is still ill, right? If you leave in such a hurry,

177
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,600
would the Imperial Censorate impeach you for being unfilial?

178
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
I don't understand anything, I'm just speaking randomly.

179
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,100
What Chengyu said is reasonable.

180
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,000
After all, your period of visitation to your elders is not over yet.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If you return to the capital in a hurry, people may talk.

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,500
Then again, us being tied together

183
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,800
is something that many people don't like.

184
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,900
- I've implicated you.
- Miss Jun—

185
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,400
Young Master Ning, if you want to return to the capital soon,

186
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,500
I'm afraid you need to first cure your mother of her illness of the heart.

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,300
I think...

188
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,400
I think our marriage arrangement

189
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,000
should be called off as soon as possible. That will be better for you.

190
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,200
That would be worse. My mother is ill.

191
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,800
If we call off the marriage, I'm afraid people will say I am unfilial

192
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
and... bring up the Ning family's past.

193
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,400
After all is said, it is our Ning family's debt to Miss Jun.

194
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,700
I must continue to inconvenience you.

195
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,250
Young Master Ning, you helped me first.

196
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,790
I should be the one thanking you.

197
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Then, I will take my leave.

198
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,600
- Jiuling.
- Chengyu.

199
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,050
Do you think I can't tell what your intentions were?

200
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
I just don't like him

201
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
The Ning family treated you so poorly before.

202
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
That matter with the Ning family is in the past now.

203
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Besides, regarding the marriage,

204
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Young Master Ning has been helping me.

205
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,000
You shouldn't be like that.

206
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,400
I know. I won't do that again.

207
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,400
Hurry and eat.

208
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
All right. Let's hurry and eat.

209
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,400
Here, you eat more.

210
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,800
Young Master, you're saying that Young Master Fang doesn't like you?

211
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,000
There are some things that we don't need to think too much about. There is no reason he should like me.

212
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,300
Is it because of the marriage being called off?

213
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,200
How long has it been since that matter? Does he still hold a grudge for that?

214
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,600
That's not it.

215
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,100
Then, what is the reason?

216
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,700
Because Young Master Fang likes her, too.

[Ning Residence]

219
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,000
How is the matter as simple as you think?

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Besides Miss Jun, there is also the Fang family.

221
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,500
Moreover,

222
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,900
at that time, Old Madam Fang was so angered by Mother that she fell ill.

223
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,400
That's true.

224
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,600
Let's do this. Make arrangements to meet with Miss Jun and the Fang family.

225
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,800
I will go with you.

226
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Father, that is not appropriate, is it?

227
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
Why is it not appropriate?

228
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,210
It's just two families with a marriage arrangement meeting to eat and talk.

229
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,800
I will write a letter and send it over.

230
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,600
We'll meet tomorrow at noon at the Shunde Restaurant.

231
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,200
- Father.
- It's settled.

232
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,600
Jiuling. Jiuling, a letter for you.

233
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,500
A letter for me?

234
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,100
It's from Jinxiu. Zhu Zan was released from prison.

235
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,400
He's self-reflecting at the Ministry of Livestock. Looks like Lu Yunqi didn't break his promise.

236
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
What is it? Did something happen at the capital?

237
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,500
It's not the capital. It's the Southwestern Hebei region.

238
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,700
Over a dozen children died because of the inoculation.

239
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,400
In addition, Northern Qi has increased the number of troops at the border.

240
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
How many invaders are there?

241
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Tens of thousands of soldiers and horses. They're Northern Qi's cavalry.

242
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,800
Then it's not a skirmish, but sending troops to battle.

243
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,400
Thinking about it, the North has been stable for less than a decade.

244
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,100
Let's hope Duke Cheng can overcome this crisis.

245
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,000
- Chengyu.
- Yes?

246
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
I want to go to the Southwestern Hebei region.

247
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,700
Go to He... Are you crazy?

248
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,000
Jiuling, that place is very close to Northern Qi and is very dangerous!

249
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Duke Cheng is leading soldiers to resist the enemy now.

250
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I can't let him get distracted because of the inoculation deaths.

251
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,200
Could it be that something went wrong with the inoculation?

252
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,600
I don't know. That's why I need to go there to take a look.

253
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Fine.

254
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,200
I will make preparations for you.

255
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
The Northern lands aren't stable, I'll send some more people with you.

256
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
All right.

257
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,800
- Miss!
- Young Master.

258
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
Old Madam is asking you to go see her.

259
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,800
The Ning family sent a letter asking to meet at Shunde Restaurant to discuss the marriage.

260
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,600
- Discuss the marriage?
- Yes.

261
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,300
Elder Sister.

262
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,800
Are you tired?

263
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,000
I brought the pastries you normally like to eat.

264
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm not tired. I'm fine.

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,400
You're able to keep working? Do you know where she went?

266
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
I know. Shunde Restaurant.

267
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Every day, you follow her, you're like her shadow.

268
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Today, both Grandmother and Mother went.

269
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,500
Why didn't you go with them?

270
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,600
In their letter,

271
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,800
they only said they want to meet with Grandmother, Mother, and Jiuling.

272
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,600
I can't shamelessly go there, can I?

273
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,330
Do you want to go?

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,400
I do. Of course, I do.

275
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,100
In fact, I really want to go.

276
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,400
As long as you say it, Jiuling would definitely agree to let you go.

277
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,000
But if you want to continue to act like a good younger brother,

278
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,200
then you can only always be a younger brother.

279
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
But if I don't act like that,

280
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm afraid I can't even be her younger brother.

281
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Your guests are here.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Old Madam.

283
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm honored that you came as promised.

284
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
I didn't expect Master Ning to be here in person.

285
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,800
It's not easy to meet you.

286
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
It was a pity I couldn't see you last year when I visited your home.

287
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
It's was all my wife's fault for not knowing etiquette and being inhospitable.

288
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,400
She has a cold today, and it is not convenient for her to go out.

289
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
So, I am apologizing to you on her behalf.

290
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,600
Young Master Ning is your wife's beloved son, so I can understand.

291
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Is Young Master Ning coming today?

292
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,200
There are some things that I, as his father, should first clarify on his behalf.

293
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,200
It's not too late for him to come after that. What do you think?

294
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,800
Master Ning, you and I are thinking the same.

295
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,400
We are a family so let's not be too formal.

296
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,500
Let's go inside to sit and take our time talking.

297
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,500
Master Ning is meeting with Grandmother today about the marriage arrangement, right?

298
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,900
Yes.

299
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,200
That's good. The elders have their own thoughts.

300
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,800
If they can use this opportunity to clear the air, then that's a good thing.

301
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,200
This was originally a matter between the two of us.

302
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,800
In the end, it will require the two of us to resolve it.

303
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,280
Actually, there's another matter I wanted to see you about today.

304
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,080
What is the matter?

305
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,830
To say farewell to you.

306
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,680
Farewell?

307
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,040
Old Madam, please have some tea.

308
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,890
Madam, please.

309
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,360
Then I shall be forthright.

310
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,450
Before Yunzhao returns to the capital,

311
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,970
let our two families settle the marriage arrangements.

312
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,840
In-laws, what do you think?

313
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,150
It's a bit early to be calling us "in-law."

314
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,470
If others were to think that this was true, then what should we do?

315
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,850
True or not, isn't that up to us to decide?

316
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,370
Since it's a farewell, the place that Miss Jun is going to is probably not the capital, right?

317
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,340
It's the North. Have you heard that Northern Qi has sent more soldiers?

318
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,160
- I didn't know. Why have they sent troops so suddenly?
- A battle is unavoidable.

319
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,060
Also, something has gone wrong with the inoculations in Southwestern Hebei.

320
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,820
Looks like the world will be in chaos again.

321
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,910
Therefore, I need to go north to investigate the inoculation matter.

322
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,450
I can't allow a pox outbreak to happen again.

323
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,290
When the people are stable, the army can then be stable.

324
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,130
When the army is stable, the country can then be safe.

325
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,780
The road ahead is full of twists and turns. For Miss Jun's bravery,

326
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,070
I salute you with tea in place of wine for your concern for our people and country.

327
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,480
I also wish you a safe journey.

328
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,910
Jiuling has been conferred by His Majesty as Commandery Princess Shanyang.

329
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,570
Even though I am the elder, it is still inappropriate for me to make the decision alone.

330
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,760
The Ning Family is of scholarly background.

331
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,600
Yunzhao is also the newly appointed first-ranked scholar.

332
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,810
This is a perfectly matched marriage.

333
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,060
Being the first-ranked scholar is indeed glorious.

334
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,230
However, it's better to choose a husband based on mutual liking.

335
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,310
Miss Jun and Yunzhao see each other often in the capital.

336
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,220
The two must have mutual feelings.

337
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,620
According to what I know, it's Young Master Ning who has sincerity.

338
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,140
Jiuling, that child, keeps a far distance from him though.

339
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,200
She already said that since the marriage arrangement has been called off,

340
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,510
there should be a clean break.

341
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,090
That... about calling off the marriage arrangement previously,

342
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,910
Yunzhao was not aware of the matter.

343
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,530
However, Yunzhao has expressed his feeling towards today's meeting.

344
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,180
Please consider it well, Old Madam.

345
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,410
To be frank,

346
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,020
- this marriage arrangement...
- Let's not rush to discuss the marriage arrangement today.

347
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,630
My Lord, on such an important day,

348
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,320
how can I be absent?

349
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,210
Old Madam, I haven't seen you for a while.

350
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,600
You look much better than the last time you were at my residence.

351
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,310
Madam Ning's complexion is much more haggard than the last time we met.

352
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,110
Is there something worrying you?

353
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,090
It's unavoidable to have worries.

354
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,060
I heard that my son become the first-ranked scholar,

355
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,390
someone actually changed her name to come and seek connections again.

356
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,940
I am afraid Madam Ning's troubles are more than this trivial matter.

357
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,590
The Ning family rented out this Shunde Restaurant for the day using 1,000 gold coins.

358
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,640
Do you know that?

359
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,220
- Madam.
- How can I not know?

360
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,930
That's why I came to speak some words of justice on behalf of Yunzhao.

361
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,370
Old Madam, you won't drive me away, will you?

362
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,050
Why would I have a reason to not be welcoming?

363
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,390
Madam Ning, have you come today to speak words of justice or to watch another's embarrassment?

364
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,620
There's a saying, "The current situation is not the same as before."

365
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,220
I'm afraid Madam Ning will be embarrassed today.

366
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,550
Old Madam, you're indeed frank.

367
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,860
Some things shouldn't be spoken about too early.

368
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,580
I really don't want to say some things.

369
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,190
But seeing Madam Ning today, I won't be content unless I say them.

370
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,720
When Jiuling was a nobody,

371
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,280
your Ning family avoided her as though she were a scorpion.

372
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,490
Now that Jiuling is well known all over,

373
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,350
Young Master Ning acts as though one day without seeing her is like three autumns of not seeing her.

374
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,690
Only the saints can hold onto their principles so dearly.

375
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,340
What are your plans for the future, Young Master Ning?

376
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,410
When mother recovers, I shall return to the capital.

377
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,540
Since you are the new first-ranked scholar, and your uncle is also the Vice Minister of Rites,

378
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,110
your future will surely be boundless.

379
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,540
I'm afraid it's not as easy as you think.

380
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,640
I originally thought that to become a general or official was a joyous matter.

381
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,130
From the looks of it now, to be able to just protect oneself

382
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,300
is already very difficult.

383
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,200
You haven't even started your official position, so why do you feel that way?

384
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,760
After studying so hard, I ended up being among these people who shamelessly seek personal gains.

385
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,920
It's such a disgrace to one's scholarly dignity.

386
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,260
I believe that officials should serve the people

387
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,780
from the bottom of their heart. All matters require a foothold

388
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,750
before anything can be accomplished.

389
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,100
There's no need to fuss over the process.

390
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,890
Sometimes an indirect route is the better strategy.

391
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,550
Jiuling, if you were a man,

392
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,970
you would certainly be an official who leaves their name in history.

393
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,490
However, the inoculation matter alone

394
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,100
is enough for people to praise you for.

395
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,380
Young Master Ning, you flatter me.

396
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,870
Miss Jun is above the common people,

397
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,560
thus Commander Lu and Duke Cheng's heir apprent

398
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,200
fought over her on the streets. Right?

399
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,050
How could an ordinary lady cause a couple of men to fight in the streets?

400
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,090
- The morality of this world is truly declining.
- That's enough!

401
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,050
- Old Madam—
- Lord Ning, no need to get angry.

402
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,470
Your wife is full of energy.

403
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,150
Looks like her cold is all cured.

404
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,880
You should be happy instead.

405
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,120
Lord Ning, you painstakingly invited me here,

406
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,110
yet our two families have no hope of becoming in-laws.

407
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,820
Jiuling is my granddaughter. I love her dearly.

408
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,090
I can't stand her being wronged, even the slightest bit.

409
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,740
If she marries a good husband

410
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,920
who brought along a rude and unreasonable mother-in-law,

411
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,850
how would I explain it to her deceased parents?

412
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,230
You don't need to explain.

413
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,440
Even if Miss Jun personally came to discuss the marriage,

414
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,770
I wouldn't agree to it.

415
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,820
Our Yunzhao is still young so there are a lot of things he is still not clear about.

416
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,500
As his mother, I should take a clear look for him.

417
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,920
Have you gotten a clear look now, Madam Ning?

418
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,380
Back then, when Jiuling asked for 5,000 taels to call off the marriage,

419
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,420
it was already a clear sign that it was us who didn't want the Ning family.

420
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,670
It's difficult to decline one's generous intentions, thus I had to let Lord Ning save face.

421
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,940
Since Madam Ning has this type of attitude, we won't acknowledge the marriage arrangement.

422
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,310
- Jiuling won't marry down.
- Marry down?

423
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,670
Our Ning family has generations of officials.

424
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,210
If we were to really marry a merchant family,

425
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,660
- then that would truly be laughable.
- Generations of officials?

426
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,780
As to when exactly your family started becoming officials,

427
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,940
- you know better than I do.
- You!

428
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,080
Looks like Madam Ning didn't have typhoid fever but superfluous irritability.

429
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,180
This is high-quality green tea. Lord Ning has already paid for it.

430
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,230
Madam Ning, don't waste his good intentions.

431
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,850
- Goodbye.
- Old Madam.

432
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,510
Old Madam.

433
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,750
Young Master Ning, do you have something to say to me?

434
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,520
I still want to ask you the question from before.

435
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,790
Everyone says that as we go on in life,

436
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,000
we'll continuously meet and separate with others.

437
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,550
In my life,

438
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,370
I've always been alone.

439
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,710
I thought...

440
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,220
in this life journey,

441
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,690
I would be alone until the end.

442
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,900
But I never thought, on the night of the Lantern Festival,

443
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,090
I would meet you.

444
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,150
Without realizing it,

445
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,940
I've truly fallen for you and can't restrain myself, Jiuling.

446
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,790
Young Master Ning,

447
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,250
please speak carefully.

448
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,720
The world is full of people,

449
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,140
but there aren't many to confide in.

450
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,900
You're one of them.

451
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,510
I know you've helped me many times,

452
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,390
and I know your heart.

453
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,100
It's just...

454
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,570
your feelings...

455
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,590
I'm afraid I cannot accept them.

456
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,380
I'm sorry.

457
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,980
Should I have said that harsher?

458
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,750
It's better to end these things cleanly

459
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,490
and not leave any hope for the other person.

460
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,020
- That would truly be what's best for the other person.
- No need.

461
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,410
I'm not the type of person who doesn't give up until he sees the Yellow River.
(T/N: stubbornly not give up)

462
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,410
I also won't abandon myself in despair.

463
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,020
Moreover, to have someone to like

464
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,550
is a gift from Heaven, not suffering.

465
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,200
Miss Jun, rest assured.

466
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,400
Young Master Ning, I'm sorry.

467
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,550
These things have no logic to begin with.

468
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,950
However, speaking of it, I'm the luckier one.

469
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,080
Jiuling,

470
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,320
I hope I'll have the opportunity to accomplish things with you.

471
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,680
That's better than you taking on all the burden by yourself.

472
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,360
In this life, having you as a confidant,

473
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,940
is enough.

474
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,840
Remember to take care of yourself.

475
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,100
Even though our parting this time is not a final goodbye.

476
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,750
Miss Jun, don't forget about me.

477
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:32,640
Increasing troops here... means a battle is about to start.

478
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,030
We're not scared of them.

479
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,590
With Duke Cheng there, we can defeat them.

480
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,570
If it were the late emperor, he wouldn't have given up an inch of land.

481
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,530
But this one's different. He's scared of death and cares greatly for his own life.

482
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,460
In addition, there's Huang Cheng whispering in his ear,

483
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,060
I'm afraid he'll make peace.

484
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,890
I must go see the emperor.

485
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,610
If I can't persuade him, I'll return to the north alone.

486
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,260
Marriage is a personal matter but also a family matter. Now, this is great.

487
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,510
Your mother has completely destroyed a good marriage prospect.

488
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,660
Now that it's come to this, you and Miss Jun

489
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,010
have no chance now.

490
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,990
It's not completely Mother's fault.

491
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,600
Miss Jun does not like me, so this marriage would have been difficult to carry out either way.

492
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,520
Even if the marriage didn't happen,

493
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,410
we could have established a good relationship.

494
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,700
We could help each other in the capital in the future.

495
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,180
Don't mind too much, Father. I have already accepted this.

496
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,750
It seems although my son has studied for many years, he is not some idiotic scholar.

497
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,660
I can be at ease about the vicissitudes of official life you'll face in the future.

498
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,470
Jiuling, take my tent with you.

499
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,330
It's very convenient during travels.

500
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,010
All right.

501
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,290
Take a chef, too.

502
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,180
Eating and drinking well on the road won't affect the journey.

503
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,370
I'm going there to solve a problem, not to have fun.

504
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,350
Then take me!

505
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,140
That way, I can talk to you on the way there.

506
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,740
I can talk to Miss, too.

507
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,770
Your words don't sound as good as mine.

508
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,460
Moreover, you're not as good-looking as me.

509
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,170
If we're discussing appearances,

510
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,900
then Young Master Ning is good-looking.

511
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,650
Duke Cheng's Heir Apparent is good-looking, too.

512
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,610
Even that Lord Lu who keeps causing trouble for Miss is good-looking, too.

513
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,500
Stop.

514
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,030
What nonsense are you spouting? Help me tidy up my desk.

515
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,090
Jiuling.

516
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,820
What did you say to Young Master Ning?

517
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,650
What's a child like you asking that for?

518
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,640
Why do you still treat me like a child?

519
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,180
In my eyes, you're always a child.

520
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,170
Why are you speaking so strangely today?

521
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,810
After you leave this time,

522
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,730
I don't know when I can see you again.

523
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,320
Jiuling, if you come across any trouble in the north,

524
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,080
you must go to the local De Shengchang there.

525
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,640
If you need anything, write to me,

526
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,600
and I'll definitely prepare everything for you.

527
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,710
All right.

528
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,210
Master Lei.

529
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,950
Miss Jun.

530
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,480
I suffered from your lies.

531
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,080
However, I'll never forget your kindness.

532
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,910
You're exaggerating. It's what we owe you.

533
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,620
Chengyu said he arranged an especially trustworthy person. Turns out it was you.

534
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,030
I'm glad Young Master Fang thinks highly of us. I just hope Miss doesn't think we're troublesome.

535
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,970
One year passed by very quickly.

536
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,730
How's your escort business doing?

537
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,690
Not bad. I don't know if Miss has noticed,

538
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,770
but the guard formation we currently use,

539
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,180
originates from what Master Ling taught us.

540
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,630
Although we didn't interact for long, his method is very useful.

541
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,930
This year, it helped us against a great danger.

542
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,790
That's great.

543
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:37,250
His methods are all from the battlefield. Naturally, they are of good use.

544
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,210
He must know that the North is unstable.

545
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,770
He must be anxious to return.

546
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,010
[East Gate]

547
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,360
They're long gone. Let's go back.

548
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,090
I'm really envious of Liu'er.

549
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,230
Who isn't?

550
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,790
She eats and drinks all she wants. She also expresses herself freely.

551
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,200
Only she can bully others and no one can bully her.

552
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,610
Even if she causes disaster, there's always someone there to support her.

553
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,740
Last night, did you tell her that you like her?

554
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,720
No.

555
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,770
I knew it.

556
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,300
Are you scared of the answer?

557
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,150
Being able to write her letters, talk to her,

558
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,890
and protect her as a good brother forever,

559
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,980
is already great.

560
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,720
It's that I'm afraid that once I ask her,

561
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,260
I'll never have that fortune again.

562
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,530
Master! Master!

563
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,790
There is no mistake.

564
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,210
Has something really gone wrong with the inoculation?

565
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,750
The news is being suppressed; however, I've gotten ahold of information.

566
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,550
More than ten children have died already.

567
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,870
The parents of those children want to come to the capital to hold Miss Jun accountable.

568
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,450
Such a serious matter has occurred, yet they're able to suppress it

569
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,340
- and not report it to the Imperial Physicians Hall?
- Exactly.

570
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,210
That Feng person insists on an investigation before any conclusion is drawn.

571
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,330
Of course, he must suppress the news.

572
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,200
Everything he has now is from the inoculation.

573
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,460
However, the families of those dead children

574
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,370
are very pitiful.

575
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,060
As physicians who save lives,

576
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,600
we must seek justice for these pitiful people.

577
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,980
Then, Imperial Physician Jiang, what's your plan?

578
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,750
Helping His Majesty with his burdens and benefiting the people

579
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,040
are our duties.

580
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,690
We can't allow such uncalled for death to occur

581
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,130
just because some people hold fame and power.

582
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,400
I understand.

583
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,620
Then tomorrow, at court,

584
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,310
I will trouble you, My Lord.

585
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,110
Farewell.

586
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,050
Imperial Physician Jiang.

587
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,810
I would like to ask for your help.

588
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,780
Are you confessing or not?

589
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,450
Imperial Physician Jiang, thank you for your hard work. This way, please.

590
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,860
The lord has ordered that you take good care of him.

591
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,570
Please rest assured, My Lord.
- What are you doing? Open the door!

592
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,290
Master!

593
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,170
Lu Yunqi! What's the meaning of this?

594
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:07,520
You actually dare put an imperial physician into prison. Are you not afraid His Majesty will punish you?

595
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,100
Imperial Physician Jiang, don't waste your energy.
