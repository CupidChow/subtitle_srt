♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,580
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,800
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement

[Episode 7]

19
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,910
The heavenly maids scatter blossoms! All in!

20
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Wow! Miss Jun!

21
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,920
She's too amazing!

22
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,010
Wow, Second Brother, she made it all in!

23
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,460
Five thousand taels, Second Brother! Didn't I say? We didn't come for nothing.

24
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,110
She made it all in?

25
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,300
Everyone, it is clear as to who the winner is.

26
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,920
It is Miss Jun!

27
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,160
In just a few short days,

28
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,640
I have lost to you again, Miss Jun.

29
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,580
Thank you for going easy on me, Young Master. I am not as magnanimous as you.

30
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,140
Second Brother, we haven't received the money yet!

31
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,990
I did not expect Miss Jun to be so good at pitch-pot.

32
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,280
Your skills outshone everyone else's today.

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,670
The money you have earned is an extremely large sum.

34
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,140
Please wait a moment. Someone will bring the money to you in a while.

35
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,780
Miss, it's a lot of money. I'll go keep an eye on it.

36
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,130
Liu'er.

37
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,860
You must be thirsty after playing pitch-pot, Miss Jun.

38
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,970
Please have some tea, Miss Jun.

39
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,980
Jun Zhenzhen, are you—

40
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,820
Wait a moment.

41
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,690
Yanyan, Jun Zhenzhen looks guarded.

42
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,300
But I have already made preparations.

43
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,160
I paid a man to dress as a server here

44
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,050
to trick Jun Zhenzhen.

45
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,370
The tea I sent over this time has a different kind of drug.

46
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,160
Also, I have both pots of tea drugged.

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,760
That man has already taken the antidote.

48
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,710
So, everything will go smoothly once they are in the room, right?

49
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,310
Everything will go smoothly.

50
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Let's enjoy the show.

51
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,890
That lady looks like the lady who gave you the lantern the other day.

52
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,750
Be honest! Did you lose on purpose just now?

53
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,450
Miss Jun is great at pitch-pot.

54
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,240
I admit defeat.

55
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,160
You chatted with her for so long on stage. What did you two talk about?

56
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,280
- That's right!
- That's right!

57
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,750
- Right.
- What did you two talk about? Hurry and tell us.

58
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,260
There cannot be any mistakes again this time.

59
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,270
Don't worry, Lord. We have prepared extensively this time.

60
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,020
- Nothing can go wrong.
- Yes.

61
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,280
Why haven't there been any activities after this long?

62
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,430
Exactly.

63
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
- How about I go take a look?
- Sounds good. Go take a look.

64
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,260
What happened?

65
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,570
Jun Zhenzhen, what are you yelling about?

66
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,100
Miss Ning must be mistaken.

67
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,120
I'm right here.

68
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,610
Let me go!

69
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,480
- Come over here!
- Let me go!

70
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,880
- Let me go!
- Jin'er...

71
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,250
Isn't that Miss Lin?

72
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,260
Let me go!

73
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,720
Who sent you?

74
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,240
- Jun Zhenzhen.
- Let's talk later.

75
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,240
Miss Ning, I don't know this Miss Jun!

76
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,330
It has nothing to do with me!

77
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,280
Stop saying nonsense! I don't know you at all!

78
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,270
How can you be like this?!

79
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,850
Miss Ning, are you trying to harm my miss or ruin that miss?

80
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,960
Stop saying nonsense! This is obviously a trap you set up.

81
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,060
Ning Yunyan! How can I live after this?

82
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,120
You were trying to scheme against my Young Miss. However, through some strange combination of circumstances, harmed her.

83
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,660
- Now you're trying to frame us instead?
- Turns out this is called

84
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,940
"Picking up a stone only to hit your own foot."

85
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,520
Stop spewing nonsense! None of this is related to me at all!

86
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,100
You are all falsely accusing me!

87
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,900
- Exactly.
- So virtueless.

88
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,250
She's gone too far.

89
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,100
How could she do that?

90
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,440
Who does such things?

91
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,190
Let's go.

92
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,120
Miss Jun.

93
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,960
- Yunzhao!
- Young Master!

94
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,500
Watch out!

95
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,580
- Let's go.
- Don't run!

96
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,930
- Miss Jun, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

97
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,900
- Ning Yunyan, you did this. Right?
- You're spewing nonsense!

98
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,240
This is obviously set up by you two!

99
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,080
- You are just looking for an excuse to make a huge commotion and mess with my Ning family!
- Yanyan!

100
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,780
Stop talking.

101
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,830
Miss Jun, apologies.

102
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,540
Let me solve this.

103
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,910
Everyone, everyone. My apologies, everyone.

104
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,010
My apologies! Come on out. Everything is fine now.

105
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,250
Today is an auspicious day for my Jinyun Restaurant.

106
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,280
I did not think that such a thing would happen,

107
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,780
frightening everyone here.

108
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,200
We at Jinyun Restaurant would like to apologize to everyone.

109
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,500
Today, everything is half off.

110
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,330
But the most important thing right now is to make sure everyone is safe.

111
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,650
So we will briefly seal off our Jinyun Restaurant.

112
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,020
I hope everyone can bear with me.

113
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,080
Please bear with me.

114
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Elder Brother.

115
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Elder Brother, it's all Jun Zhenzhen's fault. If not for her, Jin'er would not have been in such a situation

116
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
and our family wouldn't have lost so much money.

117
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Yanyan,

118
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,400
why don't you think about why she would trick you and why you fell for her tricks?

119
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,200
You schemed against her first, and you even came up with such a despicable scheme.

120
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,400
This is the result of your own choices and decisions.

121
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
What reason do you have to blame and begrudge others?

122
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Elder Brother, I'm your sister. Why don't you help me? Instead, you're siding with others.

123
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,100
Yanyan, do you still not know what you've done wrong?

124
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,600
What wrong have I done? It's all Jun Zhenzhen's fault!

125
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Blaming others is shirking from the consequences of your own wrongdoings.

126
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,200
It will only cause you to make more mistakes in the future.

127
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,400
What wrong have I done? I just wanted to help our family get revenge.

128
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,100
It's all Jun Zhenzhen's fault! She set me up!

129
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,700
Ning Yunyan!

130
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,000
In life, you cannot be lucky every single time like today.

131
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Sometimes, because you refuse to realize your faults like this,

132
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,500
Miss Lin's life is ruined. Do you still not know to repent even now?

133
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
What wrong have I done?

134
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,670
I didn't do anything wrong! Brother, I didn't do anything wrong!

135
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,700
Come! Come! Come over!

136
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,500
Everything's fine now, everything's fine.

137
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,200
Young Master Ling,

138
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,100
are you all right?

139
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,140
Thank you so much for saving me today.

140
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,090
I wonder when you arrived.

141
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,180
I happened to see your skills at pitch-pot.

142
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Then the one who bet on me was you, right?

143
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,900
I'm puzzled.

144
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,600
- Earlier, the heaven—
 - Second Brother!

145
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
Second Brother!

146
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,900
The people from the Martial Moral Ministry are here. Let's go quickly.

Who is in charge here? Come out and speak.

152
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
Lord, the person in charge is usually here

If Your Lordship has any need, you may just give me the order.

Have everyone gather downstairs.

Have them exit the main entrance in order.

I will arrange it right away. Right away.

So many twists and turns of events.

Second Brother, we really have great luck!

Through a strange combination of circumstances, we are always running into our enemies.

Second Brother, why don't we escape in the chaos?

- So you're from Lord Ning Yan's household.
- Yes, I am.

195
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Young Master Ning, our ministry is acting according to His Majesty's secret orders.

196

If you hear about it, I am afraid you will lose your head.

Lord, everyone that is here to enjoy themselves are all commoners.

198
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I do not think the person you want to arrest is here, so why make it difficult for everyone?

199
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,600
Young Master Ning.

200
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,400
This is not the time for you to be a hero. Go back to your residence.

201
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,900
Give my greeting to Lord Ning for me.

202
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,800
Little maid, did you drop the silver?

203
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,430
Answer me.

204
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,800
Lord, my maid has not seen much of the world. Please do not blame her.

205
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Second Brother, what should we do?

206
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,330
Let's stay calm for now.

207
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,000
You seem very composed.

208

In my opinion, this money was dropped at such a strange time.

209

- Out of the way, out of the way!

Second Brother, we're doomed! Looks like we have no choice but to fight now.

215
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
First, let's not expose our identities. We have more important matters to do.

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,600
- Let's go.
- Drink...

All right. Stop!

- I'm not involved.

How did you know there was a secret passageway located here?

234
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,300
No one is as familiar with Jinyun Restaurant as I am.

235

Chen Qi... Your surname is "Chen"?

237
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,200
Could you be the descendant of the Chen clan who sold Jinyun Restaurant?

238
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,400
Do not accuse someone so casually. It was my old man who was addicted to gambling and sold it.

239
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,800
I have nothing to do with it.

I saw you two slip away the moment the Martial Moral ministry arrived.

Why would you act so guilty if they were not after you?

Do you think it's appropriate for you to see her at this time

considering your social status?

Miss Fang, please do inform her.

It's best to let her make an informed decision as to whether she wants to meet me or not.

Fine. Wait here. I'll go tell her.

I apologize on behalf of Yanyan for what happened at Jinyun Restaurant.

279

Young Master Ning, this is not related to you nor did you instigate the event. You don't need to apologize.

280
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,830
No, I asked Yanyan.

281

She has a grudge against you because of our broken engagement. I am the reason for all this.

Since Miss Ning has spoken the truth,

283
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,400
please pass on this message to her.

284
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,010
I do not wish for more people to be involved in this.

Hence, I hope Miss Ning will do what is best for everyone after this lesson.

Please go ahead.

How did you know the night of the lantern festival was also my birthday?

290
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,830
It happened to be in the marriage contract. That's how I knew.

291
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,640
Miss Jun, was it truly a coincidence

292
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,680
or was that planned to look like one?

293
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,190
Young Master Ning, you are overthinking.

294
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,710
I did not intentionally plan to meet and play chess with you.

295
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,740
Is it really me overthinking?

296
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,580
- Yes.
- Then, why did you give me the lantern?

297
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,140
You knew who I was.

298
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,830
Do you not think...

299
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,670
Do you not think that was inappropriate?

300
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,250
Young Master Ning, I did not think too much at the moment.

301
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,860
If it caused you trouble and created a misunderstanding,

302
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,070
I will apologize.

303
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,060
Miss Jun, you do not need to apologize. It looks like I did overthink.

304
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,250

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,840

306
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,790
I know our marriage affair upset a lot of people.

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,820
However, I have let it go.

308
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,310
Let's put an end to this. I didn't know you were visiting,

309
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,210
so I did not prepare any tea. Please take this pear instead.

310
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,560
Turns out, that was not what her intentions were.

311
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,060
My connection to her from before has been broken.

312
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,660
In the future, we will not have any connections either.

313

Ning Yunzhao, oh, Ning Yunzhao.

314
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,810
Is the meaning of this pear not clear?

Gifting a pear. Bidding farewell.
 (T/N: pear and farewell are homophones)

No need to think too much.

00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,460
She can do it. Can't you do it as well?

318
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,020
The pears are not bad. They are quite sweet. A good gift to give someone.

319
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,550
However, it carries the meaning of separation.

320
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,250
Did you hear our conversation?

321
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,880
I unintentionally eavesdropped. I just happened to pass by.

322
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,970
Happened to?

323
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,570
Yes, happened to.

324
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,910
Thank you for saving me today.

325
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,750
I promised you that I'll protect you and not let any harm come to you.

326
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,590
I have sent Zhang Baotang to investigate the assassins.

327
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,500
They should be working for the mastermind behind the Fang family's misfortunes.

328
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,450
That is my exact thought.

329
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,290
They are determined to kill the Fang family.

330
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,480
How are you?

331
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,470
I am all right.

332
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,500
However, it was too dangerous at Jinyun Restaurant today.

333
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,170
The people at the Martial Moral Ministry are targeting you, right?

334
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,530
Young Master Ling, for your own safety,

335
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,280
please leave Zezhou as soon as possible.

336
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,980
Our deal ends now. Please do not investigate this matter any further.

337
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,880
Why are you so concerned about me?

338
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,140
Am I?

339
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,090
You do not need to worry about my affairs. I know what I'm doing.

340
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,650
Can I ask you something?

341
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,400
You want to ask about "The Heavenly Maids Scattering Blossoms," right?

342
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,310
How do you know its name?

343
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,250
Princess Jiuling taught me.

344
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,360
Pitch-pot. When did you learn pitch-pot from her?

345
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,730
The winter in the year she came of age.

346
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,610
How about the way you drink tea? Why are the two of you so similar?

347
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,900
Princess Jiuling and I spent all our time together. There are many things that she taught me.

348
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,370
What else has she taught you?

349
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,310
Who are you?

350
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,390
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

351
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:04,760
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for
indescribable cause and effect ♫

352
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,010
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

353
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,690
Who exactly are you?

354
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,640
♫ I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

355
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,860
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

356
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,400
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

357
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,190
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

358
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,420
I am Jun Zhenzhen.

359
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,610
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

360
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,280
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

361
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,270
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in a deadlock with the sky ♫

362
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:48,040
♫ If memories could speak,
I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

363
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,130
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

364
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:59,020
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me.
Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

365
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,930
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

366
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:09,710
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you,
it would drift like the rain  ♫

367
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,960
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

368
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,210
Tomorrow afternoon, go with me to the ledger room.

369
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,430
[Ning Residence]

370
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,230
Mother, I have something to say to you.

371
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,440
I know. You want to discuss going back to the capital.

372
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,790
Everything is packed for you. The carriage and horses are already prepared for you as well.

373
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,270
- Thank you, Mother.
- Enough.

374
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Mother, before I leave, let's settle my sister's marriage.

375
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,910
However, you are leaving in three days.

376
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,870
Are you saying that, in three days,

377
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,550
we should settle Yanyan's marriage?

378
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,390
Yes.

379
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,780
Yanyan was wrong

380
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,300
but how is that Jun Zhenzhen not in the wrong? She is the source of evil.

381
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,380
- If she did not come to break off the marriage first—
- Mother.

382
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,130
She is not the source of evil.

383
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,580
I heard about her breaking off the marriage from Yanyan.

384
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,520
You should know better than I who is in the right and the wrong.

385
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,150
However... there is still no need to be in such a rush

386
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,400
to settle Yanyan's marriage, right?

387
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,790
Mother, I do not want my marriage affairs

388
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,920
to continue to be a bargaining chip for others.

389
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,230
Yanyan should also learn to be an adult.

390
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,290
She should know what she should do and should not do.

391
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,880
We cannot let the reckless enjoyment of her youth

392
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
delay her life.

393
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,910
Fine.

394
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,940
I have thought about Yanyan's marriage long ago.

395
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,970
I was thinking to settle her marriage by the twelfth lunar month of this year

396
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,460
and have her married next year.

397
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,880
Since you will not be able to come back for New Year,

398
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,120
let's just settle it. That way you will not miss it.

399
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,870
Thank you for your care, Mother.

400
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,980
The young lady from the Ning family is going to be married soon.

401
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,840
That quickly?

402
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,420
I heard it was Young Master Ning's suggestion.

403
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,450
The matchmaker already went. It will be decided later today.

404
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,350
Do you not know?

405
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,090
Rest assured, Miss Jun. They will learn their lesson.

406
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,330
So this the lesson he will give Ning Yunyan.

407
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,930
Looking at your expression, it would only be strange if you did not know of this.

408
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,120
Zhenzhen, your marriage date with Chengyu is approaching.

409
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,260
Have you tried on the marital clothes that were sent?

410
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,400
Are the measurements suitable?

411
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,810
Thank you, Auntie. They fit well.

412
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,430
Would you believe it if I told you that she probably didn't even try it? She's just speaking nonsense.

413
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,170
In fact, she's not taking the marriage seriously at all.

414
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,480
Elder Sister, just don't say too much. Hurry and eat.

415
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,190
A physician will be here in the afternoon.
 (T/N: 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.)

416
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,670
He will take a look at Chengyu one last time before the wedding.

417
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,730
Let's head over together after eating.

418
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,670
Grandmother, I have something arranged during that time.

419
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,950
I am afraid I cannot go with everyone.

420
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:48,620
What arrangements do you have that are more important than your cousin?

421
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,450
You must go when the physician is here to look at him.

422
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:56,190
I still have some things I want to get ready before the wedding.

423
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,880
Is there anything to ask the physician?

424
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,180
Can you ask the physician to prescribe Chengyu some more strengthening medicine?

425
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,170
That way we can carry out the wedding smoothly.

426
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,120
Jun Zhenzhen, you are shameless.

427
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,390
Chengyu's body is already in poor condition

428
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,230
yet you're still thinking about...

429
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,600
You're still thinking about giving him tonics on your wedding night.

430
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,960
You are so shameless!

431
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,290
Elder Sister Jinxiu, you have misunderstood.

432
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,960
I want the physician to prescribe strengthening medicine for Chengyu

433
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,950
so that he can go through the wedding smoothly

434
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,680
and go through the ceremony to accomplish an important matter in his life.

435
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,360
What are you thinking?

436
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,350
Even the food can't keep your mouth shut?

437
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,100
Grandmother, I am finished eating.

438
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,990
Then I will get going first.

439
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,910
All right. You go get busy.

440
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,750
When you are done, come home early.

441
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,600
Jinxiu, you are a lady who has not married yet.

442
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Say what you should say, but say less of what you should not say.

443
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,900
Mother, I did not teach her well.

444
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,830
Grandmother, I understand.

445
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,000
Eat.

446
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,400
De Shengchang prospered during the third year of Taiyan.

447
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,020
There are even records for when the revenues were low,

448
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,580
but why are there no records for the third year of Taiyan when they earned more revenue that year?

449
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,650
Are there other ledgers?

450
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,400
The transportation records for all the branches of De Shengchang

451
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,440
as well as all of the ledgers over the years are all here.

452
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,360
Could it have been lost in transport

453
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,620
- or been destroyed?
- Destroyed?

454
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,290
If it was really destroyed, then that is serious trouble.

455
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,230
So many years have passed now, the witnesses and physical evidence are long gone.

456
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,660
It's like De Shengchang's history in that year was erased.

457
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,050
Miss Jun, you have been at the Fang residence for so long now,

458
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,200
have you seen this image?

459
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,570
Why does he have this seal pattern?

460
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,780
I have never seen that. What is that?

461
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
The shops, pawns, and banks in the past

462
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,950
each had their own symbols to distinguish themselves from one another.

463
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:51,070
I do not know the meaning of this pattern.

464
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,920
However, I feel like it is related to what I am investigating.

465
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,410
But this is not De Shengchang's seal.

466
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,220
That I know.

467
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,510
Fang family.

468
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,720
The third year of Taiyan.

469
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,840
These symbols and this image

470
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,360
must be safer when they are farther apart

471
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,430
from each other.

472
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,650
If you see this image at the Fang residence,

473
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,900
please tell me immediately.

474
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,630
This matter is very important.

475
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,800
Thank you for the trouble.

476
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,360
I'm sorry for last night.

477
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,720
No need to worry about it, Young Master.

478
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,880
All right.

479
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,020
Farewell.

[Fang Residence]

481
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,040
What is it?

482
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,620
I don't understand why you gave up such a good marriage with Young Master Ning

483
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,750
and insist on marrying Fang Chengyu.

484
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,990
Did someone say something?

485
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,250
There are people out there saying

486
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,780
that the Fang family is having such a grand wedding

487
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,200
to spend some money on Fang Chengyu in his last moments.

488
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,800
They say it is not a true, joyous event

489
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,690
but a sorrowful event.

490
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,790
Such unpleasant things to say.

491
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,260
Just let them speak.

492
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,560
These are the same people who will come to congratulate Chengyu when he gets better.

493
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:05,220
[Joyous]

494
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,340
Cleanse in order to show respect to the elders.

495
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,190
In just a short period of a little more than a decade of my life,

496
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,190
I have actually had three marriage arrangements.

497
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,840
Once with Lu Yunqi who seemed a world away.

498
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,160
Once with Young Master Ning that occurred out of a strange combination of circumstances.

499
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,790
Once with my cousin who feels depressed and hopeless.

500
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:08,630
Of these three marriage arrangements, none truly belong to me.

501
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:15,890
In the rest of my life, will I be able to have a marriage that truly belongs to me?

♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

504
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:43,500
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

505
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:49,560
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for
indescribable cause and effect ♫

506
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,400
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

507
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,320
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

508
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:07,200
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

509
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,170
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

510
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,580
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

511
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,980
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

512
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,920
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

513
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,220
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

514
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,640
♫ If memories could speak ♫

515
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,670
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

516
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:43,880
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

517
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:10,340
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:27,450
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

521
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,010
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

522

♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

523

♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

♫ If memories could speak ♫

♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

528
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,670
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

529
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:02,890
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

530
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,080
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

531
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,240
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

532
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:17,530
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
