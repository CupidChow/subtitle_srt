♫ Journeying alone and cold,

[Episode 25]

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,160
Chengyu, why do you think Young Master Ning

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,640
helped Jiuling?

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Didn't I just say?

22
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,610
That was Jiuling's idea. But what is Young Master Ning's?

23
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,460
You probably already guessed.

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,410
You said that Jiuling and Young Master Ning discussed it.

25
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,770
But in the letter, neither Shopkeeper Liu nor Jiuling brought this matter up.

26
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,520
That means this matter occurred suddenly.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,450
How could something that happened suddenly be thought thoroughly about?

28
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,110
Since he made the decision impulsively,

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,700
he has some feelings for her.

30
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,720
That would be the most reasonable explanation.

31
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,120
Perhaps.

32
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,810
Chengyu, Jiuling getting help from Young Master Ning,

33
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,950
are you happy about that?

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,440
I like her.

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,190
Her being liked and protected would make me happy for sure.

36
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,920
Regardless if that person is you or not?

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,540
Regardless if that person is me.

38
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,180
As long as she is the one getting protected, it's fine.

39
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,450
Our Chengyu is really different from before.

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,570
Today is not a holiday, is someone getting married?

41
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,020
Thinking of the date, it must be the congratulatory celebration for the first-ranked scholar.

42
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,050
It's worthy of celebration.

43
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,340
Madam Ning must be very happy.

44
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,120
Yes, it is worthy of celebration.

45
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,880
This is nothing to be ecstatic about.

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,750
The magistrate is being too excessive.

47
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,630
He is the first-ranked scholar.

48
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,700
There is only one every three years.

49
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,800
It's normal to get excited.

50
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,490
Speaking of which, Yunzhao is of age to consider marriage.

51
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,470
This child insists on discussing marriage after the examinations.

52
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,790
He has kept delaying it until now.

53
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,400
I wonder if Madam Ning has a favored candidate in mind.

54
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,350
There's no rush. There's no rush.

55
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,810
- Madam Ma.
- Congratulations, congratulations.

56
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,500
Two joyous events at once.

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,710
Please sit.

58
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,230
Madam Ma, our Ning family only produced one first-ranked scholar this year.

59
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,550
What two joyous events are there?

60
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,400
You have yet to receive a letter from your family in the capital, right?

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,730
I let it slip. My apologies to you, Madam.

62
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,700
Now that Young Master Ning is the first-ranked scholar

63
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,660
and Miss Jun has a renowned reputation for treating the pox,

64
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,840
the sooner they get married, the sooner it's settled.

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,610
What do you mean?

66
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,490
Jun Zhenzhen is getting married to my brother?

67
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,840
Is that the matter you are speaking of?

68
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,520
That is a misunderstanding.

69
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,200
We did have a marriage agreement previously but it has been broken off.

70
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,990
You don't need to hide it any longer.

71
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,860
The Fang family's matters have been resolved.

72
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,320
There's no need to pretend going forward.

73
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,740
On the day after the ranking was announced, Young Master Ning

74
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,280
publicly announced the marriage arrangement with Miss Jun.

75
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,410
- They said they would get married after returning to their hometown.
- How is that possible?

76
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,470
Why would my brother marry her?

Congratulations! Congratulations!

Say hello to Miss Jun for us!

80
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,740
Once getting married, will you let Miss Jun still practice medicine?

81
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,770
Please say hello to Miss Jun for us.

82
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,440
Miss, you clearly know that everyone will get into a frenzy seeing you, yet why did you still come?

83
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,460
Young Master Ning dared to help me in public,

84
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,040
so I must also be supportive of him in public.

85
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,820
In addition, that Lu guy will only be more cautious if more people know about this matter.

86
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,040
Second Brother, how do you feel?

87
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Is there something you want to say?

88
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,950
Outstanding!

89
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,350
That was a soul-stirring sound.

90
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,020
It was unhypocritical and genuine. You did not wish them well but neither did you admit defeat.

91
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,800
That is the sound of the true feelings of a real man.

92
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,560
Bah!

93
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,110
They only have an agreement on paper but are not yet actually married.

94

I think Miss Jun treats you quite well.

95
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,730
- Bah.
- Stop making that sound anymore.

96
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,160
I also think Miss Jun treats you quite well.

Bah!

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,000
Eldest Brother, why are some people so abnormal?

99
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,330
You are still young.

100
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,120
You will never understand.

101
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,030
Is that so?

102
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,020
Come, let's speak of serious matters.

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,810
Is there any news?

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,540
There hasn't been any criminal secretly put into jail.

We searched the entire capital yet still can't find Wan Qing.

You were hit because of Physician Jun, right?

Zhu Zhan.

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,240
The heir apparent of the duke?

109
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,980
It must be because you want to take in Physician Jun.

110
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,270
Most likely he has taken a liking to Physician Jun.

111
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,800
Even though Physician Jun's family background is a bit lowly,

112
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,270
that is all right. Duke Cheng is not someone who cares about such trivial things.

113
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,100
He won't mind.

114
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,550
In that case, Physician Jun

115
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,980
- can be Madam to the Heir Apparent.
- Impossible!

116
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,680
Ning Yunzhao also said that Jun Jiuling is his fiancée.

117
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,850
Ning Yunzhao?

118

The new first-ranked scholar?

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,540
If Physician Jun can marry him,

120
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,850
- then that is also very good.
- Impossible!

She is such a great young lady,

122
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,180
You should let her live freely.

123
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,370
Isn't that a good thing?

124
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,520
Don't you like her very much?

125
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,410
Then I'll have her keep you company every day. Isn't that great?

No.

127

I also don't like her. She is not my younger sister.

128
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,820
My younger sister... is already dead.

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,590
Since she seems so much like a princess,

130
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,010
then she should live like a princess.

131
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,860
If she refuses,

132
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,650
since Princess Jiuling is already dead,

133

Lord Wang, you should also comfort her and not let her be too agitated.

That's great. You saying that my wife is fine is the biggest consolation for her.

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,110
What does this have to do with us?

162
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,410
They must be targeting me.

163
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,150
This isn't Lord Lu's doing, is it?

164
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,040
Liu'er, relay the order to have the prescription gathered immediately.

165
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,320
You must select the best medicinal herbs

166
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,160
and send them to Lord Wang. There must be no delays.

167
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,600
- I must go see him.
- All right.

168
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,540
Rest assured, Miss.

169
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,390
However, you rejected his marriage proposal before. Would it be fine for you to go see him?

170
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,200
- I have no time to care about that. Go quickly.
- All right.

171
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,780
[Martial Moral Ministry]

172
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,300
Lord Lu.

173
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,550
Looks like you finally understand my intentions.

174
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,940
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

175
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,720
I want to give you a hard time.

176
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,420
I don't understand what you really want.

177
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm someone with a marriage agreement.

178
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,410
So what? I like you.

179
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,290
Is it wrong to sincerely propose a marriage?

180
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,440
Lord Lu, are you hoping that I will be like Third Madam?

181
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
No.

182
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,930
You two are not the same.

183
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,240
You clearly know that you and I can never be together.

184
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,660
Lord Lu, remember this. I am a physician.

185
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,950
My responsibility is to treat illnesses and save people.

186
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,860
If you want to give me a hard time next time, please don't harass the innocent.

187
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,620
[Li Residence]

188
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,090
Lord Huang, careful.

189
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
Be careful of the threshold.

190
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,130
That's right.
[Li Residence]

191
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,770
All right.

192
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,130
I will remember your words.

193
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,220
Then, I shall trouble you, Lord Huang.

194
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,070
Lord Huang, you work day and night for the nation. You need to take care of your health.

195
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,010
I personally brewed some nourishing soup for you.

196
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,010
Please try it, Lord.

197
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,200
Noruishing soup?

198
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,910
Lord Li, I didn't expect you to know how to make nourishing soup.

199
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,620
I am embarrassed. When I was young, my family was not well off.

200
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,250
My mother was also ill often.

201
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,660
So I personally washed clothes and cooked

202
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,960
in order to barely preserve warmth.

203
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,480
Then you truly worked hard, Lord Li.

204
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,830
Lord Huang, you're the one who is working hard!

205
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,940
I'm of low rank so I can't share your burdens.

206
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,980
- To be able to be of service to you, would be—
- Enough.

207
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,610
I understand.

208
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,560
Please accept this nourishing soup.

209
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,460
Please accept it.

210
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,270
This nourishing soup is indeed nutritious.

211
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,720
All right then. I'll see what positions are opened in court to assign you to.

212
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,760
After all, copying books in the Ministry of Personnel

213
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,640
- must be hard work.
- That's right.

214
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,760
Here. Lord Huang.

215
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,150
May I ask, is that Prime Minister Huang?

216
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,320
Did you just come to the capital? That is not Prime Minister Huang. That is his son,

217
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,390
Young Lord Huang.

218
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,720
Step aside! Scram!
[Silence; Move Aside]

219
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,340
Step aside.
[Silence; Move Aside]

220
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,110
Move! You!
[Silence]

221
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,640
Move! Go, go!

222
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,310
Miss, who is that? So imposing.

223
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,870
Prime Minister Huang's son, Huang Ziqing

224
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,250
It looks quite lively up in front.

225
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,580
- Let's go and take a look.
- Liu'er.

226
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,620
Next time you see him, stay far away. Do you understand?

227
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,250
Why?

228
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,920
Is he more scary than that Lu Yunqi?

229
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,570
It's said that many people died in the hands of the Martial Moral Ministry's officials.

230
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,160
- However, he caused most of the deaths.
- What?

231
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,280
He's that scary?

232
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,800
Good thing we don't have much to do with him and can't offend him.

233
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,720
Let's take a detour.

234
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,800
- I'm sorry.
- My apologies.

235
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,760
Miss, your flowers.

236
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,040
Your flowers!

237
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,000
Isn't that Wan Qing, Wan Dachun's granddaughter?

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,680
Why does she seem so strange?

239
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,740
- Let's go and take a look.
- What?

240
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,480
- There are so many people today... 
- Lord Huang!

241
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,670
Young Lord Huang.

242
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,970
Lord Tang, you're in such a rush. Is something the matter?
[Silence; Move Aside]

243
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,830
The memorandum suggesting the impeachment of Duke Cheng by the Admonishment Court

244
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,080
has been blocked by Lord He once again.

245
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,180
When one gets old, his brain tends to get muddled.

246
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,550
He actually said that our speculation of Duke Cheng's collusion with Northern Qi is foolish.

247
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,170
He even said the Imperial Censorate is supposed to write and present memorandums, not echoing hearsay like a dog barking.

248
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,740
How can Lord He scold people like that?

249
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,800
Exactly! The news from the North

250
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,580
has been heard by many people.

251
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,940
In any case, he's suspicious.

252
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,550
Here, give me the memorandum.

253
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,420
I will report it to my father.

254
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,140
Then His Majesty shall decide if it is foolish words of speculation or just jokes.

255
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,680
How can the rest of us make that decision?

256
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,100
- Do you agree, Lord Tang?
- Exactly. Exactly.

257
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,730
Come.
[Silence; Move Aside]

258
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,510
That much?

259
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,840
If only one person says something, it may be nonsense.

260
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,930
If it's two people, it's a possibility.

261
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,970
However, if it's this many people,

262
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,250
then that means...
[Memorandum]

263
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,260
I have bothered you, Young Lord Huang.

264
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,800
Helping His Majesty with his burdens

265
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,170
is my duty.

266
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,020
I will take my leave now.
[Silence; Move Aside]

267
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,940
Excuse me. Excuse me.

268
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,080
She followed him the whole way. Could it be that she plans to assassinate Huang Ziqing?

269
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,070
There is no chance of success. This is suicide.

270
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,450
She is still so young. She shouldn't die so easily.

271
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,920
Young Master, only Commander Lu has not arrived yet.
[Silence; Move Aside]

272
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,900
We won't wait for him anymore. Open it

273
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,840
[Silence]

274
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,570
Useless thing.
[Silence]

275
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,330
Miss, lift your head and let me take a look.

276
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,860
Young Master! Young Master!

277
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,230
Young Master!

278
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,820
What are you waiting for? Get the master!

279
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,510
Young Master!

280
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,010
You must hold on, Young Master!

281
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,420
Stop! The knife is in his chest right now.

282
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,000
If you take it out, he will die for sure.

283
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,040
This... Then my Young Master...

284
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,030
Young Master,,, Young Master!

285
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,280
Son!

286
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,100
- Ziqing!
- Master.
 - Ziqing!
- Young Master, he...

287
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,990
Ziqing!

288
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,990
Who are you?

289
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,600
Wan Qing.

290
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,210
I am the granddaughter of Wan Dachun from the Ministry of Works.

291
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,690
Just kill me! You murdered my entire family!

292
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,270
I will kill you!

293
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,340
So pitiful.

294
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,070
You unfilial son!

295
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,200
How could you have fallen into her trap?

296
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,120
Imperial Physician, save him! Hurry!

297
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,720
Lord Huang, if the injury was inflicted elsewhere, perhaps there's a chance of saving him.

298
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,050
But the injury just happens to be located at the heart.

299
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,130
Young Lord Huang is bound to die once the knife is removed.

300
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,150
You still need to think of a way to save him!

301
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,810
Imperial Physician, he is my only son.

302
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,370
You must think of a way. As long as you can save him,

303
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,310
I guarantee you prosperity for life.

304
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,920
Please punish me for my incompetence.

305
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,460
Then, what should we do?

306
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,150
Young Master... Young Master!

307
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,290
- Ziqing!
- Young Master.

308
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,050
Son! My son!

309
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,110
Grandfather and grandmother, do you hear that?

310
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,950
Did you see? I have avenged you all.

311
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,200
I finally avenged you.

312
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,470
That despicable official Huang Ziqing is finally dead!

313
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,510
I have finally gotten my revenge and carried out my desires.

314
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,810
It is my greatest fortune to be able to finally die quickly with a clear conscience.

315
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:53,150
Unfortunately, I won't be able to witness the day when you are exonerated from this profound injustice.

316
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:58,430
Lord Huang, Young Lord Huang's wound might be treatable.

317
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,720
Who? Who can treat him?

318
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,400
Physician Jun from Jiuling Hall once said she is able to treat any injury that we cannot.

319
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,430
Physician Jun is here now.

320
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,280
Where? Where is she?

321
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,950
Over there.

322
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,020
Physician Jun, can you save him?

323
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,310
Don't save him! I'm begging you! Don't save him!

324
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,480
Young Lord Huang is a man who's about to die. If Physician Jun can save him,

325
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,960
then she would possess the miraculous power of reviving the dead.

326
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,660
Miss Jun, these knees of mine

327
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,620
have only ever knelt before Heaven and Earth, my monarch, my parents, and my teachers.

328
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,500
Yet I kneel before you today.

329
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,140
I beg you, please save my son!

330
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,670
He is my only son!

331
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,870
- No!
- We came too late.

332
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,940
Don't save him!

333
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,780
- Why is she here?
- Miss Jun?

334
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,940
Physician Jun, whether you can save him, give us an answer. We're all waiting.

335
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,460
Don't save him! I'm begging you...

336
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm begging you. I'm begging you, please don't save him.

337
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,500
Miss Jun!

338
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,780
Don't save him! I'm begging you!

339
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,410
Don't...

340
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,850
- Don't.
- Miss Jun.

341
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,110
Don't save him! I'm begging you...

342
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,900
Don't! Don't!

343
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,050
Miss Jun, please save my son.

344
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,820
I can do it.

345
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,720
Young Master. There's hope, Young Master.

346
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,310
- Precisely. Why save someone like him?
- Young Master...

347
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,130
He's not a good person.

348
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:39,310
Don't! Don't!

349
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,490
Don't!

350
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,550
I'm begging you! Don't do it!

351
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,840
Don't...

352
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,230
Don't save him!

353
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,970
Don't!

354
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,690
I'm begging you, don't save him!

355
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,740
Miss Jun is going to save Huang Ziqing.

356
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,220
What are you doing?

357
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,670
I have to stop her from saving Huang Ziqing! If she saves him, how many harsh words must she then endure?

358
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,360
If she saves Huang Ziqing, how many people will die?

359
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,820
Use your brain! Huang Cheng has been targeting Duke Cheng in every way. The consequences will be unimaginable the moment you step forward.

360
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,840
Second Brother, don't be impulsive.

361
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,240
- Wait here.
- Second Brother!

362
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,990
Wait there!

363
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,520
My son, Miss Jun has come to save you!

364
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,620
He's a murderer!

365
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,710
How many more people will die at his hands if you save him?

366
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,340
You will become the accomplice of a murderer! He's a murderer!

367
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,710
You will become the accomplice of a murderer!

368
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,350
- Miss, get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

369
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,100
- Master!
- So dangerous!

370
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,260
Son!

371
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,940
- Son...
- Young Master!
- This is retribution!

372
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,890
You corrupt official deserve worse than death!

373
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,010
- Son...
- Young Master.

374
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,330
Lord Huang, please accept my deepest condolences.

375
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,700
Wan Qing's death can be considered a life for a life.

376
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,290
How can her insignificant life be compared to my son's?

377
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,810
Can her life even be used to repay my son's life?

378
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,760
Miss Jun,

379
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,480
aren't you supposed to be miraculous, bringing the dead back to life?

380
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,640
Aren't you supposed to be miraculous, bringing the dead back to life?

381
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,170
My Miss isn't Yamla. Must she revive the dead just because she knows how to treat people?
(T/N: one of the judge of the underworld)

382
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,640
Lord Huang, no one here is overjoyed by the turn of events.

383
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,690
Please accept my deepest condolences.

384
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,870
Zhu Zan. Zhu Zan, you killed my son!

385
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,580
Now you're acting clueless!

386
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,410
You frightened the horse! You killed my son!

387
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,860
You killed my son! What are you all still standing around for?

388
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,870
Get him! Get him!

389
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,740
Stop!

390
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,590
His Majesty has issued an order. Arrest him.

391
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,690
- Eunuch, you came at the right moment.
- This case will be investigated thoroughly.

392
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,950
He's the murderer!

393
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,420
Recently, I've received many memorandums suggesting the impeachment of Zhu Shan.

394
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,080
I was just about to present them to His Majesty. I not only want him to pay with his life,

395
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,350
but I want both father and son to pay for my son's life with theirs!

396
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,540
- Try to touch my father if you dare! You can forget about trying to tarnish his reputation! Huang Cheng!
- You!

397
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Young Lord, if you have anything to say, just tell His Majesty when you enter the palace.

398
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,280
Take him away.

399
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,120
Lord Lu, I'll have to ask you to come with me.

400
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,470
Lord Huang is in a very emotional state today.

401
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,480
If there are any loopholes in his statements,

402
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,850
you can be a witness.

403
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,880
Lord Huang, after you.

404
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,520
Drag that despicable wench away,

405
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,950
and feed her to the dogs!

406
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,810
Yes, My Lord.

407
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,340
My son...

408
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,270
Slow down. Why are you in a rush?
[Jiuling Hall]

409
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,000
Why would Wan Qing choose a place like that to get revenge?

410
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,640
Isn't it clear that she no longer wants to live?

411
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,820
Don't speak rashly. We don't know what happened.

412
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,840
Thus, there's no justice in this world.

413
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,740
Justice comes at the expense of lives.

414
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,290
Miss, isn't it true?

415
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,530
Jiuling, do you think the startled horse was truly just a coincidence?

416
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,020
Baotang. Sanbing. Do me a favor and follow Wan Qing.

417
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,570
After the Huang servants leave her, take her out of the city.

418
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,860
She's alive?

419
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,180
Yes, I gave her medicine to hold her breath for the time being.

420
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,050
She'll wake up tomorrow morning. Wan Qing,

421
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,450
now that Huang Ziqing is dead, they definitely won't let you off.

422
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,960
Did he startle the horse on purpose?

423
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,180
You should ask him yourself.

424
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,700
Why did it happen to be the young lord?

425
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,400
How did it go, Sanbing?

426
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,230
Don't worry. Baotang has taken Wan Qing out of the city.

427
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,250
What about the young lord?

428
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,840
No news yet.

429
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,780
He must've been worried I'd save Huang Ziqing, so he risked his life to do that.

430
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,210
When he insists on something, I can't stop him.

431
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,910
Huang Ziqing happened to be submitting the memorandums about Duke Cheng's impeachment to His Majesty.

432
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,140
Even if the young lord is silver-tongued, I'm afraid it'll be difficult for him to get out of this.

433
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,900
His life won't be in danger, will it?

434
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,010
Your Majesty!

435
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,470
Zhu Zan killed my son.

436
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,290
My family lineage was cut off because of the Zhu family.

437
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,450
Considering the hard work I've done for the Imperial Court,

438
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,860
Your Majesty must seek justice for me!

439
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,080
Where's Zhu Zan?

440
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,050
The young lord is being held outside of the hall.

441
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,790
- Should I summon him?
- No.

442
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,070
Put him in the imperial prison. There's also no need for a trial by the three ministries.

443
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,950
Pick a date and behead him.

444
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,310
Thank you, Your Majesty!

445
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,350
Your Majesty, please remain calm.

446
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,010
This matter happened suddenly.

447
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,570
It also has to do with both Duke Cheng and Lord Huang.

448
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,990
To avoid speculations among the imperial court,

449
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,780
it's better to investigate it first.

450
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,750
Huang Cheng had only one son.

451
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,910
This means an end to his family lineage.

452
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,630
He'll do whatever it takes to take the young lord's life.

453
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,620
I'm most worried that Lu Yunqi is there to support Huang Cheng.

454
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,780
Then he'll really have little to no chance of being saved.

455
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,590
Even if I lose my life, I will save my second brother.

456
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,850
Li Sanbing! Don't be impulsive.

457
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,840
Let's think of a way to get news about the young lord first.

458
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,870
What's there to investigate, Your Majesty?

459
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,970
I saw it with my own eyes. Lord Lu was there as well.

460
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,680
He can attest to that!

461
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:39,190
Your Majesty, I did see a startled horse run into the crowd,

462
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,820
and it happened to step on the vulnerable part of Young Lord Huang.

463
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,410
Then Heir Apparent Zhu got here and calmed the startled horse.

464
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:51,920
It was because Zhu Zan startled the horse and caused it to step on my son.

465
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,470
Your Majesty, he was getting revenge.

466
00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:00,490
He's getting revenge on me for suggesting Zhu Shan's impeachment. Please seek justice for me, Your Majesty.

467
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,520
Beloved Official, be calm for now.

468
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,940
I will handle it properly.

469
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,260
Issue a decree to put Zhu Zan in the imperial prison.

470
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,880
Give him 100 strokes of the army stick for now.

471
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,620
I obey.

472
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,910
Will you talk or not?

473
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,560
Hurry up and talk.

474
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,000
Talk!

475
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,850
Continue to hit him!

476
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,150
Will you talk or not?

477
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,250
I really have no idea.

478
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,750
Tell me now!

479
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,880
Gui Shou, don't worry about him.

480
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,700
An important person will be here soon. His Lordship said to take good care of him.

481
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,280
What important person?

482
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,690
Here, they are all the same to me. A pile of flesh, that's all.

483
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,160
- It's different this time.
- When is he being sent here?

484
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,540
I can't wait any longer!

485
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,210
I believe he's almost done with the strokes.

486
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,120
- How many strokes?
- 100 strokes.

487
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,820
A total of 100 strokes.

488
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,020
How can I have fun when he's dead?

489
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,760
Other people may not be able to stand it, but he's different.

490
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,690
He was quiet at first.

491
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,830
He only moaned a bit when his body was mutilated later on.

492
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,750
I look forward to it even more now.

493
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,250
Lord Lu, it looks like

494
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,960
the young lord is asleep.

495
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,610
Is this the infamous

496
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,560
imperial prison of the Martial Moral Ministry?

497
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,590
I hope you'll still be able to smile in a bit.

498
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,390
Young Lord,

499
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,320
I'm going to treat your wounds now.

500
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,300
Can I refuse?

501
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,750
No.

502
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,150
Is Physician Jun here? Our Prince Xian is seeking Physician Jun for treatment.

503
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,150
Twelfth Imperial Uncle? Why is he here?

504
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,860
Greetings, Prince Xian.

505
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,670
Are you Jun Jiuling, the famous miraculous physician in the capital?

506
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,930
I'm flattered. You flatter me, Prince.

507
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,070
I keep feeling unwell these past few days.

508
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,160
The imperial physicians in the palace couldn't tell what the reason is.

509
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,970
They make me take bitter, useless medicine.

510
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,630
Since you're a miraculous physician, why don't you take a look at me?

511
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,240
Prince Xian, this way, please.

512
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,550
I thought nobody would come, but a prince has come so early in the morning.

513
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,560
Don't talk nonsense.

514
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,090
The herbal scent of your hall is quite pleasant.

515
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,110
Prince, rest assured. There is nothing serious with your body.

516
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,780
Really?

517
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Since you've said that, I am naturally at ease.

518
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,450
But... even though I'm fine,

519
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,110
I don't know if my family members at home are all right.

520
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,590
Why don't you come to my residence to take a look at them?

521
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:25,550
If anyone gets sick in the royal residence, someone from the Imperial Physicians Hall will take care of it.

522
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,070
Twelfth Imperial Uncle is close to Zhu Zan. Since he personally came here,

523
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,720
it must have something to do with Zhu Zan.

524
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,800
Physician Jun.

525
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,120
Sure.

526
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,280
Then I'll start packing and get ready.

527
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,740
Thank you.

528
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,770
Zhu Zan, if it hurts, just let it out.

529
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,820
You don't deserve to call my name.

530
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,830
You actually didn't need to kill Huang Ziqing.

531
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,600
Even if he wanted to impeach you and your father, His Majesty might not have listened.

532
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,820
You all better do your best. Don't let the young lord

533
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,520
underestimate our Martial Moral Ministry.

534
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,290
Hold on. Don't rush, don't rush.

535
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,730
The young lord hasn't taken the medicine yet.

536
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,510
He can't stand the torture yet. Don't beat him to death.

537
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,270
Old Gui, what medicine are you using now?

538
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:43,550
These days, the punishments issued by the palace eunuchs are becoming more and more severe.

539
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,280
Look at these wounds.

540
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,710
It's... absolutely beautiful.

541
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,540
