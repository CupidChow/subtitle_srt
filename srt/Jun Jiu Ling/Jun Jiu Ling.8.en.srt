In just a short period of a little more than a decade of my life,

26
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,850
I have actually had three marriage arrangements.

27
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,620
Once with Lu Yunqi who seemed a world away.

28
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,840
Once with Young Master Ning that occurred out of a strange combination of circumstances.

29
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,530
Once with my cousin who feels depressed and hopeless.

30
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,420
Of these three marriage arrangements, none truly belong to me.

31
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,430
In the rest of my life,

32
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,680
will I be able to have a marriage that truly belongs to me?

No need for ritualistic formalities.

38
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,730
The groom's health is not good, and his physical movements are restricted.

39
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,500
Just have them bow to each other.

- Congratulations! Congratulations!
- Congratulations to Young Master!

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,810
Just right.

47
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,790
- Younger Cousin.
- Yes?

48
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,460
From now on, you don't have to address me as "younger cousin" anymore.

49
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,440
Fine. Then I shall call you Chengyu.

50
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,020
What are you doing?

51
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,020

54
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,020
What are you thinking of? Medicinal bath.

55
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,350
Didn't I tell you before? Did you forget?

56
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,370
Medicinal bath?

57
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,990
I don't want that.

58
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,020
Miss, the hot water is ready. Should I bring it in?

59
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,430
- Bring it in.
- All right.

60
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,010
Chengyu.

61
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,770
Before, you said there was a difference between a man and a woman, so you refused the treatment.

62
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,380
However, since we are married, it is all right now. Right?

63
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,940
From now on, do not listen to Jinxiu's nonsense.

64
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,030
All right.

Young Master, Madam especially prepared this for you.

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,230
Leave it here.

68
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,930
I know our marriage affair upset a lot of people;

69
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,930
however, I have let it go.

70
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,290
Let's put an end to this.

71
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,470
I didn't know you were visiting, so I did not prepare any tea.

Today is the day of her wedding.

74
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,450
She must have already done the ceremony by now.

75
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,860
It's all right. It's in the past now.

76
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,500
Chengyu, the longer you stay in the bath, the more painful it will be.

77
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,880
But the effect of the medicine will be better.

78
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,990
You must endure it,

79
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,160
even if you pass out in the end.

80
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,980
Is it painful?

81
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,310
It's all right.

82
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,180
Am I... Am I really useless?

83
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,020
Trust me, you'll get better soon.

84
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,340
If it is too painful, then let it out.

85
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,500
Screaming will help you feel better.

86
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,720
Get out.

87
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,950
Get out.

88
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,550
Chengyu, you will pass out from the pain in a while. I need to be here.

89
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,910
Get out!

90
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,730
Get out!

91
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,400
Okay. I'll be at the door then.

92
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,330

Is Young Master all right?

95
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,900
Chengyu is a good child. He is very strong.

96
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,400
He needs to get well soon.

97
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,200
Otherwise, he will suffer if we need to go somewhere far.

98
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,220
Is he going somewhere far?

99
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
That is a possibility.

100
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,500
By the way, we must prepare in advance.

101
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
Make sure to bring more of Chengyu's medicine.

102
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
All right.

103
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,800
If you decide to go, how long will we be gone?

104
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I don't know.

105
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,410
Expelling poison on your wedding day. You are quite peculiar.

106
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,550
This child is absurdly skinny and weak.

107
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,390
If you can't keep quiet, then get out.

108
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,620
I am about to put the needles in.

109
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,790
Your skills are not bad. Who were you taught by?

110
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
Today is my wedding day.

111
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,300
You came uninvited. Are you going to give me a surprise?

112
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,250
This was a fake marriage from the start.

113
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,350
It is to allow you to treat him more easily, right?

114
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,900
You are so nosy.

115
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,200
It is quite rude of me to show up here.

116
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,400
It is because I thought of Jiuling when I saw that you got married.

117
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,600
When Jiuling got married, I was not in the capital.

118
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
Since it is your wedding day today,

119
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
I came here to congratulate you.

120
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,420
Tell me what you want.

121
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
You forgot to take it the other day.

122
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,000
I was afraid that you would forget it so I drew another one for you.

123
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,990
Is this seal that important?

124
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,300
Do you know about Northern Qi's treachery during the third year of Taiyan?

125
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,600
My father mentioned it before.

126
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,800
There may be secrets behind this matter.

127
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
The ransom most likely was not handed over to Northern Qi

128
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,800
and was hidden by people with ulterior motives instead.

129
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
So you are saying

130
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,800
that this seal is related to the silver that went missing back then.

131
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
Exactly.

132
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Since this matter is so secretive, how do you know about it?

133
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,200
A close attendant of the late emperor drew this from memory.

134
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
It may be a little different from the actual pattern of the seal.

135
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,800
However, I heard that the vassal prince who oversaw Zezhou at that time is now the current emperor.

136
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,200
Even if you find the truth, what can you do?

137
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
You would just be "an ant trying to shake a big tree."
 (overconfident)

138
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
The truth is the truth.

139
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,000
It will not disappear just because time has passed. You may think that of me.

140
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,400
However, in my opinion, "one ant hole may bring the collapse of a thousand mile-long embankment."

141
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,400
Why are you telling me this?

142
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,100
Because I want to make another deal with you.

143
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,900
- Tell me.
- Help me secretly investigate the Fang family.

144
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,600
Find out the source of this seal.

145
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,200
I will help you find those who are secretly plotting against the Fang family.

146
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,300
I will also keep this child's illness a secret.

147
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,900
Fine. Then promise me one thing.

148
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,900
- Tell me.
- No matter what the truth is, spare the Fang family.

149
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,640
- Even if...
- Even if they were accomplices.

"If a ruler wants a servant to die, then the servant has no choice but to die."

151
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,200
Even if the Fang family was involved in this matter,

152
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,000
I fear they were forced into it. That is a very likely possibility.

153
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,610
One more thing.

154
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,800
You should leave now. I will go see you at noon tomorrow.

155
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
I shall wait for you.

The marriage between Miss Jun and Young Master Fang is fake?

158

No wonder.

160
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,000
You were in such great spirits when you returned last night.

161
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
Let me tell you.

162
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
I was in great spirits because Miss Jun agreed

163
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,800
to investigate anyone suspicious in the Fang family.

164
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't make foolish conjectures.

165
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,400
Second Brother, something is not right.

166
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,200
I didn't say what I was thinking, so how am I making foolish conjectures?

167
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Open the door.

168
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
Miss Jun.

169
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,700
Please.

170
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,000
Miss Jun, please have a seat.

171
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Now that you are married,

172
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,100
we should meet less often.

173
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Let's not give people a reason to talk, right?

174
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,400
Didn't you ask me to secretly investigate the Fang family's matters?

175
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
That's right.

176
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,600
I thought it over.

177
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,200
If the Fang family is involved with that batch of silver,

178
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,700
then we must start with the veteran workers of De Shengchang.

179
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,990
Do you already have someone in mind?

180
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,440
It is the person I suspect of being behind the misfortunes of the Fang family.

181
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,040
Mother, please have some tea.
[Fang Residence]

182
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,100
Zhenzhen, you are here.

183
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
Grandmother. Aunt.

184
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Although we know that the joyous event is fake,

185
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
you should change the way you address us in public.

186
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Yes, Mother.

187
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,000
Zhenzhen, have a seat.

188
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,000
How was Chengyu after the medicinal bath?

189
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yesterday, he had his first medicinal bath.

190
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Chengyu was not able to endure the effects of the medicine and passed out.

191
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,400
He passed out? Is that concerning? Do we need to get another physician to look at him?

192
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,800
Mother, you do not need to worry.

193
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,600
This actually proves that the medicine is working well.

194
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,400
It's just that there is an excessive amount of poison that has accumulated in his body over the years.

195
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,000
Thus, he will suffer for a bit.

196
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,100
That is good then.

197
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,200
Right now, Chengyu must expel the poison before he gets nourished.

198
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
The medicinal baths are to expel the poison from his body.

199
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,200
After that, I will use golden needle acupuncture to repair his meridians. In addition, he is nourished through medicine and food.

200
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
Zhenzhen, you have worked hard.

201
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Old Madam.

202
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,400
What is it?

203
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Shopkeeper Song has arrived.

204
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,600
He brought Imperial Physician Sun to take a look at Young Master.

205
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,220
Indeed, it is him.

206
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,260
Zhenzhen.

207
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,090
Grandmother.

208
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,750
Zhenzhen, this is Imperial Physician Sun.

209
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,690
He happened to be visiting relatives in Zezhou.

210
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,150
Shopkeeper Song asked him to make a visit to us

211
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,790
after knowing he was here.

212
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,910
We shall trouble you then.

213
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,370
Imperial Physician Sun, please.

214
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,440
Imperial Physician Sun, how is Chengyu's illness?

215
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,800
Madam.

216
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,110
Let's speak outside and not disturb him.

217
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,800
All right.

218
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,640
The Young Master's pulse is extremely weak.

219
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,150
His insides are already festering.

220
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,990
Even if a miraculous physician exists,

221
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,530
he would be powerless.

222
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,950
Imperial Physician Sun, I beg you to save Chengyu.

223
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,070
- Madam.
- Mother.

224
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,960
Madam, my condolences.

225
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,820
What do you mean? Is your diagnosis even accurate?

226
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,080
A few days ago, during the joyous event, I saw that the young master was quite energetic.

227
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,660
It has only been a few days, so how could his health have deteriorated that quickly?

228
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,490
It could be terminal lucidity

229
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,640
or he may have taken some strengthening medicine

230
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,720
that helped him hold onto his last breath.

231
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,870
Haven't you always been decocting medicine in the East kitchen?

232
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,820
Why have you brought it in here today?

233
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,290
It's also beneficial for your health to fumigate the room with the medicine.

234
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,400
All right. Put the lid on.

235
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,040
Today, someone from the Imperial Physician Hall will come to see you.

236
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,090
Are you not treating me anymore?

237
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,790
How could I possibly abandon you?

238
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,430
This medicine is decocted for them to see.

239
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,400
For them to see?

240
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,710
Your body is most weak after taking medicine.

241
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,460
They probably won't be able to find out anything.

242
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,480

243
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,830

Be careful, Mother.

please instruct the kitchen

247

to make some soothing soup for Grandmother and Mother.

248
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,980
Yes.

249
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,220
It really is her.

250
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,590
I was wrong about her.

251
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,310
Zhenzhen, what do you have planned for the future?

252
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,290
This time, we weren't discovered because we happened to arrange it so they would see the weakened Chengyu after he's taken his medicine.

253
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,930
If they come again next time, it will be hard to pass their test.

254
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,430
I was thinking, is it possible for Song Yunping

255
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,910
to strategize all this over the year on his own?

256
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,680
Are you saying that he is following someone else's orders?

257
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,160
That is a possibility.

I wonder if you two will agree to it.

Let me hear it.

Yes.

267

First, it will be more convenient for me to treat Chengyu's illness.

Second, we can lure out the person behind all this.

be more?

Reasonable. We leave tomorrow morning.

would be you, Young Mistress.

Back then, I was an escort for the Righteous Loyalty Services.

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,440
are cursed.

323
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,610
Those are nonsense rumors that circulate the marketplace.

324
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,230
How could you believe them?

325
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,820
Whether or not I believe them,

326
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,170
our Fang family only has Chengyu now.

327
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,300
Yesterday, you also heard what the physician said.

328
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,230
He said that Chengyu is almost at the end of his days.

329
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,040
Dakong Temple's wisdom reading master gave me some guidance,

330
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,820
advising Chengyu to leave this land where the Fang residence is at.

331
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,810
Perhaps it can get rid of this curse.

332
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,480
However, someone must take care of Chengyu's

333
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,600
needs like food, drinks, and medicine.

334
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,160
After all, being out there is not as convenient as being at home.

335
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,300
He could settle in another court away from the Fang residence.

336
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,180
How about this? You tell me where Chengyu is

337
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,000
and I'll send someone to retrieve Chengyu to get him settled.

338
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,360
Shopkeeper Song, rest assured.

339
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,050
Chengyu is being taken care of very well.

340
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,580
As to where he is at, the master has said

341
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,900
that it would be best if even we at the Fang Residence do not know.

342
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,500
Right now, even I do not know where he is at.

343
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,460
That is fine. I hope

344
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,320
this can rid of Madam's years of worry.

345
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,580
It can also be considered that Chengyu's sufferings are not for nothing.

346
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,920
Quickly send someone to find him as soon as possible.

347
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,190
Do they think they can hide someone under my nose within the borders of Zezhou?

348
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,910
Not a chance.

349
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,440
Do you find the journey uninteresting?

350
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,090
Not at all.

351
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,180
It may be that way for those who travel often,

352
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,180
but it is very interesting for someone like me

353
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,110
who has never traveled far before.

354
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,580
Look at all the grass and trees. They clearly look the same

355
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,150
yet I cannot get enough of them.

356
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,990
I was just like you when I traveled for the first time.

357
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,650
I used to travel everywhere with my father when I was young.

358
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,470
I thought I would lead a nomadic lifestyle forever.

359
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:07,190
Father told me that a person's life is not too long, not short, it's just right.

360
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,880
On the road, we can use the time to see the world.

361
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,130
Thank you for allowing me to understand that the outside world

362
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,540
is much bigger than I thought it was.

363
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,790
In the future, you can also experience riding a horse.

364
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,490
That is a different experience than sitting in a carriage.

365
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,570
Riding a horse?

366
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,810
Are you saying that my legs will be cured soon?

367
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,180
After arriving in Ru'nan, it should be soon.

368
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,350
I hear riding a horse is difficult to learn.

369
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:54,080
You are so smart. It probably will not be too difficult for you.

370
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,850
I am quite smart. But I'm not as intelligent as you.

371
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,580
Why do you say that?

372
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,180
Because you're very good at pitch-pot.

373
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,230
You heard about it?

374
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,110
How immature.

375
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,590
This uncle is old

376
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,400
so you naturally do not understand the enjoyments of young people.

377
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,380
What about me?

378
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,160
A handsome and young man, indicates that I am an old uncle?

379
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,740
Didn't your mother tell you that calling an elder brother, "uncle," is very rude?

380
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,550
This uncle, not only did my mother teach me manners,

381
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,960
she also taught me that eavesdropping on other people's conversations

382
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,580
is a very disgraceful act.

383
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,150
You commented unnecessarily even though you didn't understand the conversation.

384
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,560
That makes you even more despicable.

385
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,670
You're only a child yet dare to carry out great mischief. I can't be bothered to stoop to your level.

386
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,890
Who is he?

387
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,160
That is Young Master Ling. He's in charge of escorting us.

388
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,280
According to age, you should address him as "elder brother."

389
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,900
I...

390
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,580
Chengyu,

391
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,450
do you want to give this a try?

392
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,550
You'll be all right.

393
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,210
Santao, here.

394
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,980
Come, Liu'er.

395
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,090
I...

396
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,690
You'll be all right. I'll count "three, two, one" and then let's put our strength into it.

397
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,660
Come on.

398
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,080
- Here.
- Here.

399
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,580
Three, two, one!

400
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,140
Do your best! Try harder, Chengyu!

401
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,640
Hold onto it. Chengyu, grip the tops.

402
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,980
I can stand now.

403
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,300
I can stand!

404
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,520
Come on, I'll help you.

405
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,040
Move forward slowly. Follow my lead.

406
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,690
Follow my lead, don't rush.

407
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,030
Come on.

408
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,580
One. Slowly, slowly. Good. Good!

409
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,580
Slowly! Grip the crutches tightly. Are you all right?

410
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,090
- Are all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

411
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,800
Let's try one more time.

412
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,520
- All right.
- All right, let's try it again. Slowly.

413
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,530
I'll hold onto you. Move forward slowly. Move forward slowly.

414
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,250
Hold on. Hold on.

415
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,460
Young Master.

416
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,610
I can stand. I can stand now!

417
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,680
I thought about stepping foot outside of the Fang Residence.

418
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,380
However, I never thought I'd be able to stand up and walk.

419
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,970
Chengyu, you'll be able

420
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,210
to walk even further in the future.

421
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,150
You will for sure. Trust me.

422
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,260
Come on! Let's practice some more. Let's stand up.

423
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,740
Here, slowly.

424
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,220
Liu'er, come help him.

425
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,120
Isn't Rong'er also like this?

426
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,500
He's trapped inside the Prince Huai Residence right now.

427
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,600
He probably wants to go outside to look at the much bigger world.

428
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,940
I wonder when he'll be as fortunate as Chengyu.

429
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,040
How are you?

430
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,980
I'm all right. Come on.

431
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,990
Why don't you rest for a while? Slowly, slowly.

432
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,780
Let's not rush, and take our time.

433
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,310
Have something to eat.

434
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,210
Young Master Ling's cooking is not bad.

435
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,910
You can just give them to me.

436
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,820
Then, we'll leave the cooking to you from now on.

437
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,510
Don't push your luck. I only accepted the money to escort you.

438
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,470
Young Master Ling, you like money quite a lot.

439
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,590
If we're to talk about liking money,

440
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,060
Miss Jun, we're not that different from each other.

441
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,690
You see... Let me calculate it for you. There was the money from breaking off the marriage arrangement,

442
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,260
the money from the chess game,

443
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,240
and the money from the pitch-pot game at Jinyun Restaurant.

444
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,380
You have made a fortune.

445
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,050
Say, why does a young lady like you need so much money?

446
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,680
I'm not telling you.

447
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,620
Young Master, have some food.

448
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,910
Let's carry on, then.

449
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,400
Young Master.

450
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,800
- Where's Zhenzhen?
- Miss said she's going to see if there are any medicinal herbs nearby she can pick.

451
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,550
Is this pretty?

452
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,160
It is.

453
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,490
She's just causing trouble. This terrain is wild and mountainous yet she's gone to pick herbs by herself?

454
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,030
I'll also–

455
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,470
Young Master Ling, are you going to look for my miss?

456
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,000
It's an Immortal Violet Blossom.

457
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,800

00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:08,630
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

479
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,790
♫ If memories could speak ♫

480
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,000
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

481
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,390
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

482
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,790
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

483
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,990
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

484
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:32,190
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

485
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,350
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

486
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,580
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

487
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:46,620
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
