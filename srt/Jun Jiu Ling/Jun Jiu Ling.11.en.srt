00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,450
♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,650
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,620
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,840
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,880
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,930
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,010
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,330
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,250
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,750
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:30,980
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,800
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,290
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:51,050
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

16
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,740
♫ Dawn... ♫

00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,740
[Episode 11]

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,280
Who on earth did all this?

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,380
It looks like we're about to find out.

21
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,320
Li Changhong became an advanced scholar at the age of 20.

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,070
Successively, he became the registrar of Luting,

23
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,330
martial officer of Taizhou, local Magistrate of Qingyang, local Magistrate of Anyang,

24
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,230
vice magistrate of Weihui and, now, local Magistrate of Zezhou.

25
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,380
Every post he held is near Zezhou.

26
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,880
If that is the case, he may have had his eyes set on our family 20 years ago.

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,430
I do not understand. Our family just does business.

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,660
What is worth him plotting for so long?

29
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,020
It was all about money. He coveted the Fang family's wealth.

30
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,010
Did he plot for twenty years just for our money?

31
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,760
Besides, our family had not built up a family fortune 20 years ago.

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,160
Zhenzhen, why did you change your name to Jiuling?

33
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,450
I remember now.

34
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,000
Jiuling is the name of the princess of the late emperor.

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,050
She was the late wife of Martial Moral Envoy Lu.

36
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,810
No wonder this name sounds familiar.

37
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,280
Zhenzhen knew Princess Jiuling. I believe she did it in memory of her.

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,330
Both of Zhenzhen and Princess Jiuling's parents passed away.

39
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,220
Princess Jiuling got married but didn't live long.

40
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,370
Zhenzhen got engaged but was rejected.

41
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,300
They're different, Grandmother.

42
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,180
Even though Zhenzhen isn't a princess,

43
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,740
I think she is living much better than a princess.

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,400
At least she's still alive.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,450
Grandmother, you two may go home first.

46
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,830
I need to go out to do something.

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,720
We're almost home.

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,570
Go after the welcoming banquet.

49
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,260
I'll definitely come back before the welcoming banquet.

50
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,990
Yuan Bao?

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,950
Isn't that Miss Jun?

52
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,620
Keep quiet.

53
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,750
- What are we doing?
- Stay put. Don't move.

54
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,330
Grandmother, Chengyu has come home safely .

55
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,250
It also seems that Elder Sister knows of nothing.

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,380
She has nothing to do with what Madam Su did.

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,800
Keeping her locked up like this, with her personality,

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,960
I'm afraid that she won't be able to take it any longer.

59
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,160
Grandmother. Mother.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,770
Considering she's a descendant of the Fang family,

61
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,770
please show some mercy.

62
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,440
Grandmother, I think Second Sister is right.

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,200
Let bygones be bygones.

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,570
Eldest Sister is not at fault. She should not be implicated.

65
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,070
Furthermore, I am standing here, perfectly well.

66
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,030
Jinxiu is bad-tempered and arrogant.

67
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,010
Actually, I had locked her up for her sake.

68
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,170
It's to prevent her from hearing rumors

69
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,480
and torturing herself every day.

70
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,980
Grandmother, I have an idea.

71
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,790
Maybe it'll work.

72
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,260
Elder Sister. Elder Sister.

73
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,810
It's me.

74
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,150
Chengyu?

75
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,410
- Chengyu?
- It's me.

76
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,080
- Can you really walk now?
- Yes, I've recovered.

77
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,780
- Does it hurt?
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

78
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,220
This is great!

79
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,240
By the way, on my way back,

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,900
I bought you a lot of toys.

81
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,630
Look. This little doll.

82
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,880
Look. Do you remember this?

83
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,780
Turns out you have gifts for me, too.

84
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,400
Of course, I have gifts for you.

85
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,820
What's wrong? What's wrong?

86
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,750
I don't think I'm qualified to call you my young brother now.

87
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,910
Nonsense. We all believe you.

88
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,580
I know you're innocent.

89
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,630
It's not about who believes me.

90
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,340
It's that I'm born with sins.

91
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,380
My birth...

92
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,060
was just her reason to stay in the Fang family.

93
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,850
Other than that,

94
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,110
I have no other use.

95
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,960
Believe me. None of us blames it on you or complains about you.

96
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,000
It is just that everything happened so suddenly.

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,250
We did not know how to deal with it all.

98
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,100
Yes, she gave birth to you.

99
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,190
But you have nothing to do with her now. You are you.

100
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,260
Also, since you were born,

101
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,040
you've been an independent individual.

102
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,420
Even if others murder people, ignite fires, and commit crimes,

103
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,570
as long as you didn't do any of those things, it has nothing to do with you.

104
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,220
Really?

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,050
Also, I have such a great sister

106
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,080
who knows how to read books, write characters,

107
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,330
look at accounting records, count rods,

108
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,470
and even deal with merchants.

109
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,340
You're smart and skillful.

110
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,050
You're my great sister, and you're forever my sister.

111
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,290
There are many things you may find difficult at the moment,

112
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,350
but they'll get better over time.

113
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,990
Look at me. Look.

114
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,030
I've recovered, haven't I?

115
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,060
Younger Brother.

116
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,520
- I want to leave the Fang family.
- Leave?

117
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,080
I'll no longer be the Eldest Young Miss of the Fang family, but Fang Jinxiu.

118
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,370
I'll start a new life as Fang Jinxiu.

119
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,750
Everything is fine now.

120
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,270
It has all passed now.

121
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,700
Enough.

[Fang Residence]

123
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,690
Eldest Sister, take good care of yourself after you leave here.

124
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,130
Rest assured. It is I, why would you worry?

125
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,400
It's just that from now on,

126
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,840
you need to take on more responsibilities for the family.

127
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,870
It's my duty.

128
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,690
I am leaving now.

129
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,620
Grandmother. Mother. Rest assured.

130
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,580
Elder Sister is very capable.

131
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,680
Let her do as she wishes

132
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,710
so she'll feel more at ease.

133
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,210
It'll be good for her to gain more experience and learn endurance.

134
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,910
We'll see when she is willing to come back.

135
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,280
Old Madam!

136
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,530
Old Madam, Miss is gone.

137
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,740
I looked for her everywhere but couldn't find her.

138
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,020
Don't cry. Hurry and tell us.

139
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,820
Did Li Changhong die?

140
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,220
It was done neatly. Nobody will find anything suspicious.

141
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,980
Are the men ready?

142
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,250
They should be here soon.

143
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,750
I have followed your orders and called them here from afar.

144
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,920
Everything was done very covertly.

145
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,730
Good.

146
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,570
This time, the people of the Fang family

147
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,430
shall be uprooted and eliminated.

148
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,270
Where's my hot water? So slow!

149
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,250
I apologize for the delay in the hot water.

150
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,270
You. What are you looking at?

151
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,860
I asked for this hot water first.

152
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,860
Is there more hot water?

153
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,210
Yes, yes. I'll deliver it to you later.

154
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,500
Deliver it in to the room for me.

155
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,210
Yes.

156
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,550
My Lord, she must have just been passing by

157
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,150
to deliver hot water to the other room.

158
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,680
This strange place.

159
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,950
Why do I keep feeling like something is not right?

160
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,140
Go. Ask the people working at this post house

161
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,830
- and confirm things.
- Yes.

162
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Officer, all the hired hands of the kitchen are here.

163
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,220
Does a young lady work here at the post house?

164
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,120
Except for her, all the servants here are male.

165
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,770
Not good.

166
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,620
My Lord, they escaped.

167
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,970
- After them!
- Yes.

168
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,640
How do you know Yuan Bao, and why were you following him?

169
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,740
I don't have time to explain now. I will tell you later.

170
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,720
If it were an ordinary person, then he would have been deceived and this would be over with.

171
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,760
However, Yuan Bao is different. Firstly, he is skilled in martial arts;

172
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,790
and secondly, he has an imperial edict with him at all times. Guards from the Martial Moral Ministry are bound to be protecting him.

173
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,680
Then, what should we do?

174
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,710
Create chaos and scatter the troops.

175
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,390
- You return to Zezhou as quickly as possible.
- What about you?

176
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,460
I have my own way.

177
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,620
Miss Jun, remember this. You owe me an explanation.

178
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,050
Zhu Zan!

179
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,960
What do we do?

180
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,490
It's been a whole night and we still have not found her.

181
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,840
Old Madam, what should we do?

182
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,740
Any news after reporting it to the local court?

183
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,220
The officials are helping to find her but they say she may have lost her way.

184
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,750
This is not a very serious matter and said...

185
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,960
- What did they say?
- They said that we are mobilizing so many people,

186
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,180
as if bandits are causing chaos

187
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,160
and wanting to upheave the city.

188
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,430
Old Madam, please think of a way to

189
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,080
find my lady.

190
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,650
I beg you.

191
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,610
For Jiuling, even if we upheave this city,

192
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,590
it's fine by me.

193
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,740
Bring me my cane.

194
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,740
Lord Magistrate, we have already informed you of all the clues we have gathered.

195
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,770
My Lord, please send men to search for her immediately.

196
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,290
The Fang family will certainly engrave your benevolence and favor in our hearts.

197
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,130
Say, Young Master Fang, there is no need for you to be so worried.

198
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,980
Young Mistress has only been away from home for a short period of time.

199
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,700
Rest assured. She will surely return home safely.

200
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,860
Should anything happen to Jiuling,

201
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,050
I, as her grandmother, will not be able to escape censure.

202
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,210
I must find her even if I have to turn this city upside down.

203
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,550
Lord Liu, please send men to look for her immediately.

204
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,140
Old Madam Fang, how serious can this be?

205
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,260
She hasn't been home for only a day.

206
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,260
Is it truly necessary to overturn the heavens?
(T/N: Idiom – to cause a huge fuss)

207
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,050
My granddaughter-in-law is our family's "Heaven".

208
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,210
Should anything happen to her, then the Fang family's "Heaven" will collapse.

209
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,120
Old Madam Fang, I'm begging you. I'm begging all of you from the Fang family.

210
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,660
Can you not make such a fuss?

211
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,560
"Setting your eyes on this written order is akin to seeing the prince in person. I exhort you to do your duty".

212
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,520
Old Madam Fang, may I see it?

213
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,570
"Setting your eyes on this written order is akin to seeing the prince in person. I exhort you to do your duty. – Chu Rang"

214
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,360
This humble subject apologizes for the offense!

215
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,610
This written order was given to my Fang Family when His Majesty was still a prince.

216
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,230
Now, he has succeeded to the throne and become the emperor.

217
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,980
Lord Liu, dare I ask if this written order is valid in your eyes?

218
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,290
It is valid, it is certainly valid!

219
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,680
"Setting your eyes on this written order is akin to seeing the prince in person. I exhort you to do your duty. – Chu Rang"

220
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,470
Lord Liu, please assist our family

221
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,350
in searching for our Young Mistress, Jun Jiuling.

222
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,400
This subject will obey the order!

223
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,570
I will take my leave now.

224
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,280
All of you, don't just stand here! Go and look for her!

225
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,890
Yes!

226
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,270
Grandmother, this written order...

227
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,710
I have already done all I can.

228
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,010
[Local Magistrate's Office of Zezhou]

229
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,810
You men head west of the city.

230
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,060
- You men...
- Grandmother.

231
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,030
...head east of the city.
-- Yes!

232
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,200
Set off!

233
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
Miss! You've returned!

234
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,740
Are you all right? The Old Madam sent us to look for you all night long.

235
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,060
- Grandmother.
- Where have you been all night?

236
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,700
I went to pick some medicinal herbs.

237
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,360
You...

238
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,620
You are so senseless.

239
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,150
Grandmother, it's great that Jiuling has returned safely.

240
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,060
She went to pick those medicinal herbs for my sake.

241
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,190
Look at yourself. You're no longer a child,

242
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,160
so why are you still so rash and careless?

243
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,450
You stayed out all night picking medicinal herbs.

244
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,430
Shouldn't you have informed your family members beforehand?

245
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,190
I was careless.

246
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,920
I did not keep the time in mind and caused you to worry, Grandmother.

247
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,190
Miss Jun isn't a physician,

248
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,670
- so why did she go to the mountains to pick medicinal herbs?
- Exactly.

249
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,230
Jiuling is a physician.

250
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,090
My legs were cured by her.

251
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,670
The Jun family is a family of physicians and she has inherited the responsibilities of her family.

252
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,030
It looks like His Majesty's written order

253
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,820
was presented at such an opportune moment.

254
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,800
What written order?

255
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,390
Grandmother, everything is fine now that she has returned safely.

256
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,250
Let's go home.

257
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:40,250
Jun Jiuling, your actions this time are very inappropriate.

258
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,660
- Grandmother, Jiuling–
- Chengyu,

259
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,010
don't talk back to your grandmother.

260
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,860
I did not think things through and have caused you to worry, Grandmother.

261
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,370
Grandmother, I have something...

262
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,390
All of you may go.

263
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,950
Yes.

264
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,020
Jiuling, stay behind.

265
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,590
The written order...

266
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,630
As for the written order, all you need to know is that it is real.

267
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,460
However, I have sworn not to tell anyone

268
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,620
the origins of the written order.

269
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,170
What I don't understand is why you would bring out the written order at this time.

270
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,970
When Father was in trouble, you did not bring out the written order.

271
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,660
When My Lord was in trouble, you did not bring out the written order either.

272
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,630
At the time, I did not know they were harmed by evildoers.

273
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,710
Grandmother was afraid I would be harmed by evildoers.

274
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,130
Then, why did you bring it out now?

275
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,520
Very simple. She can cure Chengyu's illness.

276
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,940
Our family is in debt to her.

277
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,920
Thank you, Grandmother.

278
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,650
Grandmother, I want to

279
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,060
ask you something.

280
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,570
I will leave now.

281
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,720
- Mother.
- Mother, how is Grandmother?

282
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,880
Don't worry. She is no longer upset.

283
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,980
It's good that she isn't angry anymore.

284
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,880
I know that she can make everyone like her.

285
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Of course.

286
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,560
Mother, since we didn't have the welcoming banquet yesterday, why don't we have a grander lunch today?

287
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,780
We'll celebrate today.

288
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,590
- Shaoyao, let everyone know.
- Yes.

289
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,850
Hold on. Warm up a pot of wine as well

290
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,740
since Jiuling is back safely.

291
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,880
Mother, I'll go get ready now.

292
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,630
Go ahead.

293
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,700
It's true that a man forgets about his mother after marrying a woman.

294
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,000
I didn't expect this day would come for me.

295
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,260
Mother, I'm not that kind of person.

296
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,780
Mother, before, you had suffered because of me.

297
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:47,660
Grandmother, I was delayed in my return to the city

298
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,230
because yesterday

299
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,140
I saw someone I shouldn't have seen on the streets.

300
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,230
- Who?
- A eunuch.

301
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,930
- Eunuch?
- Yes.

302
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,320
Eunuchs can't exit the palace casually.

303
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,630
Maybe you were mistaken.

304
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,500
I saw him before when I went to the palace with my father. There is no way I was mistaken.

305
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,460
Eunuchs cannot exit the palace on their own accord.

306
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,210
But what if they are under orders?

307
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,090
Even if it's true, it's nothing serious.

308
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,800
Our Fang family has His Majesty's written order.

309
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,890
It makes perfect sense for His Majesty to send his attendant here.

310
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,920
Grandmother,

311
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,820
one should not have intentions to harm others

312
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,540
but should have intentions to protect oneself.

313
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,000
In regards to all the things of this world, one cannot possibly be fully prepared

314
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,650
and there are no promises that cannot be changed.

315
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,680
That is the delight of living,

316
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,650
competing against Heaven and Earth.

317
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,700
Will you continue to deceive yourself even now?

318
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,220
You're well aware that His Majesty sent him here

319
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,970
not only to keep an eye on the Fang family,

320
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,350
but also to get rid of the Fang family.

321
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,420
I personally heard from the eunuch that His Majesty is acting against the Fang family.

322
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,610
To be frank, I've seen the seal in your casket.

323
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,580
It is related to the silver transported during the third year of Taiyan, right?

324
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,540
- How do you know that?
- If my guess is correct,

325
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,750
that batch of official silver

326
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,240
was never handed over to Northern Qi.

327
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,590
Back then, Chu Rang was still a vassal prince and Zezhou was his territory.

328
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,860
That batch of official silver passed through here on its way to Northern Qi.

329
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,290
However, Chu Rang did something in the midst of the transport.

330
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,790
Chu Rang delivered that batch of official silver to the Fang family

331
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,790
and it was the capital used to start the family business.

332
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,470
Later on, the Fang family recruited people for Chu Rang's army and made money for him.

333
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,410
However, as for his father and brothers kidnapped by Northern Qi,

334
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,750
he did not care about their lives at all.

335
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,890
The fewer people in his way, the better.

336
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,100
No, no.

337
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:47,140
Back then, our Fang family was confused and made a huge mistake.

338
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,680
We also got the punishment we deserved.

339
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,360
Chengyu's father and grandfather

340
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,050
died because of this.

341
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,610
Why? Why won't they let us go?

342
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,400
Why?

343
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,090
Grandmother,

344
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,070
have you never thought

345
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,790
that he's the one who has been harming the Fang family all these years?

346
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,640
I've suspected that,

347
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,690
but I had no evidence.

348
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,510
Chu Rang knows our Fang family still has the written order.

349
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,930
He won't harm us.

350
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,800
He won't harm our Fang family. He won't. He won't.

351
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,300
He won't harm our Fang family!

352
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,860
He won't. He won't.

353
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,180
Grandmother, to the Fang family,

354
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,280
the written order is no longer an assurance.

355
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,390
Our priority now should actually be resolving the problems that the written order brings with it.

356
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,590
We can no longer hide the Fang family's identity as an imperial merchant.

357
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,460
Firstly, everyone in Zezhou knows that you have brought out the written order,

358
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,780
which will surely fuel speculation.

359
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:32,070
Secondly, Chu Rang will definitely become suspicious after learning about that.

360
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,230
Who knows what he'll do next?

361
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,610
What should we do then?

362
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,740
In regards to hiding the official silver during the third year of Tiayan

363
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,480
and the identity of our family as an imperial merchant, let the public know.

364
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,710
Don't worry. I'll have someone arrange everything.

365
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,540
The farther it spreads, the better.

366
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,230
That way, Chu Rang surely will not dare make any rash moves.

367
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,140
Perhaps the Fang family can avoid being eliminated.

368
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,160
All right.

369
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,720
This is our Fang family's last resort

370
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,720
to get out of danger.

371
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,400
We'll listen to you.

372
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,920
I know how serious this matter is.

373
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,520
Nobody in the Fang family will know about it except you and me.

374
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,580
Rest assured.

375
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,460
Jiuling, our Fang family

376
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,030
has hope now.

377
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,070
She should be done talking to Grandmother now, right?

378
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,230
I'll go see her. She hasn't eaten all night.

379
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,190
She must be hungry.

380
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,050
Chengyu,

381
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,310
I need to tell you something.

382
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,170
What is it?

383
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,780
The marriage between you and Jiuling is fake.

384
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,060
Mother, don't say such lies.

385
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,900
It's true, Chengyu. In order to cure your illness without others noticing,

386
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,190
we let you two get married in the name of bringing good fortune.

387
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,450
Then why...

388
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,710
did she never tell me that?

389
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,290
She had to go through with it.

390
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,400
It would be unfair for her to be one to tell you, too.

391
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,420
So, because my legs are cured and she wants to leave,

392
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,280
you are allowed to tell me all this. Right?

393
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,110
No, Chengyu. It is not what you think.

394
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,490
I thought that since my legs are cured

395
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,060
and I can stand now, then I can be with her.

396
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,830
Turns out everything is fake.

397
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,540
Of course not. Your legs are cured and you can walk now.

398
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,840
All that is real.

399
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,650
I'd rather I not be cured.

400
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,160
Don't say such things out of anger, Chengyu.

401
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,790
Jiuling doesn't want to see you like this either.

402
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,590
You are an intelligent child.

403
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,550
Jiuling doesn't have romantic feelings for you.

404
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,810
You should know that in your heart.

405
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,720
You are a man.

406
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
You should be able to let go of things.

407
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,270
If something should be broken, then let it break. If something should be let go of, then let it go.

408
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,860
Mother, in regards to this matter,

409
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,360
we owe Jiuling an explanation.

410
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,790
We got married, bowed to Heaven and Earth, and offered sacrifices to the gods.

411
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,400
We even held a wedding banquet and invited everyone from the city to attend.

412
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,140
This matter cannot be fake just because we say so.

413
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,310
That is unfair to Jiuling.

414
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,700
Then, what you mean is to give her a divorce letter?

415
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,070
Not only that,

416
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,310
but I want everyone in the city

417
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,460
as well as Heaven, Earth, and the gods to know about it.

418
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,220
Only in this way will we be fair to Jiuling.

419
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,460
Because of me, she lied to Heaven and Earth, lied to the gods, and lied to everyone in the city.

420
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,240
Then I should tell Heaven, Earth, the gods, and everyone in the city

421
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,180
what a good person Jun Jiuling is

422
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,520
and what meritorious deeds she has done.

423
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,730
My Chengyu has grown up.

424
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,860
Miss.

425
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,210
Miss.

426
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,520
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

427
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,670
Are you done packing?

428
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,400
You can finally go to the capital to fulfill your wish.

429
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,750
Yes. I have wanted to go this whole time, and now, I can finally go.

430
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,310
However, I am still quite reluctant to leave.

431
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,270
Could it be that you'll miss Young Master?

432
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,920
What are you thinking of? I have always treated Chengyu as my younger cousin.

433
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,860
So, that's how it is.

434
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,800
Besides, the Fang family has always treated us well. Right?

435
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,980
Cousin.

436
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,180
- Chengyu.
- Young Master.

437
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,580
Miss, this is the first time I heard Young Master call you "cousin".

438
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,020
What is your reason for coming today?

439
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,960
There is something I want to talk to you about.

440
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,110
Go ahead.

441
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,160
I believe you will need this.

442
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,270
[Divorce Letter]

443
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,230
A divorce letter.

444
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,860
Thank you, Cousin, for protecting our Fang family.

445
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,420
There's no need for you to be so polite.

446
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,040
We are a family and don't need to be so polite with each other.

447
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,060
Cousin, are you leaving tomorrow?

448
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,730
Yes. Let's go outside for a stroll.

449
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,970
All right.

450
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:06,110
It is a long journey. You must be careful and take care of yourself.

451
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,310
I am not alone. I am taking Liu'er with me.

452
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,040
Then you have to look after Liu'er, too. Even more of a reason for you to take care of yourself.

453
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,230
Cousin, if you encounter any problems, just go to our store directly.

454
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,460
De Shengchang has branches located within the capital.

455
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,560
I'll coordinate things with them.

456
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,960
All right.

457
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,150
You came to see me today

458
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,450
because you're afraid I'll leave without saying goodbye. Right?

459
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,390
I was planning to go see you after packing everything up.

460
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,560
I didn't expect you to come to me first.

461
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,610
Then, can I ask you a question?

462
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,220
Go on.

463
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,500
Will you come back?

464
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,120
Why wouldn't I come back?

465
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,740
This is my home.

466
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,780
I will return after settling my matters.

467
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,910
"The swordsmen have been around for some time."
(T/N: a Chinese legend about swordsmen)

468
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,120
"Wei Niang is discussed as unique."

469
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,030
Everyone knows that those who do good are blessed.

470
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,390
She is not considered an outstanding lady.

471
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:55,100
All of you are familiar with the unique lady I am talking about.

472
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,120
Well-known in Zezhou, she is Miss Jun.

473
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,100
If I'm going to talk about why and how Miss Jun is unusual,

474
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,610
then I'll have to start from the very beginning, far back in time.

475
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,540
No need to discuss her breaking the engagement with Young Master Ning,

476
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,850
being in the limelight at Jinyun Restaurant,

477
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,460
nor finally marrying Young Master Fang.

478
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,720
This was all arranged by Miss Jun right from the beginning.

479
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,680
Everyone, be patient.

480
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,620
Let me tell the story slowly.

481
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,120
All this starts from Miss Jun's origins.

482
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,390
You only know that Miss Jun is the Fang family's granddaughter.

483
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,790
However, do you know that her Jun family is a family of physicians

484
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,430
who have passed down their skills for over 100 years?

485
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:44,330
Her father, Jun Yingwen, was a famous physician in Ru'nan.

486
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,330
Even if she hid away in her bedroom, she was already too entrenched in her family's medical teachings.

487
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,070
She is the successor of her family legacy as Ru'nan miraculous physician,

488
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,540
Jun Jiuling!

490
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:14,830
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

491
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:20,590
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

492
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:26,680
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

493
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:32,420
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

494
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,420
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

495
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,200
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

496
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,220
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

497
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,650
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

498
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,050
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

499
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,000
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

500
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,300
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

501
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,800
♫ If memories could speak ♫

502
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,750
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

503
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:19,540
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

504
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:47,390
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

505
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:53,210
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

506
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:59,270
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

507
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:04,610
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

508
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,030
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

509
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,070
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

510
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:16,320
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

511
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,730
♫ If memories could speak ♫

512
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,750
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

513
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:28,250
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

514
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,720
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

515
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,660
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

516
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,920
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

517
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,250
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

518
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,340
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

519
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:54,320
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
