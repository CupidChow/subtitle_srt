Yes.

It was the fault of the Ning family for insulting me first.

We were in the right.

This type of family, even if I marry into it, may not be a good thing.

Before doing this, you should have discussed it with us.

Say, why did this Zhu Zan run away?

212

Maybe it's because he was worried that he would be punished

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,200
What's going on?

327
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,430
How did you drive the carriage?

328
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,420
Miss, a hand cart was damaged

329
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,990
and is blocking the road.

330
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,980
Come.

331
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,330
What's going on?

332
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,470
The wheel of this hand cart is damaged. Take a detour.

333
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,840
Miss, what should we do?

334
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,010
Let's walk. We can take a stroll.

335
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,340
Miss, this is not appropriate. If any mishaps happen along the way,

336
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,850
I can't undertake this responsibility. It's better that I escort you...

337
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,160
It's fine. Don't worry.

338
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,610
Our young lady came from the capital and didn't get lost. How could she get lost in a small place like Zezhou?

339
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,360
- Let's go.
- Miss.

340
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,410
Liu'er,

341
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,530
it's the job of the carriage driver to escort his passengers safely.

342
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,780
Talk to him nicely in the future. Don't use such an attitude with him again.

343
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,480
Miss, you will be bullied by others with your good temper.

344
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,360
No. You are definitely that kind

345
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,450
who treats others politely when they do the same to you.

346
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,400
When others treat you in an arrogant manner, you will retaliate. Right?

347
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,170
Why do you say that?

348
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,820
Because you treated Old Lady Ning in this way.

349
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,900
Miss, I just passed by a pastry shop.

350
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,620
They looked delicious. Do you want to have some?

351
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,100
Go and buy them. I will wait here for you.

352
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,010
Miss, are you alone?

353
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,320
Remove your dirty hand from me.

354
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,440
How can such a beautiful lady with a good temper be so irritable?

355
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,040
Don't blame me for being impolite.

356
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,370
Impolite? I'm so scared.

357
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,030
She's being impolite to me. Everyone, take a look.

358
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,910
How could she do this? This is too much. In broad daylight, too.

359
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,190
What is she doing?

360
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,560
- Release me.
- Fine.

361
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,670
How insulting.

362
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Stop!

363
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,710
Look.

364
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,160
Let go.

365
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,400
Brat, mind your own business.

366
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,080
Are you all right?

367
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,560
Apologize to her.

368
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,850
Impossible.

369
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,140
I was wrong.

370
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,800
I was wrong.

371
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,320
Firstly, your apology was too soft.

372
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,590
Secondly,

373
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,390
your so-called apology was because

374
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm highly skilled in martial arts and you were helpless in this situation.

375
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,180
What do you want then?

376
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,740
Miss, what is your wish?

377
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,640
I want to report him to the officials.

378
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,550
Miss, I think today was a misunderstanding.

379
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,600
Why not reduce this major problem into a trivial matter? Miss, you are magnanimous.

380
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,920
He escaped.

381
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,340
This little thief was rather formidable.

382
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,730
Don't bother about me. It's fine.

383
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,590
Hey! Miss.

384
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,730
I helped you.

385
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,990
Shouldn't you help me, too?

386
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,380
I forgot to bring my money pouch. The account is not settled yet.

387
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,000
Can I please know your name?

388
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,300
I will pay my debt tomorrow.

389
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
No need.

390
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,400
Take it as repayment for your assistance today.

391
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,300
It's right and proper to repay debts.

392
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,000
I must pay my debt.

393
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Mister, do you know that person?

394
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,700
You must be joking. Of course, I don't know him.

395
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,800
The hand cart which was damaged and blocked the road was arranged by you, too. Right?

396
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,210
I think you must have misunderstood me.

397
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,200
I have seen this type of trick before.

398
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,700
Miss, since you know,

399
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,300
why would you pay for me? Why not just leave?

400
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,800
I just wanted to come and see what other tricks you had.

401
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,820
I indeed have another thing.

402
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,070
Is your father Jun Yingwen?

403
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,000
Do you know my father?

404
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,800
I have heard of him.

405
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,100
You are...?

406
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm Ling Jiu. "Ling" as in "rule" the kingdom. "Jiu" as in "when all's said and done".

407
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,600
Ling Jiu.

408
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,800
No matter when you come back,

409
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,400
write me a letter in advance and I'll wait for you at the city gate.

410
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,800
Really? You will wait no matter how long it is?

411
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,100
When have I ever lied to you?

412
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,800
But...

413
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,730
But if I'm gone for too long

414
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,600
and many years pass,

415
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,800
what should I do if you don't recognize me anymore?

416
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,000
When that time comes, if someone impersonates me,

417
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,200
don't be deceived.

418
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,200
I got it. I'll gift you a name so you will be the one and only.

419
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,600
I'm called Jiuling so you'll be called Ling Jiu. What do you think?

420
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Jiuling and Ling Jiu?

421
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,800
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

422
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,900
I like it very much!

423
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,660
Ling Jiu?

424
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,800
- Miss Jun?
 - It's you, Zhu Zan.

425
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
So, it's you.

426
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Miss Jun, are you all right?

427
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,500
Miss Jun, I was abrupt today because of someone.

428
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,390
Princess Jiuling.

429
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,800
I know your father and you just left the capital.

430
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,500
Have you seen Princess Jiuling?

431
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,500
I will never harm your father and Princess Jiuling.

432
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,400
Please believe me.

433
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,800
I do not know where they are.

434
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,000
The princess and I have known each other since we were young.

435
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,900
The princess's whereabouts are very important to me.

436
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,200
Where is your father?

437
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,600
I really do not know.

438
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,800
If you do not believe me, you may ask others.

439
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,500
I shall leave now.

440
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,590
You're back?

441
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Second Brother, how was it?

442
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,400
Your acting was too awful. People saw right through you.

443
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
Can people see through my acting?

444
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,200
This Miss Jun is very discerning.

445
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,000
What happened afterward?

446
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Have you found out anything related to Jun Yingwen or Princess Jiuling?

447
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Nothing?

448
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,900
What a waste.

449
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,000
I keep feeling like she is hiding something from me.

the previous innocent and bubbly Chu Jiuling is already gone.

461
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,550
The one that is still here, Jun Zhenzhen, is irrelevant to you.

462
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,800
On this journey of revenge, I must not implicate any innocent people.

463
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,800
If I'm careless, everyone in the Duke Cheng Residence will be consigned to eternal damnation.

However, you are not the same. Zhu Zan,

467
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,800
you don't need to go through all this for a dead person.

Although Princess Jiuling is dead,

did Jiuling teach her that?

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,400
Second Brother, don't think about it anymore. Rest.

479

Eat this. Try this one. It's very fresh.

Achieving one's aim by underhanded means to save the princess, is a crime of deceiving the monarch.

Then what should we do?

488
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,800
If Lord Jun and Jiuling are safe and they can't show themselves,

489
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,600
they will have problems with food and clothes.

490
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,600
If Jun Zhenzhen knows their whereabouts, then she will surely go there.

491
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,500
Miss, he seems to be Fang Chengyu,

492
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,600
the eldest son of the Fang family,

493
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:16,080
Are you the rumored cousin, Jun Zhenzhen?

494
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

495
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,800
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

496
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,700
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

497
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,800
♫ Allow me to weigh every word
for indescribable cause and effect ♫

498
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,600
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

499
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,600
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

500
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:08,400
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

501
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,400
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

502
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,800
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

503
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,090
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

504
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,000
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

505
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,600
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

506
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,920
♫ If memories could speak ♫

507
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,800
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

508
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,000
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

509
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,420
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

510
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:17,400
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

511
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,200
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

512
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,800
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

513
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,120
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

514
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,000
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

515
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,600
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in a deadlock with the sky ♫

516
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,820
♫ If memories could speak ♫

517
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,800
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

518
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,400
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

519
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,920
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

520
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,800
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

521
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,000
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

522
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,290
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

523
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,400
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

524
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,100
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
