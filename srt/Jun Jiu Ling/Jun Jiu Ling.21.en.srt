00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,400
♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,540
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,530
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,750
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,810
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,930
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,870
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:11,380
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,230
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,760
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:31,020
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,770
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

14
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,110
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:51,000
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regard, waiting for dawn ♫

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,630
♫ Dawn... ♫

[Jun Jiu Ling]

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,630
[Episode 21]

19
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,530
More than a hundred people were admitted to Qingshan Court recently.

20
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,340
Yesterday, more than a dozen died

21
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,410
and few were cured.

22
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,010
Medicinal halls near the capital have been submitting reports,

23
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,600
saying that the pox is spreading.

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,930
It's hard to calculate the number of deceased.

25
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,150
By the way, the Military Moral Ministry reported that

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,110
that several cattle have arrived to Qingshan Court.

27
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,880
It's said that Jun Jiuling wants to try the method of inoculation.

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,950
The Imperial Physicians Hall said they have never heard of it and are unable to make a decision.

29
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,340
Almost half a month has passed now.

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,750
The ministers have been talking,

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,280
saying that if Jun Jiuling fails at inoculation, she will merely die.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,340
However, if the pox spreads due to delays,

33
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,190
then the capital will be in danger.

34
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,230
We cannot wait for one month's time.

35
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,430
Order Lu Yunqi to give Jun Jiuling only seven more days.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,010
Once seven days are up,

37
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,380
he should know what to do.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,380
This is the secret message that just arrived.

40
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,860
[Seal Qingshan Court. If Jun Liuling cannot find the cure in seven days, burn the place down with the people. No mistakes allowed.]

41
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,290
Older Sister Jun.

42
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,100
Guo'er.

43
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,880
Wait a moment.

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,840
Older Sister Jun, you are not wearing your mask so I cannot get near you.

45
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,310
Is this all right?

46
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,370
Guo'er, what is it?

47
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,540
Older Sister Jun, my mother said that you are the miraculous physician who protects us.

48
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,730
You protect my mother and me so, of course, I need to protect you.

49
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,820
Why have you come here so late at night? Where is your mother?

50
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,380
Older Sister, I want to ask you to cure my mother.

51
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,380
She keeps crying. It must be very painful.

52
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,350
I promise you that

53
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,050
I will let you and your mother go home in good health. All right?

54
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,050
Older Sister Jun.

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,160
Older Sister Jun, my mother said it can keep one safe. I'm gifting it to you.

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,790
Let me take any new medicine that you have. I'm not afraid.

57
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,270
Thank you, Guo'er.

58
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,160
Do you know?

59
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,240
I have a younger brother your age.

60
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you miss him?

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,720
I miss him.

62
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,960
However, we must cure the smallpox

63
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,340
before we can go home to be reunited with our families.

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,190
Then... Guo'er, you must be good during the treatments.

65
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,520
Look! The smallpox on your face has improved a lot now.

66
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,980
You will be able to go home soon.

67
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,010
Go on. Your mother must be worried.

68
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,290
Older Sister Jun, I'm leaving now.

69
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,040
Miss! Miss!

70
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,210
The new prescription has shown results.

71
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,410
Our severe patients are showing obvious signs of improvement.

72
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,880
Good.

73
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,480
However, the number of new patient being sent here

74
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,920
are increasing.

75
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,460
I will try the inoculation.

76
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,700
Miss!

77
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,980
Miss, you cannot.

78
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,000
You still need to lead in this matter. You must not take this risk.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,050
In ancient times, Shennong tried all kinds of herbs. After that, Hua Tuo tried Chinese anesthesia drugs.
(T/N:Shennong and Hua Tuo were ancient Chinese physicians)

80
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,950
Besides, curing the pox is my duty.

81
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,120
But we have a shortage of physician to begin with.

82
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,970
Let's think of another way.

83
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,750
No need to think further. I have already decided.

84
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,610
Miss, think about it some more.

85
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,330
The Jun person.

86
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,670
Young Lord?

87
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,280
I will take my leave now.

88
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,090
Go on.

89
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,420
What is it?

90
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,530
I believe what you said today.

91
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,470
I have had no contact with the patients.

92
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,420
I can do the inoculation.

93
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,910
- No.
- Why not?

94
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,830
This is not child's play. It is a situation that even I cannot guarantee. If anything goes wrong, it will be death.

95
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,600
I know.

96
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,800
I have said this already.

97
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,290
If we're doomed, then count me in.

98
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,220
I said no. This is not up for discussion.

99
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,070
You have your important matters to do, and I also want to do something for the people.

100
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,320
- This is not your—
- Let me finish talking. As the Heir Apparent of Duke Cheng, I should be a role model.

101
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,780
If my inoculation is successful,

102
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,070
then the people won't have any fears in regards to inoculations.

103
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,660
You continue to save people.

104
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,730
I will pacify the hearts of the people.

105
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,520
No.

106
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,040
You must listen to me about this.

107
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,730
What—

108
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,360
Why are you here?

109
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,130
I'm ordered by His Majesty to supervise Qingshan Court.

110
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,230
I should ask you why you are here.

111
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,870
Does an imperial order allow you to

112
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,880
secretly go to a young lady's room late in the evening to eavesdrop?

113
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,660
Same for you.

114
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,810
I am not the only one who is not asleep so late in the night.

115
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,450
Lord Lu, I am not the same as you.

116
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,890
I'm here legitimately and honestly to discuss official matters.

117
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,530
What are your official matters?

118
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,380
Let's hear them.

119
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,050
This is the person you want to find.

120
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,120
The person I want to find?

121
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,960
Aren't you looking for someone to be inoculated?

122
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,190
He can.

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,680
Lord, have mercy! Lord, have mercy!

124
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,420
Looks like you want to use your subordinate to gain praise from His Majesty.

125
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,500
I am helping you.

126
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,500
Scram.

127
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,030
He committed a crime,

128
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,440
so he will be sent to prison sooner or later.

129
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,980
I'm merely bringing forward the time of punishment.

130
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,760
May I ask, what has he done?

131
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,390
Physician Jun, Li Ze stole all the personal items of the corpses

132
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,760
you buried in the back of the court during his night shift,

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,130
and he was prepared to sell them off the mountain.

134
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,060
Lord Lu, I was momentarily possessed. That's why I did that.

135
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,570
Spare me. Spare—

136
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,290
Suppose he sold those stolen items carrying the pox in the capital.

137
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,850
The outcome would be unimaginable.

138
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,540
Using him for the inoculation is reasonable, is it not?

139
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,850
Physician Jun, I was wrong.

140
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,420
Physician Jun, I was wrong! I was wrong!

141
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,490
I was wrong, Physician Jun! I was wrong!

142
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,760
Lord Lu, I do not force people to do anything.

143
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,440
The inoculation must be done willingly. Please go back.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,700
Since that is the case, a useless thing like this

145
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,190
doesn't need to be sent to prison.

146
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,660
Let's go.

147
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,470
Spare my life, Lord! Have mercy! Spare me!

148
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,050
Your subordinates

149
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,120
all have cunning, petty tricks up their sleeves.

150
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,830
They are quite similar to their master in that they cannot be kept.

151
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,490
He's more useful than you.

152
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,310
What? How about you try it?

153
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,370
Lord Lu,

154
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,990
I am not the same as you.

155
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,200
I don't have that many subordinates who will sell their lives for me.

156
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,070
I can only volunteer myself.

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,610
Young Lord.

158
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:42,260
Lord Lu, could it be that you want to stay here to be inoculated with me?

159
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,980
Physician Jun, you still have seven days.

160
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,100
There's not much time left. You have no choice.

161
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,320
- Have you really decided?
- Bring it on.

162
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,320
Is it because of me?

163
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,080
Duke Cheng devoted himself to this nation and its people. What he has passed down

164
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,400
is not simply just his blood. As the son of Duke Cheng,

165
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,370
I do not care about glory or wealth. What I care about is

166
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,640
the people of the world.

167
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,100
The people in the imperial city are not suffering miserably from the pox.

168
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,940
However, those outside the imperial city are uncertain of their lives.

169
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,000
They are defenseless.

170
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,890
How can you let me feel embarrassed to dedicate my service to the nation?

171
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,770
If it were you, would you be at peace?

172
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,780
Here.

173
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,930
Zhu Zan,

174
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,530
once this enters your body, I cannot control it.

175
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,030
How is it?

176
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,430
How do you feel?

177
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,140
- A bit thirsty.
- Thirsty?

178
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,840
I want to eat this.

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,750
Tangerines?

180
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,340
I'll peel it for you.

181
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,090
Give me your hand.

182
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,720
How do you feel right now?

183
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,240
All right.

184
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,710
Do you feel hot?

185
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,100
Not really.

186
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,950
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for
an indescribable cause and effect ♫

187
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,440
Listen. Go to sleep in a bit.

188
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,280
Make sure you have energy. I will keep watch here. You must call me if there are any problems. Understand?

189
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,370
Do you want to eat more tangerines?

190
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,060
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

191
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,110
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

192
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,900
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me
I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

193
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,970
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in a deadlock with the sky ♫

194
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,900
♫ If memories could speak ♫

195
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,780
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

196
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,690
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

197
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,640
Lord Lu, I have been ordered to be here as a reinforcement.

198
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,820
These two rows over there. These two rows over there.

199
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,020
My Lord, on the surface, it seems like they are here as reinforcement.

200
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,810
Could it be that even we will be...

201
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,160
♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

202
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,370
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

203
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,350
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

204
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,660
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

205
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,580
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

206
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,770
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

207
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,750
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

208
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:29,020
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars ♫

209
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,930
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

210
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,470
Jiuling, the pox is very aggressive,

211
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,010
but you have always been meticulous in every step you take.

212
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,160
This can also be just like in the past

213
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,770
where the medicine cures the disease and people are brought back to life.

214
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,580
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

215
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,980
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

216
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:05,280
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you without any regard, waiting for dawn ♫

217
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,370
Miss Jun, you were always able to escape danger in the past.

218
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,110
This time, you will surely be able to successfully treat the pox.

219
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,750
Go to sleep for a bit.

220
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,250
How is he?

221
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,390
I just looked at him. He is still feverish.

222
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,450
It seems that he is developing rashes now.

223
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,860
Is this good news or bad news?

224
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,940
Currently, it is considered good news.

225
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,400
Miss, you have exhausted these days, taking care of patients and the young lord.

226
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,480
How about you go rest? I am here.

227
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,930
You have not slept either. Go sleep for a bit. I will stay to take care of him.

228
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,410
- Miss.
- Physician Jun! Physician Jun!

229
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,580
Physician Jun, there is a new patient.

230
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,740
- What is it?
- I have never come across the symptoms before so I'm a bit perplexed.

231
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,810
Hurry. When his temperature is reduced, don't touch his scabs. Notify me if anything new occurs.

232
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,050
- All right, Miss.
- Let's quickly go.

233
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,870
Physician Jun, here.

234
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,410
Physician Jun is here! Move aside.

235
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,480
- Please move aside.
- Physician Jun, this is the new patient.

236
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,320
She keeps foaming at the mouth. Her symptoms are different from the rest of the patients.

237
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,170
She has symptoms of cold diarrhea. We cannot continue to use periostracum cicada, or she will get worse.

238
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,820
- What prescription should we use then?
- We must first stabilize her.

239
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,740
Use costus! Pound it into a powder and decoct it until it is reduced to four-fifth of a cup. Go now.

240
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,580
I'm going now.

241
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,020
Let's suppress her symptoms first.

242
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,060
There haven't been any deaths recently. Does this mean we have controlled the pox now?

243
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,900
We mustn't let our guards down. Increase the monitoring of everyone.

244
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,500
Yes, I am Jun Jiuling.

245
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,290
Your prescription is ready.

246
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,870
She has never been in your dreams, right?

247
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,280
Who exactly are you?

248
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,130
My Lord, tomorrow is the deadline.

249
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,630
The greased wood used to ignite fires has been prepared.

250
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,370
You may leave.

251
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,750
Yes.

252
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,520
Physician Feng, add some ginseng and angelica sinensis to his prescription.

253
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,670
The blood pus from the smallpox can be released quicker. Thank you for your help today.

254
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:57,160
Miss! Miss! The young lord's condition has changed. Hurry and come take a look.

255
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,330
- Keep watch for me.
- All right.

256
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,620
Zhu Zan. Zhu Zan.

257
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,740
- What is going on?
- Just now, he was all right.

258
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,060
He suddenly became like this.

259
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,480
- The smallpox didn't fully erupt.
- What should we do?

260
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,140
The pox is still in his body.

261
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,040
Then, the young lord...

262
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,600
Let's see if he can overcome this. He can only get through it on his own.

263
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,500
Zhu Zan. Zhu Zan.

264
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,970
- Young Lord.
- Zhu Zan!

265
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,760
Zhu Zan!

266
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,550
Zhu Zan.

267
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,590
Young Lord!

268
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,320
Miss. What are you doing, Miss?

269
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,130
Miss!

270
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,520
Zhu Zan.

271
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:06,090
Zhu Zan, I'm here with you. You promised me

272
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,750
to succeed in the inoculation and save the people.

273
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,460
You promised me that we will advance and retreat together.

274
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,960
You cannot go back on your promises.

275
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,590
- Zhu Zan.
- Jiuling!

276
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,740
Jiuling.

277
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm here.

278
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,640
Ling Jiu.

279
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,450
Ling Jiu.

280
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,030
I'm here.

♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

283
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,550
Ling Jiu, promise me.

284
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,270
Nothing can happen to you.

285
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,670
You haven't completed your drawing of the capital's road map.

286
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,460
The pastries from that shop tasted terrible.

287
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,160
But I still want to go to that grilled meat shop we went to last time.

288
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,090
I'm waiting for you to take me there.

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,630
I thought that I had been through life and death,

294
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,970
so nothing could scare me.

295
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,520

As long as you can wake up,

I will tell you everything. All right?

315

In Zezhou, my horse got startled.

You saved me one time.

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,840
In Jinyun Restaurant, there were assassins.

318
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,630
You saved me another time. At the cliff near Ru'nan,

319
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,360
you saved me yet another time.

320
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,240
When Yuan Bao almost found me,

321
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,560
you also saved me.

322
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,110
When Lu Yunqi caused trouble at Jiuling Hall...

323
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,130
Zhu Zan, you have saved me so many times.

324
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,600
Let me save you one time.

325
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,040
Let me save you one time. All right?

326
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,510
You–

327
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,640
Z-Zhu Zan.

328
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,240
Zhu Zan.

329
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,880
Are you awake?

330
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,980
The pox has completely erupted.

331
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,280
The pox has completely erupted.

332
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,610
When I was asleep,

333
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,070
you pushed my clothes aside

334
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,550
and took a good look. Right?

335
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,780
You seem to be experienced.

336
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,770
Did you hear everything?

337
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,950
I don't know.

338
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,730
I had a nightmare.

339
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,940
I dreamed that Jiuling

340
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,690
was in a big fire.

341
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,910
Say, in that moment,

342
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,450
how painful it must have been for her.

343
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,650
I will get you water.

344
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,950
Lord Lu.

345
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,520
Chu Jiuling.

346
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,150
Are you back?

347
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,790
I don't know what you are talking about.

348
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,780
Of course, you know.

349
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,880
Do you believe in reincarnation?

350
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,490
- I don't believe it.
- I believe it.

351
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,470
You know.

352
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,610
I am Jun Jiuling.

353
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,710
Chu Jiuling.

354
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,420
Why are you afraid to admit who you are?

355
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,100
I don't know what you mean.

356
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,090
You should know what I mean.

357
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,640
You are still alive, right?

358
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Lord Lu, you're not fulfilling your duties. Are you not afraid of being punished by His Majesty?

359
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,550
Is that important?

360
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,170
I only care about you.

361
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,040
Who you care about has nothing to do with me.

362
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,750
I am not who you are looking for. I am busy decocting medicine. Please do not disturb me.

363
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,970
Did Zhu Zan call you Jiuling when he was unconscious?

364
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,010
You responded, didn't you?

365
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,580
It looks like you not only neglect your duties but also eavesdrop.

366
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,230
Yes. I replied to him. He called for me.

367
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,980
Even if it were not me,

368
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,780
what is wrong with me replying to him out of consideration of the risk he took to test the inoculation?

369
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,860
You came a long way to the capital to open Jiuling Hall.

370
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,320
I've forced you to change your name several times, but you would not change it.

371
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,410
There is also your prescription. Your handwriting is the exact same as hers.

372
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,900
Last time, at Prince Huai residence,

373
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,790
you looked more worried than Princess Jiuli.

374
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,370
Can you stop pretending?

375
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,410
- I don't want to guess anymore.
- Lord Lu,

376
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,230
these are all your speculations. That's all.

377
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,020
She and I are different people. Whatever I do, I don't need to explain to you.

378
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,250
You can fool others, but not me.

379
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,420
What do you want so you'll let me go?

380
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,520
I will never let you go.

381
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,050
I know you miss her very much, but she's already gone.

382
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,140
Even if she were alive, she wouldn't want to see you treating me like this. Right?

383
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,050
Lord Lu, face reality.

384
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,300
Have you ever loved someone?

385
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,410
Jun Jiuling and the other physicians at Qingshan Court have successfully found a treatment for smallpox.

386
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,230
Zhu Zan personally tested the inoculation.

387
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,690
He actually survived.

388
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,940
Do you think this is good news or bad news?

389
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,860
I'm slow-witted.

390
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,820
If Your Majesty says it is good, then it is good news.

391
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,660
If Your Majesty says it is bad, then it is bad news.

392
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,470
Getting rid of the pox can save so many people.

393
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,960
Of course, it is good news.

394
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,190
Our nation is truly blessed.

395
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,650
Zhu Zan seems to have made a great contribution.

396
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,360
Say, if I heavily reward him now,

397
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,590
what would Duke Cheng do?

398
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,150
Based on Duke Cheng's personality,

399
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,430
he would surely reject it,

400
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,180
saying it is his son's duty.

401
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,750
Don't think that he is just a military commander.

402
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,720
In this imperial court, he is

403
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,890
one of the few sensible people.

404
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,320
Throughout the ages,

405
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,330
there are not many military officers

406
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,810
with great meritorious service and a good reputation.

407
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,180
Although Duke Cheng is a transparent person,

408
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,170
only you can see through his plan.

409
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,230
Your Majesty is the only true

410
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,530
sensible person in the world.

411
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,210
This type of person

412
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,170
is the most terrifying.

413
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,170
- Physician Jun.
- You have worked hard.

414
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,730
Physician Jun, please check if the ratio of the medicinal herbs is correct.

415
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,270
Is this the prescription that we discussed yesterday?

416
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,900
It's fine.

417
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,660
Physician Jun, please check this prescription to see if there are any herbs missing.

418
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,610
Add two more maces of ginseng and angelica sinensis.

419
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,260
- Go on.
- All right.

420
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,000
Hold this well.

421
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,480
Here, here. Be careful, it's hot.

422
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,370
What are you doing here?

423
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,090
You don't have a mask. Quickly go back.

424
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,130
Did you forget that I had the inoculation?

425
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,310
I forgot.

426
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,040
How do you feel now?

427
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,830
I'm much better.

428
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,300
You haven't slept for days now, right?

429
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,050
You've worked hard.

430
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,020
There are so many people here in public. What are you doing?

431
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,770
I'm checking the smallpox.

432
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,980
Who wants to look at you?

433
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,890
You are recovering very well.

434
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,320
Looks like this prescription is effective.

435
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,760
So, have we succeeded?

436
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,350
It is not considered a success yet. We still need to try it on the children.

437
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,930
Do we still need to try it on the children?

438
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,520
That's right.

439
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,370
You will need to suffer again later.

440
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,390
I won't refuse under any circumstances.

441
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,270
The pox's toxin in the young lord is reduced

442
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,830
and safer. However, everyone, remember this.

443
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,880
The rashes from inoculation are considered good only if they are big with a waxy appearance.

444
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,710
- Understood.
- Big.

445
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,680
Then I shall hand the young lord over to everyone.

446
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,550
All right. Don't worry.

447
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,030
Everyone, everyone.

448
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,040
- Be gentle.
- Don't be afraid.

449
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,980
- Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
- Come on.

450
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,560
Come here.

451
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,910
Miss Jun!

452
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,790
Miss Jun!

453
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,020
Let us take a look.

454
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,630
Your Majesty, Young Lord Zhu requests to see you.

455
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,350
What?

456
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,460
He's here?

457
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,060
Isn't he afraid to spread the smallpox in the palace?

458
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,990
Who allowed him to come here?

459
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,770
This Lu Yunqi is really neglecting his guarding duties.

460
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,530
He dared to release him.

461
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,230
The servants of the palace are useless, too.

462
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,400
I won't see him. Tell him to leave.

463
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,750
Your Majesty, the young lord said that what you are worried about will not happen for sure.

464
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,590
He is here to discuss serious matters.

465
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,080
It's about the criminal Zhou Bentang.

466
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,390
- Let him in.
- Yes.

467
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,590
Don't these servants know who to let in and who not to?

468
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,400
Young Lord, if you have anything to say, you can do so from there.

469
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,480
Your Majesty, I have already been successfully inoculated.

470
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,020
I will not be infected again, and I will not infect others.

471
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,890
Hurry in.

472
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,730
- Yes.
- Young Lord, please don't mind.

473
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,460
It's just that the pox is very aggressive and dangerous.

474
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,810
What is it? Is the inoculation a success?

475
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,370
That is great news!

476
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,210
Heir Apparent, you have made a tremendous contribution.

477
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,960
The success of the inoculation is not of my doing,

478
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,710
but the work of Physician Jun.

479
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,950
I will definitely reward everyone.

480
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,810
Your Majesty, I'm not here for a reward.

481
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,450
I have a request.

482
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,060
I ask for your permission to let me take Zhou Bentang's descendants.

483
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,670
Why?

484
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,510
To take them to Qingshan Court to be inoculated.

485
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,700
The children of the Zhou family...

486
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,330
The Zhou family committed

487
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,210
the capital crime of treason.

488
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,920
Right now, wanting to take them from the prison for those on death row,

489
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,860
you are sparing the descendants of the Zhou family.

490
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,330
Your Majesty, please understand. My only intention is to treat the pox.

491
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,410
I don't have any selfish reasons.

492
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,420
Isn't the inoculation a success?

493
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,240
Your Majesty, the inoculation is indeed a success,

494
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,040
but only for adults.

495
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,940
Children and adults have different physiques.

496
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,240
The medicines and methods used for them are also different.

497
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,760
Hence, we still need to make adjustments.

498
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,910
There are many people on death row.

499
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,710
Just choose any of them.

500
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,550
Why must you insist on using the children of the Zhou family?

501
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,930
Your Majesty, according to Physician Jun,

502
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,890
the children for the inoculation test have to be ten years old or younger.

503
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,830
As for those on death row in the prison, the only ones who meet this requirement

504
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,030
are Zhou Bentang's descendants.

505
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,320
Young Lord, this is an easy task.

506
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,830
Just buy any children from the market.

507
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,170
Your Majesty, we cannot.

508
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,830
There is still hope of survival for those children.

509
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,530
If the inoculation fails and word spreads, then it will affect Your Majesty's reputation.

510
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,820
They are on death row anyway. Even if they die,

511
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,100
it would be more meaningful for them to die from the inoculation.

512
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,360
I'm telling you to buy the children from the market.

513
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,510
- What does this have to do with His Majesty?
- Enough, enough.

514
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,970
It is just two children.

515
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,400
I permit your request.

516
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,150
As long as the pox can be eradicated,

517
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,760
more children can be saved.

518
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,210
Go on.

519
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,090
Thank you, Your Majesty.

520
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,470
I will take my leave.

521
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,250
- Miss, this is the tonic prescription I gathered as you said.
- Here. Look.

522
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,630
Gather the ingredients based on this. Gather a few sets.

523
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,990
- Okay.
- Hurry.

524
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,070
He is disobeying an imperial decree by leaving Qingshan Court on his own accord.

525
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,340
Disobeying a decree means death.

526
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,810
Why are you here, Lord Lu?

527
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,510
What do you think?

528
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,620
I've been discussing matters with the other physicians here in the hall this whole time.

529
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,600
I really have no idea.

530
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,660
Fine. Then tell Zhu Zan to come out.

531
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,590
I have something to ask him.

532
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,130
If you're looking for the young lord, then go ask him yourself. Why ask me?

533
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,280
Are you saying you are unwilling to go get him?

534
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,590
- So, is it a success?
- Not yet.

535
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,290
We need to test it on children.

536
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,820
Do we still need to test the inoculation on children?

537
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,750
Did he really go out to look for children for the inoculation?

538
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,920
You are all helping Zhu Zan, thus disobeying the imperial decree.

539
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,890
You all must die.

540
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,870
