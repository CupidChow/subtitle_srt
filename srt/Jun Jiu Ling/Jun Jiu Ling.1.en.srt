[Red Phoenix Gate]

20
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,460
Emperor Zhizong of Tianyou has passed away.

21
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,600
His young brother, Chu Rang, ascended the throne. Not long after,

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,140
Zhizong's second daughter, Princess Jiuling,

23
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,260
according to an imperial edict, married beneath her to the Commander of the Martial Moral Ministry,

24
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,060
Lu Yunqi.

25
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,630
May you live a long life, Your Majesty.

27
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Jiuling, what is wrong?

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,620
It's such an auspicious day, what's going on with you?

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,060
Chu Rang, why did you kill my imperial father?

30
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,200
Why do you say that?

31
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
I have already found out the truth.

32
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,100
My imperial father passed away because of your poisonous hands.

33
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,020
Killing an innocent person, you are so vicious!

34
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
The Imperial Physicians Hall has long come to a conclusion.

35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,200
Imperial Brother returned to Heaven because his chronic illness relapsed.

36
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,910
Could it be that you have heard some rumors?

37
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,490
Did you go to the imperial study the day my imperial father passed away?

38
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,030
After you left there,

39
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,800
did my imperial father return to Heaven because his chronic illness relapsed?

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,550
However, why did his neck have bright red strangulation marks?

41
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,880
It's him, Chu Rang!

42
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,640
It's he who killed my father!

43
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,190
You have been instigated by people, right?

44
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,160
You—

45
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,610
It's you who killed my imperial father.

46
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,930
Yes.

47
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,770
What will you do?

48
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,190
Have you found who told Jiuling of the matter?

49
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,830
- How's Jiuling?
- Replying to Your Majesty. We have placed severe punishment on her,

50
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,020
yet she will not confess.

51
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,830
I have checked thoroughly.

52
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,160
A maidservant named Bing'er has escaped.

53
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,440
Tell me. How should this Jiuling be disposed of?

54
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,350
This...

55
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,120
Your Majesty must have already decided long ago.

56
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,320
I am just worried about

57
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,720
the fact that this Chu Jiuling has an older sister and a younger brother.

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,550
Could it be that the three of them participated in this matter together?

59
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,870
No.

60
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,560
Among the three siblings,

61
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,430
Jiuli is the most innocent and Jiurong is not of age yet.

62
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,860
Only this Jiuling...

63
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,790
is extremely intelligent and meticulous.

64
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,230
She was doted on most by my imperial brother.

65
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,190
May I be so bold as to say, if she's so extremely intelligent,

66
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,510
then why would she...

67
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,260
Try to assassinate me?

68
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,880
If she had succeeded in the assassination, then her wish would have come true.

69
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,390
Since it wasn't a success, then she's asking for death.

70
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,640
If she dies, then I'll be at the mercy of the public and I cannot do anything to Jiuli or Jiurong.

71
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,460
See?

72
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,210
Is this child simple?

73
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,190
She is not simple at all.

74
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,940
I had Lu Yunqi marry her...

75
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,270
as a precaution.

76
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,010
Since she won't say, then there's no need to continue asking.

77
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,230
I understand.

78
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,090
This time, don't let anyone else escape.

79
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,440
I deserve to die.

80
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,220
Chu Jiuling, wake up and eat. After you eat, we'll send you on your way (to death).

81
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,400
Father, the guards outside have fainted but we must be quick.

82
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,970
All right.

83
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,200
Jiuling.

84
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,490
- Jiuling.
- Jiuling.

85
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,450
How could they harm you to this state?

86
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,490
- Her life is not in danger for now. Let's leave here immediately.
- All right.

87
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,400
Let's go. Hurry.

88
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,200
My Lord, when I was on duty, I heard with my own ears

89
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,940
that His Majesty wants to kill Princess Jiuling.

90
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,230
Father, walk quickly.

91
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,720
Come on.

92
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,470
This way.

93
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,580
Wait, Father.

94
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,750
Once the people from the Martial Moral Ministry find Jiuling missing, they will search the entire capital for sure.

95
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,020
At that time, none of us will be able to escape.

96
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,720
I, Zhenzhen, am not filial. I shall be your daughter again in another life.

97
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,850
Jiuling, we have learned medicine from Father for many years.

98
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,860
We have long been a family.

99
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,600
The late emperor had been extremely gracious to my Jun family.

100
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,330
Having the chance to repay that grace now is our Jun family's fortune.

101
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,870
You must live well for me.

The water is here!

110
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,360
What?

111
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,440
Jiuling died in a big fire?

112
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,250
When I got there, I was too late.

113
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,540
How did the prison catch fire?

114
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,420
I failed at my duty. When I was not aware,

115
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,300
the princess set herself on fire.

116
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,410
Herself on fire?

117
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,560
Jiuling is one of my most beloved nieces.

118
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,070
Since young, she was obedient and sensible.

119
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,080
Later on, she lived outside the palace for many years

120
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,360
and became arrogant.

121
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,330
She actually... She actually tried to assassinate me.

122
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,000
Since she is no longer with us,

123
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,420
I will not punish others for her crimes

124
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,820
nor continue to pursue this matter any further.

125
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,590

Jiuling,

130
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,480
I used a secret technique to change your appearance and voice.

131
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,350
But sadly, your previous face and voice...

132
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,050
Master,

133
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,030
- what about Zhenzhen?
- Zhenzhen...

134
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,210
has died.

135
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,640
Zhenzhen stayed in the prison for you and set a fire to cover it up.

136
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,920
That was the only way everyone would believe that you died.

137
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,060
These years of you secretly learning medicine by my side

138
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,570
has been my and Zhenzhen's happiest years.

139

The late emperor was so kind to me. You were in trouble.

How could Zhenzhen and I just stand by and watch?

141
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,050
Jiuling, our Jun family has willingly repaid that kindness.

Don't let her sacrifice go to waste.

As of today, your appearance has been changed to Zhenzhen's.

This was a last resort

158
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,300
but it's also a blessing in disguise.

159

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,100
Imperial Father died tragically in Chu Rang's hands.

164
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,710
Princess!

165
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,240
Bing'er, where did you go?

166
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,550
Everyone's trying to find you.

167
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,490
Princess, I have something to report!

168
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,220
Before the late emperor died,

169
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,000
His Majesty entered the palace with Commander Lu.

170
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,600
and...

171
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,980
and had an argument with the late emperor.

172
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,040
It turned into a violent dispute.

173
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,560
A violent dispute?

174
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,010
What were they arguing about?

175
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,650
I don't know the reason but

176
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,560
I personally saw, after the late emperor died,

177
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,400
there were strangulation marks on his neck; definitely not natural death as the imperial physician said.

178
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,250
[Here will lay the spirit of the deceased emperor]

179
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,280
Master...

180
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,060
I can't let this go.

181
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,730
Child, the heavens have their own plan.

182
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,570
But you must live on in order to get justice.

183
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,070
You must cherish your life.

184
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,980
Live on...

185
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,410
Yes... live on.

186
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,600
Master, you lost your daughter because of me.

187
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,210
From now on, I will be Jun Zhenzhen

188
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,870
- I will live on for Zhenzhen.
- Good.

189
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,100
- Only through living can I get justice.
- Good.

190
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,270
Good child.

191
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,900
Master...

192
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,600
Master...

193
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,770
Master!

194
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,710
Master!

195
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,290
Master! Master!

196
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
Master!

197
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,500
Master! Master!

198
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,120
Master!

199
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,630
You're awake! Master!

200
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,140
Master, it's me, Jiuling.

201
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,240
- Master...
- When I saw the immortal flower,

202
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,930
I was so overjoyed.

203
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,660
I wasn't careful with my footing,

204
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,970
and fell down the mountain.

205
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,600
Don't talk anymore, save your energy.

206
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll take you back.

207
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,560
Hold on.

208
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,890
Hang on.

209
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,920
- Jiuling!
- Master.

210
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,310
There's no use, no use.

211
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,890
Just hold on, hold on!

212
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,020
Jiuling, this is my Jun family seal

213
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,970
that has been passed down through the generations.

214
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,890
Take it.

215
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,800
From now on, you're no longer Princess Jiuling.

216
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,450
You are Jun Zhenzhen.

217
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,830
No, no, I'm not anyone.

218
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,760
I only want Master to survive. Do you hear that?

219
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,330
- Master...
- There's something...

220
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:30,170
I have to leave it to you.

221
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,200
Jiuling, in my records,

222
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,280
there’s a seal that the late emperor handed to me before his death

223
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,110
It's about the murder of the late emperor's father by the Northern Qi people three years into his rule.

224
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,150
The emperor had suspected that this matter was related to Chu Rang.

225
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,640
So, he wanted me to investigate. Not long after,

226
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,720
he was killed by Chu Rang.

227
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,080
I believe this is the reason for Chu Rang's troubles.

228
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,320
It's also Chu Rang's weakness.

229
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,570
Now that you are weak, you must not return to the capital hastily or you will fall into a trap by yourself.

230
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,110
It's better to go to Zezhou first and investigate the matter thoroughly.

231
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,610
The Fang family, which Zhenzhen’s maternal grandfather is from, is a big family with big business in Zezhou.

232
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,250
That's the best way to protect yourself.

233
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,460
[Jun Yingwen]

234
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,260
[Third Year of Taiyan, seal]

235
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,850
Chu Rang,

236
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,870
I'll get justice for my imperial father.

237
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,760
Let the whole world know the truth.

238
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,210
Ten miles south, at the Blue Cloud Worn Inn,

239
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,140
Ru'nan's maid, Liu'er,

240
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,270
will wait there for you.

241
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,110
[Blue Cloud Worn Inn]

242
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,270
Let me go!

243
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,510
What are you trying to do in broad daylight?!

244
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,720
What are you doing? Should I sell you for rent?

245
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,210
Do you have any rules? I'm going to report you!

246
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,390
You stayed here and ate for free for a month, yet you want to report me?

247
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,510
Who lied to you? My Lady will be here soon!

248
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,970
If my money hadn't been stolen before, I wouldn't owe you anything!

249
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,280
Right, right. Keep lying.

250
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,990
How many times have I heard it already?

251
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,840
Your Master and Young Lady, some Ru'nan military family,

252
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,960
are having you wait here for them.

253
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,830
I shouldn't have believed you, to begin with!

254
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,750
Our Old Master, the miracle physician, has been reborn.

255
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,460
He just wanted me to wait here for him. He'll definitely come!

256
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,490
How much does she owe? I'll pay.

257
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,920
My Lady, we're finally united.

258
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,400
All these years we haven't seen each other, you've gotten even prettier.

259
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,330
Our old servants didn't want to wait anymore.

260
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,280
They stole my money and ran off.

261
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,580
But now that we're together, everything will be fine.

262
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,100
Nobody will harm us anymore.

263
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,610
Don't cry anymore. You've had a stressful time.

264
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm going to seek shelter at Grandfather's place.

265
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,950
If you'd like, you can come with me.

266
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,500
Yes! I'll go wherever you go.

267
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,260
However, that place is a merchant's house.

268
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,210
I'm afraid that once you get to Zezhou, you will be miserable.

269
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,060
Whether it's a family of officials or merchants, I do not care.

270
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,610
My identity isn't important either.

271
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,510
Eat it. I'm not hungry.

272
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,390
Eat more. After we eat, we will go to Zezhou.

273
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,810
You have such strong hands. It's like the abacus owes you silvers.

274
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,010
I was never serious about this when I was young. It's not like you are unaware.

275
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,540
I broke De Shengchang's abacus many times. This is not bad.

276
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,770
Eldest Young Mistress. Second Young Lady.

277
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,600
Guests have arrived.

278
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,020
When have we not had guests? Why so panicky?

279
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,190
They said they are... Old Madam's granddaughter...

280
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,950
When did Old Madam have a granddaughter?

281
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,220
How come I don't remember?

282
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,040
I think I've heard it before, but

283
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,970
it's been a long time since they've made contact.

284
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,380
Someone who hasn't come in a long time suddenly shows up...

285
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,110
They are definitely here for a reason.

286
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,120
Let's go see.

287
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,650
You're Yuxian's daughter, Jun Zhenzhen?

288
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,710
Yes, Grandmother.

289
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,350
Come closer.

290
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,560
You don't look like Yuxian.

291
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,130
You probably look like your father.

292
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,400
After Yuxian married into Ru'nan, she has never come back.

293
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,080
Yuxian has been gone these many years.

294
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,910
The news I've received... I don't know if it's real or fake.

295
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,290
How did your mother pass?

296
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,250
When Mother passed, I was only 3 years old.

297
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,290
She caught a cold and was treated for half a year but never got better.

298
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,160
She passed that winter.

299
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,340
Grandmother, we don't know Auntie's situation.

300
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,440
Just because she says so, how can we believe it?

301
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,630
Grandmother, this is the Jun family seal.

302
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,610
Zhenzhen, I'm not blaming you.

303
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,330
You said this is the Jun family seal, but do you have anything else?

304
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,080
Like anything of your mother's or Ru'nan documents?

305
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,880
See? Just someone else here to take our money.

306
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,130
Sister, don't say so much.

307
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,260
Mother, how about we let Zhenzhen stay a little while?

308
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,350
In the meantime, we can send someone to Ru'nan to investigate.

309
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,250
They'll find the truth.

310
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,760
If we continue, I'm afraid we'll hurt Zhenzhen's feelings.

311
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,320
You can stay for now.

312
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,830
Jinxiu, have someone clean the West Courtyard.

313
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,660
You all can go.

314
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,640
I want to chat more with her.

315
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,220
Yes.

316
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,890
When Yuxian left home, she didn't take anything.

317
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,140
The only thing she took was a bracelet.

318
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,270
That's the bracelet I gave her. She loved it.

319
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,280
Before her wedding, she would often joke

320
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,030
that she would leave this bracelet to her child.

321
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,590
This bracelet... Did she give it to you?

322
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,670
When Mother died, Father was distraught.

Grandmother, you've been coughing today.

It's better to stay away from oily foods and eat something lighter.

Jun Zhenzhen, you're purposely contradicting me?

Sister, you've misunderstood. I saw it and just casually said something.

Our Jun family owns medical clinics.

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,990
our Old Lord Ning has never mentioned this.

487
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,720
Did he not mention having his life saved?

488
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,480
Doesn't seem like Lord Ning was that kind of person.

489
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,870
You!

490
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,620
I heard that your family has been practicing medicine here for generations.

491
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,500
I think you've saved countless people,

492
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,550
so how many debts

493
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,020
have you collected?

494
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,480
The Jun family saves people and people pay if they can. If they can't, it doesn't matter.

495
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,350
That's a doctor's right.

496
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,370
But the patients, if they can pay, they should.

497
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,290
If they can't, they should give respect.

498
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,370
You're right.

499
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,980
People should give money and people should receive money.

500
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,730
However, the marriage of someone’s son and daughter should not be used as bargain chips.

501
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,050
That is something that lasts a lifetime.

502
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,050
But Lord Ning didn't give money.

503
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,700
You're lying! My grandfather was definitely not this kind of person!

504
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,580
Back then, Old Lord Ning said he was coming home to get money.

505
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,640
But my grandfather refused again.

506
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,510
But Lord Ning didn't want to lose face

507
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,790
and didn't want to be indebted, so he created this contract.

508
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,060
Lady Ning, if you accept this engagement contract,

509
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,120
then it'll be a marriage agreement. If you don't accept,

510
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,460
then it'll be a contract of debt.

511
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,030
What do you mean?

512
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,580
If you pay the fee for saving his life,

513
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,660
then I shall take back this marriage contract.

514
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,050
Then, we don’t owe each other anything.

515
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,140
Mother, give her the money

516
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,960
and tell her to get out!

517
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,780
Enough. Leave.

518
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,840
- Mother!
- Go!

519
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,980
Young Lady Jun, do you feel wronged?

520
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,190
Lady Ning, don't you also feel wronged?

521
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,310
Yes, as a mother, using all this effort

522
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,850
to raise my son, only to be bitten by a wild wolf.

523
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,370
This beast has no feelings.

524
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,270
I can't hit or curse it, yet I'm the one to be cursed and hit.

525
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,390
I do feel wronged and my heart hurts.

526
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,880
As a mother, I can stand it.

527
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,680
But I can't stand it when something like this happens to my kids.

528
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,310
Young Lady Jun, this engagement

529
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,130
is the biggest blessing of your life.

530
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,770
Our Ning family is philanthropic.

531
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,760
Supporting you in this life is hard and makes me sick.

532
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,560
Lady Ning,

533
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,160
being philanthropic is also something that the Jun family does.

534
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,720
Whether they're beggars on the roadside or disaster victims who come to us,

535
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,490
we've always saved people, regardless of who they are.

536
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,550
Back then, if Lord Ning said he had no money, then it wouldn't have mattered.

537
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:04,650
But now that this engagement has been set and turned us into evil people, we also feel wronged

538
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,130
and sick.

539
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,320
Some things can change and some cannot,

540
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,640
such as a person's fate.

541
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,030
Some people, when they're born, will have a hard life no matter how hard they try for a better life.

542
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,720
- I remember the Ning family paid for the first official title.
- How did you know?

543
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,920
You bought people off regardless of their positions and made friends with the Officer of Prefectural Confucian School, right?

544
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,660
Lady Ning, don't panic.

545
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,760
I won't leak this information.

546
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,210
But I would like to tell you,

547
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,240
there are many things that can be solved with money.

548
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,160
Back then, the Ning family bought the official title

549
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,150
to get rid of the low social status.

550
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,030
And now, they bought the marriage contract to get rid of a bad reputation.

551
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,610
Isn't it the same?

552
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,920
Also, 2,000 taels will do.

553
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,220
Young Lady Jun has thought it through.

554
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,120
- Lady Ning, thank you for the compliment.
- This business is a good deal.

555
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,750
Go.

556
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,940
Bring 2,000 taels.

557
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,020
Wait.

558
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,080
2,000 taels was the price before. Now it's changed.

559
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,240
5,000 taels.

560
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,240
