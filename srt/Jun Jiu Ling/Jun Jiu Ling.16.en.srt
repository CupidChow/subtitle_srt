2
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,360
♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,510
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,600
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,760
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,970
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,950
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:11,350
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,380
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,800
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:30,910
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,810
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

14
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,280
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:50,990
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

16
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,950
♫ Dawn... ♫

[Jun Jiu Ling]

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,850
[Episode 16]

19
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,760
Is Physician Jun in?

20
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,340
Our madam invites Physician Jun for a consultation.

21
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,610
Madam's illness is not serious. This prescription is correct as well.

22
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,590
Just continue with the medication for a few more days and she'll be fine.

23
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,290
Physician Jun, you should still go and see her.

24
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,390
Why don't you understand what she said?

25
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,820
What our miss means is,

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,510
your madam will be fine as long as she continues to take the medication in a timely manner.

27
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,440
Men, invite Physician Jun for a consultation.

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,150
What are you doing?

29
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,030
Physician Jun, the situation is urgent and our madam's illness cannot be delayed.

30
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,260
Whether it is serious or not, please see her in person first.

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,740
Physician Jun, please.

32
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,580
All right then. Liu'er, go get the medical box and let us make a trip there.

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,970
Rest assured, we will be right back.

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,160
Physician Jun, please.

35
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,780
Who are they? Why are they so aggressive?

36
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,150
Perhaps it's just a normal consultation.

37
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,080
If she is not back after two hours, we'll go seek the heir apparent.

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,670
All right.

39
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,540
Physician Jun, come with me.

40
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,500
Please.

41
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,510
Third Madam, Physician Jun is here.

42
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,020
Physician Jun, my master loves to hear my madam speak.

43
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,360
However, she has been silent for many days now. Take a look

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,490
to see if there is any way for her to recover quickly.

45
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,290
Come here.

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,650
Madam, please.

47
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,320
How is it, Physician Jun?

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,370
Madam, there is no need to worry. It's just a common sore throat.

49
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,720
You shall be fine after a few days of rest. No need to spend so much money.

50
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Money is nothing. I just want to get well as soon as possible.

51
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,470
This medicine must be taken with warm water. A cup of tea can be prepared.

52
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,020
All right.

53
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,410
Madam.

54
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,810
How are you?

55
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,040
Madam!

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,440
What is it?

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,010
Physician Jun, your medication has made it worse for our madam, hasn't it?

58
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,010
Why can't our madam make any sounds after drinking it?

59
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,750
No worries. Just wait for a few more moments.

60
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,000
Madam! Madam!

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Nanny Huang.

62
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,020
Madam, you can speak now?

63
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,380
- Nanny Huang.
- Yes.

64
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,130
Nanny... Huang.

65
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,790
I can speak now. My voice has recovered.

66
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,110
- You are all right now. You've recovered.
- Nanny Huang!

67
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,970
- Nanny Huang! Nanny Huang!
- Yes.

68
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,560
Why is her voice so similar to my previous voice?

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,390
I can speak now.

70
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,420
This is so great.

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,620
Yunqi, you are here.

72
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,930
Yunqi.

73
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,000
Has your voice recovered?

74
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,100
Let me hear you call me.

75
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,750
Yunqi.

76
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,120
That's not right. Do it again.

77
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,810
Yunqi.

78
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,370
Call me again.

79
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,030
Yunqi. Yunqi.

80
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,810
- Yunqi—
- That's not right. She wouldn't address me in such an enchanting way.

81
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,320
Be more natural.

82
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,290
Yunqi. Yunqi.

83
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,920
I heard that you like to eat snacks from Cao.

84
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,360
So, I brought some back.

85
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,940
But they open late.

86
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,070
I was scared they wouldn't be delicious if they were made in a rush,

87
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,330
so I waited four more hours.

88
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,940
Are you angry with me for coming so late?

89
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,040
Thank you, Lord Lu.

90
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,960
We will be married soon.

91
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,990
Actually, there is no need to be so distant with each other.

92
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,440
How about... you just call me Yunqi?

93
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,650
Yunqi.

94
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,750
Yunqi.

95
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,250
Who is she?

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,780
This is Physician Jun. She cured my throat.

97
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,000
You are Jun Jiuling?

98
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes, I am Jun Jiuling.

99
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,480
Continue to call me.

100
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,080
Yunqi. Yunqi. Yunqi.

101
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,600
Yunqi.

102
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,510
Yunqi. Yunqi.

103
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,900
Why did you change your name?

104
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,260
Ru'nan's Jiuling Hall has been passed down for generations in my Jun family. Thus, I named myself after that.

105
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,820
Nanny Huang, bring the consultation fee of 1,000 taels of silver for Physician Jun.

106
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,450
A consultation fee of 1,000 taels of silver?

107
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,850
It is 1,000 taels of silver for the consultation and 1,000 taels of silver for the medication.

108
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,690
Give her 10,000 taels.

109
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,080
That...

110
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,520
Third Madam, please stay.

111
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,330
Thank you for your grace, My Lord, but I will only collect what should be collected.

112
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,550
Go get it.

113
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,260
Yes.

114
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,820
The 2,000 taels of silver are for the consultation. The rest of the money

115
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,870
is for you to change the name of Jiuling Hall.

116
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,900
My Lord, Jiuling Hall has been passed down for 100 years now.

117
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,260
- If I change the name now–
- So what?

118
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,180
Take the money and change the name.

119
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,060
Also, your name must be changed as well.

120
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,750
So this is Lu Yunqi's private residence.
 [Lu Residence]

121
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,770
He actually...

122
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,090
Thinking about it, Princess Jiuli is really pitiful.

123
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,430
What if she's a princess? Her husband has a woman in his private residence,

124
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,020
and even makes it obvious to everyone.

125
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,870
Don't say anything more.

126
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,110
Miss, are you all right?

127
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,620
Miss!

128
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,180
Miss!

129
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,340
I am fine.

130
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,090
It turns out Third Madam is the woman who lives in Lu Yunqi's private residence.

131
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,080
I didn't expect Elder Sister to be living like this.

132
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,410
Does she know all this?

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,190
Without me by her side, who can she talk to about her sufferings?

134
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,880
He is sick. He must be sick.

135
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,100
How is that him keeping a woman by his side? She is just a shadow of Chu Jiuling,

136
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,610
even if it is just for the similar voice.

137
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,090
Why is he doing this? Does he like me?

138
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,650
Chu Rang had me marry Lu Yunqi. I thought he was trying to make me miserable on purpose.

139
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,930
Could it be that that is not the case?

140
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,980
Being liked by a person like that...

141
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,850
is truly disgusting.

142
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,690
Miss, are you all right?

143
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,760
D-Don't scare me.

144
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,280
I am fine.

145
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,630
I am fine.

146
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,520
Let's go.

147
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,610
Jiuling, the Mid-Autumn gifts from home have been delivered here.

148
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,680
All right.

149
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,070
After you came back from the consultation, your mood has been strange.

150
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,770
This place is not like Zezhou. Have you suffered any wrongs?

151
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,290
No.

152
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,680
If you are willing to share, then go ahead. If not, it is also all right.

153
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,830
It is all in the past now.

154
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,170
I haven't had the time to ask you yet. Are you getting used to living here?

155
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,690
It's not bad.

156
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,180
When I previously wrote to you, asking you to come,

157
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,040
were you worried?

158
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,520
Whether or not I was worried, do you not know?

159
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,900
If you were worried, you would not have come to help me.

160
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,240
Miss Fang.

161
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,850
Young Master Ning?

162
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,640
I have been studying in seclusion recently, so I didn't know that you had also come to the capital.

163
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,730
Did you come to look for her again?

164
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,210
Yes.

165
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,450
Miss Jun.

166
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,980
Young Master Ning?

167
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,810
Young Master Ning, is there something you need me for?

168
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,950
I have something to tell you.

169
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,920
Coincidentally, some new teas have arrived at the teahouse.

170
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,330
Miss Jun, is it convenient for you?

171
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,460
[Fang Residence]

172
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,430
We sent out a whole cart of things. I wonder if Elder Cousin has received them or not.

173
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,050
Sooner or later she will receive them.

174
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,650
Grandmother, receiving them a day early or late will make a difference.

175
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,130
What is the difference? Tell us.

176
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:55,040
For example, if the fish arrives a day earlier, then it would be a day fresher.

177
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,070
Indeed, if a person takes action a day earlier,

178
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,490
it would be more useful than if he takes action later.

179
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,910
Young Brother, you included fish in the gifts?

180
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,300
Yes, Elder Cousin likes to eat Zezhou's pickled fried white fish.

181
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,760
This dish tastes better if it is made with the fish from our local Lake Yang.

182
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,090
This Chengyu. When will he be as thoughtful towards us?

183
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,320
Zhenzhen likes pickled fried white fish.

184
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
Thus, this fish will appear on Jiuling Hall's dining table.

185
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,500
However, en route,

186
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,450
I'm afraid the fish would have died, and it would no longer be fresh.

187
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,380
It won't, it won't. I specially prepared a bucket of water from Lake Yang.

188
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,110
I ordered the men to carefully change the water along the way.

189
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,570
That way, it is guaranteed that the fish is lively and jumping about when it arrives at the capital.

190
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,540
The fried fish will definitely

191
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,670
taste the same as when she ate it here.

192
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,560
Although this child says he understands,

193
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,860
his heart still has deeply rooted feelings for Jiuling.

194
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,680
Grandmother. Mother. For dinner tonight,

195
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,150
let's eat this dish as well.

196
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,080
Perhaps the cart of gifts will reach the capital tonight.

197
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,080
This way, we can be eating the same dish as Elder Cousin.

198
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,340
Sure.

199
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,280
This fish that has been sent to the capital

200
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,450
most likely tastes even better.

201
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,630
Miss Jun, please.

202
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,920
It is indeed good tea.

203
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,430
Young Master Ning, didn't you want to ask me something?

204
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,060
It is actually my first time doing such a thing.

205
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,080
I wonder whether this is a good idea or whether it is the right thing to do.

206
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,090
Please do tell me.

207
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,500
The day after tomorrow, on the 15th, are you willing to go watch the lanterns with me?

208
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,920
That's fine. I was going to go anyway.

209
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,910
This way, everyone can have dinner together

210
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,160
and then go together.

211
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,030
What I mean is... Miss Jun,

212
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,910
are you willing to go watch the lanterns with me, just the two of us?

213
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,330
Young Master Ning, I thought that when I gifted you the pear last time,
 (T/N: pear represents parting ways)

214
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,460
this situation between us has already cleared up.

215
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,380
At the time, I truly did admire you.

216
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,360
I also completely understood what your pear meant.

217
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,010
When I found out that you married into the Fang family, I indeed gave up all thoughts of being with you.

218
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,250
However, seeing you here in the capital, I have come to find out that in Zezhou and Ru'nan,

219
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,490
you set up such a thrilling and elaborate trap.

220
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,710
I also found out your wedding was fake and that you are still unmarried.

221
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,730
Miss Jun, to say I have no feelings towards you would be a lie.

222
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,740
Young Master Ning, our engagement is already in the past.

223
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,110
Let's just let the past remain in the past.

224
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,810
- There are some things–
- Miss Jun.

225
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,280
Allow me to finish, all right?

226
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,040
I've been thinking of this matter for close to a month.

227
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,320
To read the most complicated Confucian text, I only spent three days.

228
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,540
In order to analyze and determine whether I have feelings towards you,

229
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,790
I spent seven days. After analyzing,

230
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,510
I confirmed that I have feelings for you. I am clear on my decision.

231
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,930
Yet I cannot guess your thoughts.

232
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,780
Since I cannot guess, then I might as well come and ask.

233
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,460
♫ Lonely and cold in the clear autumn chills,
the dream is long lasting ♫

234
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,390
Miss Jun, you don't have to answer me now.

235
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,510
There are still two more days and one more night until the 15th.

236
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,040
You can think about it.

237
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,900
No need. I can answer you now.

238
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,820
Thank you for your invitation. I'm sorry.

239
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,660
Could you... tell me why?

240
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,230
♫ Cut each period of time and place them in my hands ♫

241
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,710
I am not compatible with you.

242
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,330
Also, I do not think about such matters now.
 (T/N: the character for think about can also mean wish for)

243
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,890
Not being compatible is an external reason.

244
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,930
Not wishing for such a thing

245
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,110
comes from your heart.

246
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,010
This reply is just like your style of playing chess. Straightforward.

247
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,750
Previously, it was you who helped find the patient. Right?

248
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,100
You know?

249
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,170
Thus, I came today wanting to thank you with tea in place of wine.

250
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,630
Zhu Zan?

251
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,430
Why are you here?

252
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,930
I was not following you! My conscience is clear.

253
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,060
The time and location were chosen by Zhang Baotang.

254
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,990
Then, where are they?

255
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,220
Buying dried meat from next door. The dried meat there is the best in the capital.

256
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,610
The two of you are...

257
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,130
I invited Miss Jun to go look at the lanterns with me on the 15th.

258
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,090
Miss Jun rejected me.

259
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,340
Then I shall take my leave.

260
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,070
Since you are not going to look at the lanterns with him, how about going with me?

261
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,190
Sure.

262
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,480
How improper.

263
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,580
You asked me, so how am I the one who is being improper?

264
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,160
It is a little bit... shameless.

265
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,260
Do you want to sit for a bit?

266
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,260
Young Master Ning's invitation and your invitation to watch the lanterns,

267
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,060
how can they be the same?

268
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,710
What is the difference?

269
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,410
He has a deeper meaning than just watching the lanterns.

270
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,520
You and him... wouldn't have the same intentions, right?

271
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,040
Naturally, they are different.

272
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,870
That is why I can agree to your invitation.

273
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,200
Young Master, did Miss Jun agree to go see the lanterns with you?

274
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,000
The 15th is a day to be with family, so, naturally, she will be accompanying her family.

275
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,800
Then, are we going home right now?

276
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,200
No. Let's go back to the Imperial Academy to study.

277
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,000
What auspicious prize is there this year?

278
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,800
I only know ancient chess game puzzles but they were already solved by someone.

279
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,300
This time I won't expose you.

280
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,000
However, I want half of the auspicious prize.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Can we speak of serious matters?

282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Has there been any progress on what we discussed last time?

283
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,400
Physician Sun replacing Physician Jiang

284
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
may...

285
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,600
Second Elder Brother, try this.

286
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Miss Jun is also here?

287
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Second Younger Brother, you asked to meet up with someone?

288
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Someone is here uninvited. It has nothing to do with me.

289
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,190
Miss, something has happened!

290
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,000
Last time, you said Physician Feng was the best physician in the capital to heal bones. As a result, someone received treatment from him and something went wrong.

291
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Now, they are causing a scene at Baicao Hall, asking for an explanation.

292
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Let's go see.

293
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,200
Second Elder Brother, you're not going to go take a look?

294
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
This Miss Jun is always in trouble.

295
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,800
I'm a dignified heir apparent. Am I that free?

296
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,000
Second—

297
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's go take a look, too.

298
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,400
Third Younger Brother, did you forget what happened last time?

299
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,900
Patiently sit and wait for him to return.

300
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,300
That's right.

301
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,300
[Baicao Hall]

302
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,400
We are indeed destroying Baicao Hall. Look at my brother whom you treated. He can't even walk now.

303
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Can a broken leg be healed in just a few days?

304
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Only a god can do that. You all should not be seeing a physician. Go see a god for that.

305
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,200
Exactly.

306
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
What do you mean a few days? How long has it been already?

307
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,500
If Miss Jun didn't say

308
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,400
- you were the best physician in the capital to heal broken bones, then would we even come here to you?
- Please let me through.

309
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,300
All right, enough. Everyone, calm down and speak nicely.

310
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,500
Miss Jun, you were wrong as well.

311
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,100
Yes. May I take a look at his injury first?

312
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,800
Then I will trouble you to take a look.

313
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,400
Endure it for a bit.

314
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,900
Is there any feeling?

315
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,800
Miss Jun, what do you think? Were the bones not set properly?

316
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
Are you joking? I have spent half my life as a physician.

317
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,500
Can I not even set this?

318
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,580
Physician Feng treated it very well.

319
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,800
Your friend's leg wound is healing well, too.

320
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,500
Then, why is he still in so much pain?

321
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,940
Physician Feng,

322
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,200
can you show me how you

323
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,800
set the bone? I want to see if it's the same as I would.

324
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,000
Endure it for a bit.

325
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,900
Okay. Then, I shall show my skills.

326
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,400
Thank you.

327
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,500
Endure it for a bit.

328
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
Endure it for a bit. Be gentler!

329
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,100
Just endure it for a bit.

330
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
First, it must be explored.

331
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Second, apply pressure.

332
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,100
For the third step, you should massage here. Right?

333
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,200
What happened?

334
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
What has gone wrong?

335
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,000
Why is the bone still broken there? I clearly set it.

336
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
Speak! Why are you not speaking now?

337
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Pain is a good thing.

338
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,400
It means that his injury is healing.

339
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,500
There's a record in the Dong Medical Records.

340
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,800
There is a type of bone injury that fractures after healing.

341
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,050
That is the case for this young man, right?

342
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
Yes.

343
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,600
Elder Brother, your friend's injury should completely heal in a few days.

344
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Rest assured.

345
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Brother, how do you feel now?

346
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,800
Much better.

347
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,100
Not as painful, right?

348
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,600
Much thanks, Miss Jun.

349
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,400
Much thanks, Physician Feng.

350
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,600
I am truly sorry, Physician Feng. He is my only good friend.

351
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I was a little anxious today and smashed your medical hall.

352
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
I will surely come to apologize another day.

353
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,600
No matter how much it costs, I will compensate you. I apologize.

354
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,000
Much thanks, Miss Jun.

355
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,800
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Come on.

356
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,000
Much thanks.

357
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Let's go.

358
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,200
Miss Jun.

359
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,800
Physician Feng, please do not.

360
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
Miss Jun,

361
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
it was all thanks to your discovery.

362
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,200
Otherwise, his leg would have become useless.

363
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,800
It was you, Physician Feng, who treated him. It has nothing to do with me.

364
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
Then I shall take my leave now.

365
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,600
Miss, why don't you go back first? I need to go to De Shengchang to ask Shopkeeper Liu a few things.

366
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,800
All right. Go on.

367
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
Not bad, not bad.

368
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,700
Is the dignified heir apparent that free?

369
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,600
Isn't it because I was afraid that the Imperial Physicians Hall was going to cause problems you can't handle?

370
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Replacing Jiang Youshu is more troublesome than I imagined.

371
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Is it because he's not willing?

372
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,100
Or is it because Physician Sun isn't willing?

373
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,900
It is His Majesty who appointed him to treat Prince Huai.

374
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
He said that his medical skills are excellent.

375
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,500
Jiang Youshu is a person who seizes opportunities to gain power.

376
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,700
He naturally understands how to carry out His Majesty's orders.

377
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,600
There is one more thing I find strange.

378
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
What is it?

379
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Why is Lu Yunqi

380
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,800
also meddling in this matter? He also wants to replace the imperial physician.

381
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,000
Although he gave up after knowing it was His Majesty's order,

382
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,010
don't you think it is strange?

383
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,960
He is surely able to see the reason behind it all.

384
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,050
Why would he go against the imperial edict to secretly investigate these things?

385
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,230
Perhaps it is because of Princess Jiuling.

386
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,600
I do not think so.

387
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,900
If he truly treasured Jiuling, he wouldn't keep a woman on the side.

388
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,800
It does not make logical sense.

389
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,400
In any case, I told Sanbing to secretly monitor Lu Yunqi.

390
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,700
We surely won't let him do anything out of line.

391
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Pay up!

392
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,700
Don't push my mother!

393
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,000
Such a young lad wants to challenge me?

394
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,600
Officer, he is just a child. Don't mind him.

395
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,200
I will be able to make up for last month's taxes very soon.

396
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
- Please let me finish selling my tangerines today.
- Screw off.

397
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,800
How dare you make money on the streets without paying your taxes.

398
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,600
- Dream on!
- Please let me sell the tangerines. I will pay.

399
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,100
Who is being a busy body?

400
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,600
I won't let you off easy!

401
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,800
How mighty this officer is!

402
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,900
I want to see who you won't let off easy.

403
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,600
Young Lord? How would I dare?

404
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,680
To him, you do not dare.

405
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,800
However, that was not your attitude towards them just now.

406
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,200
They owe two months' worth of taxes, yet they are still doing business on the streets.

407
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,600
This is not in compliance with the rules. I also wouldn't be able to explain it to the other businesses.

408
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,600
Even so, you acted so violently.

409
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,800
They are just a woman and a kid. How can they bear your brute force?

410
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,000
Who are you?

411
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
Young Lord! Young Lord! I was wrong! I was wrong!

412
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,400
- Scram!
- All right! All right!

413
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,600
Young Lord, you're so awesome!

414
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,200
You have such good taste at such a young age.

415
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,700
Hurry and thank them.

416
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,900
- Thank you, Young Lord. Thank you, Elder Sister!
- No need, no need.

417
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,000
- Here.
- Here.

418
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
Here.

419
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,400
Elder Sister, has business not been well recently?

420
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,000
I remember that the taxes for small street vendors like you weren't that high before.

421
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,500
Young Miss, you probably don't know that taxes have changed long ago.

422
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,100
You are speaking of the system that the late emperor had.

423
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,800
Ever since the current emperor's ascension, the Ministry of Revenue decreased the taxes.

424
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,800
However, they added three more types of taxes.

425
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,890
Adding them all together,

426
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,800
the sum of taxes is now more than twice as before.

427
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,400
Thank you. Thank you.

428
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
This won't do.

429
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,900
This system that does not follow the people's wishes and only seeks wealth cannot continue unchecked.

430
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,800
What do you want to do?

431
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,400
Submit a memorandum to His Majesty, calling for tax reform.

432
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,100
Zhu Zan, you have to be careful. Although you agree with the late emperor's system,

433
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,400
the current emperor only made amendments to the late emperor's system.

434
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,600
If you make a public memorandum, then you are not giving His Majesty face (respect).

435
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,000
Not to speak of whether or not it will work,

436
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you may even get thrown in prison.

437
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,800
Miss Jun, I originally thought you were a person of justice.

438
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,000
I never imagined you would be the kind of person who would rather protect themselves.

439
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,600
The late emperor's system was great.

440
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,000
Everyone knows that.

441
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,200
As to which is more important, myself or the wellbeing of the common people,

442
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,100
isn't it obvious?

443
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,400
If you're afraid of getting in trouble, then stay far away from me.

444
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,900
Zhu Zan.

445
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Although the late emperor is no longer here,

446
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,200
his system is well-remembered by the people.

447
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,400
It was respected and accepted by the people.

448
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,100
The late emperor is remembered by the people.

449
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,600
Why can't Jiurong's illness be cured?

450
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,800
What is the use of the Imperial Physicians Hall then?

451
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
Your Majesty, please do not be angry.

452
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
Prince Huai no longer just has a cold.

453
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
This illness has been going on for too long, and, thus, is hard to treat.

454
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
"Going on for too long."

455
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,800
Hasn't it continued because your Imperial Physicians Hall is lacking in medical skills

456
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
and thus it has turned chronic?

457
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,300
Prince Huai is young.

458
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,000
His body is weak, thus he gets sick easily, to begin with.

459
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,000
Then, all those in the Prince Huai Residence are useless as well.

460
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,100
How did they care for Prince Huai? They should all be punished.

461
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,600
Everyone, listen.

462
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,000
Prince Huai is the only son of the late emperor.

463
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,500
We must do all that we can.

464
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,800
If anything happens to Prince Huai,

465
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,500
how would I face the late emperor?

466
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,700
I will do all that I can to treat Prince Huai.

467
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,900
I really did not expect Prince Huai's illness to be so troublesome.

468
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,000
Whether he can make it or not depends on the next few days.

469
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,600
If I were to say, we have already used all the ideas we have come up with.

470
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,600
However, none were effective, so what can we do?

471
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,900
People's lives are determined by the heavens.

472
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,800
That is Prince Huai's life. Others cannot be blamed.

473
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Better be safe than sorry.

474
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,200
While Prince Huai is alive, no one cares.

475
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
If he dies,

476
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,600
the whole world will be watching.

477
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,200
Then... Then do we treat him or not?

478
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,600
Some people want to see him die.

479
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,400
From what I see, even if his illness is treatable, we cannot treat it.

480
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,600
It's hard to understand His Majesty's mind. Frankly,

481
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,000
our lives are not safe enough.

482
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,800
If we cannot save ourselves, we'll just end up as scapegoats.

483
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
W-What should we do?

484
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,400
We can neither treat this illness nor not treat this illness.

485
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
No matter what, it's a dead end.

486
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,200
Isn't that so?

487
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
If we do not want to become scapegoats,

488
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,700
then Prince Huai's illness must make sense.

489
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,600
If he were to have an incurable illness,

490
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,600
then the people cannot say anything about us.

491
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,400
What if this is scrofula?
(T/N: scrofula is enlarged lymph nodes usually caused by tuberculosis)

492
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,000
Scrofula? You–

493
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,400
How can you think of that?

494
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,600
These days, Jiuling Hall has gained more fame.

495
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,400
If we can use this opportunity to get rid of Jiuling Hall,

496
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,200
then that would excellent.

497
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
- Great idea.
- Great idea.

498
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,200
A great "one stone, three birds" tactic.

499
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,800
Yes, that's great.

500
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,500
[Jiuling Hall]

501
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,300
Thank you, Physician Jun for all your advice.

502
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,800
You are welcome.

503
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,400
Then I shall leave now.

504
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,900
Take care.

505
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,300
How is this a medical hall?
 [Jiuling Hall]

506
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,400
It's clearly a learning hall to pass on medical skills.

507
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
How is it as you say?

508
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Is it not?

509
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
Including this one, you have advised a total of five physicians this morning.

510
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,000
There's a saying...

511
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,300
"One physician can treat one person while a hundred physicians can save tens of thousands of lives."

512
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,600
Have you heard of it?

513
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,000
Miss, you really have the heart of a Bodhisattva.

514
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Let's quickly get to work.

515
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,700
Master, all the physicians in the capital

516
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,200
are no longer angry when she says they can treat the patients.

517
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,400
Instead, they take pride in that. They even hope that she says they can treat patients

518
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,400
because as long as she says so, they can surely do it.

519
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,800
Even if they were incapable of treating someone,

520
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,400
she will guide them from the side to help them treat the patient.

521
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,390
That's all?

522
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
Now...

523
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
Now, many physicians

524
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,500
will go to Jiuling Hall to consult her.

525
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,200
They do not have their attitudes from before.

526
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,200
They believe they had wrongly accused Physician Jun.

527
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,400
She does not go against the physicians of the city,

528
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
and she doesn't look down on the common people.

529
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,200
This kind of behavior...

530
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,600
This kind of behavior is the benevolence of physicians and the heart of Bodhisattva.

531
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:45,000
Master, if anyone tries to cause conflict between them and Physician Jun in the future,

532
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,200
it won't work.

533
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,400
You have worked hard. You may go back to work.

534
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Yes, Master.

535
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,100
This fire is too big.

536
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,600
You have the time to eat a tangerine, yet don't help.

537
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,200
I have to go out with my miss in a bit. I do not have the time to help you.

538
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
Where are you two going?

539
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,400
Decoct your medicine.

540
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,100
What are you doing?

541
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Don't stop.

542
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,400
Jiuling said

543
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,400
that this medicine has to be stirred for four hours nonstop, do you understand?

544
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
You cannot randomly stir it. You must stir in one direction, do you understand?

545
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,200
All right, I understand.

546
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,800
Add this herb when it's sticky.

547
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,100
All right.

548
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,000
What are you laughing about?

549
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,800
I'm laughing at you for being scared of Miss Jinxiu.

550
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,600
I am not scared of her. She is the eldest young lady of the Fang family after all.

551
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,200
She's now the accountant of Jiuling Hall. I'm being respectful.

552
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,000
Whatever you say.

553
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,400
- How is it going?
- Miss.

554
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,900
Miss.

555
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,200
Things have actually become like this?

556
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,600
Yes, My Lord. This has spread throughout the capital now.

557
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,900
They even say that Miss Jun is, what is it?

558
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,000
A living Bodhisattva who teaches with simple words.

559
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Then this makes things difficult.

560
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,000
Looks like Imperial Physician Jiang will have a hard time instigating those other physicians now.

[Household Registration and Tax Office]

562
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,000
Has she not changed her name yet?

563
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,600
No, My Lord.

Although some have changed their views of her, others have not.

Physician Jun, this is bad. A lot of men from the Martial Moral Ministry have arrived.

571
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,200
Men from the Martial Moral Ministry? It's not the first time they have come.

572
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,100
What is it? Are they looking for our lady to make some diagnosis?

You know what I mean.

Forgive me, for it was difficult to obey your previous orders.

584

Forgive you for it was difficult? Then, why did you agree to it at the time?

At the time, I did not dare refuse.

You have received the money already.

You do not dare to do this or that,
