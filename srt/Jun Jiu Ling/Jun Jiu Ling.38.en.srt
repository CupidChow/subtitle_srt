[Episode 38]

19
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,820
In battle defense, it's most important to defend well. The greatest taboo is to be flustered and then make mistakes.

20
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,740
We need to divide tasks immediately and ensure we make the best use of those who have been deployed.

21
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,240
You know best about the defense layout. I will leave this to you.

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,000
Sure. I'll take care of this.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
Also, pick some strong soldiers from the city

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,210
to guard the four gates and city walls, especially the north gate.

25
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,830
The wall is shorter there. Northern Qi is most likely to attack the city from there.

26
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,890
When that time comes, the drums are my command.

27
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,990
Focus on the defense. As long as their is the sound of the drums, the fighting must not stop.

28
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

29
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,840
Chen Qi, lead the chosen people to De Shengchang to receive the weapons.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,110
Jinxiu, Liu'er, you're responsible for arranging other civilians who are willing to help out and ensuring a sufficient supply.

31
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,380
- Go now.
- All right.

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,020
Prince Xian.

33
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,620
Lord Ning.

34
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm sorry for being late.

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,420
As long as you're here, it's never late.

36
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,150
These are the guards of Ning Residence, who have volunteered to guard the city.

37
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,680
Heroes, please follow me.

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,390
Young Lady Jun, I know you and Prince Xian have done a lot.

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,650
But we don't have enough support from the people.

40
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,950
Why?

41
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,720
On my way here just now, I heard many people discuss it.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,990
Some even said that you were sacrificing civilians' lives

43
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,070
by having them protect you on the front line.

44
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,160
Which fool said that?

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,420
If I feared death, why would I be guarding the city myself?

46
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,250
It doesn't matter who said it.

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,920
What matters most is that when everyone is in a panic,

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,620
a lie will be accepted as truth if repeated often enough.

49
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,580
Lord Ning, do you have any suggestions? Feel free to tell us.

50
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,380
If someone volunteers to guard the city with us,

51
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,410
it'll put a stop to the rumor.

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,690
Do you mean...

53
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,500
- Prince Huai?
- Exactly.

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,100
No, that's too dangerous.

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,400
Prince Xian, listen to me. The late emperor was more respected and liked by civilians than His Majesty.

56
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,580
It's more the case now, since this time His Majesty ran away because of the war.

57
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,230
Prince Huai is the son of the late emperor. He used to be one of the candidates for crown prince.

58
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,850
If he can guard the city with us this time,

59
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,860
it'll really mean something to the civilians.

60
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,500
It's...

61
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,180
If Jiurong can join us now

62
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,180
and fight for the nation,

63
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,900
it'll encourage and also unify the people.

64
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,490
All right.

65
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,290
Are you asking me to guard the city with you?

66
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes, but it's dangerous on the battlefield.

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,410
Your Highness, are you willing to do it?

68
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,150
Of course, I am. It's my duty without a doubt.

69
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,860
Jiang Baihu, you should know why Lu Yunqi made you stay here.

70
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,780
It's up to you.

71
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,330
Keep Jiuling and Their Highnesses safe no matter what.

72
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,890
Yes.

73
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,990
Listen, everyone.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,730
Follow Young Lady Jun and keep Their Highnesses safe at all costs.

75
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,330
Yes!

76
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,080
Physician, how is he doing?

77
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,870
This man has injured his lungs

78
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,120
and has lost a lot of blood. Also, he's been on the run and was unable to recuperate.

79
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,910
It has resulted in a wound infection and a high fever.

80
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,930
What should we do then?

81
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,700
Please wait a moment.

82
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,020
This medication is to be taken orally and this one is to be applied externally.

83
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,930
Use them in the morning and evening to boost blood circulation and remove blood stasis.

84
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,410
Okay. Thank you, Physician.

85
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,310
Thank you, Physician.

86
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,690
Second Brother, we can save you now.

87
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,510
Hurry up. Hurry up.

88
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,460
Let us out!

89
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,140
Let us out!

90
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,110
Let us out!

91
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,530
Let us out! You can't do this. Let us out!

92
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,370
Everyone, calm down.

93
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,960
We can't let any leave, for your own safety!

94
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,900
Is Northern Qi here to attack us?

95
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,850
To be honest with you, the Northern Qi army

96
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,270
is only one step away from our capital.

97
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,100
The capital is very far away from Northern Qi.

98
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
How could Northern Qi come all the way here to attack us?

99
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,350
- Even if they're really here to attack us, how could His Majesty have no plans?
- Exactly!

100
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,970
Exactly!

101
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,680
Because... Because His Majesty has run away.

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
Why don't you open the gate so everyone can escape?

103
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,640
What should we do?

104
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,970
Open the gate! Open the gate!

105
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,990
Don't worry, everyone. His Majesty is gone, but I'm still here.

106
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,850
Think about it. If you leave from this gate

107
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,140
and run into the Northern Qi army in the wilderness, will you be able to protect yourselves?

108
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,630
We have gigantic gates, sturdy walls,

109
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,740
and soldiers on standby here. I'm also here to protect everyone.

110
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,040
Prince, why did His Majesty leave?

111
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,280
Where did His Majesty go?

112
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,380
That's right. Are we doomed? What should we do?

113
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,670
Open the gate! Open the gate!

114
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,390
Open the gate!

115
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,130
Stop it, everyone!

116
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,820
No matter what...

117
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,310
No matter what, we can't open the gate.

118
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,320
The army is at the border. If any spies come in as we open the gate,

119
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,810
then our capital will be doomed for real.

120
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,940
Open the gate! Open the gate!

121
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,510
Open the gate! Open the gate!

122
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,870
Don't panic. I'm Prince Huai.

123
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,990
Why should we trust you?

124
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,170
That's right. Why should we trust you?

125
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,310
Because he's the son of the late emperor.

126
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,610
Because he didn't leave you all.

127
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,170
He felt very sorry when he knew Northern Qi was going to attack us.

128
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,050
Everyone's suffering because the Imperial Court didn't do anything well.

129
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,070
When we're in a crisis, those leaders have run away.

130
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,390
You're so young, you shouldn't be ashamed.

131
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,190
Those who have run away should be ashamed.

132
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,280
- Am I right?
- You're right. They should be ashamed.

133
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,260
Now it's pointless to talk about shame and regrets.

134
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,590
Please believe that Prince Huai will definitely protect our homes

135
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,910
with all of you.

136
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,610
Don't panic. If they get in,

137
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,210
we'll fight against them!

138
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,300
- He's a kid after all.
- Yes.

139
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,010
- Does he know how fierce the Northern Qi army is?
- Exactly.

140
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,130
How do you know we can't defeat them without even trying?

141
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,170
Our army doesn't like starting wars but never fears them.

142
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,110
If those with good intentions come, we'll treat them well. If those with bad intentions come,

143
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,890
we'll certainly fight back!

144
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,710
I'll guard the gate. If the gate is broken,

145
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,570
I'll die first. I'd rather die than retreat.

146
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,070
People say kids don't know about life-and-death matters.

147
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,810
It's like a joke when they talk about life and death.

148
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,030
But now everyone can see that Prince Huai is here

149
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,420
to fight with all of you. As long as I'm alive,

150
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,620
I'll stop the enemy from setting foot in the capital.

151
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,750
Who are you?

152
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,150
That's right. Who are you?

153
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,630
I'm Jun Jiuling.

154
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,250
Physician Jun. Even if you're a highly-skilled physician,

155
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,050
you can't shoot from the hip. What's the point of keeping us here?

156
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,240
- Exactly. It's pointless to keep us here.
- That's right.

157
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,940
Fellow citizens, please stay here.

158
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,940
We'll guard the gate and our homes together.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,860
Guard the gate?

160
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,280
We're just civilians. How can we guard it?

161
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,430
You must trust Jun Jiuling.

162
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,100
She's never insincere.

163
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,480
Only if you stay here can you be alive.

164
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,340
As long as the Northern Qi army can't come in,

165
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,630
we won't die.

166
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,150
This...

167
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,520
We just want to stay alive.

168
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,290
That's right.

169
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,960
Fellow citizens, you used to say the smallpox was incurable.

170
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,200
I said the smallpox was curable, so we defeated it together.

171
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,800
You used to say Northern Qi was fierce, but I was lucky enough

172
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,660
to fight against Northern Qi and save thousands of civilians with Duke Cheng.

173
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,680
Now I still dare to say that as long as we all work together,

174
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,530
we'll certainly guard the gate and defeat Northern Qi.

175
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,300
Now we're not outnumbered by the enemy. Besides soldiers, horses, and ministries from five cities,

176
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,770
we have you as well. There are over a hundred thousand people here.

177
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,700
Why should we fear sixty thousand of them?

178
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,390
- But we don't know how to fight.
- Exactly.

179
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,970
That's fine. As long as you don't panic,

180
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,760
and as long as we obey orders, I believe

181
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,270
we'll surely be able to guard the city where we've lived for years.

182
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,030
Now only we can guard the city

183
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,050
and save ourselves so we can possibly stay alive

184
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,010
and wait for reinforcements to come.

185
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,620
I'm with you all!

186
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,690
- Yes.
- They're right.

187
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,630
Everyone can kill the enemy!

188
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:06,930
- Everyone can kill the enemy!
- Everyone can kill the enemy!

189
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,210
[Qi]

190
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,730
The walls here are not stronger than the ones in the North.

191
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,430
These soldiers have never been on a battlefield.

192
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,020
I think they can't even withstand a single blow.

193
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,770
Yes.

194
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,390
Even though the walls are strong, it doesn't help.

195
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,070
Not only can we break through the gate of the city,

196
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,010
we can also shatter the hearts and courage of these people.

197
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,170
Make them bow their heads to us.

198
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,040
My Lord, I have a plan.

199
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,270
Remember this. Add more manpower to these two sides of the wall.

200
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,670
All right.

201
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,150
The hearts of the people are finally stabilized.

202
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,810
This is due to the credit of Prince Huai.

203
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,610
Your Highness, are you afraid?

204
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,490
I'm not afraid.

205
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,680
It's just that... I have never done this.

206
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
I don't know what to do.

207
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,820
You have done very well.

208
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,210
Leave the rest to us.

209
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,970
Miss Jun, you have interacted with people from Northern Qi. What do you think are our odds of winning?

210
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,760
Frankly speaking,

211
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,710
I'm not sure.

212
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,380
Your Highness, the people from Northern Qi are here.

213
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,940
Let's go!

214
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,480
Close your eyes.

215
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,440
Quick. Those in there, listen up.

216
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,560
Open the city gate now.

217
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,410
Open the city gate and protect their lives.

218
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,600
These shameless people from Northern Qi.

219
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,080
Your Highness, what should we do?

220
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,040
Prince.

221
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,690
We must not open the city gate.

222
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,250
Wife!

223
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,060
Rong'er, your family name is Chu.

224
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,150
You must always remember these people.

225
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,520
Brother-in-law, you are awake.

226
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,600
Chengyu,

227
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,270
what day is today?

228
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,960
The fifth of the month.

229
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,220
No. I must go back to the capital.

230
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,030
Brother-in-law, be careful.

231
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,290
I want to go back to the capital.

232
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,730
No. You haven't recovered from your injury.

233
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,150
The road is bumpy. You won't be able to endure it.

234
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,250
Don't worry. I can.

235
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,080
The capital has been trapped for many days.

236
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,120
The soldiers guarding the city have never seen a real battle.

237
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,730
They won't be able to stop the people from Northern Qi. Besides,

238
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,850
Jiuling is still in the capital.

239
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,510
Fine. I will prepare the carriage and go back with you.

240
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,260
You can't.

241
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,820
You are already a dead man to them.

242
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,800
You can't go back.

243
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,480
The biggest threat to the Fang family has already escaped.

244
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,850
Hence, there's nothing wrong with me going back.

245
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,710
Come here.

246
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,310
All right.

247
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,780
All right.

248
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,970
Reporting!

249
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,330
My Lord, Northern Qi's army that besieged us has retreated.

250
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,480
Retreated? Do you know the reason?

251
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,360
It seems to be related to the internal news in Northern Qi.

252
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,800
When their army retreated, they were extremely demoralized and in a hurry.

253
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,670
Looks like Zan'er succeeded in assassinating the Emperor of Northern Qi.

254
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,140
This is great. Since this is the case, pull out the troops immediately from the south and rush back to the capital.

255
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,530
Relay the order to the troops to set out in half an hour.

256
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,290
Yes!

257
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,560
Duke Cheng.

258
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,890
Are you not going to ask about Zhu Zan's situation?

259
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,070
If there's any news, he will naturally find ways to communicate with me.

260
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,960
Then...

261
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,960
What if there's no news from him?

262
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,940
It's a worthy death for the country.

263
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,760
Hang in there. It will be fine soon. Cover this.

264
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,070
Hold on.

265
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,120
Everyone must hold on!

266
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,020
If we let them charge in, our families...

267
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,100
will die.

268
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,030
Think of our families. As long as we are still alive,

269
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,900
we must hold on!

270
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,880
Come, take this.

271
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,110
Place it there.

272
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,680
Queue up.

273
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,550
Everyone, collect one weapon.

274
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,120
Once you collect, don't rush, gather over there.

275
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,890
After you take your weapon, gather over there.

276
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,020
Gather over there.

277
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,790
- Everybody, take note of the shift change.
- Take it carefully.

278
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,090
Hold it properly.

279
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,640
Thank you.

280
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,240
- Come, give you.
- Here, take it carefully.

281
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,180
- Take it carefully.
- Give me some.

282
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,440
- Send it over.
- Okay, okay.

283
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,290
Thank you.

284
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,920
Come, eat a bit of this.

285
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,870
Give way please.

286
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,780
Move aside.

287
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,610
Eat more.

288
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,810
Take it carefully. Give me a hand.

289
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,660
What's the situation in the capital now?

290
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,800
I don't know specifically yet. We are rushing there now.

291
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,710
Are you better?

292
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm already fine. It is imperative that we rush to the capital as soon as possible, don't worry about me.

293
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,420
What? Northern Qi has not broken into the capital yet?

294
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,640
It is Jun Jiuling, Prince Xian, and Prince Huai.

296
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,690
And Lord Ning, who is leading everybody in the capital to guard it.

297
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,090
Who released Prince Huai?

298
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,040
Replying to Your Majesty, it was Jun Jiuling.

299
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,530
It's her again.

300
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,940
Your Majesty, you are therefore much safer.

301
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,680
Northern Qi besieged the capital for several days but has not succeeded, instead many of their people died.

302
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,960
With the capital in front attracting firepower, they cannot continue southward.

303
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,110
You are very safe here.

304
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,200
When the reinforcement army from the North arrives, the crisis will be relieved.

305
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,410
It's been a long time, why have the reinforcement soldiers not arrived?

306
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,880
Reporting to Your Majesty. Actually, a batch of reinforcement armies arrived.

307
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,310
It was Duke Cheng's army.

308
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,990
They encountered the tail end of the Northern Qi troops.

309
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,660
Now they are battling on the outskirts of the capital thirty miles away.

310
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,610
There's no winner as of now.

311
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,620
A rebellious criminal

312
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,360
surprisingly has so many people who listen to his orders.

313
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,500
Your Majesty, as long as you and the capital are protected, whoever was dispatched,

314
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,510
it doesn't matter.

315
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,260
Your Majesty, I think that if there are more reinforcement armies.

316
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,070
Why not let them come here first?

317
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,150
Then divide the soldiers and send them to guard the capital.

318
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,000
Good idea. Let the reinforcement soldiers protect me.

319
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,150
This way, everybody knows

320
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,780
that I'm a person who wants to cling to life and am scared of death. Right?

321
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,890
Have you found the Imperial Jade Seal?

322
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,600
I have not found it yet. Your Majesty please punish me.

323
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,750
Reporting to Your Majesty.

324
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:02,130
Since the Imperial Jade Seal has not yet been found after such a long search, it should still be somewhere in the Imperial Study.

325
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,140
Hopefully.

326
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,470
All of you stand down.

327
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

328
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,580
Your Excellency Lu.

329
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,580
I keep forgetting to say thank you.

330
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,800
No need to thank me, it's not for your sake.

331
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,380
Then, you are doing this for Miss Jun?

332
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,700
Thanks for your hard work. Speed up.

333
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,590
After taking a weapon, gather up at the walls.

334
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,180
Go and see if there are more weapons.

335
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,190
Be careful.

336
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,940
Give everyone a set of arrows and a bow.

337
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,450
Thanks for your hard work.

338
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,620
Gather up at the walls.

339
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,730
Here. Here. Speed up.

340
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,350
Speed up.

341
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,840
Go there.

342
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,790
What are you doing?

343
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,440
Jinxiu, why did you come here?

344
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,900
Bringing you your meals.

345
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,790
Why haven't I seen you get congee lately? Do you eat this only?

346
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,640
I'm too busy.

347
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,540
Two more batches of weapons will be delivered in one hour. I must stay here.

348
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,530
Did you cook it?

349
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,770
I bought it.

350
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,470
You bought it?

351
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,530
I can't find authentic Zezhou dishes like this in the capital.

352
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,060
You can't keep your mouth shut even while eating.

353
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,580
It's delicious.

354
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,870
Oh, how's it going on your end?

355
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,880
Fewer and fewer people eat.

356
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Everyone's guarding the gate.

357
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,490
I don't know if they will be able to come back.

358
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,020
You shouldn't have come to the capital.

359
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,960
Fortunately, I did;

360
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,500
otherwise, I'd be worried about your lives every day.

361
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,650
If you die, we'll die together.

362
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,260
Die together?

363
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,470
I mean, I'll die with Jiuling. What are you thinking about?

364
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
Jiuling?

365
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,810
I must go over there.

366
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,030
Jinxiu,

367
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,050
they need more people at the gate tower.

368
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,500
After I deliver the weapons there,

369
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,590
I'll stay behind and guard the city with them.

370
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,620
You must take care of yourself.

371
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,930
Chen Qi!

372
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,100
If you die,

373
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,470
I won't be done with you!

374
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,080
Let's go!

375
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

376
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,520
It looks like whether we can guard the city

377
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,130
depends on tomorrow.

378
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,650
Prince Xian, I'll make arrangements.

379
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,700
- And–
- Young Lady Jun.

380
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,310
Master Gu.

381
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,630
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

382
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,990
Please.

383
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,620
Why are you here?

384
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,170
Someone asked me a favor, so I must do it.

385
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,960
Before Lord Lu left, he'd told me

386
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,110
to get you, Prince Huai, and Princess Jiuli out of here at the right time.

387
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,210
Master, how could we leave now that the capital is in danger?

388
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,100
Young Lady Jun, Lord Lu sincerely wants to save you all.

389
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,170
He thinks what you've done is enough.

390
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,000
What do you mean?

391
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,200
Now that Prince Huai has gained a good reputation, he can leave and wait for the right time.

392
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,930
I'm afraid we won't be able to guard the capital.

393
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,830
Whether we can guard it,

394
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,000
we won't know until we've tried.

395
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,580
We won't give up until the very last moment.

396
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,830
Young Lady Jun, you'd better leave soon.

397
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,670
Lord Lu has prepared a hideout already.

398
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,170
If we leave now, nobody will notice it or blame you.

399
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,750
Once the city is stormed, His Majesty won't come back for real.

400
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,410
That's why we must keep the Chu family's descendants safe.

401
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,600
Prince Huai, as the heir of the late emperor, has a good reputation.

402
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,350
Some things should be done in a certain way.

403
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,230
- Master Gu–
- Hurry!

404
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,240
Young Lady Jun, it looks like Northern Qi is really storming the city. If you don't leave, it'll be too late.

405
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,620
You don't need to say anymore.

406
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,300
I know what you mean. Please tell Lord Lu that I won't leave.

407
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,040
Jiurong is guarding the city, not because of reputation or the throne.

408
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,320
This city has protected us for years.

409
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,720
The descendants of the Chu family must defend it at all costs and not shirk their responsibilities.

410
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,250
If you're not staying behind, go ahead and leave.

411
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,010
Young Lady Jun!

412
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,890
Kill!

413
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,750
Let's go!

414
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,110
Go!

415
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,460
Don't run! Catch him!

416
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,750
Protect Prince Huai!

417
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,160
Everyone can kill the enemy!

418
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,330
Everyone can kill the enemy!

419
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,100
[Qi]

420
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,280
This prosperous city...

421
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,290
will become our turf soon.

422
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,230
Congratulations, General. Congratulations, General,

423
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,240
on making such an achievement for Northern Qi.

424
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,550
From now on, His Majesty will surely favor you even more.

425
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,850
Hurry up and move the rocks over here. Don't let them come up.

426
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,720
Quick, quick, quick!

427
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,760
Protect Lord Ning!

428
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,290
Go!

429
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,110
- Chen Qi!
- Hang in there!

430
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,750
Hang in there!

431
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,090
Hang in there!

432
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,360
Hang in there!

433
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,630
Hang in there!

434
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,430
