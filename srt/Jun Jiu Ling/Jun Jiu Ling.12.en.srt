♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,600
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

[Episode 12]

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,320
Everyone, be patient.

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,200
Let me tell the story slowly.

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,800
All this starts from Miss Jun's origins.

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,000
You only know that Miss Jun is the Fang family's granddaughter.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,420
However, do you know that her Jun family is a family of physicians

24
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,000
who have passed down their skills for over 100 years?

25
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,400
Her father, Jun Yingwen, was a famous physician in Ru'nan.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,190
Even if she were to hide away in her bedroom,

27
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,200
she was already too entrenched in her family's medical teachings.

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,630
She is the successor of her family legacy, as Ru'nan's miraculous physician, Jun Jiuling.

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,200
Miss Jun is a divine doctor?

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,000
How can a mere woman be a divine doctor?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
- Yeah.
- That's right

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
That's right. Your story is too unbelievable!

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Miss Jun's aspirations are to inherit the family business

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
and reopen Jiuling Hall in Ru'nan.

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,200
But she learned of the tragedies and tribulations that befell her mother's family, the Fang family.

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,400
Her maternal grandfather and uncle were murdered by unscrupulous people.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Her younger cousin is now also dying.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,000
And so, she vowed to help the Fang family through this difficult time.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
She came up with a genius plan.

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,800
Miss Jun used the excuse of changing bad luck with an auspicious event to fool others,

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,400
and secretly cured Young Master Fang's poison and other ailments.

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Moreover, to lure out the person plotting everything in the shadows, Li Changhong,

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
she disregarded her own safety

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,500
and undertook the difficult task of bringing the sick and the old back to Ru'nan.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She sprang traps and faced ambushes,

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
even entering the battlefield.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Only by doing this could she reveal

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the decades of collusion between Li Changhong and the military.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,400
This is the ingenious plan that the daughter of the Jun family came up with,

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
to unveil the evil by breaking her engagement, and arranging a fake marriage.

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,500
This is why

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,000
when the renowned physician, Young Lady Jun, didn't return home all night.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the Imperial Merchant Madam Fang ordered a thorough search of the whole city.

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,900
I'm not good at this.

55
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,000
The storytellers made this up.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
It's good.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
You can tell that the Fang family was behind this.

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,000
You haven't seen it. All the storytellers in town

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
have "Young Lady Jun, the Renowned Physician" as the main topic in their repertoire.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,200
How she saved the Fang family from villains and also saved the people from their misfortunes.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
The story of the late Master Fang receiving a decree from the emperor to establish De Shengchang only comes next.

62
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm not good at telling stories. Tomorrow, I can take you to a teahouse and you can listen for yourself.

63
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,800
Second Brother, we are about done with the investigation in Zezhou.

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,600
- Where should we go?
- Back to the capital.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,400
What? Don't forget how we escaped from the Martial Moral Ministry.

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Isn't going back to the capital right now the same as turning ourselves in to our enemies?

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
If we don't turn ourselves in, how can we diminish His Majesty's mistrust against us?

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,500
Plus, I have more important things to do.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,800
I know what you want to do.

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Then tell me.

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,390
To seek justice for the late emperor and the princess. Right?

72
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,370
Finish your dinner and get some rest.

73
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,530
We need to head back to the capital early tomorrow.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
My Lord, we chased him all night yet he escaped.

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,300
He went towards the capital.

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,400
- The capital?
- That's right.

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,200
If he knows who we are, why would he head towards the capital?

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
That'd be like walking into a trap.

79
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,400
My Lord, our men have entered the city.

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,500
Should we take care of the Fang family?

81
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,850
The Fang family's daughter-in-law didn't come home all night.

82
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,200
While there was a new maid at the inn serving tea.

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,490
That damn Fang woman is giving me a mystery to solve.

84
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
It doesn't matter.

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,200
We should go back to the capital and report this to His Majesty first.

86
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes.

87
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,250
Miss Jun!

88
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,900
Brother, is Miss Jun not here?

89
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,600
She left this for you.

90
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,700
Ling Jiu.

91
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,200
Thank you for helping me identify the one plotting against the Fangs family.

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,300
As I have promised, I will find out the secrets in Zezhou.

93
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,540
I will tell you everything.

94
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,200
I have also confirmed with Grandmother.

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,400
The money from the third year of Taiyan,

96
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
indeed was sent to the Fang family through Chu Rang, as the seed money for the Fang family.

97
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
The profits were used to support Chu Rang.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Today, Grandmother is the only person who knows this.

99
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,600
The Fang family has been punished for their wrongdoings.

100
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Everyone else is innocent.

101
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,070
You have promised me to spare the Fang family.

102
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,800
Please keep your promise.

103
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Please don't ever put them in a tough situation.

104

[Jun Jiuling]

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,400
After we bid farewell today, we will be thousands of miles from each other.

106
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,640
We might never meet again.

107
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,400
Please take care of yourself.

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,330
Your old acquaintance has left.

109
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,000
I hope you will forget her soon,

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,200
and for the rest of your life.

111
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,300
Jun Jiuling.

112
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,120
She severed our ties once she was done using me.

113
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,410
She dismissed me with a letter.

114
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Where did she go?

115
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
She is gone.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
She only said that

117
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,000
she had some business to take care of.

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know where she went.

119
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,880
Do you like her?

120
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,400
Do you like her or not?

121
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,550
Miss Jun, you haven't answered my question.

122
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,520
What are you trying to avoid?

123
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,040
Forget it. I'll go back to the capital first.

124
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,000
I have so many memories in Zezhou.

125
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,760
I have a new family, figured out the secret of Zezhou,

126
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,960
and met Zhu Zan again.

127
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,100
But I have to say goodbye.

128
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,710
This time I'm going back to the capital for my original purpose.

129
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,090
Despite all the dangers,

130
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,660
I'll keep moving on as long as I live.

131
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,020
Sister. Rong'er.

132
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm going back to the capital to protect you.

133
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,490
Chen's sugar figures!

134
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,350
Hi, would you like a sugar figure? Okay. Five pennies. Here.

135
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,800
Chen's sugar figures!

136
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,730
The best in Zezhou!

137
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,950
Chen's sugar figures.

138
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,880
Yes, yes, yes.

139
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,340
Chen's sugar figures!

140
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,280
I never expected Madam Su of the Fang family to be so evil.

141
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,890
Exactly. She actually gave birth to a daughter for the Fang family.

142
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,850
She even gave birth to a daughter?

143
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,570
- How could this Young Miss of the Fang family live on now? 
- The best in Zezhou.

144
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,500
How could she live? She can't.

145
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,250
Was the Fang family lady who colluded with Head Shopkeeper Song...

146
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,400
Yes! It was my mother. You're annoying!

147
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Young Lady, eat a sugar figure.

148
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,450
Once you eat my sugar figure, I'm sure you'll be in a good mood.

149
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,960
- I don't want it.
- Give it a try.

150
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,580
- I don't want it!
- Just try it!

151
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,800
I don't want it!

152
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,610
My sugar figure.

153
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,010
How much is it? I'll pay you back.

154
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm sorry for not having money with me.

155
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,860
But I'll keep it in mind. I'll definitely pay you back next time.

156
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,580
That's fine. I can make some more. That's fine.

157
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,590
Did you get kicked out by the Fang family? I find it pretty good.

158

00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
What is this last task he wants to do?

320
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,800
I will go with you.

321
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,200
You go back. I have my own plans.

322
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Don't act tough.

323
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,500
Fine, I will go back then.

324
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,200
You really don't need me?

325
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
Wait.

326
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,900
You have to pay for the meal.

327
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,000
- Shopkeeper, here.
- Take care.

328
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,700
Be careful.

329
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,200
[Tomb of beloved Princess Jiuling]
[Wife of Lu Yunqi]

330
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,750
So, it's my own tomb.

331
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,500
So, after my death, I am still in the Lu family's ancestral burial site.

332
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,570
This family held me in bondage while I was still alive,

333
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,600
and they continue to do so even now when I'm already "dead".

334
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,300
[Princess Jiuling]

335
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,700
I am here.

336
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I am back

337
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,000
I brought what you wanted,

338
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,600
the thing you said you wanted.

339
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Zhu Zan, what are you doing?

340
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
I've prepared a magic trick for you.

341
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,000
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

346
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,700
Just wait and see.

347
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,200
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

348
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,400
I have a wish. Will you help me make it come true?

349
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,100
What do you want? Tell me. I will definitely get it.

350
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,600
I hear that there's a certain flower in the northern lands called the "Hurricane Lily."

351
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,460
When the flower blooms, it is very pretty.

352
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,700
When you come back, can you bring one for me?

353
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,000
Sure. I promise you.

354
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,900
Is it pretty?

355
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,400
I am sure it will look especially pretty on you.

356
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Jiuling,

357
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,130
let me tell you a secret.

358
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,600
I never had the courage to say it out loud.

359
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,200
I was planning to tell it to you when I returned and when you called me "Ling Jiu" again.

360
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,800
It's a pity there won't be another chance.

361
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,850
I like you.

362
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,800
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

363
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,600
I rushed back immediately when I found out you were getting married,

364
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
but I was too late.

365
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,100
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

366
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,500
Too late!!!

367
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,680
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

368

♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

369
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,000
The Chu Jiuling of before won't know about it,

370
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
but the Jun Jiuling today

371
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,200
knows that you traveled over a thousand miles from the Northern frontier,

372
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,400
escaped your armed escorts, and changed your name and identity.

373
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,000
You also barged into the capital and kept a low profile,

374
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,100
just so you could place the Hurricane Lily from the north

375
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,600
on my tombstone.

376
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,960

377

♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

378
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,000
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers, I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

379
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,830
You lied to me.

380
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,400
You are not inside.

381
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,600
Do you know that I met a girl who is especially like you.

382
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,900
But I know she isn't you.

383
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
What should I do?

384
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Lu Yunqi?

385
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,740
Young Lord Zhu, this is the Lu family burial ground.

386
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,720
It is not appropriate for you to be here.

387
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,170
Because Jiuling is buried here.

388
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,020
She is my wife now.

389
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,360
Let me ask you.

390
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,150
How did Jiuling die?

391
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,470
She died from a sudden illness.

392
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,240
Royal marriages always need to pass a health check.

393
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,270
How did a perfectly healthy person suddenly die after her wedding?

394
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,430
It was difficult to predict.

395
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,080
But it has nothing to do with you.

396
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,380
No matter how much you entangle yourself, it's useless.

397
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,250
You are still acting?

398
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,120
Since further words are useless,

399
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,270
let's do something useful.

400
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,410
I will use this sword

401
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,310
to teach you a lesson for Jiuling.

402
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,080
You are not qualified.

403
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,800
You vile rascal.

404
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,420
I'm afraid you've forgotten why you're named Xiao Zao Lu.
(T/N: His name means "little jujube")

405
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,820
Let me remind you then.

406
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,400
You used to be dark and small.

407
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,230
You were as skinny as a dried jujube.

408
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,690
If it weren't for my dad taking you in,

409
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,180
you would have died on the side of the road.

410
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,810
Now you've learned how to steal?

411
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,400
Do you dare do it again? Tell me! Will you?

412
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,160
You still dare to steal?

413
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,000
Stealing?

414
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,680
You...

415
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,970
Zhu Zan!

416
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,370
In formation!

417
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,450
Get out of the way!

418
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,630
Eunuch Yuan.

419
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,480
I'm about to visit His Majesty.

420
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,620
Why are you blocking me?

421
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,580
Eunuch Yuan, he wanted to kill me on the streets.

422
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,580
Young Lord, you're not a child anymore.

423
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,400
You shouldn't cause trouble like this anymore.

424
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,480
All right.

425
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,750
See?

426
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,100
Official Lu, His Majesty has a decree

427
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,740
summoning the heir apparent to the palace.

428
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,680
What is he going to the palace for?

429
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,000
Young Lord, this way.

430
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,950
Let's go.

431
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,050
My Lord, we're letting it go like this?

432
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,950
Let's return to the Martial Moral Ministry.

433
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,000
Let's go.

434
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:34,600
[Tomb of beloved Princess Jiuling]
[Wife of Lu Yunqi]

435
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,660
Zhu Zan, according to your strategy,

436
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,990
your public appearance in the capital will cause an uproar.

437
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,650
So, you prepared to enter the palace as an escapee. Right?

438
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,390
I hope everything will go according to your plan.

439
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,020
- You must return safely.
- Miss Jun?

440
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,380
Master Ning?

441
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,950
Miss Jun, long time no see.

442
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,120
Long time no see.

443
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,560
What you did for the Fang family was great. Very admirable.

444
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,530
You've heard?

445
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,820
My family sent a letter mentioning it.

446
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,070
Miss Jun, what are you doing in the capital?

447
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,750
I... I came to take care of something.

448
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,800
But aside from my family, no one knows. So...

449
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,560
All right, I'll keep your secret.

450
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,560
If you need anything while you're in the capital,

451
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,630
you can find me at my uncle's house.

452
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,080
Okay.

453
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,860
Is something bothering you?

454
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,380
The civil exam is coming up. You will definitely do well.

455
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,590
We'll have to see.

456
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,090
Your aspiration lies in the imperial court.

457
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,550
It's my duty to continue the Ning family's legacy.

458
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,510
Becoming an official isn't any easier than being a scholar. The court is a battlefield.

459
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,670
I understand your personality. You're still a little naive.

460
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:03,380
My uncle also warned me. Do you also know about being an official?

461
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,040
Regardless, I hope you'll pass with a top score and fulfill your wishes.

462
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,570
I'll be on my way.

463
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,520
Miss Jun, let me escort you.

464
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,320
No need, it's right there.

00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,050
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

479
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:53,430
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

480
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:19,660
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

481
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:25,620
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

482
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:31,420
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

483
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:36,860
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

484
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,320
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

485
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,300
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

486
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:48,730
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

487
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,930
♫ If memories could speak ♫

488
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,070
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

489
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:00,520
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

490
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,920
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

491
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,990
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

492
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:12,210
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

493
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,490
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

494
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,620
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

495
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:26,660
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
