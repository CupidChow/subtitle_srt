[Episode 31]

19
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,690
It‘s been so long since I've seen such a clear and peaceful starry sky.

20
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,150
I remember seeing it often with my father.

21
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,540
I have also seen it when traveling alone on the road.

22
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,000
The current starry sky is still that same stretch of starry sky,

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,890
but the people under the starry sky have changed.

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,520
If not for war, this sky would be more beautiful.

25
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,800
Do you know? During the time when summer turns to autumn,

26
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,240
this sky is studded with stars.

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,990
This ground is interwoven with sparks

28
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,500
and stonecrop, making a pattern

29
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,320
as if the Milky Way of the sky has poured down to earth.

30
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Really?

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,350
I really want to see it.

32
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,620
That's easy, I'll bring you next summer.

33
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,410

What should I know?

36
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,520
Some things...

37
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,660
cannot be hidden from the eyes.

38

Jun Jiuling,

39
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,600
I've always wanted to search for answers in your eyes.

57
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,030
From the start,

58
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,680
my repeated questions were just suspicions.

59
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,210
Until I heard what you said by my ear

60
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,330
when you treated me for the pox at Qingshang Court.

61

62
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,090
Ling Jiu, I'm here.

63
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,760
Jiuling is here.

64
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,510
I thought that after experiencing life and death,

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,740
there's nothing more to be scared of.

66
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,070
But I'm so scared now.

67
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,560
I'm scared that I won't get to see you again.

68
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,100
Do you know?

69
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,820
If you can wake up,

70
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,140
I will tell you everything. All right?

71
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,430
Those faint words, I heard them.

72
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,740
At that time,

73
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,090
I was thinking that you must be her.

74
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,710
However, I can't verify that even though we have been through so much together.

75
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,920

76

how difficult it is for you.

77
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,120
You have a lot of things that are hard to say.

78
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,380
But do you still remember what I said?

79
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,520
When it comes to some things,

80
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,080
if you don't say them, I won't ask.

You can't blame us.

The treasury hasn't been able to provide that much money.

Since we're getting paid, we must share the burden of the emperor.

126

Naturally, we must think of some way

to figure out Duke Cheng's reward.

128

Otherwise, if we don't pay, we can't satisfy the military

and they'll cause trouble. Then, what would we do?

Of course, we should be blaming Duke Cheng.

Because he wants his reward, he is being aggressive.

Because of him, other officials are following in his steps and asking for rewards for every achievement.

Because of him, hundreds of officials are owed pay, and taxes are increased for all the people.

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,280
Why don't you say something to make me happy?

161
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,110
All right, I'll say something.

162
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,500
I don't like this world.

163
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,030
I only like you, Jiuling.

164
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,700
That's it?

165
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,880
Not very original.

166
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,500
That won't work?

167
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,800
Then you say something.

168
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,740
I have always been unfortunate,

169
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,330
but the best fortune I've had in life

170
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,540
is being able to meet you.

171
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,180
Even though I'm not sure what will happen in the future,

172
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,970
when I think about having you by my side,

173
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,220
I'm not scared of anything.

174
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,380
There's one thing you can be sure of.

175
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,900
No matter how this world changes,

176
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,830
I will like you and you're mine.

177
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,340
We'll be together forever.

178
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,440
Go!

179
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,500
- Be careful!
- Let's go!

180
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,900
Quickly run.

181
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,270
Zhu Zan!

182
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,130
Notify our comrades ahead that Zhu Zan and Jun Jiuling have left the Hejian area.

183
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,370
Retreat!

184
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,310
You already know about what happened at the capital?

185
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,670
Such dirty actions.

186
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,940
They couldn't get what they wanted using upright methods, so they turned to this.

187
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,480
So we need to think of a way.

188
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,970
I have an idea but I need your help.

189
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,880
It's not suitable for you to take part in this matter.

190
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,210
However, it would be much more convenient for De Shengchang to take part.

191
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,610
Also, no one would be suspicious.

192
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,970
It's very easy to take care of troublemakers,

193
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,990
but scholars are stubborn and pedantic so they aren't easy to deal with.

194
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,050
I have a solution.

195
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,640
Most of the capital's scholars are Master Qi's students.

196
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,520
If we can get him to help us, then everything will be solved.

197
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,340
That's a good solution.

198
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,010
But I heard that Master Qi has been retired for a long time now.

199
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,440
No one knows where he is.

200
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,550
There is someone who has that capability.

201
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,650
Ning Yunzhao, Young Master Ning.

202
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,380
Then after we enter the capital, we will act separately.

203
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,860
All right.

204
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,030
[Red Phoenix Gate]

205
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,010
Duke Cheng is about to return to the capital.
[Red Phoenix Gate]

206
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,950
How is the tax decree going?

207
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:24,430
Duke Cheng led the army to protect the people of Tianyou.

208
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,050
Fortunately, your people are relatively sensible.

209
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,500
Naturally, they are willing to contribute whatever they can to the soldiers.

210
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,010
Your Majesty, it's just that...

211
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,230
Forgive me for being straightforward,

212
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,820
but I hope you will distinguish between rewards and punishment,

213
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,220
and not tolerate Duke Cheng's past faults.

214
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,830
What faults does Duke Cheng have?

215
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,620
Your Majesty is merciful and understands Duke Cheng's laboriously returned from the North.

216
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,030
This should be rewarded, of course.

217
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,220
However, after we negotiated peace, Duke Cheng

218
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,210
initially resisted the imperial edict summoning his return and entered the Northern lands.

219
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,260
Thus, we must not let our guard down.

220
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,450
I trust Duke Cheng.

221
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,320
I dare ask Your Majesty to take back the summoning order at the city gates

222
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,310
and to not open the gate to welcome Duke Cheng.

223
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,650
Before, Duke Cheng disobeyed the summoning order and refused to return.

224
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,870
But now he is willing to return to the capital.

225
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,080
We have no way to know what happened between him and Northern Qi.

226
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,360
Once the city gates open and spies slip in among the crowds,

227
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,170
it will endanger Your Majesty's safety.

228
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,710
If our city's defense facilities are disclosed, then Tianyou

229
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,750
will be destroyed.

230
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,170
Even if I die thousands of times, I cannot let

231
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,990
Your Majesty and Tianyou be in danger.

232
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,030
Your Majesty,

233
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,890
I congratulate you immensely.

234
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,830
Your Majesty originally wanted to praise Duke Cheng's services. But if you open the gates,

235
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,910
then the people of the Three Counties who traveled thousands of miles through hardship to enter the capital will thank you.

236
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,950
If that's the case, then Duke Cheng and the people would be praising Your Majesty.

237
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,610
Lord Ning, are you oblivious to outside matters?

238
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,860
Lord Huang, being oblivious to outside matters refers to being oblivious to matters unrelated to you.

239
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,520
Yet this is a matter of our nation.

240
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,950
Your Majesty, in this case, you've not only made Northern Qi surrender

241
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,640
and made them pay taxes as a vassal state to comfort our ancestors,

242
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,960
but also welcome instead of abandoning the people.

243
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,290
Your Majesty, you are benevolent. The heavens can attest to that as well as to the fact that there is no other monarch like you.

244
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,230
Yao and Shun cannot even compare.
(T/N: These are highly esteemed ancient Chinese leaders)

245
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,230
This is your contribution. Everyone should celebrate.

246
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,790
Now that the peace negotiation is settled, the country is at peace.

247
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,060
I believe the people are grateful for Your Majesty's kindness and virtue.

248
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,310
I congratulate Your Majesty immensely.

249
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,300
- Your Majesty—
- All right, all right.

250
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,410
As discussed by the officials, since this is for Tianyou,

251
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,050
let me consider this matter again before deciding.

252
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm a bit tired now. You all may leave.

253
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,580
As long as I, Huang Cheng, am here, there will be innumerable hurdles.

254
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,970
Zhu Shan, you just wait.

255
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,990
[Concealed Greatness]

256
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,190
They actually used such tricks.

257
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,260
They must have planned this for a long time.

258
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,570
This move of Huang Cheng was to kill Duke Cheng with flattery,

259
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,130
pushing him into the line of danger to become the target of everyone.

260
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,180
Even before he gets here, he'll be the subject of everyone's hatred.

261
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,320
It's extremely dangerous for Duke Cheng to return to the capital. I'm afraid he won't even make it through the gate.

262
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,650
Uncle, rest assured. Naturally, I won't let them get their way and deceive the people.

263
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,670
What do you have in mind?

264
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,910
They forgot

265
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,660
that there's another person entering the capital.

266
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,610
Are you talking about Miss Jun?

267
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,620
Yes.

268
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,200
Now, she is the wife of the duke's heir apparent. She's always been very smart.

269
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,850
She must have already anticipated the difficulties of entering the capital.

270
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,050
Of course, she's planned it all and is proceeding with clear logic.

271
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,670
Yunzhao.

272
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,850
Towards Miss Jun, you–

273
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:34,510
Uncle, I have no place in her heart but I have tried before.

274
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,940
All I can say now is that it's not meant to be, or not fated.

275
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,910
Now that she has chosen her spouse, I'm happy for her.

[Jiuling Hall]

277
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,680
They've provided a large amount of money, and also encouraged a group of people to cause trouble.

278
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,590
There must be hundreds now. They've found that many?

279
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,650
They're all paid. A certain amount for an adult going,

280
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,220
a certain amount for a child going, and even a certain amount for crying!

281
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,750
They've detailed everything.

282
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,210
They have no shame.

283
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,880
I'm afraid the shameless are the hardest to deal with.

However, don't worry Eldest Young Lady.

285

Young Lady Jun is already aware of this and has made preparations.

286
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,940
Young Master has also made arrangements.

287
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,300
If it were up to me, I'd just clearly state my identity

288
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,980
and tell everyone that Miss Jun of Jiuling Hall is the wife of the duke's heir apparent.

289
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,950
With her reputation, let's see who dares to get in her way!

290
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,090
Then, aren't we are a disadvantage? No one dares to block Young Lady Jun,

291
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,850
but Duke Cheng can't be blocked either! They are two different matters.

292
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,600

Grandmother, no need to worry.

Experiencing so many things, you've grown up now.

302

What Jiuling is doing is too dangerous.

303
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,920
How would you know the reason for it?

304
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,310
Grandmother, I only need to know

305
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,970
that she's doing the right thing, then that's enough.

306
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,270
She's not only doing it for the Fang family.

You and I are the same.

308

We're willing to use everything in the Fang family's power to help her.

However, we all worry for her, that's all.

Weren't you supposed to enter the city with Duke Cheng? Why have you entered first?

311
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,710
Because there's a favor I must ask of you.

312
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,150
It seems Duke Cheng's journey back is not peaceful.

313

Scholars are upright and proud. They are hard to deal with once instigated.

314
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,290

Who is it? How dare you block our Zhu Army?

319
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,200
Duke Cheng, you have asked for reward from His Majesty, yet the treasury is empty,

320
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,420
making it hard to fulfill your wish. Thus, we are the ones to pay.

321
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,060
Duke Cheng, you have become richer with war

322
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,310
yet you can't steal the livelihood of us common people!

When will Duke Cheng arrive?

Please be calm, Third Prince. Duke Cheng has no one to hold authority over him in the North.

I believe he is used to being undisciplined.

He surely won't be able to arrive on time.

for how long that Duke Cheng can delay this.

Are you dissatisfied with His Majesty's order?

We ask that Duke Cheng dismount, take off his armor,

- and return to the capital to ask for forgiveness for his crimes!
- How dare you!

Our Duke Cheng has done great service, winning the battle. What crime has he committed?

385
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,010
Crime one, he has caused chaos in the North by disobeying imperial orders.

386
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,980
Crime two, his hunger for battle has prevented rest for his armies.

387
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,960
Crime three, his request for rewards and titles has caused military and political chaos.

Did you or did you not remain unmoving when Kaide Prefecture was attacked?

However, these scholars are innocent as well.

473
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,990
Tianyou has gained such a great master of literature.

474
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,820
Of course, I am here to congratulate you.

475
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,840
Master Qi is at the outskirts of the city?

476
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,430
Yes.

477
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,280
Why didn't you report such a great matter?

478
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,180
The messenger didn't report such a thing.

479
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,810
I didn't know either.

480
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,810
Imperial Brother, you must not neglect this matter.

481
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,720
Recently, tax was collected to reward military generals.

482
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,750
That was not unprecedented and thus hard to accept

483
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,690
for the civil servants and scholars.

484
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,790
If Third Prince continues to keep Master Qi outside the city walls

485
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,960
and word gets out,

486
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,400
then wouldn't that mean that Tianyou looks down on literature

487
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,200
and rejects scholars of the world?

488
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,430
Furthermore, with the Earl of Qinghe going to the North,

489
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,130
the Zhu Army would definitely be suspicious.

490
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,320
Why doesn't Imperial Brother take this opportunity to get on good terms with Duke Cheng?

491
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,160
This will be helpful for stabilizing military morale.

492
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,100
Once the North is stable,

493
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,960
then the money in the treasury won't be wasted.

494
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,840
Imperial Brother, although you let Third Prince and Lord Huang take charge of the situation,

495
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,910
you must not let their actions

496
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,320
ruin your reputation.

497
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,760
Send my verbal decree.

498
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,840
Have Third Prince open the gates

499
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,850
to welcome them into the city.

500
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,360
Imperial Brother is wise.

501
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,020
Duke Cheng, you're greedy for war and hurt the people in order to gain military merits.
[Guanghua Gate]

502
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,570
Do you admit to your crime?

503
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,030
Third Prince, if Duke Cheng was greedy for war and hurt the people,

504
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,130
he wouldn't bring these displaced people here.

505
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,460
If he was greedy for power, he wouldn't only bring those close to him back to the capital.

506
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,760
He will not admit these unfounded crimes.

507
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,490
If that's the case,

508
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,420
then why would Duke Cheng be condemned by everyone on his way here?

509
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,330
Whether the people are displeased with me or some deliberately set this up,

510
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,770
please investigate clearly, Third Prince.

511
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,410
Some read books of virtues yet commit evil deeds.

512
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,250
From just listening to rumors,

513
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,740
they have mixed up the truth and slander loyal officials and good generals.

514
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,560
Clearly, they do not care for the law.

515
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,970
It's clearly you who is disobeying the law!

516
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,010
There were many urgent summonses yet you refused to listen to orders.

517
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,210
I have always followed His Majesty's orders,

518
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,180
helping refugees of the North this entire trip.

519
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,110
I am now returning by His Majesty's order, Third Prince.

520
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,350
When have I defied imperial laws?

521
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,330
Third Prince, I am Qi Xuan.

522
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,240
If you still respect me, an old man,

523
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,680
then quickly open the city gates.

524
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Third Prince, please open the city gates!

525
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,530
Third Prince, you must not.

526
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:01,100
Because there are tens of thousands of refugees with Duke Cheng.

527
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,980
Once they enter the city, it will be hard to have them settle down.

528
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,870
In addition, it's inevitable that there will be thieves and spies among these tens of thousands of people.

529
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,840
Once they enter the city and cause chaos, what will we do?

530
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:22,260
Third Prince, please open the city gates!

531
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,240
