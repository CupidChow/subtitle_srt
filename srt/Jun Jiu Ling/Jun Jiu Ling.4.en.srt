Mother, Chengyu's appetite today is better than before.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,580
During breakfast, he had half a bowl of porridge more than usual.

21
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,000
Is the medicine working then?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,630
Following the prescription that Zhenzhen wrote,

23
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,930
one decoction every day. She even added in acupuncture yesterday.

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,770
Zhenzhen is really doing all she can to treat Chengyu.

25
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,780
Yes. I went to take a look yesterday.

26
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,530
She personally decocted the medicine in the east kitchen.

27
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,510
From washing to decocting, she did it all herself.

28
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,450
This child is reliable.

29
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,860
Not only that, Mother.

30
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,820
Chengyu ate half a bowl more of porridge.

31
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,500
It has been so long since he has had such an appetite.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,650
In our Fang family, this is outstanding merit.

33
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,500
I originally thought Zhenzhen was exaggerating her medical skill.

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,150
However, it now looks like

35
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,660
she really is capable.

Chengyu's illness is getting better,

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,510
but we should not act hastily. Otherwise, his body won't be able to endure it all.

Going forward, you don't need to be so polite.

In addition, you have taught me in great detail,

According to my knowledge, the average cost of a horse is around 70 to 80 taels.

At most, it will be 150 taels,

What we've found so far

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,780
is the condition of one of De Shengchang's branches.

But what if the other branches have the same issue?

106
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,900
Naturally, we shall investigate all of them.

107
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,310
This will alert the enemy.

108
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,810
I think we can use the excuse of auditing all the accounts

109
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,430
to collect all the ledgers of the branches of De Shengchang.

110
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,450
This way we will prevent the news from leaking

and changes being made in their ledgers.

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,480
Also, we can't exclude the possibility of the ledgers and transport records of previous years having issues.

113
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,550
So it's best if we can collect all the ledgers and records

114
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,670
since De Shengchang has been established,

115
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,280
to have them examined thoroughly one by one.

116
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,290
Ledgers from a decade or two ago are probably too old.

117
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,390
We won't need them, right?

118
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,290
We do. Doing business relies on trust.

119
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,250
This way, we can find the worm that has been here at De Shengchang all these years,

120
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,390
and promote those who are conscientious and trustworthy.

It turns out that I really did bring you a lot of good food.

You've grown taller.

148

Perhaps they think that you're an adult now

149
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,600
and don't need these things, so they don't bring these back to prevent you from getting angry.

Only you aren't afraid of making me angry.

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,670
Rest. I'll come back later to decoct medicine for you.

161
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,720
Acupuncture and tonics

162
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,760
are just basic treatments.

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,090
If I want to completely cure Chengyu's illness,

164
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,530
I must prepare a medicated bath for him as soon as possible.

165
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,650
Right now, the Fang family is hiding someone behind the scenes.

166
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,600
Treating Chengyu must go unnoticed.

167
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,950
I must not alarm the enemy.

168
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,200
Greetings, Madam.

169
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,790
Zhenzhen, did you just visit Chengyu?

170
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,550
Yes. The season is changing and his body is a bit weak.

171
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,260
So these past few days I prepared some medicated meals for him to avoid the cold.

172
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,650
What a nice child. You're very thoughtful.

173
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,120
You are...?

174
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
We share the same thoughts.

175
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,610
Chengyu has had a weak body since he was young.

176
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,740
He cannot sleep nor eat well.

177
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,080
I prepared some medicated meals to nourish him.

178
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,980
You are very thoughtful as well.

179
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,040
Yes. We cannot drag this matter out any longer.

180
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,910
I just bumped into Madam Su.

181
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,930
She was bringing Chengyu some tonic soup, right?

182
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,930
Has she always done that?

183
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,450
Not every day, but every now and then.

184
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,010
Are you suspecting that it is her?

185
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,770
I saw the medicated meals she was bringing to Chengyu. There was no problem.

186
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,530
It is just... I cannot explain, but I keep feeling that something is strange.

187
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,850
Zhenzhen, you're wrong this time.

188
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,340
Madam Su has a gentle personality. She surely cannot be the one behind it.

189
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,290
I've also examined her tonic soup. Nothing is wrong with it.

190
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,540
What if she's using the soup as an excuse to check on his condition?

191
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,960
I'll have someone keep an eye on her.

192
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,910
- If it's her, I will show no mercy.
- Grandmother,

193
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,370
let's not act rashly and alarm the enemy just yet.

194
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,760
I want to use marriage as an excuse to spread the false news that Cousin cannot get better.

195
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,130
That way, everyone will think that the wedding is to counter his illness, and it will lull the person behind it.

196
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,070
In addition, it'll be beneficial to my treatment of Cousin's illness.

197
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,840
Currently, his condition is improving.

198
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,220
The next step is a bath to detoxify him.

199
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,250
It's just that he is very guarded against the intimacy between men and women.

200
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm afraid that he won't cooperate if we're not husband and wife.

201
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,130
Between the sexes, there should be a prudent reserve.

202
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,580
Zhenzhen's worries are reasonable.

203
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,640
Even if it's a fake marriage,

204
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,310
when everyone knows of the truth in the future,

205
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,590
what will we do about your reputation?

206
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,600
Grandmother, right now, there's nothing more important than Chengyu's life.

207
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,530
I need to cure Chengyu's illness as soon as possible.

208
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,040
As for the rest, just let the people talk.

209
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,890
Zhenzhen, have you really thought this through?

210
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,080
I'm sorry that you will have to suffer through this, Zhenzhen.

211
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,770
Zhenzhen, if you are able to save Chengyu's life

212
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,710
and save the bloodline of the Fang family,

213
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,170
you can use the Fang family's assets as you like.

214
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,870
Grandmother, I cannot do that.

215
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,440
There is nothing you can't do.

216
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,680
Since you treat our Fang family wholeheartedly,

217
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,300
then our family will treat you wholeheartedly as well.

218
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,950
Sincerity in return for sincerity.

219
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,280
I am also a granddaughter of the Fang family now.

220
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,000
I must do everything I can to keep the Fang family safe.

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,890
Older Sister.

222

Rong'er.

223
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,970
You must also be safe and wait for my return.

[Prince Huai's Residence]

225
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,300
Older Sister.

226
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,340
The paper boat Rong'er folded looks so nice.

227
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,060
It looks like a real one.

228
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,540
Older Sister, will she be able to see it?

229
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,230
She will.

230
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,340
Of course, she will.

231
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,250
When she taught me how to fold the paper boat, she told me

232
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,030
that if you keep thinking the person's name when you are folding it,

233
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,610
they'll definitely know.

234
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,410
Unfortunately, she can't teach me other things

235
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,020
and can't tell me stories anymore.

236
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,850
Then Rong'er, let's fold some more paper boats

237
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,800
and put them in the water. She'll definitely see them.

238
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,380
Okay.

239
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,520
Why are you coughing?

240
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,750
Did you catch a cold again recently?

241
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,280
I, Lu Yunqi, greet Your Highness Princess

242
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,070
and Your Highness Prince Huai.

243
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,710
Older Sister, I will take my leave now.

244
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,810
Okay. Then I'll go visit you later.

245
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,820
What brings Lord Lu here today?

246
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,720
I have asked His Majesty to marry you.

247
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,390
His Majesty has already agreed.

248
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,660
Fine.

249
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,020
I've already had someone pick an auspicious day for us. The 18th of the sixth month.
 (Lunar calendar)

250
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,580
I wonder what your thoughts are, Princess.

251
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,570
The 18th of the sixth month.

252
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,180
Jiuling's birthday.

253
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,650
Of course, it's an auspicious day.

254
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,460
I will surely prepare for the wedding well.

255
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,360
I'll be leaving now.

256
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,610
It seems that

257
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,000
Chu Rang has arranged all of this.

258
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,840
Fine. This is the only way

259
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,550
I can protect Rong'er.

[Clouded Dream of the Lake Inn]

261
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,880
Second Brother.

262
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,310
Second Brother, there's news from Yunxiao Pavilion.

263
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,990
They found the late emperor's personal maid, Bing'er.

264
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,970
The Martial Moral Ministry has been hunting her down this whole time. Fortunately, we were ahead of them and saved her.

265
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,360
According to Bing'er,

266
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,710
the late emperor's death was not caused by the relapse of a chronic illness,

267
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,410
but is related to Chu Rang and Lu Yunqi.

268
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,130
Bing'er said that the night the late emperor died,

269
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,710
she personally saw Chu Rang secretly enter the imperial study.

270
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,270
It seems that he had a dispute with the late emperor. That night,

271
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,330
it was Lu Yunqi who was on guard, but he never mentioned it to anyone after that.

272
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,690
Not long after that, the Imperial Physician Hall announced to the public

273
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,730
that the late emperor died of a relapse of a chronic illness.

274
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,970
However, after the death of the late emperor, Bing'er secretly went to see him.

275
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,230
There were strangulation marks on his neck.

276
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,230
He usurped the throne by killing his brother.

277
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,980
Also... Bing'er also said

278
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,140
that she told this information

279
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,670
to Princess Jiuling.

280
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,910
By the way, Second Brother,

281
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,520
Bing'er drew this pattern by memory.

282
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,480
According to Bing'er,

283
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,020
the day the late emperor died, she saw that he looked terribly distressed as he looked at this pattern.

284
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,750
Could it be that Chu Rang's killing of the late emperor is related to this pattern?

285
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,230
Mother, are we really announcing the news of Chengyu and Zhenzhen's engagement tomorrow?

286
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,650
Should we wait until Chengyu is a bit better?

287
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,430
Tomorrow is the day of discussion between the stewards and shopkeepers of all the branches of De Shengchang.

288
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,900
Everyone will be together, so it's the best timing.

289
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,840
Everyone in our home already knows about it.

290
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,980
It will inevitably spread.

291
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,780
Why?

292
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,510
Why?

293
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,790
Grandmother. Mother.

294
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,070
Why?

295
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,650
Jinxiu, is this how you speak to your grandmother?

296
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,090
Yes. I know.

297
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,410
It's disrespectful to question Grandmother like this.

298
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,540
But I just want to know why.

299
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,750
Chengyu is already fifteen years old.

300
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,340
The physician said that Chengyu won't live past sixteen,

301
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,300
so we are holding a joyous event to counter his illness.

302
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,010
Grandmother.

303
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,470
You have always been wise.

304
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,440
You never believed in these things.

305
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,920
- Why now—
- The past is the past.

306
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Now is now.

307
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,410
As long as Chengyu can stay alive,

308
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,290
no matter what method it may be, I'm willing to try it.

309
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,820
Fine.

310
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,260
Then let me ask.

311
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,780
Since you want to counter the illness with marriage, why not find another lady?

312
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,550
Why does it have to be Jun Zhenzhen?

313
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,610
She is willing to do and I am willing to let her.

314
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,310
Grandmother, she's willing

315
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,340
because she wants to rule our family.

316
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,230
In the future, she can abuse her power and domineer as the young madam of the house.

317
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,120
No wonder she's been so interested in De Shengchang recently.

318
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,090
She refused to go before, but now she goes more frequently than anyone else.

319
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,580
She even thought of a way to look at De Shengchang's ledgers and transport records over the years.

320
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,920
I think she calculated all this long ago

321
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,100
in order to take over De Shengchang in the future!

322
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Jinxiu, you're thinking too much of it.

323
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,850
It's really just to counter the illness.

324
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,800
She wants to usurp De Shengchang and the Fang family!

325
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,700
She can keep dreaming!

326
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,000
Their marriage will make us doubly related

327
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,800
and counter the illness, changing fate. No one is allowed to intervene.

328
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Jinxiu, hurry and apologize to Grandmother.

329
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,590
I'm not wrong.

330
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,080
Why should I apologize?

331
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,300
Mother, please calm down. It's all my lack of discipline.

332
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,800
This is what onlookers

333
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,400
think of this marriage.

334
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,400
In the end, Zhenzhen is the most wronged.

335
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,800
We shall remember all this in our hearts.

336
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
In the future, we will surely repay her manyfold.

337
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,200
[Imperial edict relayed by the Ministry of Ceremonies]

338
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400
If this curse is a natural disaster,
[Seal]

339
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I will do everything to turn it around

340
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
to protect my Fang family's bloodline.

341
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
If it's done by a person,

342
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
no matter how high ranking or powerful,

343
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,300
even if I'm an ant shaking a tree,

344
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,600
I will fight them to the end.

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Who made my Jinxiu mad again?

346
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
Hurry and sit.

347
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Mother.

348
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,300
I told Mother and Grandmother all of your suspicions.

349
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,900
But none of them believed me.

350
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,000
Forget it.

351
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,800
We've already done our part in warning them.

352
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,700
In the future, don't mention this again

353
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,300
so as to not anger Grandmother, all right?

354
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,100
I got it. Then, I'm going to bed.

355
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,900
Go on.

356
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,790
No need. Hurry and go sleep.

357
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,300
Quickly tell Second Master Song that the marriage cannot be reversed.

358
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,490
Yes.

359
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
Older Sister. Rong'er.

360
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,980
Are you well?

361
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,900
It's funny to say that I'm getting married again.

362
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,490
But this time is different.

363
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,700
This time I'm repaying my debt to Zhenzhen

364
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,200
as well as to investigate the truth behind Imperial Father's death.

365
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,180
You're still up?

366
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,200
I'm not the only one...

367
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
still up.

368
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,500
I was thinking about something and couldn't fall asleep.

369
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Are you thinking about something as well?

370
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm thinking,

371
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,800
"Can I leave the Fang residence once before I die?"

372
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,700
Have you never left here before?

373
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,800
Before I was five years old, I did go out.

374
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,600
I even remember the Lantern Festival back then.

375
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,100
In the clearing in the middle of the city, there was a huge lantern.

376
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,400
When it was lit, almost everyone in the city could see it.

377
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,100
If you want, you can still see the Lantern Festival this year.

378
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,000
Do you know why I've never mentioned

379
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,600
going out again after I was five years old?

380
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,260
Don't laugh when I tell you.

381
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,760
When I got sick at the age of five,

382
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,660
I had to avoid many foods.

383
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,830
I couldn't eat a lot of things.

384
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,400
But I was only 5 years old,

385
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,600
when I was curious about everything.

386
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,440
How could I resist all those tempting foods?

387
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:00,020
One day, I saw a male servant outside

388
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,180
drop the pastry he was eating.

389
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
I got up from bed and

390
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,000
slowly crawled over to it. I picked it up and ate it.

391
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Coincidentally, Mother saw.

392
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,100
She immediately passed out from crying.

393
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,800
She lay in bed for 3 days and 3 nights.

394
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,800
From then on, I've never had any requests.

395
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,000
I eat whatever Grandmother tells me to eat.

396
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,300
If they don't let me go out, then I don't.

397
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,200
It's been hard all these years, right?

398
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,670
It was and it was not.

399
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,570
Anyway, it's all about to end.

400
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,800
It's just that recently my desire to go out

401
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,000
has gotten stronger.

402
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,630
Perhaps because I'm nearing the end.

403
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,610
I want to go out and live recklessly for once.

404
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,190
Let's go to the Lantern Festival together this year.

405
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,150
Grandmother will never agree to that.

406
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,450
There's me.

407
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm here. This year, we'll definitely be able to go together.

408
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,240
Trust me.

409
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,600
I'm worried that Chengyu's body won't be able to handle it.

410
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Grandmother, his condition is better.

411
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,600
It's time for him to go out and move around.

412
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,200
Besides, if he is in a good mood, his body can get better sooner.

413
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,700
He can do it. Trust me.

414
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,000
That child has suffered a lot these past years.

415
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,400
If you think it's good for him to go out,

416
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,600
then let him go.

417
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Grandmother, Chengyu's body is weak.

418
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
There will be a lot of people at the festival.

419
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,200
- What if someone steps on him or pushes him?
- Let's listen to Zhenzhen.

420
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,900
Jun Zhenzhen, what kind of mind confusing soup did you give Grandmother and Mother?

421
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,000
They actually agreed to let Chengyu go out and especially for the Lantern Festival, too.

422
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,600
If Zhenzhen says it is all right, then it should be all right.

423
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,500
Hurry and sit.

424
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,820
The whole family has drunk her mind confusing soup.

425
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,500
Grandmother, I heard there's an auspicious prize during Zezhou's Lantern Festival.

426
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,400
The Lantern Festival's auspicious prize is just to generate more liveliness.

427
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,000
It's not anything grand. The prize that Jinyun Restaurant has for the Double Third Festival is grand.

428
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,400
What happens at the Double Third Festival at Jinyun Restaurant?

429
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,000
We don't know. No one in the Fang family has been.

430
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,400
What is it? Do you want to win the auspicious prize?

431
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,670
I want to make a lantern.

432
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,000
Every year, our family blocks off a street to make lanterns.

433
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,600
If you want to make one, then just add one.

434
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,400
After we eat, I'll have Steward Gao take you to see the artisan.

435
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,000
All right. Thank you, Grandmother.

436
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,700
Everyone, eat. Eat.

437
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,960
[Seals]

438
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
What is it?

439
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Do you think this pattern is related to the seals of

440
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
escorted transport or regular transport of goods?

441
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,400
That's possible.

442
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Second Brother, then isn't that...

443
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Imperial transport of goods.

444
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,960
Say, is there something publicly known about that person?

445
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,330
The silver to rescue the hostages during the third year of Taiyan was handed over in Zezhou, the territory that Chu Rang held as a vassal.

446
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,530
That year, Northern Qi treacherously

447
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,310
killed numerous princes as well as the emperor emeritus.

448
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,260
If the pattern sketched by Bing'er is the same from back then,

449
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,310
there must be some hidden secrets.

450
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,260
If that really is the case and the matter is brought up,

451
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,400
- there will surely be a terrible disaster.
- Go investigate.

452
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,200
See which merchants in Zezhou have such capabilities.

453
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,240
The death of the emperor emeritus must have something to do with Zezhou's secret.

454
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,830
Okay, I'll go now.

455
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,390
- Boss, two bowls of hot pepper soup.
- Okay.

456
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,780
Did you hear?

457
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,350
The paralyzed young master of the Fang family

458
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,640
is marrying his cousin who recently came to seek shelter with their grandmother.

459
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,770
- The marriage will make them doubly related.
- It sounds nice.

460
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,920
What do you mean doubly related? To put it plainly,

461
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,070
they're taking advantage of Miss Jun because she's alone and has no one to turn to. Otherwise,

462
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,340
why would a lady like Miss Jun

463
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,070
marry a paralyzed man who's barely alive?

464
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,420
Forget that. That Miss Jun

465
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,900
extorted 5,000 taels of silver from the Ning family.

466
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,900
She even said that the Young Master Ning is worth the same as a courtesan.

467
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,430
- What decent lady would say such words?
- Waiter.

468
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,830
- Yes, customer.
- I think...

469
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,000
- Thank you.
- ...she is marrying into the Fang family...

470
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
- Take care.
- ...for their wealth.

471
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,690
- Boss, I want two more steamed buns.
- Okay.

472
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,680
Artisan, is the design I drew difficult to make?

473
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,710
Miss, it's not that it's difficult.

474
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,590
It just may not look pretty after it is made.

475
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,120
That is fine. Its appearance is not why I want it made.

476
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,180
Just do as she said.

477
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,340
Okay.

478
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,540
Thank you for the trouble.

479
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,240
Miss, last time you asked me

480
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,810
whether there was anything interesting going on in the capital. To be honest,

481
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,280
I do not know much about the interesting things that go on in the capital.

482
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,240
Here's something interesting now.

483
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,410
Many people who have been to the capital have brought this back.

484
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,030
- A roadmap of the capital?
- Yes.

485
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,190
I saw someone selling it when I was at the post station, so I bought one.

486
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,830
It wasn't expensive, and it doesn't look that impressive, but its victory lies in its details.

487
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,200
It is indeed drawn in great detail.

488
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Miss, I'll get out of your way then. I will head back to De Shengchang first.

489
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,150
Okay, go ahead. I still have to make a lantern here.

490
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,430
All right, goodbye.

491
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,540
Let's go! Come buy materials with me.

492
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,070
- Liu'er.
- Okay.

493
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,460
Help me choose some bamboo strips.

494
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,030
Let's choose some that can be used to make a lantern.

495
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,040
If you're tired,

496
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,260
you can sleep for a bit in the carriage.

497
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,150
I'm going to be a while.

498
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,710
I'll wait for you in the carriage then, Miss.

499
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,380
Call for me when we're leaving.

500
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,300
Okay. Go ahead.

501
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,610
Miss Jun, I have disturbed you.

502
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,260
Why are you here again?

503
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,680
First, I'm not here because of the princess.

504
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,360
Secondly, I'm not following you.

505
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,730
The Fang family's carriage is right at the door. Third,

506
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,190
you and I are both old friends of the princess, so I want to ask you some things.

507
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,420
We are not very familiar with each other, right?

508
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,490
You can only get this capital roadmap at the post station. Where did you get this from?

509
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,940
The family steward gave it to me. Are you also familiar with it?

510
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,030
It's because I made it.

511
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,230
A friend told me about it.

512
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,440
I deliberately made this to sell

513
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,330
to lure Chu Rang into summoning me into the capital

514
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,510
so that I can see Jiuling.

515
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,340
What a shame.

516
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:21,490
♫ The echo sounds again,
causing the candle and tears to indulge with me ♫

517
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:28,810
♫I want to know when you shall return
for I've been desperately looking for you by my lonesome self♫

518
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:35,320
♫ Flustered in thoughts again
for it's difficult to solve your deep riddle ♫

519
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:42,440
♫ However, the details are drenched in memories
and I want to confirm that the answer is you ♫

520
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,230
♫ I see through your false calmness ♫

521
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,270
Is there anything else?

522
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,940
I often made lanterns with Princess Jiuling when we were younger.

523
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,580
She always wore crimson clothing,

524
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,250
looking bright and beautiful.

525
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,370
♫ The wind and frost all go accompany you ♫

526
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,820
You still remember your childhood that clearly?

527
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,260
Yes. When you like someone, you naturally remember everything about them clearly.

528
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,100
♫ How much of it is cherished? No need to bury the past ♫

529
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,050
You liked her?

530
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,980
Yes.

531
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,020
That's why I'm constantly asking you about her.

532
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,840
Unfortunately,

533
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,700
I still missed out on her.

534
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:51,100
Then, why didn't you tell her before?

535
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,960
I wanted to wait to tell her when she reached adulthood.

536
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,090
Who knew...

537
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,990
it would be harder for us to see each other after that.

538
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,200
I have this with me at all times. Apply it.

539
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,540
Thank you, Young Master.

540
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,930
Miss Jun, De Shengchang has been in operation for many years.

541
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,840
- Do you know whether or not Zezhou—
- Young Master,

542
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,720
I don't know anything about De Shengchang.

543
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,800
- Miss Jun, please tell me anything you know.
- Young Master Ling,

544
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,180
if you are asking about De Shengchang,

545
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,850
I really cannot tell you anything.

546
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,770
I still need to make this lantern. If there's nothing else,

547
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,660
please leave.

548
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,920
Thank you for the trouble.

549
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,050
I'm staying at the Clouded Dream of the Lake Inn.

550
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:06,750
If you think of anything, please help me answer my questions.

551
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,390
Goodbye.

552
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,290
Why are you asking about De Shengchang?

553
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,570
Could it be that you're also investigating the hidden secrets of Zezhou?

554
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,830
Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi
