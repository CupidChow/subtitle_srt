♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,620
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,850
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,870
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,060
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

[Episode 20]

19
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,320
If the young heir is also going, that would be great.

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,490
He would be able to protect Miss.

21
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,200
With Lu Yunqi there, I really can't feel assured.

22
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,240
Don't be too worried.

23
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,640
Miss Jun is a fortunate person who will be protected by the heavens. She will be fine.

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,310
It will be okay.

25
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,460
By the way, Shopkeeper Liu, Jiuling wanted me to give this to you.

26
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,980
All right.

27
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,410
What does she need these for?

28
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,800
Jiuling always has a reason for her actions. Let's just follow her requests.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,810
Okay. Eldest Miss, if there isn't anything else,

30
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,060
I will go back to De Shengchang.

31
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,570
All right.

32
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,830
She really managed to get so many physicians to go.
[Imperial Physicians Hall]

33
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,100
I think Jun Jiuling is too arrogant this time.

34
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,840
I think she doesn't want to live for long.

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,650
Let them be. In a month,

36
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,020
we will see the outcome.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,350
Also, everyone should do their duties.

38
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,510
Go visit the palace and various lords more often.

39
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,420
After all, everyone is in a panic right now.

40
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,270
Do your best so that they can rest assured.

41
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,140
All right. We'll go back to work then.

42
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,900
Excuse us.

43
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,060
- Miss!
- Chen Qi, how is it? Is everything inside ready?

44
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,660
- Yes.
- Let's take a look.

45
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,860
Physician, save us!

46
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,540
Save our kids. I'm begging you!

47
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,000
Everyone, don't panic! The physicians are here!

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,970
Let's hear what the physicians have to say first.

49
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,650
Get up first.

50
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,690
Physician.

51
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,330
Everyone, morals come first.

52
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,370
His Majesty is currently at the palace praying for everyone.

53
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,840
The Martial Moral Ministry and all the physicians

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,200
came all the way here without hesitation

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,540
to fight against the epidemic with all of you. I know that

56
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,780
some of you, along with your kids, are in imminent danger.

57
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,000
I also know that you have family members

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,540
waiting for your return.

59
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,190
They are eagerly waiting to see you.

60
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,150
I promise you all

61
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,050
that as long as we can fight,

62
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,540
even if we have only one day left,

63
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,350
we won't give up on any patients.

64
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,390
Thank you.

65
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,270
Thank you, Physician Jun.

66
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,760
Physician Jun.

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,040
Thank you. Thank you.

68
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,050
Thank you.

69
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,860
Right now, we don't have much time. Please cooperate with us in your treatment.

70
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,500
You must ease your minds, all right?

71
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you, Physician Jun.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,820
Thank you.

73
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,330
[Chaohua Hall]

74
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,190
Your Majesty, I have one more thing to report.

75
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,110
Go ahead.

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,200
Your Majesty, the fact that Physician Jun went to Qingshan Court to cure smallpox on an imperial order,

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,170
has spread throughout the capital and to other major cities.

78
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,240
The common people are commending Your Majesty

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,520
on your grace and benevolence.

80
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,490
According to the news reported to the Ministry of Wars by the posts,

81
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,690
many people who have the smallpox

82
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,970
are on their way to Qingshan Court after hearing about it.

83
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,680
For such a great act of kindness, having just Jiuling Hall there

84
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,070
makes it difficult to inspire and comfort patients. I think,

85
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,140
to show how much the imperial family takes it seriously,

86
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,940
we should send a prince or an imperial lord

87
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,070
to be stationed at Qingshan Court.

88
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,790
Your Majesty, I have a different opinion.

89
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,150
What Lord Ning said is not quite right.

90
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,020
Your Majesty has already sent Commander Lu there with his people.

91
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,320
Doesn't it show how much the Imperial Court cares about the matter?

92
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,170
Your Majesty, I find what Lord Tan said is inappropriate.

93
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,690
How could Commander Lu compare with a prince or imperial lord?

94
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,790
Your Majesty, please understand that I did not mean that at all.

95
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,760
Your Majesty, Third Prince is linguistically and artistically talented.

96
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,080
He's the right person.

97
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,600
Your Majesty, Third Prince has recently

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,980
been learning in the different ministries

99
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,450
to assist Your Majesty with national affairs and to help shoulder some burdens.

100
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,560
Lord Ning's suggestion is inappropriate as well.

101
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,860
May I dare ask Lord Tan for your suggestion then? Among the princes,

102
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,980
who should be elected to go to Qingshan Court?

103
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,500
Twelfth Prince, Prince Xian.

104
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,220
He's part of the imperial family, but he has no government affairs to tend to.

105
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,770
He's the most suitable person.

106
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,010
I think that is our only choice.

107
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,890
It's not right, is it?

108
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,960
But it makes sense.

109
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,870
That's right.

110
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,430
Your Majesty, I believe there is someone

111
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,010
more suitable than Prince Xian.

112
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,560
Lord Huang, who are you referring to?

113
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,040
Your Majesty, Duke Cheng's heir apparent, Zhu Zan.

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,660
Your Majesty, I disagree.

115
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,010
He's not part of the imperial family, and he has been convicted.

116
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,410
How could he take on such an important task?

117
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,490
Lord Ning, you think too much. Does being convicted

118
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,820
mean that he deserves to be beaten to death with no chance to turn things around?

119
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,050
Precisely because he is convicted, he should make amends for his wrongdoings.

120
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,830
Your Majesty, his age is between that of Third Prince and Prince Xian.

121
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,140
He's in the prime of his life, so it would not be easy for him to contract smallpox.

122
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,520
His father, Duke Cheng, is very well known.

123
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,290
As the saying goes, "Like father, like son."

124
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,990
Your Majesty, even though his status can't compare with a prince or an imperial lord,

125
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,720
he's at least addressed as "Young Lord the Heir Apparent."

126
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,470
I believe a person of his status

127
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,060
is most suitable.

128
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,330
Your Majesty, please make a decision.

129
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,960
Beloved Minister Huang, what you said makes sense.

130
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,860
- Let's decide on Zhu Zan then. Lord Ning,
- Your Majesty—

131
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,720
Must I repeat myself?

132
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,590
Zhu Zan will represent the Imperial Court

133
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,710
to go to Qingshan Court and take care of the situation.

134
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,870
Your Majesty is wise.

135
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,810
Thank you, Young Master Ning and Lord Ning.

136
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,560
As you said, we couldn't recommend you directly,

137
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,450
otherwise it would backfire.

138
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,830
There must be objections for it to work. Young Lord,

139
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,070
I have a question for you.

140
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,630
Go ahead.

141
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,720
Are you close to Miss Jun?

142
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,520
Not very.

143
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,330
When we played pitch-pot at Jinyun Restaurant, you two knew each other. Right?

144
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,690
No. We met for the first time.

145
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,490
I just find it strange. If you two were close,

146
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,190
you should call her name, Jun Jiuling or Jiuling.

147
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,730
But you don't even call her Miss Jun.

148
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,400
You only call her that Jun person. However, if I say you two are not close,

149
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,630
you didn't have to help her time and time again,

150
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,830
even offending Commander Lu that sly devil.

151
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,060
You scholars think too much. It's just a form of address.

152
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,920
I'm leaving now.

153
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,770
Young Lord,

154
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,470
when you arrive at Qingshan Court,

155
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,170
take care of her.

156
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,060
How is he?

157
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,870
His pulse is stable for now.

158
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,330
Come.

159
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,010
What it is, Physician Liu?

160
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,780
The majority of these pox patients have been infected for over 3 days.

161
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,790
They're also in the critical stage. The young people recover faster.

162
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,620
As for treatment, honey and rhizoma may be used, but the effect is unknown.

163
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,440
How about this? Try using 3 maces of medicated leaven, 5 candareen of Coptis Chinensis,

164
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,960
1 mace of ginseng, 2 maces of hawthorn, and 1 mace of cicada exoskeleton to make a decoction.

165
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,570
I've never heard of this prescription before. Will it work?

166
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,800
Use this medicine with patients who were infected within the past 3 days and young patients.

167
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,250
They are still mentally and physically well enough to endure it.

168
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,710
For critical patients who have been infected for more than 3 days, use the honey and rhizoma to be safe.

169
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,960
All right. That's the only thing we can do now.

170
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,040
Let's hurry and go see.

171
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,030
- Here.
- Give me a bowl.

172
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,070
- One bowl for each person.
- Here, for you.

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,640
Chen Qi, I need detoxification soup here!

174
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,180
All right.

175
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,950
You can't scratch. You must not scratch.

176
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,270
- What is it?
- Physician Jun.

177
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,870
Physician Jun, can I still be saved?

178
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,310
Here, open your mouth.

179
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,350
Hang in there. As long as you believe we can do it,

180
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,050
then you'll definitely be able to get better. Do you understand? All right.

181
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,210
- Chen Qi, prepare a bowl of detoxification soup for here!
- All right.

182
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,960
Physician Jun, hurry and take a look. That young man can't hold on much longer.

183
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,710
You will be fine, you will be fine. Persevere.

184
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,450
What's going on here?

185
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,430
He was fine earlier.

186
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,900
So serious.

187
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,520
That's right.

188
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,980
- We must use acupuncture.
- All right.

189
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,140
- Hold him down, Physician Feng.
- All right.

190
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,540
- Roll up his sleeve.
- All right.

191
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,430
No, you have to hold him down! Use force!

192
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,310
Do you feel better?

193
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,330
Physician Feng, prepare him a bowl of detoxification soup.

194
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,820
All right.

195
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,020
Physician Feng,

196
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,950
let's step aside and have a few words.

197
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,330
Acupuncture can only be used to temporarily stabilize their conditions.

198
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,330
We must hurry and find a prescription to target the disease.

199
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,720
- Go ahead and work.
- Okay.

200
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,870
More and more people are getting critically ill. What should we do?

201
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,050
The current situation is worse than I anticipated.

202
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,960
I keep studying the medical books, but there is no cure-all solution.

203
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,160
Based on today's diagnoses, what insights do you all have?

204
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,510
I've documented some things today.

205
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,710
Among those suffering from pox, those with bright pox are in better conditions.

206
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,520
Those with glossy, red sores have mild cases. Those with a dense amount of sores have severe cases.

207
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,450
Those with wide and red have mild cases. Those with fever and asthma symptoms are in critical condition.

208
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,420
Those with waxy sores have mild cases. Those with abdominal distension, thirst, shortness of breath, and teeth grinding are in critical conditions.

209
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,150
There are many people infected now.

210
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,250
According to each person's symptoms,

211
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,500
we should change the prescription as appropriate.

212
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,800
I put together a list of prescriptions.

213
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,340
For people who experience confusion, make the medicine with 5 Chinese thorowax roots.

214
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,960
For those who are cold with deficient vitality, use a firewood, kudzu, and cinnamon decoction.

215
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,420
- For those with strong vital energy,
- That's right.

216
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,630
give them a detoxification tonic or an appropriate amount of ginseng and Perilla frutescent tonic.

217
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,040
For those with superfluous cold energy, we can use Five Accumulation Powder

218
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,340
or try a rhizoma and licorice decoction.

219
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,420
All right. Then I ask everyone to

220
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,930
immediately adjust the prescription as appropriate.

221
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,320
Okay.

222
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,790
Here at Qingshan Court,

223
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,760
I ask you all to give it your all so we can overcome this challenge together.

224
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

225
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,200
Miss, let me do it.

226
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,860
No need.

227
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,130
There can't be any fluctuations in

228
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,680
the ingredient ratio or heat level.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
It looks like the prescription you came up with during the day is working.

230
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,420
It's much quieter out here now.

231
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm afraid that the silence is only temporary.

232
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,800
You've worked incredibly hard today.

233
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,710
Have a bowl of ginseng soup and replenish yourself.

234
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,470
Where is it from?

235
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,240
I-It is from Imperial Physicians Hall.

236
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,590
His Majesty said to use the medicinal herbs freely.

237
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,550
So I got some ginseng and young deer antler

238
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,580
to help everyone replenish themselves.

239
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,760
Quickly bring this to Physician Feng and the others. They have worked hard all day.

240
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,970
- But, Miss, you—
- I'm fine.

241
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,850
It's the middle of the night. Why is he here again?

242
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,220
He's like a ghost that won't go away.

243
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,560
He was ordered to monitor Qingshan Court, so it's expected for him to come and survey the place.

244
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,190
Hurry and go. Don't mind him.

245
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,940
He didn't actually have scrofula. Is that right?

246
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,570
Answer me.

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,180
Miss Jun came here,

248
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,280
not to deal with you.

249
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,940
Heir Apparent.

250
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,940
Jiang Baihu.

251
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,730
Lord. L-Lord, he has...

252
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,720
[Imperial Edict]

253
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,600
[Imperial Edict]

254
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,370
Look carefully.

255
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,430
Heir Apparent, you may have an imperial edict;

256
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,050
however, you still must obey the rules here.

257
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,740
Naturally.

258
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,700
However, I am not the same as you.

259
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,790
I have never bullied a young lady.

260
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,400
I have never bullied a young lady.

261
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,500
I only kill people.

262
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,820
Heir Apparent, why are you here?

263
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,920
You said before...

264
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,460
that you're willing to fight for the people.

265
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,370
I am willing, too.

266
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,950
It is very dangerous here right now.

267
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,800
- You—
- I already said before,

268
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,010
I am willing, too.

269
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,170
- Endure it for just a little more.
- I can't.

270
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,510
- Guo'er, be good.
- I can't.

271
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,410
Guo'er, be good.

272
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,850
Guo'er, you will only get better after applying the medicine.

273
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,430
That way you can go out and play with your mother sooner.

274
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,340
Sister Jun, after applying the medicine,

275
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,190
then... can I get better?

276
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,590
I promise you. As long as you listen

277
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,030
and apply the medicine, then you'll get better soon.

278
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,390
I promise you, okay?

279
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,510
Then, Guo'er, you're the best.

280
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,610
Let's apply the medicine, all right?

281
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,310
Endure it for a bit.

282
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,040
Good girl.

283
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,670
Is it done?

284
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,110
Almost, almost.

285
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,100
Just endure a little more.

286
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,580
Endure it.

287
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,220
Endure it.

288
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,730
Endure it, endure it.

289
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,510
Old Man Cheng.

290
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,650
Old Man Cheng. Old Man Cheng.

291
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,050
- Do you feel better now?
- What's wrong?

292
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,450
- Is it better?
- Endure it.

293
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,430
All right, just endure a little more.

294
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,510
I need to perform acupuncture.

295
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,000
- Give me his Hu Kou.
- Okay.
(T/N: acupuncture point located at the thenar webspace)

296
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,230
Old Man Cheng, hang in there.

297
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,940
Hang in there.

298
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,200
The acupuncture will only temporarily reduce the pain. Old Man Cheng is elderly, so you must take care of him meticulously.

299
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,670
All right.

300
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,130
Physician Jun, I hope your method

301
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
is effective.

302
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,730
Until the last moment, none of us can give up.

303
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,420
H-H-He died! Wasn't the old man fine last night?

304
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,310
I'm afraid. I don't want to die.

305
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,320
- I don't want to die.
- Guo'er, good girl.

306
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,500
Physician Jun, what is going on?

307
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,120
Didn't you say you could cure this illness?

308
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,190
Old Man Cheng was too sick.

309
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,650
Plus he was elderly, so he missed the best time for treatment.

310
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,800
Mother, I don't want to die.

311
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,060
Mother, I'm scared.

312
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,080
Guo'er, as long as you accept treatment

313
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,250
and listen to me, I will surely help you live.

314
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,790
I will listen to you.

315
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,370
We're not getting treatment anymore. We are suffering so much yet the results are the same.

316
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,210
I would rather just die.

317
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,500
We won't get treatment, Guo'er. We won't get treated..

318
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,270
Older Sister, I understand how you feel right now.

319
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,400
I just want to tell you,

320
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,720
Guo'er's hope for survival isn't on anyone. Not even me.

321
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,600
It's on you. As long as you don't give up, Guo'er won't give up.

322
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,950
Do you know? You're her biggest support.

323
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,210
In the darkest of moments, you are her light.

324
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,200
Why did you come here to the capital?

325
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,500
Why did you travel so far to bring her here?

326
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,450
Isn't it just to give her a chance to survive?

327
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,370
Just listen to the physician.

328
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,090
Physician Jun, I was momentarily muddle-headed.

329
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,430
We... We will listen to you.

330
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,770
- We'll get treated. We'll get treated.
- We'll listen to you.

331
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,040
Here, be careful.

332
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,860
Let's drink the medicine.

333
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,870
Physician Jun.

334
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,380
Lie down first. Please wait.

335
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,870
What is it?

336
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,670
Two more people got carried away. A total of five people have died now.

337
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,530
Call all the physicians together tonight. We'll quicken our pace in testing the prescriptions.

338
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,010
We must find the cure to the pox as soon as possible.

339
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,340
Is this medicine to save people or poison

340
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,480
- that kills people?
- Miss, calm down. Calm down.

341
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,870
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,520
We all know about what happened last night.

343
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,310
Today, corpses were carried out

344
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,240
one after the other.

345
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,950
- Will it be our turn soon?
- Older Sister! Older Sister!

346
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,080
Calm down. Calm down.

347
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,380
Stop lying to us.

348
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,290
If you really wanted to cure us,

349
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,680
why haven't you cured us by now?

350
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,700
Why are there more and more people dying instead?

351
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,470
What kind of medicine are you giving us?

352
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,560
- Everyone.
- You should go back first.

353
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,420
We have never given up on investigating prescriptions.

354
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,760
It's just that, right now,

355
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,450
we indeed have not yet found a cure.

356
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,950
All right.

357
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,950
Turns out you all do not know how to treat this at all.

358
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,520
You tricked us all here

359
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,340
because you're afraid we'll infect the lords of the capital, is that right?

360
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,400
- It's not like that. It's not like that.
- Liars. Liars.

361
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,370
- It's not like that.
- You lied to us.

362
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,930
If you had said earlier on that there is no cure,

363
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,830
then why would we have traveled so far to get here

364
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,620
to suffer?

365
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,270
I would rather die at home.

366
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,620
At least then my soul could return home.
(T/N: belief that a person's soul will be lost if the deceased's body isn't brought back to their hometown)

367
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,300
- We should return to our hometowns.
- That's right.

368
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,270
All right. Everyone, go on back first.

369
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,810
Physician Feng, this is our problem.

370
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,430
We must face it. I hope that everyone can believe

371
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,490
that every life here is not a joke to us.

372
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,380
If possible,

373
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,310
we hope to suffer on behalf of everyone.

374
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,590
Every physician here

375
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,680
views everyone's life as more important than their own.

376
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,770
I hope everyone can give us more time.

377
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,440
We can definitely put our efforts together and find the cure for smallpox.

378
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,050
No matter what problem and no matter at what time, all the physicians

379
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,670
will stay with you all.

380
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,770
- Everyone.
- Heir Apparent.

381
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,550
I am the heir apparent of Duke Cheng, Zhu Zan.

382
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,520
Until everyone recovers and the smallpox epidemic ends,

383
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,400
I will remain here with you all.

384
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,310
I know that everyone is very upset

385
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,180
and hopeless.

386
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,710
However, unless we are at our last moments, we must persevere.

387
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,570
The perseverence I am talking about is not just personal.

388
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,710
I mean the perseverence as a group together.

389
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,020
I ask everyone to please believe in Physician Jun and the other physicians.

390
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,840
I believe that with our perseverence,

391
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,130
we will win against this.

392
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,030
All right. Everyone, please head back first.

393
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,020
Recuperating is most important now. All right? Head back.

394
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,200
Come on, come on. Let's head back.

395
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,640
Miss! Miss!

396
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,860
Shopkeeper Liu said it's hard to immediately complete everything you asked,

397
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,880
but he'll do his best to hurry.

398
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,050
If you see Lord Lu, please tell him

399
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,870
that to not block the people from De Shengchang who may come. I'll just go get it.

400
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,930
All right.

401
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,290
Zhu—

402
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,010
In regards to the handwritten edict, I didn't take everything into consideration and made a hasty delivery.

403
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,580
Did Miss Jun blame you?

404
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,380
She did not blame me. Instead, she thanked me.

405
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,340
Then, why do you blame yourself?

406
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,900
There's quite a distance between the capital and Zezhou.

407
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,170
No matter how fast news travels, it can never keep up with momentary changes.

408
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,940
When I sent it, I never knew that so many things would happen after.

409
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,100
Did something happen to Miss Jun in the capital?

410
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,640
She was ordered to go to Qingshan Court to treat the pox.

411
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,580
Now, there is a large shortage of herbs,

412
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,000
silver, and infected cattle.

413
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,430
Infected cattle? What can they be used for?

414
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,740
I don't know either.

415
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,100
However, since she wants them, then there must be a use for them.

416
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,080
[Instruction letter to provide Jun Jiuling with whatever she needs without the need to consult Fang Chengyu]

417
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,970
Quickly send this to the capital.

418
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,500
Yes.

419
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,760
Jiuling, you must stay safe.

420
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,540
You cannot leave.

421
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,410
I came under an imperial order. I won't escape.

422
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,980
- Heir Apparent.
- Heir Apparent.

423
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,770
- Get out of the way.
- Heir Apparent.

424
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,380
- Xiaozao Lu.
- Heir Apparent, you can't go in.

425
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,360
So many years have passed yet you're still the same.

426
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,330
You as well, Xiaozao Lu.

427
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,220
Did you purposefully come to pick a fight?

428
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,720
Miss Jun asked me to tell you

429
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,340
not to block any deliveries from De Shengchang. Let them deliver it to the bottom of the mountain.

430
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,880
From now on, have her tell me whatever she has to say, herself.

431
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,850
Do you know why she asked me to relay her words?

432
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,150
It's because she can't bear to see your icy cold, dead face.

433
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,170
That's still better than you who's simple-minded and mischievous.

434
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,770
Being simple-minded

435
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,620
is better than being cruel.

436
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,900
She asked for so much honey and rhizoma.

437
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,930
Are they not using the honey-rhizoma method?

438
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,840
Not only that, but she has also taken a lot of alcohol.

439
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,910
Using alcohol in medicine?

440
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,400
According to my previous investigation,

441
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,170
alcohol and lime are used to drive away evil spirits.

442
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,910
It's used to make sure dead patients

443
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,720
don't spread the disease.

444
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
She asked for so much alcohol.

445
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,700
Looks like many people died.

446
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,320
It should be a lot.

447
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,390
However, Commander Lu is guarding the place strictly.

448
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,920
There are strong restrictions on who can enter and exit.

449
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,230
Even our carriages that are delivering medicine are not allowed up the mountain.

450
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,400
Someone from there will come out to get the carriages.

451
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,550
When we ask about the situation,

452
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,950
they all do not reply.

453
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,940
So, no one knows the condition in that court.

454
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,950
It allows that Jun Jiuling to hide the truth.

455
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,710
Imperial Physician Jiang, when we ask, they do not say.

456
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,560
If His Majesty asks,

457
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,740
Lu Yunqi can't possibly not answer, right?

458
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,800
Physician Jun, the patients have not improved after using your prescription.

459
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,400
What should we do?

460
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
That is because it has been too short of a period of time.

461
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Physician Feng, you cannot say that. Smallpox is deadly.

462
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Severe patients can die in seven days!

463
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,000
When treating this type of disease, we don't have much time, to begin with.

464
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,800
That's right. There are more and more dead.

465
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,200
It is getting harder and harder to comfort the patients.

466
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,900
Physician Jun, if we had known you had no secret prescription,

467
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,800
why would we have come with you to die?

468
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,600
That's right. Say, you don't have the capabilities to cure the pox so why are you here acting strong?

469
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,100
Furthermore, I heard that the situation is getting worse everywhere.

470
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,400
If there are corpses everywhere, then none of us will survive.

471
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
That's right. What should we do?

472
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,200
What's with the arguing?

473
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,800
Keep on arguing. Why did you stop?

474
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Keep arguing and none of you will survive.

475
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,400
A ghost that won't go away.

476
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,750
Everyone.

477
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,700
What did you say to them just now?

478
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I am responsible for not thinking of a good plan.

479
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,600
Physician Jun said that no one has ever done this before.

480
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,800
With more people, it will be easier to do.

481
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,600
Physicians,

482
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,600
she was indeed at fault in this matter.

483
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,800
Her fault was that she couldn't guarantee that she could cure this disease.

484
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,500
However, she didn't hide anything and even took the lead.

485
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,200
I once asked her what she would do if no one came to cure the pox.

486
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,400
She said that the road ahead is dangerous. Life and death are unpredictable.

487
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
You all have elders and children at home.

488
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,800
It's normal that you would not come. She can understand.

489
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,400
I also asked her why she came here.

490
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,100
She said that "those who've mastered medicine save people.

491
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,800
Those who've mastered medical ethics save the world." She chose the latter.

492
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,200
If everyone truly does not want to stay to treat this illness,

493
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,800
then I will not make it difficult for you all. However, please do not leave here yet.

494
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
I'll prepare a clean courtyard. When the smallpox epidemic ends,

495
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,600
I will personally escort you down the mountain. I promise I won't mention this to anyone.

496
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,300
Everyone, that day, you all risked your lives

497
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,800
to come here. I have nothing to return the favor.

498
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I know you've been working without rest day and night to take on this task despite criticism.

499
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,900
I am beyond grateful. In regards to the current situation,

500
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,000
no one wants to see it. However, as long as one person is still alive,

501
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,600
then the things we are doing have meaning.

502
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,600
My father once said to me,

503
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,400
"Do good deeds without asking about the future".

504
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,500
I ask everyone to stay

505
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,700
because every patient here needs you.

506
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,600
Since I willingly came here,

507
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:59,230
I will willingly continue.

508
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,000
I will not leave anymore.

509
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,700
- I will not leave anymore, too.
- I will stay as well.

510
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,000
I will stay too.

511
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,300
I will stay, too.

512
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm giving it my all.

513
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,800
I will remember all your benevolence.

514
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I have a prescription that we can try. Please take a look.

515
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,700
What is it?

516
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,620
Take a look.

517
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,400
This prescription is not bad. We can try it. I'll immediately gather the herbs.

518
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,800
Thank you for your trouble.

519
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
Let's go.

520
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,400
Look here.

521
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,600
You've worked hard.

522
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I hope this prescription will work.

523
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,200
Too many have already died. Once news gets out,

524
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,600
I'm afraid we cannot control the reaction.

525
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,800
- Today—
- There's no need for thanks.

526
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,830
Today, it was not only for you,

527
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,200
but more so for those outside.

528
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,400
How is Guo'er doing today? Any better?

529
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,900
Last night, we used our new prescription.

530
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,000
She's doing much better today. I think the prescription is working.

531
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,260
Did the sores scab over?

532
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,600
When I looked just now, some scabs were showing signs of falling off.

533
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,600
As long as she doesn't have a fever, she should fully recover soon.

534
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,400
However, I think to utterly win against this pox epidemic,

535
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,600
- we must quickly find how to treat the root cause.
- That's right.

536
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,800
Miss.

537
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,200
Aside from the people of the Martial Moral Ministry, a lot of officers and soldiers have also came.

538
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,800
Right now, those out there are not aware of the situation here.

539
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,800
They only know that new patients arrive every day.

540
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
I think they're afraid that the situation is not ideal, so they're paying more attention to here.

541
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
Are the things I want here yet?

542
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Soon.

543
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,300
It's just that it is not as easy as before to get supplies delivered here.

544
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,400
Let's do this. Go look for Heir Apparent and have him go down the mountain with you.

545
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,200
- All right.
- Go on.

546
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,500
[Betel Nuts]

547
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,500
- Shopkeeper Liu.
- Young Lord.

548
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,400
According to Miss Jun's orders, we were able to gather a cart full of foreign betel nuts.

549
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,800
We could only find these cattle. It was very difficult to find them.

550
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
I was worried that it was urgent, so I'm here to deliver a batch first.

551
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,930
Are there only cattle and betel nuts?

552
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,400
Yes.

553
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Using betel nuts for medicine is considered normal.

554
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,200
What about these cattles? Are they to be eaten?

555
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,500
Young Lord, speak carefully.

556
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,000
Slaughtering cattle is against the law.

557
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,200
Then she must have her use for them.

558
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,600
Young Lord, we were allowed to deliver supplies up there before.

559
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,400
Why are we not allowed in now?

560
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,800
Is the situation inside worse now?

561
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't worry. With your young lady there, everything is fine.

562
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,600
Go back home. It's more convenient for you to be outside.

563
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
All right. I will head back then.

564
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,700
If there are any needs, notify me.

565
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
Are you going to make me carry all these herbs and cattle up the mountain by myself?

566
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,400
Give me a hand.

567
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,050
Let's go.

568
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,940
Let's go.

569
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
Let's go.

570
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,700
Physician Jun, why did you want these cattle?

571
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,800
These cattle all had the pox before.

572
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,000
Thus, I want to scrape off their scabs to use to treat the pox.

573
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,200
- Treatment?
- Using scabs?

574
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Can these cattle cure the pox?

575
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
There are records from Lingnan (Southern China). There was a smallpox epidemic in that region before.

576
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,800
There were countless casualties and some towns were even wiped out.

577
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,800
However, there were some who survived. It is those who had the pox when they were young.

578
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,600
So, I was thinking

579
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,900
- could it be that those who have had the pox are not affected later on?
- Wait.

580
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,000
Do you mean to have people who have had the pox take care of who are infected now?

581
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
What I mean is

582
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,800
what if everyone is able to get the pox once?

583
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,200
Everyone?

584
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,400
Wait. Everyone gets the pox once?

585
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
- If everyone gets it, what would we do if they die?
- That's right.

586
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,400
I know smallpox is deadly,

587
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,400
but what if there's a type of smallpox that is weaker and won't cause death?

588
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,900
In an ancient medical book, someone used pox scabs from cattle to treat the disease. We can try it too.

589
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,000
Have humans absorb the pox from the cattle?

590
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,600
Exactly. These cattle have fully recovered from the pox,

591
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,200
so the deadliness of the pox in their bodies is very low.

592
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,000
C-Can this work?

593
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,400
Then how can we be sure that

594
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,800
this smallpox poison won't be deadly?

595
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Exactly.

596
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,300
If it doesn't work, then aren't we killing people?

597
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,400
Exactly.

598
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Isn't this treating a person's life as a joke?

599
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,850
So it is imperative that we find

600
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,000
someone who has not been exposed to the pox.

601
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,600
Then, if they successfully contract smallpox

602
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,200
and fully recover, then we can continue with inoculations.

603
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,600
- Innoculation?
- What kind of joke is this?

604
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,900
- What kind of joke is this? This is not reliable.
- This is crazy.

605
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,200
No, no, no.

606
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,800
- This can't be done.
- This is crazy.

607
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,000
Physician Feng, do you understand what I mean?

in a deadlock with the sky ♫

630
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,400
♫ If memories could speak ♫

631
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,400
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

632
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,800
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

633
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,000
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

634
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,200
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

635
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,400
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

636
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,800
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

637
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,000
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

638
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,900
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
