♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,670
[Episode 28]

19
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,420
My Lord,

20
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,290
according to your instructions, I have handed them over to Gui Shou.

21
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,280
It's just...If anyone from the palace or Imperial Physicians Hall asks,

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,110
what should we say?

23
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,060
There was a criminal who was struck with a complex illness,

24
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,650
and Imperial Physician Jiang has always been responsible and diligent.

25
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,120
So, he came to stay in the prison.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,060
You know how to explain the rest, right?

27
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,420
Poor Imperial Physician Jiang gave his all,

28
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,640
and became sick so he passed away.

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,380
You may go.

30
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,560
You dare touch my woman!

31
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,760
My Lord,

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,520
Miss Jun has already left Zezhou to go north.

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,550
I don't think she will bring too many people with her.

34
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,240
I will immediately take some people to bring her back for you.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,210
But you must wait until after she's dealt with the inoculation matter

36
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,550
before you do anything.

37
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,080
Yes.

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,150
Let's go.

39
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,760
Your Majesty, I ask to return to the North.

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,560
You still dare mention facing attacks?

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,530
Very well.

42
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,150
Then I'll show you.

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,170
This accuses your father of delaying military plans.

44
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,740
Take a look.

45
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,130
This one accuses your father

46
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,370
of being disloyal.

47
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,030
This one accuses you and your father of using military funds to expand your residence!

48
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,190
Take a good look! You still dare mention attacks?

49
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,420
Are you trying to continue to embezzle military funds?

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,960
Take a look. Take a good look!

51
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,060
It's all about you and your father. I trust you two,

52
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,610
so I suppressed these reports. Is this how you repay me?

53
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,790
No wonder people in the North say there's an emperor in the south and a Duke Cheng in the North.

54
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,680
Your Zhu army is truly outstanding.

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,060
Your Majesty, these are false rumors.

56
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,000
You're the patron saint of the Northern lands and whom they believe in.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,380
Everyone says that without you, there would be no Duke Cheng or peace in the North.

58
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,250
Your Majesty, your subject Zhu Shan has given his best

59
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,710
and is willing to die for the court at any time. He is utterly loyal.

60
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,060
Your Majesty, you're a wise monarch.

61
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,980
Please do not listen to the lies.

62
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,430
Your words sound nice.

63
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,140
Let me ask you.

64
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,090
Do you really not know why I'm keeping you in the capital?

65
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,040
Do you know?

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,380
I did it so that those who are reporting you two can shut up.

67
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,240
So they'll think that since you're in my hands, your father, Duke Cheng will be afraid.

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,890
I'm doing it for them to see!

69
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,440
Your Majesty.

70
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,800
That's enough. Go take care of the horses at the Ministry of Livestock.

71
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,680
Your Majesty, I ask to redeem myself for my crimes by going to battle with my father.

72
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,090
I'll go to battle with my father!

73
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,490
I'll go to battle with my father!

74
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,930
I'll go to battle with my father!

75
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,590
Miss Jun,

76
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,920
people from the Martial Moral Ministry have caught up to us.

77
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,820
So far, they haven't done any harm to us. Let them follow us for now.

78
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,100
Then, what should we do? Should we turn around to go back to Zezhou?

79
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,740
Keep going north. It's not easy for us to make the trip. I want to see whether there's a problem with the inoculation.

80
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,050
[Jiuling Hall]

81
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,560
Eldest Miss, Miss Jun sent a letter.

82
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,780
Hurry, let me see.

83
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,580
W-What does it say?

84
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,140
Is it about the inoculation issue?

85
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,140
Indeed, there's an issue with the inoculation. However, it's not our inoculation, but a fake one.

86
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,930
Fake one?

87
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,350
W-What happened?

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,400
There were a few physicians who discovered the principle behind the inoculation and became greedy.

89
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,800
They retrieved the pox from infected individuals on their own accord.

90
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,340
Consequently, their methods were wrong and the toxicity was too high, so there were issues with the inoculation.

91
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,050
Is that so?

92
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,240
It's great that the issue is resolved.

93
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,330
That's right. It's great that it's resolved.

94
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,610
The more unwilling His Majesty is to let me go back,

95
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,080
- the more reason why I should go back.
- If you go out now, there will be even more people who want to kill you.

96
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,710
Second Brother, you need to be cautious.

97
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,530
Oh, right. How is the inoculation issue in Hebei?

98
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,790
Miss Jun has already resolved it.

99
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,310
But...

100
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,430
Miss Jun is missing.

101
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,480
She should...

102
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,660
be hiding from Lu Yunqi's men, right?

103
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,330
Young Lord! Young Lord!

104
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,250
Second Brother, someone's calling you.

105
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,810
If I hear anything about Miss Jun, I'll let you know immediately.

106
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,070
Miss Jun always makes people worried.

107
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,820
Coming!

108
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,080
My Lord, the princess is not in danger. She just caught a cold.

109
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
I will do my best to help her recover.

110
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,390
Nothing can happen to the princess.

111
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,290
My Lord, rest assured. I will do my best. I'll go prepare her medicine now.

112
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,980
Princess, you should still take good care of your body.

113
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,610
Even if it's only for Prince Huai's sake.

114
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,100
He's already lost an older sister, so he cannot lose another.

115
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,020
I know.

116
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,490
Back then,

117
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,200
did Ling'er ask you to take care of us?

118
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,810
She didn't.

119
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,520
Then I should thank Lord Lu even more.

120
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,030
Please rest, Princess.

121
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,840
Jiuling,

122
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,100
just now Princess Jiuli thanked me for taking care of her and her younger brother.

123
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,810
She asked me if this was all your request.

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,800
If you knew all of this was for you,

125
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,200
would you be touched?

126
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,670
Forget it. Who told me to like you?

127
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,870
Even if someone is slightly similar to you,

128
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,500
I'll do everything I can to hold onto her.

129
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,690
I won't let anyone go.

130
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,200
Master, Lord Yu has arrived.

131
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,300
Let him in.

132
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,790
Lord Huang.

133
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Thank you for your advice.

134
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,030
It looks like the three countries of Zhengding

135
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,500
will be ours very soon.

136
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,600
You people are benefitting from this deal,

137
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,000
but what about me? All of my efforts have amounted to nothing.

138
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,400
Not only did Duke Cheng survive in the battle with Northern Qi,

139
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,590
he even defeated Northern Qi to recapture Hejian Prefecture.

140
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,200
Lord Huang, seizing Hejian Prefecture was supposed to be a done deal,

141
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,800
but who would have thought Duke Cheng

142
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,900
would actually rush there with the speed of thunder.

143
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Your calligraphy truly lives up to its reputation.

144
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,200
You're even able to write Sangguan regular script so delicately and beautifully.

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,100
Admirable. Admirable.

146
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,650
We would still like to reconcile with you.

147
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,500
Hence, please convey that to His Majesty.

148
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,200
Zhu Zan killed my son. I must make him and his father pay with their lives.

149
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I originally wanted to use Lu Yunqi to get rid of Zhu Zan,

150
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,500
but that plan still fell short.

151
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,810
After losing, you want to make peace?

152
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,500
Then what about my son's revenge? Who will exact revenge for him?

153
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,000
Young Lord Huang treated me very well when he was alive.

154
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,200
However, we cannot violate His Majesty's order.

155
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,800
If you take the initiative to ask for peace, then Duke Cheng will get the credit.

156
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,400
If that's the case, not only will Duke Cheng be in the North,

157
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,200
the whole world will be Duke Cheng's.

158
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
You're saying...

159
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
Whether it's offering land,

160
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,000
money, or jewels, those are all superficial wealth.

161
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,400
There's sincerity there, but it's far from enough.

162
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you dare fight to the death,

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,800
using the blood and flesh of your Northern Qi soldiers

164
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
to express your sincerity?

165
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,200
I cannot make the decision for such a significant matter.

166
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,400
His Majesty must make the decision.

167
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,800
When the night is long, there's much trouble. You must hurry.

168
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
Yes.

169
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,200
Lord Huang, then I'll take my leave now.

170
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,860
I'll go north first.

171
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,800
Miss, are we traveling again?

172
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm thinking about where we'll go first.

173
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Miss!

174
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,200
Something bad has happened.

175
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Northern Qi has officially declared war on us.

176
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
War?

177
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,700
Northern Qi has already sent a written war declaration. Their soldiers have already assembled,

178
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,200
and are coming at us from the east and west borders.

179
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,800
Duke Cheng has ordered each prefecture to prepare for war.

180
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Yongxing Army and Guangcheng Army are being mobilized now.

181
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
The common people's lives are still unaffected.

182
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,400
According to the requirements, they are saving up rice and refraining from going outside.

183
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,200
It's just that the North is no longer peaceful like before.

184
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,000
For now, we shouldn't go any further north.

185
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,600
That's right. Once war breaks out, it's no joke.

186
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,800
Miss, how about we head back in the other direction?

187
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,400
We can go back to Zezhou or the capital. Whatever you want.

188
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
No.

189
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Since it's come to this,

190
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,100
then we have more reason to go north and visit all the counties.

191
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,500
Duke Cheng can only face the enemy with no worries if the inoculation matter is dealt with.

192
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,800
- But we—
- It's decided.

193
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,600
Hurry and pack the bags. We're leaving today.

194
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes.

195
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,700
I didn't think the war would become a stalemate.

196
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,800
Prepare to get moving.

197
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,600
In southwestern Hebei, gather people from Yunxiao Pavillion. We'll regroup there.

198
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,500
- Then, how will you escape?
- I have my way.

199
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,800
Second Brother, there's news about Miss Jun.

200
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
She went north from Qingyuan prefecture.

201
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
You go find out more about her and then come meet us.

202
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,800
All right.

203
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,200
Lord Huang,

204
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,800
this is a jade seal that the king of Northern Qi had capable craftsmen make.

205
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
After everything is over, this shall be yours to use.

206
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,100
My Lord, take a look. Are you satisfied with it?

207
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
It's too early to say all that yet.

208
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,900
The current situation is very unfavorable for Northern Qi.

209
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,400
Duke Cheng is brave.

210
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,800
We suffered heavy losses in the battle of Xiongzhou.

211
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,400
I knew you wouldn't be able to handle the old man.

212
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,200
So we must ask you for advice, My Lord.

213
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
Conduct a raid at Kaide Prefecture.

214
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,300
Kaide Prefecture is my nation's sore spot.

215
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,600
His Majesty will surely call Zhu Shan back to clear the siege.

216
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
If he's summoned and doesn't return, he will be defying an imperial decree.

217
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,000
If he's summoned and returns...

218
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,300
Brilliant plan. Lord Huang, a brilliant plan.

219
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,800
I will go back and prepare the troops immediately.

220
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
You must hurry.

221
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,700
My Lord, rest assured. It's a sure success.

222
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,800
I, Huang Cheng, am under one person but above thousands.

223
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm ashamed to face my nation.

224
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Lord Huang is excellent in civil and military skills.

225
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,400
You should be the real monarch of the court.

226
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Military Governor, remember this.

227
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,600
I must take the lives of Zhu Shan and his son.

228
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,520
You must not wet this area for the next two days. You must keep it bandaged.

229
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,000
Miss, here is the Fuxi Powder.

230
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's right. Give him the four-herb powder and five candareen of notoginseng.

231
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,400
All right.

232
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Fuxi powder.

233
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Here, slowly. I'll help you.

234
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
- Thank you, Physician Jun.
- Go ahead and drink it.

235
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,570
Miss, all of the severely injured have been settled.

236
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,400
Over there, the inoculations have also started.

237
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,600
Okay, thank you.

238
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,900
Liu'er, the conditions here are tough. You've worked hard.

239
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,800
With you, I don't feel like it's hard.

240
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Let's go take a look over there.

241
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
- Physician Jun.
- Physician Jun.

242
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,600
- Physician Jun.
- It's my turn.

243
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,900
Physician Jun.

244
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,600
Everyone,

245
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,200
I've been entrusted by Duke Cheng to come and give you all the inoculation.

246
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,400
Duke Cheng knows that the suffering you experience in the North is not easy.

247
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,800
He also knows that you're often subjected to fear of invasions.

248
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,600
So he specifically ordered me to come and resolve the sufferings from diseases.

249
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,400
This is a blessing to the commoners and a blessing to the North.

250
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,300
Now, I've already taught the inoculation technique to the local physicians.

251
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,800
So please feel at ease and cooperate with the treatment.

252
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,000
Thank you, Physician Jun.

253
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Duke Cheng is such a good person!

254
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,600
- A good person!
- Yes!

255
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
- Yes.
- Thank you, Physician Jun.

256
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Everyone, no need to be so polite.

257
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We're all people of the North. We're all one family.

258
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,800
Then, let's continue with the inoculation.

259
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,600
Children under ten get priority.

260
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Please come.

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
Liu'er, go help Master Lei.

262
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,700
All right.

263
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,710
Betel nut smells bitter. It's pungent, warm, non-toxic, and astringent?

264
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,500
It helps with digestion. It is a hydragogue.

265
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,970
It eliminates phlegm and three types of worms. It cleanses corpses.
[Betel Nut]

266
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,250
It treats tapeworms. It grows near the South China Sea.

267
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,970
What are you doing, Master Lei?
[Records of Celebrated Physicians]

268
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,410
Miss Jun said that after the years of war here in the North,

269
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,520
the food and water are unsanitary.

270
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,780
With the addition of miasma, people's bodies must be breeding many diseases and worms.

271
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,220
This betel nut can increase vitality, kill worms,

272
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,280
eliminate the accumulation of water and relieve diuresis. It's a very good supplement to medicine.

273
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,280
Since Miss Jun handed over the important task of sorting the medicinal herbs to me,

274
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,200
I must not make any mistakes.

275
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,860
I still need to understand the efficacy of these herbs.

276
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,080
Master Lei, you are very mindful.

277
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,560
[Red Phoenix Gate]

278
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,720
Your Majesty, Kaide Prefecture cannot fall.

279
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,530
Back then, Northern Qi invaded us through there

280
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,260
and came south to surround the capital; all sides couldn't save it.

281
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Your Majesty's father was captured and died on foreign land.

282
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,580
Could it be that they are using the same tricks to stage a comeback?

283
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,570
Your Majesty, please issue a decree to

284
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,150
transfer Duke Cheng back to defend Kaide Prefecture.

285
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,620
Same path, same tactic.

286
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,830
This is too much of a coincidence.

287
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,290
Your Majesty, you must not.

288
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,660
Duke Cheng is fighting Northern Qi in the North right now.

289
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,910
If we transfer him back now, the North

290
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,710
will be slaughtered and be at the mercy of others.

291
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,630
Lord Ning, are you saying

292
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,980
we should ignore the safety of the capital?

293
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,830
Of course, that is not what I meant. Lord Huang, stop taking things out of context.

294
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,860
I care about Your Majesty.

295
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm only thinking of your safety.

296
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,090
Your Majesty, please issue the decree

297
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,730
to transfer Duke Cheng back to defend Kaide Prefecture.

298
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,620
Your Majesty, even if you don't consider your own safety,

299
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,630
you should consider the safety of the people of this city.

300
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,550
Your Majesty, please transfer Duke Cheng back to defend Kaide Prefecture.

301
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,690
Your Majesty, please transfer Duke Cheng back to defend Kaide Prefecture.

302
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,770
Your Majesty, please transfer Duke Cheng back to defend Kaide Prefecture.

303
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,280
Your Majesty, please transfer Duke Cheng back to defend Kaide Prefecture.

304
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,810
Your Majesty, please transfer Duke Cheng back to defend Kaide Prefecture.

305
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,000
Yaozi Pass. Qingpa River. Liangcheng County.

306
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,870
The capital.

307
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,380
It's a risky move for their troop to invade Kaide Prefecture alone.

308
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,810
It doesn't seem like they are fighting to invade the central region.

309
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,110
How can it be such a coincidence?

310
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,480
All of the advancing routes are exactly the same as those during the third year of Taiyan.

311
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,860
Their objective is to disturb the morale of our troops.

312
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,760
- What's wrong with the horses? They are running away. Stop them! Hurry!
- We can't stop them.

313
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
Hurry!

314
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,070
- Don't let the horses run away!
- Help!

315
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,980
Come stop them!

316
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,350
Hurry and stop them!

317
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,280
Issue the decree to have Duke Cheng mobilize the troops immediately

318
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,560
to return to defend Kaide Prefecture.

319
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,030
Your Majesty, I think that issuing more decrees

320
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,690
can show your reliance on Duke Cheng,

321
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,630
and to let Duke Cheng know the severity of this situation,

322
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,070
so he'll rush back with soldiers to defend.

323
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,820
Then issure another decree. Two decrees.

324
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,700
Three. No,

325
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,920
ten decrees.

326
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,710
Your Majesty is wise.

327
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,840
Zhu Zan escaped.

328
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,230
Your Majesty, Zhu Zan escaped.

329
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,130
Everyone is useless!

330
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,600
They can't even keep watch over a mere Zhu Zan!

331
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,820
What's going on?

332
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,570
They said the horses were alarmed and he chased after them.

333
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,440
However, as he was whistling, the horses followed along with him.

334
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,720
These beasts don't understand the dangers of swords, spears, bows, and arrows at all.

335
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,290
Hiding among them, Zhu Zan couldn't be stopped.

336
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,100
My Lord, I failed in my duties.

337
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,110
I calculated all possibilities and didn't expect he would escape in this manner.

338
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,150
Please punish me.

339
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,870
We'll just remember this for now.

340
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,850
Go do something for me.

341
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,210
My Lord, what instructions do you have for me?

342
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,350
His Majesty issued a state-wide decree that the Heir Apparent of Duke Cheng fled to escape punishment.

343
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,150
Anyone who sees him can arrest him and bring him back to justice.

344
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,830
Yes. I will notify our brothers everywhere.

345
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,770
[Martial Moral Ministry]

346
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,280
Miss.

347
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,030
All right.

348
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:39,880
Miss, they have followed us all the way. I guess they are quite determined.

349
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,720
Let them be. They've followed us the whole way and nothing has happened.

350
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,190
It's so chaotic in the North now. We can consider them as armed escorts.

351
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,010
Protect Madam!

352
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,820
There's a fight down there. Miss, should we avoid it?

353
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,440
Let's save them.

354
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,650
Get on the horses! Get on the horses!

355
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,910
Miss, be careful!

356
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,490
My Lord, what should we do?

357
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,470
Old Ba, find the chance to escape or all of us will die here.

358
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,840
Madam, don't worry. With me here, nothing will happen to you.

359
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,920
Protect Madam!

360
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,000
Old Ba!

361
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,650
Madam Yu.

362
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,660
I'm fine.

363
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,170
Be careful!

364
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,220
Madam!

365
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,960
- Miss!
- Miss!

366
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,310
Miss, are you all right?

367
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,850
I'm fine.

368
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,230
Are you all right?

369
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,910
What's wrong?

370
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,220
Madam, your leg may hurt for a few days.

371
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,840
- Bear with it.
- If it didn't hurt, then that would be something to worry about.

372
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,720
- Let me.
- Here.

373
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,850
Be careful.

374
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,660
Are you all right?

375
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,160
I'm fine.

376
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,770
Miss, what's your family name?

377
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,490
It's Jun.

378
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,040
Miss Jun.

379
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,490
Madam, where are you heading to?

380
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,370
Daming Prefecture.

381
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,340
They are not bandits. They're killing without robbing. They should be...

382
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,110
Northern Qi people.

383
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,300
Miss Jun.

384
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,570
Madam, please wait for a moment.

385
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,840
Master Lei, what's the situation?

386
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,090
Miss, they are not bandits.

387
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,280
They are Northern Qi people pretending to be bandits.

388
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,220
No wonder. This makes sense then.

389
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,550
- Master Lei, let's change our route to Daming Prefecture.
- Daming Prefecture?

390
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,940
- That's right.
- Why?

391
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,500
I don't have time to explain. I will tell you later. Let's prepare to set out soon.

392
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,750
- All right.
- Go on.

393
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,260
Everyone, immediately pack up and be ready to set out.

394
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,600
Madam, let me escort you to Daming Prefecture.

395
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,900
From the look of it now, you don't have any other choices.

396
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,110
Lord Jin, you have worked hard.

397
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,770
Miss Jun, what do you mean?

398
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,040
I wonder when Lord Lu will take actions

399
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,510
to capture me and take me back to the capital.

400
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,110
You have misunderstood, County Princess. I have no such intentions.

401
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,850
Are you here to escort me, then?

402
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,840
Since that is the case, I will trouble you for the rest of the journey.

403
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,810
Come on, come on!

404
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,330
Cheers!

405
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,160
- Is it done?
- Soon. Almost.

406
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,740
Why are you crying?

407
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,500
Fill it up. Let me have one first.

408
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,930
Beauty, let me take a look.

409
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,680
Let me take a look at you.

410
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,420
Fill it up, fill it up.

411
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,620
Fill it up to the brim.

412
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,080
Is it cooked yet?

413
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,900
It will be done soon.

414
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,620
What's the hurry?

415
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,810
I haven't eaten yet.

416
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,800
Someone's there.

417
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,230
Run quickly!

418
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,020
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Where's Baotang?

419
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,230
He's in the Northwest summoning our brothers to set out for Kaide Prefecture.

420
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,010
There's no news about Miss Jun.

421
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,190
Let's go to Kaide Prefecture.

422
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:49,450
Ten decrees were issued and they were all rejected.

423
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,050
Oh, wonderful Zhu Shan.

424
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,820
Your Majesty, please punish

425
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,470
Duke Cheng Zhu Shan for being guilty of rebelling.

426
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,140
Your Majesty,

427
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:15,880
please punish Duke Cheng Zhu Shan for his arrogance.

428
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,620
Your Majesty, please punish Duke Cheng Zhu Shan for his arrogance.

429
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:26,750
Your Majesty, with Zhu Zan escaping, Duke Cheng will be more confident and fearless.

430
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,870
They are really too bold.

431
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,170
Your Majesty, I have already distributed wanted warrants everywhere.

432
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,030
I will definitely apprehend Zhu Zan soon.

433
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,540
Your Majesty, everyone only sees that the son of Duke Cheng

434
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,760
escaped and that Duke Cheng is being confident and fearless.

435
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,670
However, please consider this. The Heir Apparent of Duke Cheng fled to the North.

436
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,620
Wanted warrants are everywhere.

437
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,930
His environment is extremely dangerous. As a father,

438
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,400
the simplest choice for Duke Cheng is to deploy his troops back to defend the capital at this time.

439
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,560
Not only would he be obeying your decree, but he would also be saving his son.

440
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,890
This is the best way to kill two birds with one stone.

441
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,640
However, Duke Cheng didn't do that.

442
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,320
He does see that his son is in a dangerous place.

443
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,000
He only sees that leading his troops back to defend the capital will only result in chaos in the North.

444
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,960
It will harm the commoners in the North

445
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
and destroy the nation.

446
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,220
Your Majesty, Duke Cheng rejecting the decrees seems as though he is rebelling.

447
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,490
Actually, he is rejecting what a father should be doing.

448
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,940
He's placing the North above everything,

449
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,810
Your Majesty.

450
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,990
What do you think?

451
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,370
It might be a coincidence.

452
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,550
Right now...

453
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,320
Are you saying that I

454
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,610
am inferior to Duke Cheng?

455
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,250
Your Majesty, that is not what I mean.

456
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,540
My nation...

457
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,230
is not for you to make decisions for.

458
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,660
Your Majesty, please think carefully.

459
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,770
Such arrogant words.

460
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,090
You are suspended from your post.

461
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,390
I punish you to self reflect

462
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,210
for three months behind closed doors.

463

478
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,150
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

479
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:18,930
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

480
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:25,090
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

481
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:30,400
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

482
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,820
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

483
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,780
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

484
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,800
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in
a deadlock with the sky ♫

485
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,500
♫ If memories could speak ♫

486
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,550
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

487
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,010
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

488
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,520
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

489
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,520
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

490
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:05,670
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

491
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,020
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

492
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,210
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

493
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:19,400
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
