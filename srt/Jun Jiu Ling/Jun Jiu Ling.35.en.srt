Is it still fake?

127
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,200
If he can accompany you

128
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,860
and be with you through hardship and trials,

129
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,060
I can be at peace.

130
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,220
Grandmother, now Chengyu has escaped using a fake death.

131
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,070
But the Fang family's crisis is far from over.

132
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,550
The deal from back then between the Fang family and Chu Rang,

133
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,520
he will definitely liquidate it.

134
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,950
So aside from the seal, did he leave anything else that could be used against him?

135
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,890
Grandmother, accompanying the emperor is like accompanying a tiger.

136
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,220
If we want to protect the Fang family and block Chu Rang,

137
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
the lump sum of silver from back then is key.

138
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,470
Come with me.

139
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,510
This is my second time coming in here.

140
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,980
The first time, your grandfather brought me here right before he died.

141
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,380
He told me all the secrets.

142
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,570
Ever since then, I never dared to come back.

143
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,000
The third year of Taiyan.

144
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,970
Yes, the third year of Taiyan.

145
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,330
Back then, our Fang family melted that silver

146
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,960
and reforged them into ordinary silver ingots.

147
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,910
Government funds became private funds.

148
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,480
The silver was stored here.

149
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,620
I never dared to touch it.

150
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,850
Chu Rang conspired for so many years.

151
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,620
He didn't hesitate to frame three generations of Fang family males.

152
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,870
Now he uses royal orders to restrain and harm you.

153
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,850
If grandfather hadn't kept this silver,

154
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,830
the truth of this matter would never have been revealed.

155
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,730
If the ruler tells his subject to die, the subject has no choice but to die.

156
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,860
But you also have to see if that person is worthy of being the ruler.

157
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,060
If he isn't worthy, he will suffer retribution.

158
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,550
Your grandfather wasn't innocent.

159
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,330
Back then, if I knew that De Shengchang became prosperous because of this silver,

160

Northern Qi has the ambition of wolves.

205

Because they coveted our prosperity, the late emperor

was seized when they forcibly attacked the capital.

They even wanted us to pay a large ransom.

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,810
Isn't this due to the contributions of the female siblings?

320
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,270
We only want to take back the money that we earned and belongs to us! Is this improper?

321
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:45,470
Friends of this hometown. Do you think that, as a daughter of the family,

322
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,430
it's an intolerable injustice?

323
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:53,150
The women in the family don't have the right to inherit the family's business?

324
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,320
You have the rights. You do!

325
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,400
Fine.

326
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,790
Since you created a scene here today,

327
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,450
this can't go on any longer.

328
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,940
Thus... the Fang family...

329
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,960
the Fang family...

330
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,780
Come out with your problems.

331
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,110
Don't keep them in your heart. You will be upset.

332
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:31,640
Look. The Fang family accumulated wealth during those years

333
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,860
and now, they are separated by wealth.

334
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,720
Do you think God is playing pranks on people?

335
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,100
I'm more convinced that human wisdom can prevail over nature.

336
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,300
Look. After they met you,

337
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,150
their fate that was written by God has changed.

338
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,260
Chengyu survived and the Fang family wasn't stabbed in the back by Chu Rang.

339
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,810
Moreover, we deliberately discussed the current situation.

340
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,810
There's no need to worry. Wealth is not important.

341
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,160
People are more important.

342
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,120
Human wisdom can prevail over nature.

343
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,190
It's getting dark. We should be on our way.

344
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,670
Jiuling.

345
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,810
Nothing.

346
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,370
Jiuling.

347
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,360
What's wrong with you?

348
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,810
I merely wanted to call your name.

349
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,510
You are crazy.

350
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,200
Jiuling, Jiuling, Jiuling, Jiuling, Jiuling.

351
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,510
Did you take the wrong medication today?

352
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,740
I like your name. That's why I called it several times.

353
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,760
Moreover, aren't you a physician? If I take the wrong medication, you can save me.

354
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,190
Physician Jun, would you like to check me?

355
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,320
I think you are dying and without any cure.

356
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,730
That's good. If so, you will always take care of me

357
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,890
and treat my illness for the rest of my life.

358
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,210
You are the only one who can treat my illness.

359
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,030
Is that so?

360
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,270
Let's be on our way now.

361
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:01,470
The women from the Fang family were wailing loudly on the day of burial.

362
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,230
They cried over the injustice of having their line of descendants severed.

363
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,490
It was so sorrowful. It was definitely not an act.

364
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,250
Also, a few days after the burial,

365
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,220
there was an uproar in the Fang family to split the family.

366
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,090
- Split the family?
- Madam Fang Cao,

367
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,200
the mother-in-law, eldest daughter, and second daughter created a big scandal.

368
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,470
Your Majesty, don't worry. Those women from the Fang family

369
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,370
won't cause any major problems.

370
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,780
This is good.

371
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,450
Did Zhu Zan and Jun Jiuling leave for the capital?

372
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,490
A few days after the burial,

373
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,820
they left for the capital.

374
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,260
Your Majesty, Commander Lu requests to see you.

375
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,540
Let him in.

376
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,660
Where did they go?

377
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:06,310
After passing Xin'an, Miss Jun and Heir Apparent separated from the convoy.

378
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:11,480
Heir Apparent dumped our people. We don't know where they are now.

379
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,450
However, that maid Liu'er will enter the capital in less than three days.

380
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,930
They rode horses and should arrive today.

381
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,940
Commander Lu, His Majesty has summoned you. Please go in.

382
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,510
Your Majesty, I just intercepted a secret letter from Duke Cheng from the North. Please take a look.

383
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,060
What?

384
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,850
A secret letter from the North?

385
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,410
Yes.

386
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,490
He still won't give up

387
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,040
and is still making grand gestures about the affairs in the north.

388
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,820
Does he think that

389
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,620
the Imperial Court can't do without him?

390
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:32,800
My right eyelid has been twitching recently.

391
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,690
I can't sleep well at night. I wonder why.

392
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,660
Tell me.

393
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,440
The civil and military officials in the Imperial Court

394
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,220
kneel to me daily.

395
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,990
The more I see them, the more I can't see it.

396
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,670
Who's really kneeling and who's really not?

397
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,060
You can leave. I want to be alone.

398
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,560
Yes.

399
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,570
Do you have any thoughts after seeing your own tombstone?

400
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,750
Come look at some umbrellas.

401
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,720
Come look at umbrellas.

402
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,510
I'm afraid there aren't many people in this world

403
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,970
like me who gets to see their own tombstone.

404
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,410
I don't know

405
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,520
when I'll be able to get rid of it.

406
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,160
It'll be soon because I'm here.

407
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,310
When I was in front of your tomb, offering you the Hurricane Lily from the Northern,

408
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,620
where were you hiding?

409
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,270
I was right behind you.

410
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,610
In a corner where you couldn't see me.

411
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,580
Then, when you saw me travel all that way to offer you flowers,

412
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,000
were you really touched?

413
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,480
At that time I thought,

414
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,460
I should run over and beat you up.

415
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,110
Such a precious medicinal ingredient,

416
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,760
you wasted it by letting it bloom for just a moment?

417
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,880
That flower is medicine to you because you're a physician,

418
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,860
but to me,

419
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,180
it was a previous promise.

420
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,620
Was it pretty?

421
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,440
Yes.

422
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,300
That was pretty enough? In the future, I'll bring you to the North

423
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,130
to see the sea of flowers. Now that's beautiful.

424
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,490
Then in the future when we go, we'll be really busy.

425
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,750
Busy? Why?

426
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,560
Think about it. You're taking me to see flowers,

427
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,840
you're also taking me to see the stars,

428
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,930
you're also taking me to see the grass plains,

429
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,950
you didn't forget all this, did you?

430
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,270
Impossible. It's all here.

431
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,370
From now on, wherever you want to go, I'll be there to take you.

432
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:56,180
We will go through hardships together and watch over our great country.

433
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,720
Okay, you said it.

434
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,270
- What's wrong?
- What's that?

435
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,860
Come closer.

436
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,550
How can you be so indecent?

437
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,640
In the past, I've always been played by you.

438
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,270
Today, I've finally gotten my revenge.

439
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,270
Young people nowadays.

440
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,380
Eldest Brother, they're at the door but don't go in. They're even sitting here.

441
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,650
We understand. We really understand.

442
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,660
Didn't I say you don't need to pick me up?

443
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,090
If we didn't, we would have missed such a splendid show.

444
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,690
All right, get to the serious business. Did you get any news?

445
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,430
There's still no news from the North.

446
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,610
Duke Cheng already made several secret reports, but there are no responses.

447
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,150
Marquis Qinghe is going to start a revolt?

448
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,300
We've already sent someone to the North to investigate.

449
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,940
But it'll probably take a while. Wait a little more.

450
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,470
That's the only thing we can do.

451
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,490
- This isn't a good place for discussion. Let's go back and talk.
- All right.

452
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,210
Jiuling, are you going back to Jiuling Hall or back home with me?

453
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,840
I'll go back to Jiuling Hall first.

454
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,990
You go discuss with Duke Cheng first, that's more important.

455
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,340
All right. Saves me from not having a place to sleep.

456
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,600
You make it seem like I take up a lot of space.

457
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,170
The world is really going downhill.

458
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,410
Now it's acceptable to talk about something so indecent?

459
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,390
In what aspect did you find this indecent?

460
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,180
We're talking about decent things.

461
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,810
Didn't Miss Jun just say her sleeping posture takes up too much space,

462
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,670
and that you don't have a place to sleep?

463
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,420
Your Second Brother meant

464
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,880
if I go home, then he needs to sleep in the guest room.

465
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,060
That's what it was?

466
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,460
I believe it. I do.

467
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,970
Let's go.

468
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,980
Let's go.

469
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,400
I really believe you.

470
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,190
You rascal.

471
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,900
You and Miss Jun... are great!

472
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,340
My Lord, should we make a move?

473
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,870
Of course.

474
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,790
But not now.

475
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,630
- Mother, I'm back.
- You're back, Zan'er?

476
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,050
Where's Father?

477
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,790
His Majesty summoned him into the palace early this morning.

478
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,530
He still hasn't come back yet.

479
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,590
What did His Majesty summon him for?

480
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:14,750
What else? To have him remove his armor and return to the fields as an idle man.

481
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,510
Removing his military power wasn't enough?

482
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,880
Does he have to take away his court position, too?

483
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,630
It's not up to us to determine what's enough. It's up to His Majesty.

484
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,830
Duke Cheng, do you know your crime?

485
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,300
- I do not know.
- You secretly led soldiers

486
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,630
to disagree with Northern Qi and ordered them to cause conflict with Northern Qi.

487
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,600
You still don't admit your crime?

488
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,700
Is this true?

489
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,420
Yes. I have always done this.

490
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,440
I don't know what secret letter Your Majesty is referring to, but I've always told the Northern soldiers

491
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,010
to always remain guarded against Northern Qi.

492
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,080
I have spent my entire life negotiating with Northern Qi.

493
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,760
I understand their character.

494
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,720
Taking the initiative to be friendly won't make them surrender. Whereas if they take the initiative to be friendly,

495
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,920
then it will be their wild ambition.

496
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,410
We cannot yield any of our territories.

497
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,900
If we withdraw from the three counties today, then it'll be countless counties in the future.

498
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,530
Negotiating peace today will be easy, but battling another day will be cruel.

499
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,530
Your Majesty, today's situation is more critical than before.

500
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,310
I earnestly request Your Majesty to place more value on military affairs to guard our territory against Northern Qi.

501
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,580
We can't show any gentleness.

502
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,210
If a battle is to come, we must fight.

503
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,660
So Duke Cheng never agreed with the peace negotiations, to begin with.

504
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,150
Your Majesty, if Northern Qi attacks,

505
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,700
this time, we should break their spirits with a single effort.

506
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,370
We must not give them time to breathe.

507
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:04,580
Your Majesty, please do not tolerate Northern Qi.

508
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,660
Not to mention the conflicts caused by the officials and soldiers of Northern Qi at the border.

509
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,640
Just state that the secret order by Duke Cheng is a violation of Your Majesty's decree

510
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,190
to privately control the army. Duke Cheng brags that he's courageous and skillful in battles.

511
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,370
And yet, he ignored the rites of defending external enemies.

512
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,540
He's greedy for merits, warlike, and used thousands of elite soldiers.

513
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,220
He lost to Northern Qi and caused casualties to the troops.

514
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,350
Fortunately, we have the peace treaty and the people can live in peace and happiness. If he still wants to fight,

515
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,800
he's delivering Tianyou to Northern Qi too?

516
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,250
Your Majesty, after Duke Cheng returned to the capital,

517
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,290
I received many memorials from the officials and generals of the North.

518
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,590
They are oppressing the Imperial Court and ignoring the orders of the government officials.

519
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,710
Marquis Qinghe is in a difficult situation in the North.

520
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,130
The officials and generals agreed overtly but secretly opposed.

521
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,880
Your Majesty, as long as Duke Cheng is there,

522
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,460
there won't be any peace at the border.

523
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,890
Your Majesty, please dismiss Duke Cheng from his military duties.

524
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,880
I request you to control Duke Cheng's domineering abuse of power

525
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,850
and convict him of unauthorized authority.

526
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,870
