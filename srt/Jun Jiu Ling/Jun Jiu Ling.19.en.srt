♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,490
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,490
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,750
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,770
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,940
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,000
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,360
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,360
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,760
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:31,000
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,750
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

14
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,230
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:50,980
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

16
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,570
♫ Dawn... ♫

[Episode 19]

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,670
Look. What is wrong with them?
[Yizheng Medicinal Hall]

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,130
[Medicine]

21
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,300
Are you here to seek treatment?

22
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,560
Can I take a look? What is wrong?

23
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,980
- Open the door!
- Leave now!

24
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,800
- Open the door! Help us!
- We can't treat you! Hurry and leave!

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,630
What's going on?

26
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,410
The two people out there have smallpox on their faces.

27
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,920
Smallpox? Did you see clearly?

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,670
Yes, I saw clearly. It was definitely smallpox.

29
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,240
Quickly shut the doors and close the shop.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,600
- Find black atractylodes and mugwort to smoke it out. Quick!
- All right.

31
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,410
Where should we go now?

32
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,380
We have already bought dried fruits and meat.

33
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,100
Let's buy some pastries.

34
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,150
I remember there's a shop over on that street...

35
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,880
called Zhang Ji Shop.

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,010
Although there are disputes in the Imperial Court now,

37
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,100
fortunately, it's still considered peaceful.

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,190
Although Northern Qi is ready to attack, it's not on a large scale yet.

39
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,690
Although there are disasters everywhere, the casualties are not serious.

40
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,080
Hence, it's a daunting experience without mishaps and hitches.

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,130
I can also be at ease and prepare for the examinations.

42
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,770
What's most important is that Miss Jun is safe and sound.

43
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,030
Young Master, Jiuling Hall is not far from here.

44
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,180
- Why don't we...
- Let's forget it.

45
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,780
- Let's take a look over there.
- Miss Jun.
- Young Master Ning?

46
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,250
Miss Jun, what a coincidence.

47
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,280
It really is a coincidence this time.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,360
Congratulations on curing someone as severely ill as Prince Huai.

49
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,620
The stone in my heart has finally fallen to the ground.

50
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,260
My mind is more at ease now.

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,310
You are headed to...?

52
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,550
I'm heading to the Imperial Academy to study.

53
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,080
Young Master Ning is very studious. You will definitely pass with high scores.

54
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,790
Thank you for your auspicious words.

55
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,880
I will take my leave now.

56
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,250
Young Master, why didn't you say more?

57
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,610
Being able to say a few words to her like just now,

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,390
I'm already very happy.

59
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,750
- I'm leaving.
- All right. Customer, take care.

60
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,850
Do you want a bowl?

61
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,920
Leave now! I'm not selling to you!

62
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,770
- Miss Jun.
- Young Master Ling.

63
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,690
I have something to ask you.

64
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,580
You want to ask about the handwritten edict, right?

65
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,160
That's right. It will not protect you but harm you instead.

66
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,920
Curing Prince Huai has caused that person to be unhappy already.

67
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,720
With that handwritten edict, you are even more of a thorn in that person's eyes.

68
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,620
Thank you for coming so late in the evening and being concerned about me.

69
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,520
However, in regards to these problems you mention,

70
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,080
I have already thought about it.

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,010
My family sent me the handwritten edict

72
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,510
because they are worried that Lu Yunqi will cause trouble for me again.

73
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,770
I didn't know.

74
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,570
Now that it has come to this, just be extra careful.

75
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,000
What is this?

76
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,430
Osmanthus cakes from the Imperial Kitchen.

77
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,700
Young Master Ling, what's the meaning of this?

78
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,310
This is... I don't like to eat sweets.

79
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,470
Take this as a reward for curing Jiurong.

80
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,500
I cured Jiurong and

81
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,510
you only give me a few osmanthus cakes?

82
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,130
So, is money what you want?

83
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,330
I will give it to you tomorrow.

84
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,960
I don't want money.

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,830
Immortal violet blossom?

86
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,110
- Do you have them?
- No.

87
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,360
Then you owe me one.

88
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm leaving.

89
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,920
Mother, why...

90
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,890
Why does no one like me?

91
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,500
Guo'er, don't be afraid.

92
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,750
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

93
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,770
I have some food here.

94
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,570
Let the child eat it.

95
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,350
Mother, I'm starving. I want to eat it.

96
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,580
- Let me kowtow to you.
- No, no.

97
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,260
You have saved our lives.

98
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,160
This illness is sure insufferable.

99
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,040
We've had a fever for days now.

100
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,890
I thought that there may be a cure

101
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,520
here at the capital.

102
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,680
Who knew they would chase us away wherever we go.

103
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,510
It's like they have seen a ghost.

104
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,610
They even refuse to give us food.

105
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,970
Actually, I know of a medicinal hall.

106
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,160
You can give it a try.

107
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,050
It's over there.

108
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,900
All right.

109
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,870
Mother, I feel horrible.
[Jiuling Hall]

110
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,720
Jinxiu, I have packed these two medicinal herbs.

111
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,800
- Deliver them to Madam Zhou.
- Are you the physician?

112
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,110
She's the physician. Come in and talk.

113
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,120
Physician.

114
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,630
Jinxiu.

115
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,260
Tidy up a room. Tell Chen Qi to decoct medicinal soup for dispelling toxins.

116
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,250
How is it? Is the medicine ready?

117
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,960
- Is it ready?
- This pot is ready. That one will be soon.

118
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,910
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Take it off and let's see.

119
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,480
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm really fine.

120
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,500
Don't touch it. Let me do it.

121
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,350
I have never seen Jiuling so worried.

122
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,240
Even when she was treating Chengyu, she wasn't like this.

123
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,760
Don't worry too much. Miss Jun will think of a solution.

124
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,270
- I hope so.
- Be careful.

125
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,360
- Watch the medicines.
- All right.

126
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,010
Mother, I feel horrible.

127
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,940
Guo'er, be good. You will be fine.

128
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,180
- Mother, I feel horrible.
- Jiuling, the medicine is ready.

129
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,800
All right. Take these and burn them now.

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,520
- Mother.
- Guo'er, be good.

131
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,330
- Guo'er, be good.
- Drink this to dispel the toxins first.

132
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,690
It will temporarily stable your condition.

133
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,670
Here, be good. I will feed you with this medicine.

134
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,760
Here, open your mouth.

135
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,440
Swallow it. Swallow.

136
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,610
Physician Jun, you are a living Bodhisattva.

137
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,440
How should we thank you?

138
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,570
Don't thank me yet. This illness may not be curable.

139
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,540
- Here.
- Physician Jun!

140
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,880
- Guo'er is my only child.
- Quickly get up.

141
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,790
I'm begging you. You must cure her at all costs.

142
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,130
- Physician Jun, I'm begging you.
- Don't panic yet.

143
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,440
How did you get this illness?

144
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,210
I have no idea.

145
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,870
In the beginning, I thought it was an insect bite.

146
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,850
Later on, it got worse.

147
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,550
Many people in the village have contracted this illness.

148
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,170
Then, people started dying.

149
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,000
We thought we could be saved if we came to the capital.

150
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,900
Who knew that, along the journey,

151
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,320
many villages contracted this illness and more people started dying.

152
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,860
Did no one report this to the officials?

153
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,020
I have no idea. There must be others coming to the capital.

154
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,460
I know that you are... You are a miraculous physician.

155
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,550
Everyone says that you are a miraculous physician. You must save her.

156
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,580
- I will kowtow to you.
- Elder Sister.

157
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,160
- I'm begging you. I'm begging you to save her.
- Get up.

158
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,440
Don't worry. I will do my best.

Here, Guo'er. Let's continue to drink the medicine.

161
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,740
If we knew there would be such great merits to curing Prince Huai,

162
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,050
then we should have cured it long ago, Master. We dragged it on for no reason.

163
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,620
Being scared and worrying caused our reputation to be ruined in the end.

How can you guess His Majesty's intentions?

Right now, it looks like she is basking in glory.

166

What if she is suddenly charged with a crime and executed?

167
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,130

Help us!

180
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,660
- Are you certain that it is smallpox?
- Yes, we are sure.

181
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,130
- Many clinics have already reported it!
- Exactly.

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,340
In such a short time, so many people were infected.

183
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,860
I think His Majesty will know of this soon.

184
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,600
What should we do?

185
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,270
It has come at just the right time.

186
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,060
Send this merit to her.

187
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,650
We'll just have to see if she has the fortune to enjoy it.

188
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,750
Reporting to Your Majesty! This time the people infected with smallpox

189
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,270
are more than hundreds.

190
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,940
Reporting to Your Majesty! It is hard to evacuate so many people.

191
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,850
That's right.

192
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,850
What should be done?

193
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,690
Ministers, do you have any suggestions?

194
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,710
Your Majesty. In my opinion,

195
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,540
we must gather all those infected in the capital

196
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,060
to prevent the widespread of the disease.

197
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,200
Your Majesty, those who are weak and old as well as women and children

198
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,150
must not move around freely, to prevent the spread.

199
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,380
Your Majesty, I suggest looking for a large open space immediately

200
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,950
to settle those people in.

201
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,290
Then we should send all the imperial physicians there to treat the patients.

202
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,720
Your Majesty, I think Lord Ning's suggestion is not suitable.

203
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,020
The number of infected exceeds hundreds and is approaching thousands.

204
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,380
That is at least tens to hundreds of times more than the number of physicians in the Imperial Physicians Hall.

205
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,940
Even if we send all the imperial physicians,

206
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,210
there is still not enough to look after so many patients.

207
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,980
Furthermore, if this was a different disease it would be fine.

208
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,350
Even if we had a shortage of people in the Imperial Physicians Hall,

209
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,530
we could all do our best.

210
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,300
However, this... smallpox

211
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,610
makes it difficult for the Imperial Physicians Hall.

212
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,280
Firstly, all the imperial physicians have to treat their patients in turn.

213
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,830
Secondly, Your Majesty, frankly,

214
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,090
we must be guarded against the contagiousness of this disease.

215
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,570
If the imperial physicians were truly sent out,

216
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,030
and they return to treat the princes, princesses, or officials, what if...

217
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,740
This won't do, that won't do.

218
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,340
Then, what should we do?

219
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,070
Your Majesty, smallpox is not something that only our dynasty has had.

220
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,680
In previous dynasties and generations, outbreaks have happened before.

221
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,880
Just now, all the suggestions put forward by the various ministers

222
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
have all been tried whenever the smallpox occurred.

223
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,580
However, the outcome has always been widespread of the disease and countless deaths. Even...

224
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,470
Even to the extent of destroying the entire nation!

225
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,150
This is risky.

226
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,100
What should be done?

227
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,490
Your Majesty, I have looked through the archives and found that, in Lan County,

228
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,460
there was a case where smallpox was stopped from spreading.

229
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,910
- What was the method?
- They gathered all the infected people in one place, and then...

230
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,570
burned them as well as buried them.

231
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,150
Bastard! What kind of solution is this?

232
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,140
Your Majesty, please appease your anger.

233
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,770
- Why are you here?
- I came to find you. In just a short time, a countless number of infected have come.

234
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,850
The entire capital is in chaos!

235
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,230
Why are you dressed like that?

236
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,360
I took in some of the smallpox patients.

237
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,740
Smallpox is completely different from scrofula! Smallpox is a lot more deadly!

238
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,010
Prince Huai did not have scrofula at all.

239
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,910
That is what the Imperial Physicians Hall said to excuse themselves from blame.

240
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,850
Those people dared to deceive the emperor?

241
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,040
So those people will surely say they do not know how to cure smallpox,

242
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,140
and push it all to you, am I right?

243
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
Smallpox has never had a cure.

244
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,340
Patients can only use medicine to help, but whether they live or die is up to luck.

245
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,840
Then those patients coming here will certainly create chaos.

246
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
By taking this step, you might be doomed forever.

247
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,560
Have you thought it through?

248
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,390
There is no escape for Jiuling Hall.

249

[Red Phoenix Gate]

250
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,260
Your Majesty, I think that while what Imperial Physician Jiang said

251
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,940
might be cruel,

252
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,870
but it is the best course of action right now.

253
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,070
It minimizes the price to pay to ensure that the disease is completely eradicated.

254
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,570
Your Majesty, if the entire city is infected, then it will be too late.

255
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,380
Your Majesty, I oppose.

256
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,330
They are all citizens of our nation. Who could bear to kill them all like that?

257
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,720
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

258
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,670
Lord Ning, the infected are indeed people of our nation.

259
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,190
However, are those innocent citizens also not people of our nation?

260
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,760
We must sacrifice the minority to protect the majority.

261
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,060
It is obvious what the right course of action is.

262
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,140
Your Majesty, I think

263
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,440
that we can let Physician Jun from Jiuling Hall give it a try.

264
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,240
Physician Jun managed to cure Prince Huai.

265
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,800
In the face of this disease,

266
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,830
I think that Physician Jun will surely have a plan to combat it.

Your Majesty is smart. I am here for this matter.

274
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,320
This is an urgent matter, thus I will get to the point. I recommend

275

Jiuling Hall to take on this important task.

276
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,370
Jiuling Hall?

277
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,320
Your suggestion is the same as the Imperial Physicians Hall's.

278
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,930
Miss Jun, everything is as you expected.

279

The Imperial Physicians Hall is waiting to watch you fall.

What does everyone else think?

281
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,890
Your Majesty, I think we can let Jiuling Hall try.

282
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,720
Your Majesty, I agree with what Lord Huang said.

283

Your Majesty–

284
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,840
Your Majesty, other than this,

285
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,390
we have no other solution.

286
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,950
I agree to your request.

287
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,260
Let Jiuling Hall try.

288
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,820
We will give them a month.

289
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,930
Your Majesty is wise.

290
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,130
Your Majesty, Qingshan Court is the ideal place to quickly gather the patients together.

291
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,180
It is a large open place that is far from the central areas, making it an ideal place for treatment.

292
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,570
Allowed. This matter will be overseen by the Martial Moral Ministry. Gather all those infected

293
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,610
at Qingshan Court and strictly watch over them.

294
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,340
There must not be any patients allowed to escape.

295
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,580
I obey.

296
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,530
Do you know why I am allowing Jun Jiuling to treat this?

297
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,670
I dare not make wild guesses.

298
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,580
You probably know, yet are pretending to be a fool.

299
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,120
I am slow-witted. Your Majesty, please enlighten me.

300
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,160
She cured Prince Huai's illness.

301
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,020
That was luck.

302
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,560
She may not be as fortunate now.

303
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,580
If she is infected by smallpox as she is treating the patients

304
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,840
and dies,

305
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,520
then Your Majesty's worries will be gone.

306
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,940
If she is fortunate enough not to be infected

307
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,370
and cures the thousands infected, the credit will go to you.

308
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,000
Do you think she can cure it?

309
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,660
It is smallpox. She is not a god.

310
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,100
Listen. Qingshan Court is on a low terrain.

311
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,820
There is only one way to enter and exit there.

312
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,020
The Martial Moral Ministry better guard it well. Nobody is allowed to leave.

313
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,620
Yes.

314
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,810
I have given her one month.

315
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,330
After a month, if she fails to cure the disease,

316
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,920
then set a large fire to the court,

317
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,960
getting rid of Jun Jiuling with the rest.

318
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,370
Keep in mind that setting it on fire is the last resort.

319
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,340
It will be done in order to eradicate smallpox.

320
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,060
Yes.

321
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,040
These shameless creatures!

322
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,930
When they couldn't cure Prince Huai, they blamed it all on scrofula.

323
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,250
What do we do now?

324
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,220
It is all my fault for trying to be clever,

325
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,470
telling everyone how capable Miss Jun is.

326
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,210
The time limit is one month!

327
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,440
We are doomed this time.

328
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,170
What do you mean by "doomed"? If we're speaking of that, our Fang family would have been doomed long ago.

329
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,000
If we weren't doomed in the past, then we are not doomed now.

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,980
Miss, Prince Huai's disease wasn't scrofula.

331
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,720
You clearly knew from the start.

332
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,640
Why did you not clarify that it was not scrofula?

333
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,690
The Imperial Physicians Hall already diagnosed it at the time.

334
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,360
Whatever I said wouldn't have mattered.

335
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,560
I would also have lost the chance to treat Prince Huai.

336
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,660
I could only make the best of the mistake.

337
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,950
However, Miss, the Imperial Physicians Hall is pushing you out there right now.

338
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,130
Clearly, they do not care about this matter.

339
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,820
With so many patients, how would you treat them all by yourself?

340
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,710
Liu'er, let's go out for a bit.

341
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,970
Let's see if there are any physicians willing to treat smallpox with us.

342
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,980
All right.

343
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,820
Miss Jun, it's useless.

344
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,590
If it was a regular disease, it wouldn't be a problem.

345
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,510
This is a life-and-death matter.

346
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,040
It's not that I'm pessimisstic. I'm just afraid

347
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,930
you won't find even one willing physician.

348
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,710
You have to try before you know if it is possible.

349
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,990
Jiuling, it sounds simple,

350
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,970
but it is not as easy when you actually do it.

351
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,320
Our lives are already on the line.

352
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,870
What's there to be afraid of?

353
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,640
The worst scenario is losing our lives. Let's go all out!

354
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,520
- What nonsense are you spouting?
- He's right.

355
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,470
Now we have to go all out.

356
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,330
Furthermore, to the extent where everyone is safe.

357
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,840
Otherwise...

358
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,450
Otherwise, we'll reach a dead end.

359
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,630
What do you need me to do?

360
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,970
Jinxiu, stay here with Shopkeeper Liu.

361
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,120
I believe there will be many matters that require people and money now.

362
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,360
Shouldn't the Imperial Court take care of the cost?

363
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,840
This is urgent. The Imperial Court's people and money

364
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,610
need all kinds of approval.

365
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,370
It would be quicker for us to do it ourselves.

366
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,700
Exactly.

367
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,620
Don't worry. If anything happens, I'll discuss it with Shopkeeper Liu.

368
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,140
All right.

369
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,720
Miss, where are you going to find help?

370
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,030
The capital is huge. There must be physicians who will go with us.

371
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,430
This road is to Baicao Hall.

372
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,230
Are you going to ask Physician Feng who caused us trouble last time for help?

373
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,980
- Hurry.
- Okay.

374
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,520
Physician Jun, are you asking me to treat smallpox with you outside the capital?

375
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,620
Yes. The situation is very urgent with many patients out there.

376
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,450
That's why I am asking you for help.

377
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,480
Miss Jun, you know my medicinal skills.

378
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,740
What my family has passed down is mainly treatments for bone.

379
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,270
I have never come in contact with smallpox before.

380
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,170
It looks like I can't help you out.

381
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,240
I understand, but nobody has ever done this thing before.

382
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,600
Therefore, as long as we have one more person to make a little more effort,

383
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,010
we'll have a little more hope.

384
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Physician Jun, I'm really sorry.

385
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,330
I want to do it, but I can't.

386

I understand, Physician Feng. I won't force you.

Goodbye.

Physician Jun,

389
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,080
you're not planning to ask every physician, are you?

390
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,220
Physician Jun, I'm afraid it won't work.

391
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,590
You have to ask before you know if it works.

Let's go.

393

Physician Liu, this matter is very serious.

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,360
I'm afraid I can't take on this important task by myself.

- Physician Jun,

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,690
it is not that I don't want to help. However, this smallpox is no child's play.

397
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,220
- It could be fatal if not handled properly. I truly cannot help you.
- I understand.

398
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,290
Ask someone else. Don't say anymore. Walk the guests out.

- Go now.

Thank you, Physician Liu.

I'm very sorry.

403
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,030
I have a family to take care of. I have a wife and a child.

I really can't help you.

405

I understand, Physician Wang.

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,150
- No, no, no.
- Please!

Please!

He's so scared of death.

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,070
Miss, we've asked all of them.

What should we do?

It's fine. We'll come up with something else.

Not one physician is willing to help her.

416
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,760
So laughable. Does she really think they are fools?

417
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,640
If she didn't personally ask them, she could've still pretended.

418
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,240
Now that she's gone to them personally, everyone knows that she's not confident in treating smallpox.

419
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,700
Would they follow her to their deaths?

420
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,680
She taught them how to do business and answered their questions a while ago,

421
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,380
so she probably wants to use that to threaten those physicians.

422
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,520
However, that period where she taught them business and answered their questions was too short.

Just wait. Doesn't she like showing off?

424

This time we'll let her show off as much as she wants.

Physician Feng, are you willing to go with our young lady?

428
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,850
Physician Jun, is what you told other physicians

429
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,550
- the same as what you told me?
- Yes.

430

Physician Jun, if you speak like that, nobody will go with you.

Why?

432

You say nobody has ever done this before.

Everyone knows what it implies.

Just say you can't handle it all by yourself.

435
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,480
Otherwise, even if you go to every medicinal hall in the capital,

436
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,700
no physician will dare go with you.

437

Thank you for your reminder, Physician Feng. But I can't do that.

438

Since I'm asking everyone for help, I have to tell them the truth.

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,450
It's very normal.

475
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,600
You must feel terrible.

476
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,610
Actually, I have imagined this ending,

477
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,500
but when it has really happened,

478
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,550
I feel quite upset.

479
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,510
My father once told me that those who've mastered medicine save people,

480
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:34,150
and those who've mastered medical ethics save the world. I was quite hopeful

481
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,800
that someone would go with me.

482
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:49,190
Those who've mastered medicine save people. Those who've mastered medical ethics save the world.

483
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,320
You're definitely the latter.

484
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,900
You can do it for sure.

485
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,990
Only you? Going alone,

486
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,110
are you seeking death?

487
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,140
Don't cry.

488
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,430
Don't cry.

489
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,160
Take care of our home.

490
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,420
I'm leaving now.

491
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,780
Let's go.

492
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,740
Physician Jun! Physician Jun, we're here!

493
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,490
Let's go together, Physician Jun!

494
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,490
We are here!

495
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,550
Physician Jun, we have come late.

496
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,730
[Liu's Medicinal Hall]

497
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,220
Old Feng, this is too dangerous.

498
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,090
Yes, I know.

499
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,850
Wait. You know, yet you still come to persuade me on her behalf?

500
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,080
Because she's trustworthy.

501
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,700
Since she asked us for help,

502
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,060
I think she will protect us if anything happens.

503
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,210
I believe in her medicinal skills. Old Liu,

504
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,190
this is about curing smallpox.

505
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,690
Are you telling me you don't want to cure smallpox?

506
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,450
Don't you want to make history?

507
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,280
Of course I do. But when it comes to this,

508
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,310
you can't just do it because you want to.

509
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,990
She's been in the capital for so long now. Think about it.

510
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,480
Is she the kind of person who does what she says?

511
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,980
She said she could cure the diseases we couldn't cure.

512
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,910
Did she do it? Hundreds of physicians can save tens of thousands of people.

513
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,380
She shared medical skills with us without hiding anything.

514
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,470
Also, every time she explained something,

515
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,170
she was so accurate that you couldn't dispute it. Right?

516
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,300
Then, do you believe her when she says we can cure smallpox?

517
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,930
I do.

518
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,620
Old Liu, I know that you're a righteous person.

519
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,710
Actually, this is not that scary at all.

520
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,330
Even if we fail,

521
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,530
the worst that will happen is shutting down my medicinal hall. I'll still be alive at least.

522
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,160
Aren't all family businesses passed down through the generation

523
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,510
started from scratch?

524
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,740
Even if we fail, we can just start all over again.

525
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,890
All right. It is settled. We will meet at the door of Jiuling Hall tomorrow morning.

526
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,650
I will go ask other physicians.

527
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,580
All right. Old Feng.

528
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,000
I will go with you.

529
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,970
Good.

530
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,660
Commander Lu, we are all here. Let's set out.

531
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,310
Ending OST: Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

532
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:56,490
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

533
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:02,290
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

534
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:08,350
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

535
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:14,140
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

536
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:20,150
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

537
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,880
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

538
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,990
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

539
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:37,320
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

540
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,670
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

541
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,750
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

542
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,000
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

543
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,460
♫ If memories could speak ♫

544
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,450
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

545
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:02,690
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

546
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:29,070
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

547
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:34,990
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

548

♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

550
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,760
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

551
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,740
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

552
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:58,660
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

553
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,400
♫ If memories could speak ♫

554
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,470
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

555
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:09,990
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

556
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,390
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

557
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,410
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

558
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:21,700
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

559
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,930
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

560
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,160
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

561
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:36,110
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
