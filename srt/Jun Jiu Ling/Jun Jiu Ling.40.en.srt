00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,300
[Episode 40]

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,600
This must be fake.

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,200
The third year of Taiyan. The palace treasury.

21
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,000
The silver isn't fake.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,200
This is truly the only batch of silver forged by the court in the third year of Taiyan,

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,200
and sent to Zezhou to get the emperor emeritus back.

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
It looks like Northern Qi killed the emperor emeritus,

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,000
not because they got the ransom and were treacherous,

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,800
but because the silver didn't get sent to Zezhou at all!

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
No way. A setup. This is a setup!

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
How could it be a setup with evidence and witnesses here?

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
Because of this silver,

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
three generations of the Fang family almost died because of you.

31
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,000
I just realized...

32
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,200
that you are all colluding together

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,400
to slander me.

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you trying to rebel?

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Soldiers!

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Who dares?

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Everyone here is listening and watching. Are they going to die with us?

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,900
Courtiers, now you see it.

39
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,200
Just now, I said that these thieves

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,300
want to rebel. As for whether you believe it or not,

41
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,800
you can choose.

42
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,200
I believe Your Majesty.

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,650
- I also believe Your Majesty.
- I believe Your Majesty.

44
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,400
I also believe Your Majesty.

45
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Jiuli and Jiurong, come here.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Be careful. Weapons have no eyes, you might get hurt.

47
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,400
Weapons have no eyes, but they are better than an evil heart.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,100
Why was Imperial Grandfather killed by Northern Qi?

49
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,800
An accident happened when the ransom was delivered to your territory.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
You should give an explanation.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,000
How come you don't believe me either?

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Listening to these thieves deceive you with lies.

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Arrest these thieves!

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,300
- Who dares?
- Arrest them!

55
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,600
Arrest all of them!

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Halt!

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Yunqi?

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
What? Do you want to rebel, too?

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,200
I wasn't able to protect her in the past.

60
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Today, I won't make the same mistake.

61
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,800
What a good strategy!

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Next up, shouldn't you all

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,100
convict me of my crimes?

64
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,900
Who dares convict me of a crime?

65
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,200
I inherited the throne of my father and brother.

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,800
A legitimate emperor in the dynasty.

67
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Which of you dares?

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm the current era's Heavenly Son.

69
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,040
How Your Majesty got the throne,

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you didn't forget, did you?

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Do you remember this seal?

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,100
Back then the late emperor was investigating it secretly.

73
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,600
You were scared your private treasury would be discovered.

74
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,400
You killed your own brother

75
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,800
to come to the throne.

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,600
Nonsense!

77
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
For the throne,

78
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
you killed my father and your brother.

79
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,000
During your reign, you have been biased.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
You've ceded three counties and increased taxes.

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,400
That's why civilians are suffering and having a hard time living.

82
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
You're worthy of being the Heavenly Son?!

83
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,400
You thought whatever you say goes?

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
Where's the evidence?

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,700
Bing'er.

86
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
It was fine, why did the sky suddenly change?

87
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Master said that if the sky omen changes, then someone did something bad.

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
The heavens are coming to punish him.

89
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,300
There are so many people,

90
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
how can the heavens keep track of who's right and who's wrong?

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,600
The heavens can see it and will naturally serve justice.

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,400
Hurry home. I'm closing shop.

93
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm the late emperor's maid servant, Bing'er.

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
I used to prepare medicine for the late emperor before. He was healthy.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,380
It was a sudden illness as the Imperial Physicians Hall said.

96
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,700
The night that the late emperor died, Your Majesty secretly entered the palace.

97
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Right after you left, I saw the late emperor's neck had marks of strangulation.

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,000
This is ridiculous. Too ridiculous.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,200
That day, Lu Yunqi was on duty in the palace.

100
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,000
He also saw the late emperor's dead body.

101
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,000
Before, I tricked you.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Today, I will tell you the truth.

103
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,600
That night I was on duty.

104
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,800
When I passed the imperial study, I heard the late emperor's cry for help. When I rushed in,

105
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,300
I personally saw Chu Rang strangling the late emperor.

106
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,200
- Your Majesty!
- Lu Yunqi.

107
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,430
Get out. Don't let people see you.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,800
You're a beast who killed your brother and father!

109
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,830
Are you still protecting him?

110
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,480
T-This...

111
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,330
T-This...

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Imperial Brother, was it really you?

113
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,200
That was Father! That was Eldest Brother!

114
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,600
It wasn't me. It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

115
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't do it.

116
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,100
You're all crazy.

117
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,800
You're a bunch of lunatics.

118
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Lu Yunqi. Lu Yunqi!

119
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
How did I treat you?

120
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,400
What did she feed you, to make you help her to hurt me?

121
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,100
It's because she's Jiuling.

122
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Chu Jiuling.

123
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
Princess Jiuling?

124
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,430
Chu Jiuling?

125
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,960
Chu Rang.

126
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,220
Impossible.

127
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,460
Impossible!

128
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,880
She died a long time ago.

129
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,190
Uncle,

130
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,930
I'm still alive.

131
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,970
You...

132
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,310
I've disappointed you.

133
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,160
That year,

134
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,150
I knew the truth of Imperial Father's death.

135
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,820
That's why I tried to force you with a knife

136
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,990
on my wedding day.

137
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,440
It was you who killed my imperial father.

138
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,890
Yes.

139
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,610
What are you going to do?

140
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,830
I never thought you would want to kill me.

141
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,130
Fortunately, Jun Yingwen and his daughter risked their lives to save me,

142
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,800
so I didn't die miserably.

143
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,920
We were once close relatives.

144
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,180
Chu Rang, I've taken every step to be here in front of you

145
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,210
to get justice

146
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,120
for my imperial father.

147
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,950
It was your wishful thinking to replace my imperial father.

148
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,770
Because of power and your personal gain,

149
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,770
you trusted traitors and stayed away from virtuous ministers.

150
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,370
When confronted by enemies,

151
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,000
Lord Han sacrificed his life for the nation.

152
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,760
If it weren't for Duke Cheng and these good soldiers,

153
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,290
Tianyou would've been gone a long time ago.

154
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,100
Have you thought about this?

155
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,560
When you're buried in the imperial mausoleum one day,

156
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,150
where the ancestors will look at you every day,

157
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,420
how are you going to face them?

158
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,750
Have you ever felt a twinge...

159
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,010
of guilt?

160
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,380
Imperial Brother.

161
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
You were looking for me?

162
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,450
This is?

163
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,130
Imperial Brother. Imperial Brother, I was wrong.

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,010
That's it?

166
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,690
I support the return of Princess Jiuling.

167
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,390
Support the return of Princess Jiuling.

168
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:34,190
I support the return of Princess Jiuling.

169
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,210
I support the return of Princess Jiuling.

170
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,390
Imperial Father,

171
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,320
are you seeing this?

172
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,930
An immoral emperor doesn't deserve to rule the nation.

173
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,630
The hidden secret about Zezhou has been revealed.

174
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,200
How are you going to deal with Chu Rang?

175
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,310
I won't kill him.

176
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,000
His actions will be seen by the people.

177
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,320
Naturally, someone will deal with him.

178
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,750
Just let him live

179
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,240
and accept the anger of the people.

180
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,000
This is the greatest punishment for him.

181
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,560
Jiuling.

182
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,820
- Young Master Ning.
- Jiuling.

183
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,720
A country can't go a day without an emperor. Please make Prince Huai the emperor.

184
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,380
How do you have the Royal Seal?

185
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,060
So did you become a crafty courtier because of Jiuling, too?

186
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,290
I secretly hid the Royal Seal.

187
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,730
I did this not only for Jiuling,

188
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,710
but for the peace of everyone.

189
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,080
Chu Rang is paranoid and scared of death.

190
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,170
The Imperial Court has been a mess for a while.

191
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,200
If I hadn't become a crafty courtier keeping an eye on whatever Chu Rang did,

192
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,530
I'm afraid there would have been many loyal courtiers like Duke Cheng

193
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,750
being persecuted by him. If it kept going like this,

194
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,940
our nation would gradually decline. How could it last?

195
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,680
Prince Huai is young, but he's braver than most people.

196
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,190
I believe he'll become a sensible emperor.

197
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,690
No matter how dangerous it is, the Ning family is always perseverant,

198
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,560
doing the right things.

199
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,120
Young Master Ning, I admire you for being a real man.

200
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,090
Young Master Ning, if it wasn't for you serving under Chu Rang,

201
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,670
I wouldn't have been able to avenge my imperial father's injustice today.

202
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,080
I'll always keep your kindness in mind.

203
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,050
As for Jiurong, he's still young.

204
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,760
I'm afraid he won't be able to handle it.

205
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,030
What should we do then?

206
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,860
Everyone in the world thinks

207
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,090
that you've achieved everything when you sit on the throne.

208
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,420
But imperial power doesn't mean you're above all.

209
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,180
Only those who are liked by civilians deserve

210
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,730
this throne.

211
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,720
What about Prince Xian?

212
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,750
After working with civilians

213
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,990
in this war, Prince Xian is quite popular now.

214
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,800
Also, he has blood ties with the emperor emeritus. He has the right identity,

215
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,300
bravery, and strategies. He's the best person for the throne.

216
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,980
Lord Lu.

217
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,240
Younger Brother.

218
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,460
Some things, if I don't say them today,

219
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm afraid I won't get the opportunity.

220
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,780
When I entered the palace for the first time, I was on duty here.

221
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,810
I never thought I would meet you.

222
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,940
Every time you passed through here,

223
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,660
I was the happiest.

224
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,610
Just as if I were dreaming.

225
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,670
Jiuling could have today because of you both.

226
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,170
Jiuling, do you hate me?

227
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,620
In imperial father's death,

228
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,280
you were an accomplice.

229
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,890
I never thought that

230
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,940
Chu Rang placing me by the late emperor's side

231
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,570
was for this.

232
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,880
I originally had the opportunity to save the late emperor.

233
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,040
In a lapse of judgment,

234
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,930
I didn't do anything.

235
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,260
So you kept making mistakes the past several years?

236
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,710
I have nothing else to give you.

237
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,860
I'll give my life to you in return.

238
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,460
Lu Yunqi,

239
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,980
let's make a clean break.

240
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,840
[Jiuling Hall]

241
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,410
- Here, Liu'er. Eat more. Take care of your young lady.
- There are too many fish bones.

242
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,120
- Thank you.
- Let me try a piece.

243
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,950
- Sit down.
- Here, Chengyu.
- I want to eat lotus roots.

244
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,520
Here.

245
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,350
Why don't we toast Young Lady and Prince?

246
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,010
- Sure!
- Sure!

247
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,450
- Here.
- Here.

248
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,560
- Let's toast Heir Apparent and Princess.
- Cheers!

249
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

250
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,450
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

251
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,260
- Meixin wine tastes very good.
- Young Lady Jun, you should drink it up.

252
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,230
Drink it up.

253
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,600
Sit down. Ignore him.

254
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,360
Now you can't call her Young Lady Jun.

255
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,620
She's Her Highness the Princess.

256
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,450
- Her Highness the Princess.
- Her Highness the Princess.

257
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,200
Jiuling, you asked around about the capital and Prince Huai.

258
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,500
I didn't know I also had a sister who was a princess.

259
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,240
Prince Huai has a sister who's a princess for real.

260
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,720
You have no blood ties, so it doesn't count.

261
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,330
Actually, it's true.

262
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,040
Chengyu, we've been a family since a long time ago.

263
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,820
Whether we have blood ties or not, you're my beloved brother.

264
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,560
Great! My wonderful sister!

265
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,260
- Beloved brother?
- Beloved brother. Beloved brother.

266
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,460
- Here.
- Here.

267
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,920
Jiuling.

268
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,290
Jiuling, the first-ranked scholar is here for you again.

269
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,410
The first-ranked scholar?

270
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,480
Young Master Ning is here?

271
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,560
Who's that?

272
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,550
Who else could pay someone a visit

273
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,230
in the middle of the night?

274
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,460
- Tell Young Master Ning to come in.
- He said he's not coming in.

275
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,030
He's waiting for you at the door. He has something personal to say.

276
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,080
- Something personal. Something personal.
- Something's wrong.

277
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,210
We've got a situation.

278
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,710
Can I go then?

279
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,210
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

280
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,690
My second brother is very generous. How generous.

281
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,860
- What a man!
- Young Master Ning comes here either too early

282
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,420
or too late every time.

283
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,770
Maybe it's wrong timing.

284
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,000
Second Brother, do you need to go take a look?

285
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,510
Everyone, do Jiuling and I have very little trust in each other?

286
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,530
Didn't you just say wrong timing?

287
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,930
Some things come early and others come late in life.

288
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,480
But they don't come at the right time. I'm different.

289
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,100
My timing is perfectly right!

290
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,200
- Perfectly right!
- Perfectly right!

291
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,070
Think about what you said. You met her much earlier than Young Master Ning did.

292
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,180
How could you say it's perfectly right?

293
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,480
- Drink three cups.
- Okay. Okay.

294
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,860
- Drink three cups.
- Perfectly right. I'll drink three cups.

295
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,620
- Wife, you see how cute they are?
- Here. Drink some.

296
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,190
I... When did I say yes to you?

297
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,060
- That day you said you would marry me if I came back alive.
- Stop it.

298
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,730
- May you hear the patter of tiny feet soon!
- Good!

299
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,990
Here! Let's stand up!

300
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,120
- May you hear the patter of tiny feet soon!
- May you grow old together!
- Thank you!

301
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,170
May you be surrounded by children and grandchildren!

302
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,070
Your Highness the Princess.

303
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,100
Lord Ning, it sounds strange.

304
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,550
Then... why don't we call each other like we used to?

305
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,760
- Jiuling.
- Young Master Ning.

306
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,480
You've been busy with the accession to the throne, haven't you?

307
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,110
Yes.

308
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,700
That's why I couldn't pay you a visit until now.

309
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,260
Are you... going to leave again?

310
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,530
I'm going to follow Duke Cheng's family to the North.

311
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,350
You've had four marriage contracts.

312
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,960
This time it's real.

313
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,880
Yes.

314
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,640
I think I should wish you all the best.

315
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,800
I should say thank you.

316
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:08,030
Since I've done a lot, can I ask for a reward?

317
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,940
As long as I can do it, feel free to let me know.

318
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,460
Let's...

319
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,210
play Go again.

320
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,490
Second Brother, are you not going to take a look?

321
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,750
Second Brother, Young Lady Jun is going to be your wife soon.

322
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,320
- You should go take a look.
- A little bit.

323
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,050

I know! The medicine is in a cabinet in the front hall,

You are decisive about your moves and thoughtful. You think twice before making a move.

a deadlock with the sky ♫

478
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,520
♫ If memories could speak ♫

479
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,590
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

480
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:02,040
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

481
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,310
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

482
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,490
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

483
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:13,760
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

484
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,990
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

485
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,200
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

486
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:28,180
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
