♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,560
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,540
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,830
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,860
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,990
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:11,440
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,340
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,750
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:30,990
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

[Jun Jiu Ling]

00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,620
[Episode 15]

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,060
- Which one do you want?
- This one.

20
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,960
- This one?
- All right.
- Child, do you want to look at this toy?

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,280
All right. The sugar is made especially sweet.

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,080
- I guarantee you will like it.
- Here.

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
- Let's go. Here's the money.
- All right.

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,690
- Come again next time.
- Let's go.

25
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,400
Elder Sister.

26
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,620
Younger Sister!

27
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,420
Are you all right?

28
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,850
It's been a long time since we met.

29
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,970
I've missed you.

30
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,910
I didn't expect the sugar figurines you make to be so unique.

31
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,750
No matter how unique, they are just sugar figurines.

32
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,760
Selling sugar figurines like this, do you feel wronged?

33
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,050
What is there to feel wronged about?

34
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,760
Didn't you just see?

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,970
Am I not selling them well?

36
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,590
Rest assured.

37
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,680
How about I recommend another kind of business to you?

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,840
This way, you can put your past business experience to good use.

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,940
Really? What kind of business?

40
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,910
A letter for you from Jiuling.
 [To Fang Jinxiu]

41
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,280
I know the two of you have never gotten along in the past.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,680
However, you should know her character.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,820
I feel that you can consider

44
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,050
her suggestion to you.

45
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,570
All right. I'll take it.

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,740
I am leaving now.

47
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,480
Go on.

48
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,880
Selling sugar figurines!

49
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,320
Fragrant and sweet sugar figurines!

50
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,060
Selling sugar figurines!

51
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,560
Fragrant and sweet sugar figurines!

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,590
Do you really think it is a good idea for her to go to the capital?

53
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,590
Eldest Sister has already thought things through and let everything go.

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,040
She has the ability to do greater things.

55
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,730
She shouldn't be stuck in Zezhou her whole life.

56
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Here, let me take a look.

57
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,510
Jinxiu, with your cleverness,

58
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,840
selling sugar figurines is only a temporary plan.

59
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,190
It shouldn't be a long-term one.

60
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,470
Being in the Fang family for over a decade, you have learned many skills.

61
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,620
Do not let them go to waste.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,650
The capital is much bigger and has many more opportunities.

63
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,910
If you are willing, come to the capital to show off your great skills.

64
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,330
What is it? You are pulling such a long face.

65
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,400
Is selling figurines not going well?

66
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
I don't want to sell sugar figurines anymore.

67
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,690
If you don't want to sell them today, then don't.

68
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,030
Take the rest for the day and do what you want to do.

69
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,290
Do what I want to do?

70
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,910
That's more like you.

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,550
I want to go to the capital.

72
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,570
Such a thing happened?
[Ning Residence]

73
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,510
Yes, Young Master. I don't know what happened myself.

74
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,360
In just half a month,

75
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,650
the wives who originally avoided Miss Jun at all costs,

76
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,850
have all gone rushing to her.

77
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,950
"Miss Jun, please look. Do I have an ill omen?"

78
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,770
If Miss Jun says they don't,

79
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,990
then they become ecstatic, thinking they are very healthy.

80
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,760
Now, those wives are all proud when they hear one sentence from Miss Jun,

81
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,540
"You don't have an ill omen."

82
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,010
Young Master, what you said is absolutely correct.

83
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,250
Miss Jun

84
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,950
is really a unique young lady.

85
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,780
All right, I know now. You may leave.

86
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,190
Yes.

87
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,290
Physician Jiang, how is it?

88
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,050
Old Madam, Madam's illness is just as before.

89
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,200
Let her take some more medicine and we shall see.

90
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,180
But she's taken this medicine for a while now.

91
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,570
There is no difference.

92
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,080
Madam is still in pain and crying every day.

93
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,340
How can she continue like this?

94
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,700
Sickness comes like a landslide and recovering from it is like spinning silk.
(T/N: Recovery takes time)

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,900
Madam has been ill for a long time. You can't rush it.

96
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,150
In that case, thank you for your effort.

97
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,790
Farewell.

98
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,250
Before the medicine works,

99
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,900
I'll die first.

100
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,170
Go search for some more famous physicians.

101
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,840
In this capital,

102
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,480
who is more famous than Physician Jiang?

103
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,700
Old Madam,

104
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,390
you don't say.

105
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,710
I actually know a suitable miraculous physician.

106
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,400
Madam Zhou, who are you referring to?

107
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,330
Jiuling Hall's miraculous physician, Jun Jiuling, Physician Jun.

108
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,750
- Jiuling Hall! Bring one back to life! Curing illnesses!
- Miss Jun!

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,520
- What is it?
- I have finally found you.

110
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,570
- What is it?
- Someone from Marquis Dingyuan Residence

111
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,940
is looking for you to go for a house call.

112
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,980
Marquis Dingyuan Residence?

113
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,780
That's right. The horse carriage is waiting for you at Jiuling Hall's entrance.

114
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,350
Oh!

115
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,980
Let's go quickly.

116
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,940
The people on the streets don't dare to make fun of her anymore.

117
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,780
What even more interesting.

118
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,510
If anyone has a health issue

119
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,250
they willingly go walk around her.

120
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,550
If Miss Jun doesn't say anything about an ill omen or if she ignores them,

121
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,740
then they feel they don't have any health issues

122
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,780
and will go find other physicians to get treated.

123
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,510
Whether she is playing tricks

124
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,050
or only crossing paths with fated people,

125
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,630
we will know once we give it a try.

126
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,500
[Prince Huai Residence]

127
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
Master, I don't understand what this means.

128
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,430
Prince, what this means is...

129
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,930
Rong'er.

130
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,130
Your Highness the Princess. Lord Lu.

131
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,500
Have you grown taller again?

132
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,160
You will be a man very soon.

133
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,310
You are at the right age to start learning martial arts.

134
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,100
Do you want to learn? I can teach you.

135
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,680
No need to look at your elder sister.

136
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,190
If you want to learn, go ahead and learn.

137
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,740
If you don't want to,

138
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,520
feel free to say.

139
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,270
Princess, stay behind and eat with him.

140
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,800
I still have some other matters to attend to, so I shall leave first.

141
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,900
Since you are here,

142
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,950
can I rest for half a day?

143
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,520
I will continue studying after noon.

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,120
Master Gu, we have embarrassed ourselves.

145
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,540
It is all right. The prince has done his work very well recently.

146
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,410
Rewarding him with a break for half a day is a good idea.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,350
Aren't you going to thank your teacher?

148
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,630
Thank you, Master Gu.

149
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,050
Let me take a good look at you.

150
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,500
When I am not by your side, have you been eating well?

151
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,260
Perhaps things will get better as time passes.

152
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,980
Didn't an imperial physician come to look at you already?

153
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,200
It is nothing to worry about, Sister.

154
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,030
How is being sick nothing to worry about?

155
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,940
Later on, I will have them summon another imperial physician to come look at you.

156
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,620
Sister, it is fine. My identity is different.

157
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,390
There is no need to give the physicians a hard time.

158
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Sister, why are you crying?

159
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,230
I am happy to see you.

160
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,150
Shopkeeper Liu?

161
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,040
Ah, Miss! You're finally back!

162
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,370
I was just seeing a patient. Why are you so nervous?

163
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,320
It's the Marquis Dingyuan residence. They are relatives of the imperial family.

164
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,740
How can I not worry?

165
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,440
They eat the same foods, just as they share the same ailments.
(TN: idiom meaning all folks get sick regardless of their birth)

166
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,660
That... Miss Jun, saying that that is fine,

167
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,170
but you can't say that outside.

168
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,530
How did it go?

169
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,740
A physician must keep a patient's privacy. How can I tell you?

170
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,390
Of course, I-I am not asking about Madam Lin's illness.

171
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,640
I was asking how your diagnosis and treatment went.

172
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,190
Quite well. I had her take some medicine today and she's already much better.

173
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,960
I believe she will be fine in about 2-3 days.

174
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,060
That quickly?

175
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,450
Before, the Marquis Dingyuan residence asked

176
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,950
Jiang Youshu from the Imperial Physicians Hall.

177
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,400
That Jiang Youshu is the best physician of the Imperial Physicians Hall.

178
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,300
He treated her for almost a whole month, but Madam Lin did not get any better.

179
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,420
If you treated her for 3 days and...

180
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,290
You didn't say that to the people of the Marquis Dingyuan residence, did you?

181
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,070
I did.

182
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,290
That... That...

183
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,920
Shopkeeper Liu, rest assured.

184
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,330
I will act carefully.

185
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,290
All right.

186
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Look at this...

187
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,940
Just follow this prescription to gather the herbs.

188
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,560
All right.

189
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,800
Imperial Physician Zhou.
 [Imperial Physicians Hall]

190
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,110
What's the matter?

191
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,630
Say, what's going on with him?

192
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,780
You really don't know?

193
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,880
It's because of Marquis Dingyuan's wife's illness.

194
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,790
This Madam Lin is afflicted with "born into wealth and raised with affluence."
(Equivalent of calling someone having "affluenza")

195
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,330
Imperial Physician Jiang spent more than a month

196
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,800
using mild medicines to slowly treat her.

197
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,100
It seems she was almost recovered, and then,

198
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,310
a female miraculous physician came out of nowhere.

199
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,830
One dose of strong medication.

200
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,550
Three days, it just took three days,

201
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,040
and Madam Lin immediately got better.

202
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,390
In just a few days,

203
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,010
this matter has spread throughout the entire capital city.

204
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,130
The imperial officials who originally asked Physician Jiang for a consultation,

205
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,960
have now switched to ask for consultations from that miraculous female physician.

206
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,410
Do you think he would be all right?

207
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,140
What's the female physician's name?

208
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,890
I'll have everyone remember her name and find an opportunity to teach her a lesson.

209
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,020
I think her name is... Jun Jiuling.

210
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,510
On Qianmen Street, she opened up a medicinal hall called

211
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,610
Jiuling Hall.

212
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,120
We won't need to take action.

213
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,630
Someone will naturally teach her a lesson.

214
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,190
Imperial Physician Zhang, what do you mean?

215
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,000
The name "Jiuling,"

216
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,900
is a name that someone does not want others to use.

217
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,490
Lord Lu has been busy with work recently, so he probably has not noticed this matter.

218
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,490
We should remind him.

219
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,970
Imperial Physician Zhou, what do you think?

220
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,940
That's a brilliant scheme.

221
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,690
Lord.

222
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,850
Jun Zhenzhen, a granddaughter from the Fang family, came to the capital a month ago.

223
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,800
She also opened a medicinal hall named Jiuling Hall.

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,270
She also changed her name to Jun Jiuling.

225
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,640
Jun Jiuling?

226
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,650
Jun Jiuling?

227
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,320
Why are you only now reporting this matter that happened a month ago?

228
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,870
You were in the midst of wedding preparations. I didn't want to disturb you with this trivial matter.

229
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,930
Besides, the Imperial Physicians Hall intentionally sent this news.

230
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,080
Imperial Physicians Hall. They dare to use me.

231
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,090
I know they want to deal with her. You don't need to convey messages for others.

232
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,080
Lord, although the Imperial Physicians Hall instigated this matter,

233
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,410
she has indeed used the late princess Jiuling's forbidden name.

234
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,060
- How about I go teach her a lesson for you?
- No need.

235
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,570
Jiang Youshu isn't someone who can silently accept loss.

236
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,770
Since he wants to help us take care of an issue, why should we do anything?

237
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,390
Pass on my order. When the Imperial Physicians make their move,

238
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,320
don't get involved.

239
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,890
Yes.

240
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,470
Jiuling Hall?

241
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,950
Jun Jiuling.

242
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,400
Younger sister, your complexion looks great.

243
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,820
- If not for Madam Zhou, I would still be laying in bed.
- Madam, Miss Jun has arrived.

244
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,380
Hello, Madams.

245
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,520
Miss Jun, no need to be so polite.

246
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,250
Your medicine was indeed effective.

247
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,290
My daughter-in-law has recovered well.

248
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,710
Her complexion is much better.

249
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,570
Madam, your complexion does look much better.

250
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,860
Miss Jun, your medical skills are indeed incredible.

251
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,490
I was sick for so long.

252
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,380
Only in the past few days has my body truly stopped being in pain.

253
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,400
I can sleep peacefully at night now.

254
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,670
That's great. I'll perform some more acupuncture to make sure your recovery is a sure thing.

255
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,990
All right. I shall trouble you then, Miss Jun.

256
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,600
You're welcome.

257
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,150
Old Madam, Commander Lu sent someone to fetch Cook Fang.

258
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,280
Prince Consort? What doesn't his home have?

259
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,770
- Why would he ask for a cook from you?
- It should be for Princess Jiuli.

260
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,580
Princess Jiuli used to love eating Cook Fang's red bean cake.

261
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,300
Speaking of, she often used to invite Cook Fang into the palace to make red bean cake.

262
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,220
However, ever since the last emperor passed away,

263
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,420
she moved to the Prince Huai Residence and hasn't sent anyone to invite her again.

264
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,010
Let her go.

265
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,630
She's just a cook. There need not be so many restrictions.

266
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,040
Yes.

267
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,280
Speaking of Prince Huai Residence, have you heard?

268
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,360
The young prince has been sick for many days now.

269
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,300
That is inevitable.

270
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,500
Now that his older sister has married,

271
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,110
he no longer has anyone by his side to take good care of him.

272
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,190
He is such a young child. Even the slightest oversight

273
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,540
will cause him to get sick.

274
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,900
That's true. It's hard for such a young child.

275
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,760
Madam, we can do the acupuncture now.

276
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,440
All right.

277
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,900
[Lu Residence]

278
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,370
Princess, this is a freshly made red bean cake from the kitchen. Have a taste.

279
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,910
Cook Fang from the Marquis Dingyuan Residence made it.

280
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,450
Master heard you like to eat it, so he specifically asked her to come and make it.

281
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,940
It tastes the same as before.

282
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,070
It hasn't changed at all.

283
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,560
If you like it, I can have her come often.

284
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,650
That's very considerate.

285
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,640
The red bean cake is very delicious.

286
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,760
You should give it a taste as well.

287
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,350
I don't like to eat that.

288
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,530
Such a delicious snack,

289
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,220
yet none of you likes it.

290
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,880
I still have some work, so I won't be back for dinner tonight.

291
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,750
Princess, Master...

292
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,960
Master seems to be heading there again.

293
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,000
Princess, you can't keep being like this,

294
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,890
keeping a distance from him.

295
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,510
All the people in this residence know that

296
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,430
on the marriage night,

297
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,370
Master didn't stay the night.

298
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,640
Princess.

299
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,050
That's enough.

300
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,860
Here.

301
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,840
- Take care.
- Thanks.

302
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,710
Miss, red bean cake.

303
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,880
- Want to try?
- I'll take some too.

304
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,070
Here.

305
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,550
Is it good?

306
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,920
It's good.

307
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,700
The red bean cake isn't delicious at all.

308
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,920
Yet, Elder Sister likes it.

309
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,320
She has such a weird palette.

310
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,960
You used to persuade me to try it, but I was never willing.

311
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,200
Now that you're not by my side,

312
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,520
I bought some to eat.

313
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,440
It's not good.

314
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,500
I happen to want to see you about something.

315
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,730
- Do you know Prince Huai?
- Yes.

316
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,840
I heard he's sick.

317
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,720
What sickness?

318
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,240
I don't know the details.

319
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,440
It seems like he's been sick for a while now.

320
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,210
It's not easy to get news about the Prince Huai Residence.

321
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,890

Coincidentally, I heard them mention it.

It's said that the people from the Imperial Physicians Hall speculate it is Heaven's will

A bunch of scumbags.

327
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,570
I was thinking that since you know Prince Huai

and I'm the princess' old friend,

But if you want to show up at his door and treat him,

I'll try.

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,840
Physician Feng, cause trouble?

477
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,500
They all told me. You said that I can cure any illnesses.

478
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,610
There are countless illnesses in the world, can I cure them all just because you said so?

479
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,210
What if I can't? Don't I become the bad guy?

480
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,930
I never said that.

481
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,180
Miss Jun, you indeed did say that. Right?

482
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,940
- Right!
- That's right!

483
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,590
Did you forget?

484
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,140
Young Master, have we met before?

485
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,800
Miss Jun, it's me.

486
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,520
You are a busy person so you must not remember.

487
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,350
Yesterday, I invited you to my house to see if there were any ill omens.

488
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,830
You said my illness

489
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,580
isn't worth you treating.

490
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,200
That's right. Miss Jun, you said it is such a trivial problem, we should just go see Physician Feng.

491
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,030
- What else do you have to say?
- Nonsense!

492
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,690
We've never met any of you before.

493
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,620
Did someone instruct you all to come?

494
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,340
What? Now that you've been exposed,

495
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,100
you're criticizing the patients?

496
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,020
Exactly! You have no medical ethics at all!

497
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,150
- Yes, that's right!
- Exactly!

498
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,250
- Physician Feng.
- Miss Jun.

499
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,340
Heir Apparent.

500
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,690
What are you all huddled here for?

501
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,020
It seems there are even people condemning you for treating others.

502
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,810
No! It's obvious that these people were sent here purposefully

503
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,910
to cause trouble.

504
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,410
Cause trouble?

505
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,790
He's Zhu Zan, the heir apparent of Duke Cheng.

506
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,200
Do I need to have the Pentapolis Military come to determine your crimes?

507
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,850
It's a misunderstanding.

508
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,500
Scram!

509
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,830
- His legs are sure moving quickly!
- Stop running!

510
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,670
- They're pretending!
- How could they do that?

511
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,630
Physician Feng.

512
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,520
Physician Feng, you have now seen the truth.

513
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,760
My apologies for shocking you.

514
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,050
Such a pretentious old man. He doesn't even admit that he was wrong.

515
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,650
Liu'er, don't say that.

516
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,000
Physician Feng is a physician with medical ethics.

517
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,870
Thank you, Young Lord.

518
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,690
If he were right, then aren't you admitting that you were wrong?

519
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,060
You don't have to distinguish between right and wrong in this world.

520
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,920
They may just be in different positions and have different views.

521
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,490
From his point of view, he is right.

522
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,240
Long time no see. Why are you here?

523
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,140
I am here to sell sugar figurines.

524
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,660
Now, we have someone to take care of accounts in Jiuling Hall.

525
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,030
We're still missing a shopkeeper.

526
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,570
What do you think?

527
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,390
I am willing! Of course, I am willing!

528
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,120
Look at you.

529
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,650
Miss Jinxiu, wait for me!

530
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,850
Miss Jun, let's talk.

531
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,920
Miss Jinxiu, wait for me, too!

532
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,450
[Fuyun Teahouse]

533
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:32,090
You are saying this matter has something to do with the Imperial Physicians Hall?

534
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,280
Most likely it has to do with your treatment of Marquis Dingyuan's wife.

535
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,600
You've offended Imperial Physician Jiang.

536
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,120
Shopkeeper Liu did advise me before.

537
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,000
It's just that, as a physician, treating and saving people is a priority.

538
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,960
I...

539
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,070
You dare to hang the plaque of Jiuling Hall, yet you aren't afraid that you will be targeted one day?

540
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,940
Let's not talk about that now.

541
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,250
Did you find anything in the archives room?

542
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,450
Speaking of, it's such a coincidence. Jiang Youshu was also the one who went to treat Prince Huai.

543
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,620
Moreover, what's written in the column for illness was "weak health."

544
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,660
He also prescribed useless tonics.

545
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,870
How could this be all right?

546
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,230
Isn't the true cause of the illness ignored then?

547
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,400
Taking too much medication is harmful. Even minor ailments can become very serious.

548
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,350
That's right. This is why Jiang Youshu is smart.

549
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,920
He takes one step forward but is thinking three steps ahead.

550
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,740
He doesn't seek to make great accomplishments. He only seeks to not make mistakes.

551
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,350
However, his mistakes,

552
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,120
in that person's eyes,

553
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,210
are meritorious services.

554
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,720
The new emperor doesn't have much tolerance.

555
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,050
Moreover, Jiurong is the son of the late emperor.

556
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,580
If not for the fact that Jiurong is a child

557
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,730
and hasn't been established as the crown prince,

558
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,080
it's not his turn

559
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,000
to sit in that seat.

560
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,670
Thus, the priority is to switch out Jiang Youshu.

561
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,860
Your thoughts are the same as mine.

562
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,970
My father and Imperial Physician Sun are old friends.

563
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,760
I want to switch out Jiang Youshu

564
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,530
and get Physician Sun to take his place. The only person we can trust now is Imperial Physician Sun.

565
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,130
Then, I will leave this matter to you.

566
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,010
When it comes to Jiuling's matters...

567
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,290
Oh, I mean the other Jiuling...

568
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,990
I would naturally care.

569
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,740
You are asking me for help so earnestly.

570
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,990
It's like Jiurong is your brother.

571
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,960
An old friend's younger brother is my younger brother as well.

572
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,060
This is my duty.

573
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,540
Are her medical skills

574
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,380
really that great?

575
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,210
Yes, Third Madam. That's what everyone says.

576
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,150
In addition, she also cured Marquis Dingyuan's wife.

577
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,340
Then she must be able

578
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,400
to cure my throat very quickly, too. Right?

579
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,030
Look. You have already taken this medication for some time,

580
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,630
but there has been no improvement.

581
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,520
The physician just has you continuing to consume this.

582
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,050
However... Lord has not come for days now.

583
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,630
We cannot wait any longer.

584
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,800
Go invite her here now.

585
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,590
Go quickly. Hurry.

586
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,180
Yes.

587
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,810
Chen Qi, what are you doing?

588
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,690
- Jinxiu, have you finished looking at the accounts?
- Yes.

589
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,730
How is it? Are you rich?

590
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,350
We can't say we struck it rich.

591
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,270
First, there's not much business.

592
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,650
Secondly, if we add up everything such as salaries

593
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,430
and expenses, she's been making great losses.

594
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,170
All those don't matter.

595
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,280
With these and these, we will surely become rich.

596
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,690
Let me tell you. This is not just a normal medicinal hall.

597
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,300
This is a shop for rare and exotic treasures.

598
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,930
What nonsense are you saying? How much can these medicinal herbs be worth?

599
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,260
I looked at the accounts. These are worth over a thousand taels.

600
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,800
This is a big business.

601
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,040
I just hope this big business will not bring big trouble.

602
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,450
What is there to be afraid of?

603
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,750
People in this world are humans after all.

604
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,560
We always live in the face of trouble.

605
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,830
We can't avoid trouble just because we want to.

606
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,930
If we have the capabilities, there would be no such thing as trouble.

607
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,920
Look at what happened today. People came to cause trouble,

608
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,580
yet nothing happened to Miss Jun.

609
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,440
Is Physician Jun in?

610
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,070
Our Madam invites Physician Jun for a consultation.

611
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,310
Madam's illness is not serious. This prescription is correct as well.

612
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,200
She just needs to take the medication for a few more days.

613
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,960
Physician Jun, you should go and take a look at her.

614
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,060
Why don't you understand what she said?

615
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,390
What our miss means is,

616
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,310
your madam will be fine as long as she continues to take the medicine.

617
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,570
Men, invite Physician Jun for a consultation.

618
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,020
What are you all doing?

619
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,590

♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

634
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:54,380
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

635
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:00,300
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

636
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,150
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

637
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:11,480
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

638
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,040
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

639
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,010
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

640
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:23,170
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked
in a deadlock with the sky ♫

641
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,640
♫ If memories could speak ♫

642
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,670
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

643
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:35,200
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

644
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,640
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

645
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,620
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

646
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:46,860
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

647
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,190
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

648
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,330
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

649
00:42:53,330 --> 00:43:01,640
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
