♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,550
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,850
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

[Episode 32]

19
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:15,600
Third Prince, please open the city gates.

20
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,060
Your Highness, His Majesty has ordered that you immediately open the city gates to welcome Duke Cheng into the capital.

21
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,330
Open the city gates.

22
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,330
Open the city gates! Let in Duke Cheng and

23
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,650
Master Qi!

24
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,300
So great! So great!

27
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,070
- Welcome, Duke Cheng.
- So great!

[Tianyou]

29
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,870
Uncle Yuan.

30
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,190
Please accept my bow.

31
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,090
- What are you doing?
- Please let me finish, Uncle Yuan.

32
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,570
Father was able to enter the city successfully all thanks to Uncle Yuan.

33
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,350
Get up, get up. Get up first.

34
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,880
Come, sit. Quickly. Get up.

35
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,280
- Yes.
- You kneeling made me feel uncomfortable.

36
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,330
You didn't see Duke Cheng's aura. No one can block it.

37
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,810
I was so confused. They say, "indigo blue comes from the indigo yet is bluer than the plant."

38
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,020
Why are you so different from your father, young lad?

39
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,990
Look, when Duke Cheng entered the capital, a sea of people were there.

40
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,570
When you walk the streets, there is definitely chaos.

41
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,920
Uncle Yuan, I think you're jealous of me.

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,850
Would you believe that once I leave, there'll be a sea of people to see me?

43
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,290
I really don't believe it!

44
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,950
I think Huang Cheng is most likely furious right now.

45
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,070
He planned for such a long time, spent so much money, and made such a spectacle of it,

46
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,960
but it ended in a failure. Such a miserable failure, too.

47
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,530
He's just a pathetic fool.

48
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,020
Don't underestimate these pathetic fools.

49
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,130
If not for the refugees from the North,

50
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,710
the plan wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

51
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,760
All thanks to Uncle Yuan.

52
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,150
I didn't do anything. It was mostly your wife who's very capable.

53
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,520
"Your wife"?

54
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,510
They're all at home. There are a few. Who are you looking for?

55
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,850
Speaking of, this great show is almost over,

56
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,270
why hasn't your wife taken the stage yet?
(T/N: shown up)

57
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,150
Uncle Yuan, in order to stop Lu Yunqi's harassment,

58
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,780
Jiuling needs me to put on a show with her.

59
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,670
My Lord, I was careless.

60
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,300
Tens of thousands of people were coming to the capital yet I only found out today.

61
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,520
My Lord, these refugees blended in with businessmen.

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,420
They made a detour on land and in the water to come here.

63
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,360
I never thought that there would still be people with such wealth and capability.

64
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,670
It was my mistake and negligence.

65
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,830
However, only she would think of such a plan.

66
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,040
You're finally back.

67
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,990
My Lord, as you had speculated, Miss Jun is indeed back.

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,830
Yunqi, I'm back!

69
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,240
You're back?

70
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,520
Capture her.

71
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,010
She is the wife of Duke Cheng's heir apparent.

72
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,690
Who dares to touch her?

73
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,180
So what? I don't mind.

74
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,720
You don't mind but His Majesty would.

75
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,200
Right now, my father is meeting with His Majesty.

76
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,270
Yet you dare to touch my wife.

77
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,430
You're disrespecting Your Majesty.
(T/N: lit. translation is giving a slap to his face)

78
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,190
That's right. You may not want to save face, but His Majesty does.
(T/N: want respect)

79
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,490
Your skin was given to you by His Majesty.
(T/N: skin means status, something that protects oneself)

80
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,320
If you slap His Majesty in the face, he would then strip you of your skin.

81
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,510
Once your skin is removed, you won't be able to capture us.

82
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,200
Zhu Zan,

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,910
whoever tries to stop the Martial Moral Ministry from handling a case shall die.

84
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm stopping you, so what?

85
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,930
Do you want to fight?

86
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,460
Come, come.

87
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,370
Enough, Husband.

88
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,300
There's no need to fight with someone like him.

89
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,260
Let's quickly go home.

90
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:49,230
I've told you to head home long ago. Why are you so slow?

91
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,890
I was wrong.

92
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,410
No problem. I forgive you. Let's go home.

93
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,680
Did you hear that? Because of her, I'll forgive you.

94
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,700
Let's go home.

95
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,990
Young Lord, please.

96
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,770
Go away.

97
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,310
That was some good acting, my beloved wife.

98
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,830
You too my beloved husband.

99
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,120
My beloved wife, if it weren't for you stopping me, I would've beaten him up.

100
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,820
How can someone as precious as my husband

101
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,010
go to clash with those scumbags?

102
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,660
My wife is the delicate, precious one. Why would she stoop to the level of those scumbags?

103
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,470
Plus, you can't disgrace the heir apparent wife's good reputation.

104
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,860
I wanted to tell him in front of everyone that I was your wife.

105
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,930
Then, my wife, you are really clever. With so many onlookers there,

106
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,090
Lu Yunqi won't dare be delusionally hopeful in obtaining you.

107
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,180
Even if you publicly agitate, he strikes,

108
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,830
and His Majesty hears, we would not be losing out.

109
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,820
Where are we going?

110
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,300
To the Duke Cheng residence.

111
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,030
You are my wife. If you are not returning to the residence, where would you go?

112
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,320
Let's go. Hurry up.

113
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,680
Do you all want to join the Zhu army?

114
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,400
Our bodily person and soul belong to Martial Moral Ministry.

115
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,600
Then why are you not wearing the uniform?

116
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,400
We didn't complete our task.

117
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,900
Miss Jun came back safely, so it's not considered a failure.

118
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you, My Lord.

119
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,300
Hurry and put it on.

120
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,200
Duke Cheng, you've returned from a great victory and must be tired from the journey.

121
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,300
You've worked hard.

122
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
Hurry get up.

123
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
I've committed a crime. Your Majesty, please punish me.

124
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
What crime?

125
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,600
I previously refused your order ten times.

126
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
I truly had no choice.

127
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,200
Your Majesty is magnanimous and benevolent, so you did not pursue my crime.

128
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
Also, my son Zhu Zan escaped his punishment.

129
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
Although the cause was the war between the two nations, he cannot be absolved of blame.

130
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,800
Your Majesty is merciful and didn't pursue that either.

131
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Now that war has been replaced with peace, I shall bear the guilt of the two crimes.

132
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
I find it hard to be at ease.

133
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Your Majesty, please punish me.

134
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,300
Duke Cheng, you refused orders for the sake of national affairs.

135
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,000
The greater picture was more important, thus, you're forgivable.

136
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,800
Your Heir Apparent Zhu Zan took a dangerous risk

137
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,200
to save the people.

138
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Merits and demerits balance out, so it's fine. Hurry and get up.

139
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,000
- Your Majesty.
- Don't mention this matter again.

140
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,690
Thank you, Your Majesty.

141
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
From being passive, he turned active.

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,400
With a few words, he's washed himself clean.

143
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Your Majesty, I still have an unreasonable request.

144
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,400
Speak.

145
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,600
Now the war is over but the treasury is empty.

146
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
I hope Your Majesty will withdraw the tax collection order

147
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,400
and return all the collected resources

148
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,600
back to the officials as well as the people.

149
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
If that happens,

150
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,600
then wouldn't I be treating the Northern soldiers poorly?

151
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,800
To myself and the Northern soldiers,

152
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,400
your trust is more valuable than gold.

153
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
Approved.

154
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

155
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,100
In that case, Historical Revisor Ning's uncle must be very happy.

156
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,900
With Duke Cheng's return, his suspension was not for nothing.

157
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,900
Your Majesty, what my uncle was against was the peace negotiation. It had nothing to do with Duke Cheng.

158
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,600
Now the nation, with its people, is at peace and what my uncle worried about did not happen.

159
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,200
He is at home now, repenting for offending Your Majesty.

160
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,400
I ask Your Majesty to graciously forgive my uncle's offense.

161
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Within the court, there have always been different opinions.

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,200
Lord Ning has always been dedicated to the nation, so how could I blame him?

163
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,000
He's already been repenting at home for a while now.

164
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,600
Tomorrow, have him return to court to discuss affairs.

165
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,000
On behalf of my uncle, I thank Your Majesty.

[Duke Cheng Residence]

167
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,400
Second Brother. Second Sister-in-law.

168
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,200
Second Brother. Sister-in-law.

169
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,600
We're at home. You don't have to be so formal.

170
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Seeing Lu Yunqi's face earlier, I really wanted to beat him.

171
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I wanted to beat him, too.

172
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Stop fooling around.

173
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,800
I wonder if Father made it into the palace safely.

174
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Second Brother, don't worry.

175
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Historical Revisor Ning is very eloquent.

176
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,200
He flatters His Majesty so much. I'm guessing he can't stop unless he sees Duke Cheng.

177
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,300
He's no longer the noble and dignified young master he used to be.

178
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,700
Everyone says Lord Ning is upright and honest.

179
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,600
How did he raise such a slanderous nephew?

180
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's been hard on him.

181
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,000
No wonder.

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,800
Someone who had such thin skin before has skin thicker than the city walls now.
(T/N: thick-skinned means shameless)

183
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,400
Turns out that there's a wise person giving him instructions behind the scenes.

184
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,410
What do you mean?

185
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,200
Sorry to interrupt.

186
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Speak.

187
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,800
There's one more thing.

188
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,100
What is it that you're being so serious about?

189
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,300
- We've found out who Huang Cheng secretly met with before.
- Who was it?

190
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,200
Northern Qi's Crown Prince, Yu Chihai.

191
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,000
- Where is he?
- He left a stand-in to fool everyone and has long gone missing.

192
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,200
All of the evidence was also destroyed. I'm afraid we won't be able to get him with only our identification.

193
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,100
To have such freedom to move around the city,

194
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,800
it can't be one person alone. Aside from Huang Cheng,

195
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,000
there must be someone behind the scenes making it easy for him.

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,600
Or someone who knows about it but isn't reporting it.

197
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,400
Could it be Lu Yunqi? Nothing can escape the eye of the Martial Moral Ministry.

198
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,200
Lu Yunqi has always only listened to imperial orders and doesn't interact with others.

199
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,100
If he secretly helped Huang Cheng...

200
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,310
Unless it's beneficial to him.

201
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,400
Minister Zhu, what is this?

202
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
Your Majesty,

203
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,200
I am old and not as I was before.

204
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,200
It is difficult for me to continue to guard the Northern lands.

205
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,800
Your Majesty, please graciously take back the military power.

206
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
T-This...

207
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,200
You must have misunderstood me.

208
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,900
I only appointed Earl of Qinghe

209
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,500
to temporarily guard the North on your behalf

210
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,400
because I felt you have worked too hard

211
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,600
and wanted you to take a break while you're in the capital. After you're back to good health,

212
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,900
I would entrust you with the responsibility of guarding the Northern lands again.

213
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,600
I am extremely touched by Your Majesty's care,

214
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,000
but my words are also true reflections of my heart.

215
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Earl of Qinghe is at his prime and more suitable than I to guard the North.

216
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,100
Please fulfill my wish and take back the military power.

217
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Since you insist, let us do this.

218
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,600
For now, we'll temporarily leave the military seal with me.

219
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Once you're in good health,

220
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,800
I will still give it back to you.

221
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

222
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,500
Tonight, you'll sleep here and I'll sleep in the guest room.

223
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,800
Look, you're so beautiful when you smile.

224
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Gentle and pleasant. Not only is your smile pretty,

225
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,500
you're also...

226
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,800
wise and brave.

227
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,370
A lot of men can't compare to you.

228
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,900
Do you still remember? When we were young,

229
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,900
I always bothered Duke Cheng, saying I want to watch him practice his swordsmanship.

230
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,000
You would secretly lift me on your back

231
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,400
and tell me that there's

232
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,900
no one in the world who would spoil me more than you.

233
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,800
It's also here

234
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,200
that you told me you were going to the Northern lands.

235
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,800
I said that no matter when you returned,

236
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,000
you have to tell me in advance and I'd go wait at the city gate.

237
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,700
You still remember all of that?

238
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,200
How could I forget such precious memories?

239
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,800
In the future, we'll create more precious memories.

240
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,600
We'll slowly tell them to our children.

241
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,790
So annoying!

242
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,500
All right.

243
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Let's talk about serious matters. Give me a moment.

244
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,000
Jiuling, this in Bing'er. She previously served the late emperor.

245
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,200
Now she's changed her name to Su Juan.

246
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,800
Su Juan, this is Princess Jiuling.

247
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,200
Bing'er, where did you go? Everyone is looking for you.

248
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
She's not Princess Jiuling.

249
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Bing'er, after surviving everything, I changed my appearance.

250
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Do you still remember I took the flint stick from the firewood room,

251
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,000
and you were scolded by Nanny Zhou? I'm truly sorry.

252
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,300
Y-You're really Princess Jiuling.

253
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,600
It's all my fault! It's all because I didn't watch my mouth.

254
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Otherwise, you would have been able to live well.

255
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Hurry and get up.

256
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,800
None of us are at fault.

257
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,700
Look! Aren't I living well now?

258
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,800
Back then, I kept looking for you. I never thought you'd be here.

259
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,400
It's the young lord who saved me and helped me settle outside the city.

260
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,500
When I heard you died, I felt like there was a problem.

261
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,600
So I had people from Yunxiao Pavilion investigate it.

262
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,300
They found Bing'er and saved her before the Martial Moral Ministry could find her.

263
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,300
Bing'er, tell Princess Jiuling all the details regarding the late emperor's death.

264
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,700
Young Lord, I've already told the princess all the details

265
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,000
about the late emperor's death.

266
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,200
But I didn't get the chance to tell you

267
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,000
about the seal pattern.

268
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,600
Princess, the late emperor

269
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
mentioned the seal pattern to Physician Jun.

270
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,800
Also, Huang Cheng, Lord Huang, has seen it!

271
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,800
That day, in the study, the late emperor accidentally knocked off the memorandums from the dragon case.

272
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,000
Lord Huang was there and also saw that seal pattern.

Yesterday,

277
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,890
I handed over the military power to His Majesty. Once your marriage arrangement with Miss Jun is called off,

278
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,070
we can leave.

279
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,640
Father, must you be in such a hurry?

280
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,530
This child. Miss Jun helped you out of kindness.

281
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,580
You can't become an obstacle to such an important matter in her life.

282
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,130
Madam. Duke Cheng. Let us discuss

283
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,050
this matter later on.

284
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,610
Zan'er, you should know that I have always liked Miss Jun.

285
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,610
Why don't I accept her as my goddaughter?

286
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,630
Then the two of you can get along as siblings in the future. What do you think?

287
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,310
G-Goddaughter?

288
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,340
Just now when my mother said she wanted to accept you as her goddaughter, why didn't you reject it?

289
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,720
Of course, I would not decline to become Madam Yu's goddaughter.

290
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,050
That's not what I meant.

291
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:56,280
When my father mentioned breaking off the marriage arrangement, why didn't you explain?

292
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,560
Wasn't that just a temporary plan?

293
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,190
When have I agreed to marriage?

294
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,500
This isn't right.

295
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,420
When I refer to you as the heir apparent's wife you seemed quite happy.

296
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,500
Weren't we in the North at that time?

297
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,190
Everyone knew about it. I couldn't embarrass my godmother, right?

298
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,310
Fine.

299
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,050
Then I will go and explain to them your true identity.

300
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,090
All right.

301
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,720
I'm giving you one last chance.

302

If you're not going to sit down, no one will stop you.

I'll give you face.

Recently, Duke Cheng has already been worried about the matter with His Majesty and Huang Cheng.

305
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,960
I cannot let him be worried over my matters again.

306
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm afraid that once we dissolve this agreement,

307
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,640
it'll be hard to make it believable.

308
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,390
After all, I'm already your third marriage.

309

If you add on Lu Xiaozao. I'd be the fourth.

Miss Jun, you haven't eaten here before. Right?

315
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,460
Call her "Sister-in-law!"

316
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,480
Didn't you tell me not to do that yesterday?

- Sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law.

318
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,120
Eldest Brother, you should call her younger sister-in-law.

319
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,590
There's a problem here.

320
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,050
- Yes.
- The problem is very serious.

321

It has only been a day and things are progressing a bit too fast.

322
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,050
This show my second brother is putting on, seems to be getting more and more realistic as time passes.

323
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,010
It's fine. As long as it is all according to Second Brother's wishes.

- I'm jealous.

Then it is such a pity.

328

Let me tell you, Sister-in-law. The food here is extremely good.

329
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,630
It's all my second brother's fault for not bringing Sister-in-law here earlier. Am I right, Sister-in-law?

330
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,420
You still need to rely on me right, Sister-in-law?

331

Even eating food cannot stop your mouth.

332

You have so much to say.

333
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,690
All right. Sister-in-law, please eat more!

it's Lu Yunqi.

341

Let's just eat our food. As long as he doesn't obstruct us then he's a good dog.

342

Whatever they ordered, we'll have the same.

All right!

344

Sister-in-law, you should eat more. Stop giving food to my second brother.

Second Brother, I'm really envious that you have such a good wife.

My Lord, Third Madam sent someone to ask

if we will be going over tonight.

She said she's learned a new song.

No need. These substitutes have no meaning anymore.

351
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,660
Just dismiss them.

352

The original has already been found anyway.

353
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,340
What's wrong, Sister-in-law? Could it be that you are with child?

354
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,450
It must be! If you dry heave, doesn't that mean you are with child?

355
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,820
Baotang, sometimes I dry heave all the time towards some people. Am I with child?

356
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,410
That's true. Then another possibility is...

357

Being digusted!

How dare you!

359
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:27,020
Could it be you heard something you shouldn't and are now feeling guilty?

360
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,090
It's because we saw someone disgusting and heard disgusting words. So we feel disgusted!

Lord Huang, why did you ask for me?

Everyone is saying, Lord Lu is heartless.

Are you thinking of asking me to help you handle Duke Cheng?

When he was young, he stole. Now, it's getting worse.

That's all because of Princess Jiuling.

Don't get involved in the family affairs of the young couple.

Then, I'll say it.

This happened about ten years ago.

At that time, that Lu Xiaozao was stealing stuff.

404

We discovered it. We confronted him, but he denied it.

So the one I saved was Lu Yunqi?

That happened such a long time ago. Princess Jiuling has already forgotten about it.

If Princess Jiuling knew she saved such a person,

00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,960
When they saw my father, they were very respectful.

474
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
Ning Yunzhao is looking for you.

475
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,630
- What is he here for?
- I don't know either.

476
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,260
He is looking for Jiuling.

477
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,690
Is there any need to meet?

478
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,090
Before we left, he wasn't that kind of person.

479
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,720
When he came back from Northern Qi, he became a slanderer.

480
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,890
That's right.

481
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,870
Miss, when I went out this morning, I heard the rumors.

482
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,340
He doesn't have any of Lord Ning's charisma.

483
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,900
Lord Ning is willing to stay at home for Duke Cheng.

484
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,290
And he just stands there and praises His Majesty.

485
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,900
I'll see him. There are some matters that should be clarified in person.

486
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,470
Lord Ning, what business do you have with our miss?

487
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,730
You are now a senior official. We can't accept such grace from you.

488
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,390
Liu'er, stop talking.

489
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:13,030
- Miss Jun.
- You should address her as the wife of the Heir Apparent.

490
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,460
Wife of the Heir Apparent.

491
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,550
Lord Ning, what business do you have with us today?

492
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,410
"Lord Ning"!

493
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,190
You never addressed me like that before.

494
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:39,530
Naturally, it is not the same. The Lord Ning today is not like the Young Master Ning from before.

495
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,400
You are also blaming me?

496
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,160
Lord Ning, our status is now different.

497
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,750
In the future, don't look for me anymore.

498
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,430
So that we won't need to feel awkward when we see each other.

499
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,390
Not even as friends?

500
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,370
Our goals and status are different.

501
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:06,730
Lord Ning, how can we be friends?

502
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,850
I understand. In the future,

503
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,570
I won't come and see Miss Jun anymore.

504
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,240
Lord Ning, take care.

505
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,240
Sounds of Rain - Jiang Long & Yin Luxi

506
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:17,430
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

507
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:23,160
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

508
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,270
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

509
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:35,050
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

510
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:41,080
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

511
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,880
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

512
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,870
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

513
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:58,200
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

514
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,640
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

515
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,600
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

516
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,870
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky ♫

517
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,320
♫ If memories could speak ♫

518
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,430
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

519
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:23,790
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

520
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:50,020
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

521
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,890
♫ And see the starry night, mountains and rivers together ♫

522
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:01,850
♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

523
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:07,190
♫ I can only sigh deeply. The rest of my life is bumpy ♫

524
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,530
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

525
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,650
♫ I’m destined to be passed by ♫

526
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:18,980
♫ The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in
a deadlock with the sky ♫

527
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,290
♫ If memories could speak ♫

528
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,440
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

529
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,820
♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

530
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,220
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

531
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,260
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

532
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,520
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

533
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,730
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

534
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,960
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

535
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:57,210
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
