♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,730
[Episode 33]

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,800
I know, in the future I won't come and disturb Miss Jun anymore.

20
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,300
The time when we are to part and meet again, I'm

21
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,350
afraid that we will have to become enemies.

22
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,620
I want you to put on a show.

23
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,110
What show?

24
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,590
I want you to draw a line between you and the people that Chu Rang is wary of.

25
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,840
Like Zhu Zan, like Duke Cheng, and me.

26
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,110
And you?

27
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,660
Only in this way can you gain Chu Rang's trust.

28
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,600
What do you want me to do?

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,430
Your reason for doing this to me, is to let everyone in the capital know about this.

30
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,350
If you want everybody to know that you and I have severed ties,

31
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,810
this show will have to be acted out in public.

32
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,770
Just that I'm afraid you will have to be aggrieved, be subjected to ridicule,

33
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,980
and will have to suffer.

34
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,380
Ever since becoming a slanderer, I've been ridiculed every day.

35
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,590
I've have long gotten used to it.

36
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,630
Using tea as wine, I toast Young Master.

37
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,170
This Young Master Ning can act well.

38
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,160
If you didn't tell me earlier, I would have almost believed it.

39
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,820
Just that he is aggrieved by descending from his level to put on this show.

40
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,800
Looks like both of you chatted well together that night at the teahouse.

41
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,060
Yes, he even asked me other things.

42
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,330
What things?

43
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,170
He asked me about our marriage.

44
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,290
Marriage?

45
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,040
He asked me if our marriage was real

46
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,340
or fake?

47
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,410
Then, what did you say?

48
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,520
I told him...

49
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,400
it is fake.

50
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,170
Fake. Fake.

51
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,250
It's you and Young Master Ning who are a match made in heaven,

52
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,050
a perfect pair, the ideal couple.

53
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Our marriage is fake, then you and him...

54
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,510
Looks like our suave heir apparent is jealous.

55
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,370
I'm not.

56
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,190
I told him that now it is fake, but that I didn't know about the future.

57
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,610
Your reply is good.

58
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,320
Your Highness, is your illness getting better?

59
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,930
It's no longer a hindrance.

60
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,040
Do you resent this life?

61
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,340
No resentment. I believe in fate.

62
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,430
If it is not fate?

63
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,210
It's also fate.

64
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,460
Doctor Jun is back.

65
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,980
Why not let her check your pulse?

66
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,160
No need.

67
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,910
I know my illness well.

68
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,870
Are you worried that I will cause trouble for her?

69
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,930
You do know, then why did you still ask me?

70
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,440
Jiuling, I bought some good food.

71
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,720
- Where's Jiuling?
- I didn't come here to fight with you.

72
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,990
I asked you where's Jiuling!

73
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,110
Zhu Zan.

74
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,940
- Why are you here?
- Prince Huai is ill.

75
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,050
- What illness?
- As for what illness,

76
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,420
you have to go and see yourself to find out.

77
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,480
Lu Yunqi.

78
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,670
Do you think anybody can be used as a tool to threaten others?

79
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,680
Why are you so sure

80
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,650
I will use Prince Huai to threaten you?

81
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,880
Prince Huai is my patient. If anything happens to him,

82
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,140
it will ruin Jiuling Hall's reputation. I will not let it happen.

83
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,550
To cure or not, it's your choice.

84
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,390
If you've decided, look for me anytime.

85
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,730
- Lu Xiaozao!
- Zhu Zan.

86
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,150
Don't worry, I'll go and inquire.

87
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,850
All right.

88
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,500
- What happened to Rong'er?
- His Highness is fine.

89
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,690
Evil! Such a young child,

90
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,800
you all could imagine doing this?

91
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,990
Huang Cheng thought of it.

92
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,620
Huang Cheng?

93
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,920
You are thinking of using Rong'er to go against Duke Cheng, right?

94
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,340
Did you all think that

95
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,260
Duke Cheng was my Imperial Father's henchman?

96
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,220
But Imperial Father is dead.

97
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,870
What exactly do you want to do?

98
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,070
Yes or no, try and you'll know.

99
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,220
Lu Yunqi.

100
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,810
If you only target Duke Cheng, you won't take action.

101
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,310
So,

102
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,960
you want to take the opportunity

103
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,990
to force Jun Jiuling, right?

104
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,920
Do you also think that this will force her?

105
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,120
She's a good physician.

106
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,870
She will not...

107
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,380
will not, when it comes to her patients,

108
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,540
sit back and do nothing.

109
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,380
This matter was not originally for the sake of Jiuling,

110
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,560
but now to me...

111
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,160
this cooperation is for her.

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,110
Whatever the cost,

113
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,300
Prince Huai Residence will not let Zhu Zan

114
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,830
enter with Jun Jiuling.

115
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,320
Prince Huai was said to be possessed by evil spirits and therefore needs to be sent to the Imperial Mausoleum.

116
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,610
He can only be safe with our ancestors' blessings.

117
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,370
His Majesty already knows about it, and it will be discussed in the Imperial Court tomorrow.

118
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,340
If everything turns out as planned, Prince Huai will leave the capital tomorrow.

119
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,080
- This soon?
- I was going to go in and see

120
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,790
if what they said was true,

121
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,390
but Lu Yunqi has many people there. If I broke in there, it would only cause more trouble.

122
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,680
I understand. But this time I don't think their target is Jiurong,

123
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,620
but to see whoever opposes it at this moment.

124
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,530
It will be the adherents of the late emperor.

125
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,510
Zhu Zan, go back and tell Duke Cheng

126
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,570
not to oppose it at all in the Imperial Court tomorrow.

127
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,710
What about Jiurong?

128
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,090
Come up with a way so that Jiurong and I can meet.

129
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,720
I want to see if it's true with my own eyes.

130
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,390
It's just that if Duke Cheng opposes it this time,

131
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,130
Chu Rang will have evidence to hold on to, which is very dangerous.

132
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,900
Zhu Zan, I know how hard it is for you to choose now

133
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,990
between me and your father.

134
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,040
I'll make the decision for you.

135
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,690
Chu Rang has made up his mind

136
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,710
to send Jiurong to the Imperial Mausoleum. Any objections will be pointless.

137
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,820
I can't let Duke Cheng take such a risk at the moment.

138
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,670
Jiuling, Prince Huai is affected by evil spirits.

139
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,580
You should be sadder than I am, but you care about me.

140
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,770
Jiuling, don't worry.

141
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,780
I swear on my life to make sure Jiurong is safe.

142
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,640
Zan'er, have you heard of the matter with Prince Huai?

143
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,610
Father, I was going to discuss it with you.

144
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,760
This is Huang Cheng's trick and also His Majesty's test.

145
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,850
When it's discussed in the Imperial Court tomorrow morning,

146
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,830
don't endorse or oppose it. Just keep quiet.

147
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,620
On the way to the Imperial Mausoleum, I'll tell Jiuling

148
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,500
to treat Jiurong at the right time.

149
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,290
Understood.

150
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,550
I'll make a decision on this.

151
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,600
His Majesty is unbelievable.

152
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,090
He cares so much when the person's gone. He makes himself busy with the kid.

153
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,290
He has a guilty conscience.

154
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,990
In the bureaucratic jungle,

155
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,940
whether it's a kid doesn't matter. They're all the same.

156
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,600
My Lord, Duke Cheng sent a card over, saying he'd like to see Prince Huai.

157
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,230
He also traveled with many Zhu Family troops.

158
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,390
Everyone's guessing if he endorses or opposes it.

159
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,860
Surprisingly, he came all the way here to pay a visit.

160
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,140
My Lord, so do we let him in?

161
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,780
If he wants to come in, then let him in.

162
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,150
My Lord, are we really going to let him in?

163
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,870
They've achieved the goal of their plan.

164
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,650
Isn't this their desired outcome?

165
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,280
Yes.

166
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,440
Take your time.

167
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,240
Master, I saw with my own eyes

168
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Duke Cheng enter Prince Huai Residence.

169
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,630
Okay. Understood.

170
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,940
Master, then... what should we do?

171
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,320
Everyone knows about Duke Cheng because of Prince Huai.

172
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,670
I don't think his power

173
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,290
can last long.

174
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,050
Your Majesty, I think we should keep with tradition

175
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,800
and send Prince Huai to the Imperial Mausoleum to get blessings from the ancestors,

176
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,590
and keep Your Majesty safe.

177
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,310
What do other courtiers think?

178
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,980
Your Majesty, please rest assured. I just saw Prince Huai.

179
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,960
He was doing fine. He could speak clearly despite being very sick.

180
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,460
Maybe he wasn't affected by his illness at that moment.

181
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,640
Young Lady Jun has gone over there to take a look.

182
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,450
We should know whether it's serious or not very soon.

183
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,060
Young Lady Jun is just a physician, not a psychic.

184
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,460
If Prince Huai is sick, shouldn't we summon Imperial Physicians?

185
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,930
Lord Tan, even if Prince Huai wasn't infected with any illness,

186
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,470
but affected by some evil spirit,

187
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,490
I think in order to get rid of evil spirits,

188
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,390
keep him here in the Imperial City instead of sending him to the Imperial Mausoleum.

189
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,970
Your Majesty is the son of God, so any evil spirits

190
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,430
will stay away from you.

191
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,100
Of course, we can actually counter it.

192
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,160
Evil spirits are afraid of a murderous aura. The soldiers under my command have been on the battlefield and have the most murderous aura.

193
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,930
We can pick those with the most murderous aura to stand guard at Prince Huai Residence.

194
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,570
Of course, the final decision

195
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,500
is up to Your Majesty.

196
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,320
We'll wait till the heir apparent's wife is done seeing him

197
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,880
to discuss it further.

198
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,210
Everyone, is there anything else to report?

199
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,550
Thank you, Your Majesty, for sending us more manpower.

200
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,160
The celebration annal for the capital has been completed without any hitches.

201
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,530
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

202
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,320
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

203
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,040
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

204
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,990
Okay.

205
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,210
Doing your job well

206
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,170
is the greatest reward for me.

207
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,390
Is Prince Huai okay?

208
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,130
Thanks to Duke Cheng,

209
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,850
their trick didn't succeed.

210
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,510
We must be careful from now on.

211
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,430
Someone may threaten us with Jiurong again.

212
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,970
Poor thing.

213
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,380
Now isn't time to tell them the truth.

214
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,750
When it's time, I'll tell my sister and Rong'er.

215
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,390
You see? That day you gave me a look and I knew what you meant.

216
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,630
Am I not amazing?

217
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,140
Yes, you are.

218
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,340
Let me feed you candied fruit as a reward.

219
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,410
Let's go.

220
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,480
Wow!

221
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,520
Lanterns.

222
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,810
Let's go look.

223
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,710
Young Master, are you choosing a lantern?

224
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,460
Exactly.

225
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,990
Choose this one. A Mandarin duck lantern with a great meaning.

226
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,750
It blesses the long-lasting loving relationship between you and your wife.

227
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,960
Good! The meaning's great! Let's buy it.

228
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,610
All right. I'll get it for you.

229
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,480
Here.

230
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,790
Money.

231
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,150
She's in charge of the money.

232
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,170
Sure.

233
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,660
He's my brother.

234
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,120
Take care.

235
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,210
Don't make a joke like this.

236
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,740
You didn't tell me the truth either.

237
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,340
You didn't tell me what you did with my Hurricane Lily.

238
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,490
Nothing really.

239
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,420
You just went to my grave

240
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,980
and put it there on purpose.

241
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,180
I followed you around and heard everything.

242
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,230
Also, I saw you cry your eyes out.

243
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,240
There are so many people here. Keep it low. Keep it low.

244
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,530
When I'm not around, you say so many sweet words.

245
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,000
Now you don't say anything.

246
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,470
Do you want me to repeat what I said that day in front of so many people?

247
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,300
Sure.

248
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,950
Jiu–

249
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,520
Are you serious? Let's go.

250
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,470
Whoa!

251
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,250
Slow down! Be careful you don't fall!

252
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,900
Are you happy?

253
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,760
Not happy.

254
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,430
Look at the fish in this lake. They're made for each other...

255
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,820
like us both.

256
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,730
Put me down.

257
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,180
- Put me down!
- Okay.

258
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,480
Here. Be careful.

259
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,300
All right. Take a break. You must be exhausted.

260
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,110
Here. Sit down.

261
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,970
If you had told me in Zezhou,

262
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,000
we would've recognized each other sooner.

263
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,920
I definitely would've protected you from any danger.

264
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,500
The tasks that I had to do in Zezhou were a matter of life and death.

265
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,950
How could I allow you to get involved?

266
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,730
In addition,

267
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,550
who knew that you were so stubborn and clingy like a dog skin plaster?
(Herbal medicines smeared onto dog skin were used as adhesive plasters)

268
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,620
Can't shake you off.

269
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,510
So it seems that we weren't fated to meet at the beginning.

270
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,230
It is a long-awaited reunion after being separated by thousands of miles.

271
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,510
It's the kind of fate that can still bring us together

272
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,330
after many twists and turns.

273
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,650
That is so mushy.

274
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,650
Actually in the beginning, I

275
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,070
wanted to push you away every time.

276
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,650
I didn't want you to get near me.

277
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,200
But I don't know when I started to...

278
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,570
realize...

279
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,080
that you've become the one I wanted to see every moment,

280
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,120
the one I think of every moment.

281
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,120
My eyes light up when I see you.

282
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,910
My heart feels empty when I don't see you.

283
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,410
I...

284
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,280
When did I become such an important person?

285
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,370
Jiuling, do you know...

286
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,890
there's no need to arrange all matters to perfection, for us to be together.

287
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,380
There are not many perfect situations in this world.

288
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,380
What if...

289
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,630
What if we had missed each other?

290
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,620
Have you considered that?

291
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,100
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

292
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:54,580
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

293
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,910
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

294
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,310
Do you know what kind of person you are to me?

295
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,160
♫ With many tomorrows to come ♫

296
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,400
You are a cheeky and flippant person.

297
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,720
Also, someone who pretends it's nothing

298
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,430
in dangerous situations.

299
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,530
You are the one who accompanies me all the way,

300
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,290
and saves me from all kinds of peril.

301
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,420
Also someone willing to come with me from the North to the capital,

302
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,810
just to let see the Northern Hurricane Lily.

303
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,480
♫ If memories could speak ♫

304
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,660
♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

305
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,970
If you ask me...

306
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,520
when the happiest time in my life is,

307
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,020
I will say...

308
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,610
that it's when you are around.

309
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,180
Therefore...

310
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,690
♫ With many tomorrows to come,

Mother.

312
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,060
- Mother.
- Jing'er, hurry.

313
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,880
Coming.

314
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,510
Let's go see the lanterns.

315
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,160
Mother, let's go see the lanterns.

316
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,410
Careful. Watch your sister.

317
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,650
Take care.

318
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,150
Jing'er, slow down.

319
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,110
Let's go.

320
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,510
- Let's go.
- Slow down.

321
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,540
Therefore?

322
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,880
Therefore,

323
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,780
I wish we can be like them.

324
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,910
- Together forever.
- The husband sings and the wife follows.

325
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,700
Lift the tray to the brow.

326
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,880
♫ The vast sky is you and the wind is me ♫

327
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,530
♫ Going through the bottom of my heart ♫

328
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,500
♫ Has God ever asked for clues about the wind? ♫

329
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,450
♫ If I could write down how much I miss you ♫

330
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,400
♫ It would drift like the rain  ♫

331
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,700
♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

332
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,940
I want to have a sugared fruit.

333
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,920
So sweet.

334
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,580
Am I sweet or is the sugared fruit sweet?

335
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm sweet.

336
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,210
♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

337
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:51,340
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

338
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,790
Your Majesty, I was mistaken. I ask for your punishment.

339
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,890
Are you getting senile?

340
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,760
I am asking you how to explain the matter regarding Prince Huai.

341
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,360
Your Majesty, Prince Huai–

342
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,030
Reporting to Your Majesty, Commander Lu requests to see you.

343
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,520
- Announce him.
- Yes.

344
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,230
- You may go first.
- Yes.

345
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,730
Your Majesty,

346
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,210
Why did I hear from Huang Cheng that

347
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,110
those refugees were financed by Da Shengchang?

348
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,560
Not by Duke Cheng.

349
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,710
Is that correct?

350
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,800
I... do not know how to say it.

351
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,630
Do you not know or do you not want to say it?

352
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,640
Reporting to Your Majesty, the refugees were indeed undertaken by Da Shengchang.

353
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,860
As for whether Duke Cheng was involved,

354
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,020
I dare not speak further of it.

355
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,760
Since the Fang family and Duke Cheng are of the same family now.

356
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,980
Jun Jiuling?

357
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,760
Reporting to Your Majesty. Providing relief to the victims of the North, building weapons and armor.

358
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,730
These were financed by De Shengchang.

359
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,990
Because of this, the seventeen branches of money exchanges run by De Shengchang are out of reserves.

360
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,650
What?

361
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,490
Why did you report such a huge matter only now?

362
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,610
Your Majesty, you once commanded

363
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,110
not to investigate De Shengchang's business.

364
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,490
- That's why I dare not make a move.
- All right!

365
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,480
In the future, you must report everything regarding De Shengchang

366
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,780
ahead of time.

367
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,860
Yes.

368
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,930
Get the proprietor of De Shengchang here, I want to see him right away.

369
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,230
Say that I want to reward him.

370
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,600
This Jun Jiuling...

371
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,880
should no longer be allowed a presence here.

372
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,530
Your Majesty has decreed to award De Shengchang for aiding the refugees.

373
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,200
Commanding Young Master to come to the capital for a meeting.

374
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,400
I am getting the feeling that this is to settle accounts after autumn.
(Idiom: to settle scores at an opportune moment)

375
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,270
Then...Young Master can feign sickness and not go to the meeting.

376
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,380
Evade it for the time being.

377
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,300
Attending the meeting or not is not our choice.

378
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,460
We have to choose...

379
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,860
whether to dare or not.

380
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,390
I don't if others dare or not,

381
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,610
but Chengyu will surely dare.

382
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:35,040
[Fulan Tea Parlor]

383
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,650
Uncle Yuan, what do you make of this matter?

384
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,570
It doesn't matter how I see it.

385
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,670
The critical part is how Imperial Brother sees it.

386
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,870
- Then how does he see it?
- Think of this.

387
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,530
One has power, the other has money.

388
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,470
And they are connected by marriage.

389
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,440
That would make anyone anxious.

390
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,240
Therefore the marriage needs to be disrupted.

391
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,950
The most simple way...

392
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,870
is to get rid of the person in the marriage.

393
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,970
You rascal are at least protected by your old man.

394
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,220
You also have martial arts, so you are clearly not the target.

395
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,020
- Therefore...
- It could only be Jun Jiuling.

396
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,420
I didn't say that.

397
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,210
Right after this morning's court, Imperial Brother saw Lu Yunqi alone.

398
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,790
Most likely it's related to this matter.

399
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,010
Although that Lu rascal is smitten with Miss Jun,

400
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,050
but an imperial command can not be refused. It's evident which one is more important.

401
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,170
You need to take precautions.

402
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,110
As long as I am around, Jiuling will not be allowed to get hurt.

403
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,330
How is it that you speak of her in such endearment?

404
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,390
She is my wife.

405
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,030
Why can't I speak of her with endearment?

406
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,250
Nothing. It's great.

407
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,640
Loving husband and wife.

408
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,930
But rascal, I need to say something.

409
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,790
I think that girl is quite fond of you.

410
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,840
If you really do like her,

411
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,120
then it must come from the heart.

412
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,710
I've met Miss Jun.

413
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,080
I also think she has a lot of

414
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,400
similarities to Princess Jiuling.

415
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,500
But just because you've lost the princess,

416
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,090
you cannot use her as a replacement.

417
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,910
It is very unfair to her.

418
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,730
Uncle Yuan, I understand.

419
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,610
Please be at ease.

420
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,880
To me, she is not a replacement.

421
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,170
She is the one and only.

422
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,040
The child is teachable.

423
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,300
Unexpectedly, you are actually serious when it comes to relationships.

424
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,060
You've inherited my traits.

425
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,260
That's enough, Uncle Yuan.

426
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,810
The number of women in your residence is comparable to the royal palace's.

427
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,690
There's something you don't know of.

428
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,290
Of all the water in the ocean, you only take one scoop.

429
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,750
For me, I am serious about drinking all the scoops. It's of no difference.

430
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,450
Uncle Yuan, seriously speaking.

431
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,980
Who made the suggestion to meet with the Young Master of De Shengchang?

432
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,580
Lu Yunqi or Huang Cheng?

433
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,010
Most likely it was Lu Yunqi.

434
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,700
After Huang Cheng left, he went to the royal study.

435
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,570
Not long after, Imperial Brother asked Yuanbao to write the decree.

436
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,040
I got it, Uncle Yuan.

437
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,330
I am going home to discuss it with my father. You leave after 15 minutes.

438
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,430
- Be cautious.
- Don't worry.

439
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,590
Mother, are you really letting Chengyu enter the capital? What if...

440
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,050
No. He's the last bloodline of the Fang family.

441
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,020
We must not let him take the risk. I will go.

442
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,340
Mother, I will go with you.

443
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,420
But His Majesty summoned Chengyu.

444
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,400
Grandmother. Mother. I fear you can't go.

445
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,010
Everyone knows that Chengyu is not in good health.

446
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,190
The excuse is a relapse of his old illness. He can't leave the bed.

447
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,500
Avoid this now and talk later if there are any troubles.

448
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,770
Grandmother. Mother.

449
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,950
I have everything packed and will leave after my meal.

450
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,400
Chengyu, we just discussed it with Mother.

451
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,100
Stay home. I will go with your grandmother to the capital.

452
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,470
How can we do this?

453
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,390
His Majesty proclaimed that I must go to the capital. I'm the only male in the family.

454
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,100
Besides, it's a long trip. Grandmother, you are old.

455
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,600
I will not let you take the risk again.

456
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,100
Chengyu, regarding this imperial summons,

457
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,810
we have no choice but to be wary.

458
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,230
Because of this reason, I must go and you should not.

459
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,330
Grandmother, you are the pillar of the Fang family.

460
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,360
I have never been the most important male in this family.

461
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,330
Without me, there's still you, Mother, and Older Sister.

462
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:08,450
The so-called successor is not me. It's the bloodlines of the Fang family instead.

463
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,890
It's our refusal to give up.

464
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,660
Moreover, they are unaware of how great the women of the Fang family are.

465
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,780
When they see me, they will definitely think I'm the most important person in the Fang family.

466
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,450
As such, by my entering the capital,

467
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,080
it can ensure the dignity of His Majesty,

468
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,450
and also, the sincerity of the Fang family.

469
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,430
Chengyu, you have grown up.

470
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:46,160
You should go out, take a look, and venture into the world.

471
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,100
Grandmother. Mother. Don't worry.

472
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,010
I know what to do and what to say.

473
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,750
Besides,

474
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,450
there's still Jiuling.

475
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,540
The memorial to request merit for Miss Jun has been written.

476
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,350
His Majesty summoned the young master of the Fang family.

477
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:20,530
It's obvious that he knows De Shengchang has been secretly helping the refugees from the North.

478
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,490
The merit is theirs. I should address this to His Majesty

479
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,690
and request merit for Miss Jun.

480
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:31,420
This is good. With this military exploits, even if His Majesty wants to touch the Fang family,

481
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,600
he needs to take the public's opinions into account, too.

482
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,970
So, everything was done by Miss Jun?

483
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:47,890
- She borrowed your name for convenience to do that?
- That's right.

484
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:52,110
So to say, the meritorious service for the Northern region should go to Miss Jun?

485
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,710
Did His Majesty praise the wrong person?

486
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,600
Lord Huang, why did you obliterate Duke Cheng's meritorious service?

487
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,120
If Duke Cheng didn't lead his strong soldiers to guard the Northern region and pledge their lives to fight the enemies,

488
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,080
no matter how amazing Miss Jun is, it would be hard for her to achieve anything without support.

489
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,250
Everyone is wrong. This is distinctly His Majesty's meritorious service.

490
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:20,440
His Majesty has great foresight. That's how he let Duke Cheng win the hearts of the people in the North and make contributions.

491
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,640
Without His Majesty's heavy reliance on trust, would Duke Cheng be who he is today?

492
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,280
The massive piles of impeachment memorials by the Censorate could crush Duke Cheng to death.

493
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,630
Yes. It's Your Majesty's meritorious service.

494
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,840
His Majesty is very benevolent and protects the people.

495
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,950
- Miss Jun did great meritorious service. Duke Cheng too.
- That's right.

496
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,940
Enough, stop arguing.

497
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,630
I understand.

498
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,640
Miss Jun has made contributions by doing all of this.

499
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,370
Of course, it's the same for Duke Cheng. This is natural.

500
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:04,410
Like what was said just now, everyone complemented each other.

501
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,790
It can't be achieved by a single person.

502
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,250
Your Majesty, I merely did my duty.

503
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,390
However, Miss Jun made great achievements not for the world to know.

504
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,280
I think Miss Jun...

505
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,440
should receive a reward.

506
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,190
Your Majesty, there's a clear distinction between rewards and punishments. As a wise ruler,

507
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,100
Miss Jun's meritorious service shouldn't be buried.

508
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,780
Your Majesty, I second this. One should receive merit for what has been done

509
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,820
and let the people know, lest we are led astray by blind faith.

510
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,110
Of course, one should be rewarded when need be.

511
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,320
Otherwise, how can we warm the hearts of those who render meritorious service?

512
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,790
She did make a contribution by treating smallpox.

513
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:51,030
I conferred her as the Commandery Princess of Shanyang.

514
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,070
As of today,

515
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,880
she will be promoted to a county princess.

516
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,290
Your Majesty is wise.

517
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,380
Greetings, Princess.

518
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,160
You already know?

519
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,930
When my father was discussing with his colleagues, I was there too.

520
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

521
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,640
Would you agree if I told you?

522
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,430
Duke Cheng has lost his military power. He won't be able to take it if he loses the hearts of the people.

523
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,820
I know you are opposing this because you want to protect my father.

524
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,950
However, my father consented to this in order to protect you, too.

525
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,310
Twelfth Royal Uncle said that His Majesty summoned Lu Yunqi yesterday.

526
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,510
I fear this will be disadvantageous to you.

527
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,270
He's most unwilling to see me be part of Duke Cheng's family.

528
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,350
Sabotaging the marriage alliance is the best way to eliminate me. Hence...

529
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,220
you have been staying here with me these past few days,

530
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,660
as you fear that they will secretly take action against me. Right?

531
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,360
Chu Rang doesn't know my identity. That's good, too.

532
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,820
However, Duke Cheng has always

533
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,180
been old friends with the late emperor. I fear he will be implicated.

534
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,220
So what if he knows? He has already given up his military power. What else does he still want?

535
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,910
Sometimes, one fears the hearts of the people more than military power.

536
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,950
Do you have any solution?

537
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,870
There's one for a county princess.

538
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,380
As for a royal princess, it's still far away.

539
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,510
