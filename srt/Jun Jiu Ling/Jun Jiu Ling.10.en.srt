♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,760
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,560
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,800
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,960
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,300
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,310
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,780
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:31,080
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

[Fang Residence]

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,950
Second Master, it's here.

21
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,660
Stop.

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Did you find out which room the young master is in?

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,720
He is in the one that Eldest Madam is in.

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,570
Eldest Madam even delivered medicine a few times to that room this afternoon.

25
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,590
Where are Jun Zhenzhen and her servant?

26
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,130
I haven't seen them.

27
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,240
Perhaps it's a cover-up.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,090
Young Madam may have taken someone with her to attract attention

29
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,310
while the person Eldest Madam is secretly taking care of, is the actual young master.

30
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,940
That sounds right.

31
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,490
I don't believe that a mother would abandon her own son.

32
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,320
Get moving!

33
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,230
Song Yunping, so it is you.

34
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,230
- Stop!
- Stop!

35
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,860
Song Yunping, why are you doing this?

36
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,770
The two of you worked together to scheme against me, is that right?

37
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,320
Why exactly are you doing this?

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,140
Why? Why am I doing this? I'm doing this for money.

39
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,640
Money? You want money?

40
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,910
You didn't want the half of De Shengchang that Father offered you,

41
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,280
the partnership that My Lord offered you, nor the honor that Mother offered you.

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,590
Song Yunping, you didn't want those yourself!

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,320
What you're offering me is not what I want.

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,250
I don't want the charity you give to me while you're riding high horses.

45
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,630
I've worked hard for De Shengchang my entire life;

46
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,020
yet, in the eyes of the Fang family, I'm still just a dog (slave)!

47
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,130
I'm bitterly disappointed at the words you just said.

48
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,610
What have you taken our kindness for?

49
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,330
Old thing, stop acting so innocent.

50
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,930
Chengyu isn't here, right? That is fine.

51
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,390
He won't be alive for much longer anyway. He'll die sooner or later.

52
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,240
Song Yunping, let me ask you.

53
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
Were you the one who poisoned Chengyu?

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,130
Then I'll tell you that I was the one who poisoned Chengyu.

55
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,280
Madam Su was also arranged by me. All of this was arranged by me!

56
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,530
You... You heartless thing!

57
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,620
You...

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,600
Song Yunping, you scoundrel!

59
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,810
How dare you do such outrageous things!

60
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,520
Lord Magistrate, everyone has heard what Song Yunping said.

61
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,910
Please seek justice for the Fang family.

62
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,710
Take him away!

63
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,950
According to the plan, Grandmother and Mother

64
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,330
should have exposed Madam Su and Shopkeeper Song by now.

65
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,880
Chengyu can walk now. When we return to Zezhou soon,

66
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,820
I believe he will be able to move like a normal person.

67
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,750
After this, I wonder if Grandmother will tell me the truth

68
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,480
if I ask about the seal.

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,380

[Jiuling Hall]

71
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
These medical books are really difficult to comprehend.

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,760
Look at these medical records and prescriptions.

73
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
These are too complicated.

74
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Jiuling, you must have worked hard to be able to treat all kinds of illnesses.

75
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,570
In the past, I studied medicine with my father and traveled everywhere.

76
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,290
Studying medicine is the same as doing other things.

77
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,990
You must work hard to gain surprisingly outstanding skills.

78
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,290
I'm also planning on learning to manage De Shengchang's business.

79
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,480
In the past, I was just someone kept behind closed doors,

80
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
nursing my health, and waiting for death.

81
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,120
I've never thought that I could do business

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,770
and take on the Fang family's important responsibilities.

83
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,090
What did you do when you were alone in the past?

84
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,820
Back then, besides reading,

85
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,420
there was actually not much to do.

86
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,290
Sometimes I thought about

87
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,790
the things I could do when I got better.

88
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,380
By the way, I also thought about

89
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,980
how I could take on the important responsibilities of the Fang family.

90
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,240
I wanted to learn about business like my grandfather and father did

91
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,180
so that the Fang family's business can prosper.

92
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,800
I also thought about holding up the entire Fang family,

93
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,000
so that the women of our family can be like those of other families,

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,620
never being worried or afraid.

95
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,630
Later on, I read a lot of books about business,

96
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,090
and looked at a lot of business accounts.

97
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,510
When we return to Zezhou this time,

98
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:53,660
you will definitely be able to help Grandmother and Mother hold up the family.

Let me see how you've recovered.

You're recovering very well.

106
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,530
Miraculous Physician Jun, my legs had been paralyzed for four to five years.

107
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,510
I originally thought that it was already extremely difficult

108
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,970
for me to even be able to walk again. But now, I'm even recovering my strength.

109
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,710
Now, I'm even able to lift boulders and walk for more than ten steps.

110
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,950
Let me show you now!

111
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,950
No need. I believe you.

112
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,900
It's just that you just recovered, so you must conserve your energy.

113
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,290
You're right, Miraculous Physician Jun.

114
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,140
In a few days, I will surely lift a boulder to cross through the city.

115
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,160
I want to let everyone know

116
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,140
that Jiuling Hall has the skills to bring a dying patient back to life.

117
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,110
Yes. I'm relieved to see that you've recovered so well.

I'm telling everyone that Jiuling Hall cures all.

Jiuling Hall can bring a dying patient back to life!

That's right. Physician Jun is miraculous!

A miraculous physician.

126
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,410
I'm... going to give it a taste.

- What meat is this?
- Here, Second Brother.

128
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,530
Dragon meat in Heaven, donkey meat on Earth.
(T/N: referring to differences in status/food)

129
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,990
Eat something else if you are not used to it.

130
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,610
It's your hometown food, of course I can eat it.

We can go back to Zezhou now.

Why did Shopkeeper Song get arrested?

I will tell you about it on the way back.

Did you find any clues from those people just now?

the master's letter said that Steward Gao is bringing men with him to come and get us.

160
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,350
If we change our route now, I am afraid we will miss him.

161
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,190
In my judgment, we should wait till we meet up with him to make a decision.

162
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,870
Yes, let's do that.

163
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,250
Get on the horses!

164
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,050
Elder Brother.

165
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,480
Since you're injured,

166
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,130
why don't you ride in the carriage together with us?

167
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,090
I'm fine.

168
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,320
Please do me a favor.

169
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,650
Second Young Lady, what is the point?

170
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,480
Almost all the boxes you have brought lately have been unopened.

171
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,210
You may as well save your time and effort.

172
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,460
Elder Sister has always been a picky eater. These are her favorite dishes.

173
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,410
It is great even if she eats a few bites.

174
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,960
Okay. I'll take it inside in a bit.

175
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,410
You'd better go now. If Old Madam sees you,

176
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,680
she'll scold us again.

177
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,460
I ask both of you to keep an eye on my sister.

178
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,650
Among the whole family, only Second Young Lady thinks of you.

179
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,260
She brought these for you. These are your favorite dishes.

180
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,700
Eat some.

181
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,460
I don't understand.

182
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,150
Mother,

183
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,570
why did you do that?

184
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,780
I always...

185
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,100
I have always been proud of the Fang family.

186
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,320
I always wanted to become a hero for the Fang family.

187
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:16,280
But in the end, I realized that not only am I not a hero,

188
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,120
but my mother was also the culprit who harmed the Fang family.

189
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,960
All my expectations

190
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,220
and dreams

191
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,660
have been destroyed.

192
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,030
They've been destroyed! Destroyed!

193
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,430
- Baotang, let's go.
- Okay.

194
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,050
- Young Master, is it really you?
- Steward Gao.

195
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,550
Have your legs really been cured?

196
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,260
They are cured. Jiuling cured them.

197
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,290
Jiuling?

198
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,050
Jiuling is Zhenzhen. She's changed her name.

199
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,260
Heavens have mercy.

200
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,720
Our Fang family has been given a miraculous physician as a daughter-in-law.

201
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,160
I have mentioned this in the letter to Grandmother before.

202
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,140
What is written in the letter and what I see in person are truly different.

203
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,990
Let me see.

204
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,390
- Young Master.
- Young Master, are your legs really cured?

205
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,560
- Let me see.
- Young Master, you're cured now.

206
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,870
- You're really cured now.
- I've recovered.

207
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,290
Your complexion looks good, too.

208
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,130
- This is great.
- We must show our gratitude to Jiuling.

209
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,010
You've truly recovered.

210
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,320
- Tell Madam.
- Young Master is really fine.

211
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,090
- Liu'er, come here.
- Much better.

212
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,020
Has your wound gotten any better?

213
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,790
I won't die.

214
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,060
How long do you plan to act like this?

215
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,220
Miss Jun, I've promised to escort you.

216
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,190
I'll keep my promise.

217
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,330
Don't worry about anything else.

218
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,330
Zhu Zan.

219
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,670
Zhu Zan,

220
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,740
fate tends to make a fool out of people.

221
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,530
If I could go back, I would not abandon you.

222
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,350
- Are you really fine?
- Young Master has really recovered.

223
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,660
- You've recovered.
- Great.

224
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,670
Old Madam Fang,

225
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,000
Song Yunping has been imprisoned for over a month.

226
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,340
We've used all the interrogation tactics.

227
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,940
He insists that nobody has given him orders.

228
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,130
It's all because of money.

229
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,770
It's pointless to keep interrogating him.

230
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,210
How about we put an end to the case?

231
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,100
Naturally, I shall listen to you, Lord.

232
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,720
Since we will put an end to this case,

233
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,870
I need all the family members to be present.

234
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,810
Right now, we are missing the young master.

235
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,530
I wonder when the young master will be back in Zezhou.

236
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,100
It's hard to say about their trip back.

237
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,990
Maybe soon.

238
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,530
It is better to be safe. When Young Master Fang is back,

239
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,210
you must remember to notify me,

240
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,180
so I can welcome him.

241
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Sure. Thank you, Lord.

242
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,160
It's my duty.

243
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,020
Then I won't disturb you anymore.

244
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,910
I'll take my leave.

245
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,260
Take care, Lord.

246
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,380
Stop!

247
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,730
Young Master, what is it?

248
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,050
Take another path.

249
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,100
Young Master, we agreed on this.

250
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,040
It's a safe signal, there's nothing ahead.

251
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,190
I think there is something.

252
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,190
- How do you know?
- The road narrows ahead,

253
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,610
it's the best location for an ambush.

254
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,020
Please trust him. His judgment has never been wrong.

255
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,890
Young Madam.

256
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,830
Do as Young Master says.

257
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,960
Let's go on another path.

258
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,280
How annoying.

259
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,070
Not only are they moving slowly,

260
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,300
but they're also turning

261
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,400
onto different routes randomly.

262
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,290
The people we arranged to go ambush them have failed to capture them multiple times.

263
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,340
Once bitten, twice shy.

264
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,620
This is how his father died back then.

265
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,840
He's afraid of repeating the same mistakes.

266
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,530
How cunning.

267
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,040
I had several talks with Old Madam Fang,

268
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,710
but I couldn't get anything out of her.

269
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,870
No matter how many paths they change, they must return here.

270
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,640
Even if there are tens of thousands of roads in this world,

271
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,450
he cannot avoid the path to Yanluo Hall (underworld).

272
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,860
Are you able to hang in there?

273
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,230
I can. I've hung in there for so many years now.

274
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,920
What's this bit of time going to do to me?

275
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,910
You have suffered.

276
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,940
If you hadn't been exposed,

277
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,440
I wouldn't have had to make such a hasty decision.

278
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,990
I put you in prison to find out the whereabouts of Fang Chengyu.

279
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,420
I will go wait for the news. I expect there will be news very soon.

280
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,030
They'll run out of paths to take soon enough.

281
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,450
Stop!

282
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,870
Miss Jun.

283
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,430
- What is it?
- The canyon ahead is a bit strange, but it's an unavoidable path.

284
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,290
We must pass through it.

285
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,180
Be careful.

286
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,930
Young Master Ling.

287
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
You be careful as well.

288
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,220
Fall in line. Surround Miss Jun's carriage so that it is at the center.

289
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,600
- Pass through the canyon.
- Yes.

290
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,740
It's the same as it was fourteen years ago.

291
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,630
Master Lei, protect Miss Jun.

292
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,280
- Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight!

293
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,730
Brave Warriors, you want money and we want to stay alive.

294
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,430
We'll give you 30,000 taels

295
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,320
to let us pass. What do you say?

296
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,990
Take all of their

297
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,260
money and lives!

298
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,440
Move aside.

299
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,640
Miss!

300
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,150
Master Lei, these were the people who hurt your right arm back then, right?

301
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,910
Yes. I finally meet them again.

302
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,570
Master Lei, if I can heal your right arm temporarily,

303
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,450
would you be willing?

304
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,190
As long as I can fight them in another battle, I'll die without regret!

305
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,330
Okay. Liu'er, get me the needles!

306
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,970
- Miss.
- Quick!

307
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,990
Young Madam, you chose me as your escort

308
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,740
to help me fulfill my wish, right?

309
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,530
Not exactly.

310
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,680
I just think that a person who still hasn't let this go in fourteen years

311
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,040
must be a very reliable person.

312
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,570
Protect Young Madam.

313
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,330
Yes!

314
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,480
Brothers, retreat!

315
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,720
Retreat!

316
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,670
Master Lei is a good man naturally blessed by the heavens.

317
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,820
It looks like his right arm has been saved.

318
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,410
Master Lei, you just used the Blue Lotus Rod Technique, right?

319
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,640
Young Madam, I, Lei Zhonglian, have no more regrets in this life

320
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,960
now that you have let me demonstrate my technique again.

321
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,100
How is it? Is everyone all right?

322
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,820
I think these bandits must have reinforcements.

323
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,690
- Everyone must be careful.
- These aren't bandits.

324
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,560
They're official troops impersonating them.

325
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,260
- That's why they're so brave.
- That's right.

326
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,580
They're the same people who robbed and killed Master back then.

327
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,500
- They're definitely not ordinary mountain bandits.
- That is right.

328
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,570
Only official troops would scream out "Kill!"

329
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,600
It looks like we falsely blamed the Righteous Loyalty Services.

330
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,980
More people are coming.

331
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,190
Stop! Who are you?

332
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,800
Are you the ones who sent someone to tell us that you have encountered mountain bandits?

333
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,070
That's right!

334
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,060
We're a garrison from Huaiqing, responsible for suppressing bandits.

335
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,860
We came as soon as we got the report.

336
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,190
Soldiers of Huaiqing?

337
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,960
Who is your military commissioner?

338
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,430
Who is your military trainer? Where is your post?

339
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,450
Who is your chief commander?

340
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,730
Do you have bandit suppression records?

341
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,630
Baiheliang Mountain

342
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,330
is full of bandits who set fires, kill, and rob. They commit many crimes.

343
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,790
Today there's another group of merchants from the Fang family, more than ten people in total,

344
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,610
that got ambushed and killed.

345
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,170
Ready!

346
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,100
The praying mantis has appeared. Where is the oriole?
(T/N : Idiom - The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind)

347
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,070
Surround these people!

348
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,570
Yes!

349
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,350
The Inspector-General's Bureau of Henan is here to investigate a case! We'll spare your lives if you surrender!

350
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,820
- Surrender and we'll spare your lives!
- Surrender and we'll spare your lives!

351
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,690
The plan my grandmother and I made has come to fruition.

352
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,180
The person behind it all will finally come to light now.

353
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,120
Who is the Young Madam of the Fang family?

354
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,460
Miss.

355
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,980
Young Madam.

356
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,440
Rest assured.

357
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,120
Lord.

358
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,970
Madam Fang Cao of De Shengchang said this matter is for you to decide.

359
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,560
Thank you, Lord.

360
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,970
Lord, please interrogate them well. Find out why they are here,

361
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,400
and who ordered them, so that the person behind this comes to light.

362
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,330
To seek justice for the wrong my Fang family has experienced over the past decade. Please do not let us down.

363
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,890
Young Master Fang, rest assured. We will do all we can.

364
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:23,850
[Your Majesty, Song Yunping is in prison and Madam Su is taken care of. The assassination attempt on Young Master Fang on his way back to Zezhou failed because of the Inspector General Bureau of Henan.]

365
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,350
Your Majesty, are you still worrying about the Fang family?

366
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,750
I thought this matter would end soon,

367
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,850
but, unexpectedly, the Fang family

368
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,250
has turned the tides once again.

369
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,230
You must go to Zezhou.

370
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,990
I do not want there to be any more trouble on Li Changhong's end.

371
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,120
Your Majesty, rest assured.

372
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,900
I'll make him and the Fang family

373
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,490
disappear.

374
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,850
After all the planning,

375
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,440
they still had to go through Baiheliang Mountain.

376
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,840
This time nothing could go wrong.

377
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,110
During a time of hopelessness, when they see reinforcements

378
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,660
sent from Heaven,

379
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,260
how happy they must be.

380
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,210
However, the result?

381
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,630
This time the Fang family will completely

382
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,440
withdraw from De Shengchang.

383
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,840
Lord, you have not had it easy, all for this day to come.

384
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,870
It's no exaggeration to say you've worked hard your whole life.

385
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:14,500
Wealth and glory are to be enjoyed for life

386
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,510
so, naturally, it is not easy to obtain.

387
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,060
I studied hard for ten years

388
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,510
before I could get an imperial title for half of my life.

389
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,510
I plotted for twenty years

390
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,770
before I could obtain enough wealth for my descendants.

391
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,310
I don't find it difficult.

392
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,510
I think God is very fair.

393
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,570
Lord, you're not arrogant or impatient.

394
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,920
Your perseverance is truly admirable.

395
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,040
Lord! Lord, not good.

396
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,190
The place... The place has been surrounded!

397
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,210
By order of the Military Commissioner

398
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,980
and the Prefectural Magistrate, the culprit Li Changhong shall be detained.

399
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,580
Whoever disobeys the order will be killed.

400
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,920
Lord.

401
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,860
[Zezhou]

402
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,260
Grandmother. Mother.

403
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,860
Chengyu,

404
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,680
you can walk now?

405
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm seeing this correctly, right?

406
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,130
Yes. I've recovered.

407
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,550
Good. Great.

408
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,790
It's good that you can walk now.

409
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,010
Everything is well now.

410
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,610
Grandmother,

411
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,350
now is not the time to talk.

412
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,930
Li Changhong has been jailed. We have to go over there soon to avoid trouble.

413
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,890
Okay. Zhenzhen, we'll go now.

414
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,990
Grandmother, Zhenzhen has changed her name.

415
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,330
From now on, she'll be known as Jun Jiuling.

416
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,450
That's right. You've mentioned it in the letter.

417
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,640
Jiuling.

418
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,030
You're reunited. Miss Jun,

419
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,740
I'll leave now.

420
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,000
Young Brother, be good.

421
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,730
We made it here safely all thanks to Young Master Ling. I—

422
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,590
No need. I've been paid.

423
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,590
Let's go. Let's go now.

424
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,220
Come on.

425
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,940
The Prefectural Magistrate said

426
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,710
according to the law, you're not allowed to see Li Changhong.

427
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,580
You've been the victims for three generations, so they made an exception.

428
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,060
You're allowed to see him before he's sent away.

429
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,150
You can also ask about the situation.

430
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,910
Thank you, Prefectural Magistrate.

431
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,120
Li Changhong! The Fang family has questions for you.

432
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,860
Li Changhong!

433
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,840
Lord! Lord, bad news.

434
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,130
Song Yunping was assassinated.

435
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,370
Open the door. Hurry!

436
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,800
Open the door!

437
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,080
