♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

3
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,560
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,550
♫ Journeying alone and cold,
the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

5
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,850
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

6
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Meeting an old friend,
we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,060
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

8
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,010
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement
with you to surge ♫

9
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:12,510
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,230
♫ The art of healing become edges used
to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

11
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,790
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

12
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:30,920
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world,
a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,810
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

15
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:51,030
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you
without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

[Jun Jiu Ling]

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,950
[Episode 22]

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,220
You are all helping Zhu Zan, thus disobeying the imperial decree.

20
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,180
You all must die.

21
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,340
Hold on.

22
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,960
Lord Lu, since you are here asking for his whereabouts,

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,630
you must already know that he's not here at Qingshan Court.

24
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,620
However, you are under an imperial decree to guard this place.

25
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,520
Now that someone is missing, it will be difficult for you to escape blame. Right?

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,430
Physician Jun, should I praise you for being a smooth talker

27
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,430
or should I convict you of the crime of inefficient treatments for patients?

28
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,130
Physician Jun has worked tirelessly and made lots of contributions. What crime has she committed?

29
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,910
Young Lord.

30
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,230
Xiao Zao, do you recognize these people?

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,060
- You actually brought them out.
- Since I am able to bring them out of the prison meant for those on death row,

32
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,080
then it shows I am acting on His Majesty's orders.

33
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,320
Xiao Zao, I have two imperial decrees with me now.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,540
What can you do to me?

35
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,940
Come.

36
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,440
Young Lord, this is...

37
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,180
They are children you can try the inoculation on.

38
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,170
What? Try the inoculation on these two children?

39
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,510
They are the descendants of Grand Guardian Zhou.

40
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,090
- But...
- If we send them back,

41
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,920
they will be beheaded. I requested an imperial decree.

42
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,530
His Majesty said that as long as they survive the inoculation,

43
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,720
they can escape death.

44
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,190
Come. Tell them. What are your names?

45
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,140
I am Zhou Jing from Zhending.

46
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,040
My grandfather is Zhou Bentang.

47
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,650
Z-Zhou Bentang?

48
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,550
Is it that traitor Zhou Bentang who colluded with the enemy?

49
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,350
Colluding with the enemy is a capital offense.

50
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,030
However, children are innocent after all.

51
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,430
My grandfather didn't collude with the enemy or commit treason.

52
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,120
No. Of course not.

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,400
He was set up.

54
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,150
All I am capable of...

55
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,450
is saving the two siblings.

56
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,450
Little ones,

57
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,200
inoculation is very dangerous. You...

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,950
Older Sister, just give us the inoculation.

59
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,950
Mao Mao, say something.

60
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,870
Older Sister, I want to try the inoculation.

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,920
Physician Jun, these children are so mature.

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,060
You must help them live.

63
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,790
That's right.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,140
Thank you for having faith in me.

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,610
I promise you...

66
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,560
that I and the rest of the physicians here will do our best to protect your lives.

67
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,210
Also, to not waste this older brother's efforts in

68
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,970
saving you from that prison by risking his life.

69
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,010
Physicians, I believe in all of your capabilities.

70
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,770
Please do your best.

71
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,460
That's our job.

72
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,020
Lord, do we really let them be?

73
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,680
They are descendants of Zhou Bentang.

74
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,400
I spoke out of line.

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,690
My Lord, will we still use the inflammable materials?

76
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,440
No.

77
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,470
Why are you here?

78
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,080
You haven't slept for a few days. I'm worried you're too tired.

79
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,120
You care that much about me?

80
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,280
That night when I was in excruciating pain,

81
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,560
you kept me company the entire night. Chen Qi also said

82
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,860
that you hadn't slept for days now.

83
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,140
Try it. I made it.

84
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,290
Even you risked your life to try the inoculation.

85
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,780
How could I fall asleep?

86
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,050
This battle is finally over.

87
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,300
We can have some rest. It's exhausting, isn't it?

88
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,330
Hurry and try it.

89
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,710
How is it?

90
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,330
This bowl of ginseng soup...

91
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,290
is the worst I've ever had.

92
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,910
Don't drink it then.

93
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,730
That's fine. There will be plenty,

94
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,570
plenty of opportunities.

95
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,150
Zhu Zan,

96
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,500
thank you.

97
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,510
Miss Jun,

98
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,310
don't develop inappropriate thoughts for me.

99
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,070
Physician Jun, thank you for saving my daughter and me.

100
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,030
I can't accept it. Please get up.

101
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,810
Physician Jun and other physicians

102
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,740
are benevolent, curing all diseases.

103
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,950
They're all miraculous physicians.

104
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,730
- Yes.
- Miraculous physicians.

105
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,980
Thank you, Older SisterJun.

106
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,620
Guo'er, Heaven was touched by your filial piety.

107
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,210
That's why you and your mother could recover so quickly.

108
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,080
From now on, Guo'er, you shall be the strongest kid.

109
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,750
Okay?

110
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,300
Physician Jun came up with a way to treat the pox.

111
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,290
The young lord personally tested the inoculation.

112
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,760
All the physicians spared no effort. Your kindness is beyond description.

113
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,860
We should kowtow to them for their help.

114
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,330
- Thank you, Physician Jun.
- Please get up.
- Everyone, get up.

115
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,020
Please get up.

116
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,850
Please get up.

117
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,440
Thank you, Young Lord, for saving me.

118
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,850
What I did for you was trivial.

119
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,670
The physicians behind me

120
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,470
are the true saviors.

121
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,560
You must learn from them.

122
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,250
Do you understand?

123
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,320
Everyone, you being well

124
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,080
is the greatest reward for us. I've promised before

125
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,050
to make sure you all go home safely.

126
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,240
So, ridding you of the suffering of the pox

127
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,340
is the greatest consolation to us.

128
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,560
Physician Jun, if it weren't for you all,

129
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,420
I would never have had a chance to see my family again.

130
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,000
I can't repay you enough for your kindness and what you have done.

131
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,790
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

132
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,780
There's no need for thanks. If you want to thank someone, you should thank yourselves.

133
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,140
It was your trust and perseverance

134
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,350
that lead to such positive results.

135
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,540
You all are the greatest contributors.

136
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,940
Yes. The young lord sacrificed himself for the sake of others.

137
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,050
Duke Cheng's generations of loyalty

138
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,920
is admirable indeed.

139
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,120
Now that everyone has recovered,

140
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,590
your family is waiting for you. Go home.

141
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,770
Thank you, Brother. Thank you, physicians.

142
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,180
Thank you, physicians.

143
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,340
- Hurry and go home.
- Let's go home.

144
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,990
Let's go home now. Go home.

145
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,240
- Let's go home.
- Thank you, physicians.

146
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,870
- Goodbye.
- Take care, physicians.

147
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,760
Let's go, too.

148
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,100
We're going home now.

149
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,810
Miss Jun.

150
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,810
Thank you.

151
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,360
You worked hard.

152
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,850
Thank you.

153
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,880
You worked hard.

154
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,630
Many people have already entered the city.

155
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,030
The people Young Master arranged for, have arrived.

156
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,890
They said they would come back today, but why isn't Miss back yet?

157
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,420
Where is she?

158
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,930
I don't know where Chen Qi is either.

159
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,230
He's dead when I see him!

160
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,030
I kept watching from the top of the city gate.

161
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,700
I didn't see Miss even with my eyes wide open.

162
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,080
Those physicians had a glorious welcome.

163
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,620
What about our number one heroine?

164
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,830
Where is Miss?

165
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,070
What should we do?

166
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,160
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,210
- You're back.
- Miss!
- Jiuling!

168
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,850
Miss.

169
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,900
Miss, when did you come back? Why didn't you come back with the others?

170
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,790
Why didn't you tell us in advance, so we could pick you up?

171
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,690
You're asking me so many questions at once. Which one should I answer first?

172
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,710
That's because I was worried about you and missed you very much.

173
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,300
Rest assured. Don't worry. I'm back, aren't I?

174
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,230
- Shopkeeper Liu.
- Young Lady Jun.

175
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,070
What did the Eldest Young Lady Fang say will happen to Chen Qi when she sees him?

176
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,370
He's dead!

177
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,150
It's my fault. I... won't worry you again.

178
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,300
Why didn't you let us know you were back? We were so worried.

179
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,140
Young Lady knew that Young Master was going to have a celebration to recognize her achievements.

180
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,630
We anticipated that when we entered the city, there would definitely be many citizens to welcome us.

181
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,840
She doesn't like such scenes, so we decided to return to the city on our own.

182
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,230
I'm just afraid that Chengyu's kind act will go to waste.

183
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,850
It won't. Whatever you do is right. Young Master won't blame you.

184
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,550
There's actually no need for a celebration in recognization of her achievements. Now that the pox is treated,

185
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,240
our Jiuling Hall will surely be well known.

186
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,880
That's absurd. Jiuling Hall stole the show.

187
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,570
Surprisingly, they succeeded only one day before His Majesty's deadline.

188
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,020
How great is it now? Even people from Ru'nan and Zezhou

189
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,970
have come all the way here with their kids to get inoculations from Jiuling Hall.

190
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,140
Inoculation is a serious matter,

191
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,260
which involves all the people.

192
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,110
How could such a small medicinal hall be in charge of it?

193
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,080
We should ask His Majesty to let Imperial Physicians Hall take over this matter.

194
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,810
That's right. After some time,

195
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,230
they'll think it's the Imperial Physicians Hall that is responsible for their inoculation.

196
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,280
However, that Jun Jiuling is not easy to deal with.

197
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,610
Will she be willing to tell us about the method of inoculation?

198
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,920
His Majesty will summon her in a few days to ask about the inoculation.

199
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,810
She's just an ordinary woman.

200
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,650
When facing His Majesty, she'll surely feel terrified and uneasy.

201
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,140
At that time, I will propose this matter in court.

202
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,920
I don't think she'll dare to say no in front of His Majesty.

203
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,250
That's right.

204
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,090
Miss, you must've been so tired, you've lost some weight.

205
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,060
Your favorite snacks. Eat some.

206
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,720
I'm fine. It's just that Chen Qi has suffered lately.

207
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,850
Without his help, I wouldn't have been able to handle it.

208
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,610
I did not help that much.

209
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,510
Thinking about it, our young master is so smart.

210
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,990
He held celebrations in recognition of your achievements in Ru'nan and Zezhou in advance.

211
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,910
He did it because he trusts you. He trusts you very much.

212
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,770
Ever since I left the Fang family, I've still caused my grandmother and aunt trouble.

213
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,090
I understand what it means. Other people with ulterior motives

214
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,230
can understand it, too.

215
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,000
What he did is too risky. If someone took advantage of him

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,430
and criticized the Fang family for this

217
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,020
by saying the Fang family is manipulating the people, it would be a serious crime.

218
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,830
You're right.

219
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,730
I have to write him a letter.

220
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,360
Young Lady Jun, if there's nothing I can help with, I'll go back now

221
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,670
to get ready for tomorrow's trip to the palace.

222
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,120
Thank you, Shopkeeper Liu.

223
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,620
All right.

224
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,160
Miss, don't worry. It'll be fine. We're going to the palace tomorrow.

225
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,180
Going to the palace this time, I can finally see Chu Rang again.

226
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,840
Horseback riding in the moonlight is supposed to be delightful, so why do you look so worried?

227
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,680
Are you still concerned about entering the palace?

228
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,930
Miss Jun,

229
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,980
what's your purpose in entering the palace?

230
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,630
Sometimes I feel like I've known you for a long time. It feels quite familiar.

231
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,640
But when I see you clearly, you're hidden among many secrets

232
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,770
as if you're wrapped up in the fog.

233
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,920
It's blurry.

234
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,920
I came back to the capital for revenge,

235
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,290
for Princess Jiuling

236
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,310
and for my father.

237
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,060
You've finally opened up to me.

238
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,540
I know that you have many secrets.

239
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,290
That's fine.

240
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,540
From now on, if you don't say it, I won't ask you.

241
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,770
But whatever you want to do,

242
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,340
I'll be with you.

243
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,560
♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

244
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,310
♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

245
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,350
♫ Allow me to weigh every word
forindescribable cause and effect ♫

246
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,370
♫ Allow me to weigh every word
for indescribable cause and effect ♫

247
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,450
♫ Life is full of ups and downs and hard to be free ♫

248
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,180
♫ With many tomorrows to come,
I’m willing to entrust my whole life to you ♫

249
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,330
Fireflies.

250
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,490
"Rain cannot smother the fire.
(T/N: The poem "Singing Firefly" by Li Bai, a famous poet.)

251
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,570
As the wind blows, it becomes brighter.
(T/N: The poem "Singing Firefly" by Li Bai, a famous poet.)

252
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,640
If it flies high into the sky,
(T/N: The poem "Singing Firefly" by Li Bai, a famous poet.)

253
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,800
it'll surely become a star by the moon's side."
(T/N: The poem "Singing Firefly" by Li Bai, a famous poet.)

254
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,050
Fireflies are truly a great medicinal ingredient.

255
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:33,290
♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

256
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,630
With a beautiful view in front of you, you can only think of medicine?

257
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:44,260
That's right. Fireflies can cleanse your liver and improve your vision. A great medicinal ingredient it is indeed.

258
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,110
You're truly not an ordinary woman.

259
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,850
Then, what is an ordinary woman like?

260
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,740
"Wow, such beautiful fireflies!"

261
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,410
Forget it. So disgusting. I can't take it.

262
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,720
Young Lady Jun, when it comes to the inoculation, nobody can compare with you.

263
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,080
Why do you want me to enter the palace with you?

264
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,610
Because there are things that even I can't do.

265
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,430
Physician Feng, rest assured. There's no need to be anxious.

266
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,010
Physician Jun, entering the palace is a serious matter.

267
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,920
Why are you not nervous at all, as if you're returning to your home?

268
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,120
Physician Jun, please.

269
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,090
- Let's go.
- Okay.

270
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,100
I, Jun Jiuling, greet Your Majesty.

271
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,400
Please rise.

272
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

273
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,900
Your success in treating the pox at Qingshan Court

274
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,600
is just like a victory in war, a great honor of our nation.

275
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,500
Having made such a great contribution, I should reward you heavily.

276
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,000
I dare not take credit.

277
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,800
Treating pox successfully is due to the right time, the right place, and the right people.

278
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,800
First, Your Majesty showed grace by delivering materials. Heaven being touched, gave us this opportune time.

279
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,000
Qingshan Court is spacious, making it easy to separate and treat patients. That was the right place.

280
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Meanwhile, many physicians

281
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,200
and the young lord, who willingly tried the inoculation, helped. Those were the right people.

282
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
How humble you are.

283
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,600
You came up with the inoculation,

284
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,700
so you should take the credit.

285
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Your Majesty, there is something

286
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I would like to ask Physician Jun to enlighten me about.

287
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,200
These useless things come forward when there is a reward.

288
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,500
Forget it. I'll see how she handles it.

289
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
- Go ahead.
- Your Majesty,

290
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,800
the method of treating pox is a fortune for our nation.

291
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,700
However, not many know how to perform the inoculation,

292
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,850
and most of them are here in the capital.

293
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,800
How to promote it in every region

294
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
needs to be discussed.

295
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,400
What suggestions do you have?

296
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,000
I believe the Imperial Physicians Hall can be responsible for this matter.

297
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,600
Every medicinal hall can send someone to the capital to learn the method of inoculation,

298
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,300
under Physician Jun's supervision.

299
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,000
Those who pass shall return home and promote it so that our people

300
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,400
can avoid suffering from smallpox.

301
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,000
Your Majesty, I agree with what Imperial Physician Jiang has said.

302
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
What does Physician Jun think?

303
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Your Majesty,

304
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,200
I disagree.

305
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,120
Miss Jun is most likely meeting His Majesty in the palace now.

306
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,800
After treating the pox this time,

307
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm curious to see how those people from Imperial Physicians Hall will give her a hard time.

308
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,600
It's hard to give her a hard time.

309
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
She knows what to say in front of different people.

310
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,160
During Miss Jun's meeting with His Majesty, I'm afraid those from Imperial Physicians Hall

311
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,200
will steal her method of inoculation.

312
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,000
If that's the case,

313
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,400
do you think Miss Jun will give the method away or not?

314
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,600
- Yes.
- No.

315
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,400
Jiuling Hall is just an ordinary medicinal hall.

316
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,800
Imperial Physicians Hall is set up by the Imperial Court.

317
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,000
Whom the smallpox treatment belongs to

318
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,700
and what His Majesty thinks are easy to guess.

319
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,020
Miss Jun is powerless, so it will be very difficult for her to refuse.

320
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,400
But if she gives it away,

321
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,800
then she won't be who she is.

322
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Physician Jun, are you unwilling to make your methods public?

323
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,200
Imperial Physician Jiang, physicians find honor in treating the people.

324
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,000
Of course, I'm willing to make my methods public.

325
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
Even more so, I'm willing to have all physicians come here to learn.

326
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
But...

327
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Not through the Imperial Physicians Hall, but through the physicians who've been to Qingshan Court.

328
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,600
Are you saying you don't trust Imperial Physicians Hall?

329
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Imperial Physician Jiang, you have misunderstood.

330
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,900
Inoculation requires practical learning.

331
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,300
It cannot be taught orally.

332
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,100
However, the epidemic in the capital is now over.

333
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:00,200
Unless there's another epidemic and the physicians from Imperial Physicians Hall learn from that, then they can promote it.

334
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,200
- How could that be acceptable?
- How absurd!

335
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,400
She does not know what's good for her!

336
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,400
Your Majesty, that's why

337
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I cannot agree with what Imperial Physician Jiang said.

338
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,600
She isn't nervous at all here at the great hall. I can't underestimate her.

339
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,600
What do you think we should do then?

340
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Your Majesty, Physician Feng

341
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,400
is a famous physician who has run a medicinal hall in the capital for years. He's very reputable.

342
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Also, Physician Feng has made irrefutable contributions to the treatment of pox this time.

343
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,200
I recommend Physician Feng take charge in the evaluation and promotion of the smallpox treatment.

344
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
The regional government offices can send physicians here to learn.

345
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,400
Let Physician Feng lead physicians who know how to treat the pox to teach classes.

346
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,400
You created this smallpox treatment.

347
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,800
It would be better for you to be in charge.

348
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,700
Your Majesty, I am young.

349
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,600
This is an important task, and it would be difficult for me to convince others.

350
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,300
Besides, Physician Feng has more experience in inoculation than I.

351
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,200
At such a young age, she understands the concept of avoiding danger and being modest?

352
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,020
Approved.

353
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,800
However, you must take the post of supervisor.

354
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
I shall obey.

355
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.

356
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,380
Please rise.

357
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
This is not my reward for you.

358
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
If you want to thank someone, thank her.

359
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Physician Jun, how outstanding you are.

360
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,200
You're young, but you don't take credit or get arrogant.

361
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,200
You are not simple.

362
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,800
Chu Rang is skeptical in nature.

363
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,400
If I don't request anything, I'll certainly make him suspicious of me.

364
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,400
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

365
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,100
Actually,

366
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I do have a small request.

367
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,400
I hope Your Majesty can make it happen.

368
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,800
Tell me about your request.

369
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,400
I shall make sure you are content.

370
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,200
I don't care about money.

371
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
But if Your Majesty could bestow me a title,

372
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,400
I would do my ancestors proud who practiced medicine for generations.

373
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
How dare you!

374
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,200
You're just a small female physician. How dare you ask for a title?!

375
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,600
His Majesty is benevolent. Do you think you can be outrageous

376
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,400
and ask for anything just for treating the pox?

377
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,400
I was being absurd.

378
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Your Majesty, please punish me.

379
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,600
Lord Huang, no need to be so angry. I think

380
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,000
Physician Jun's request is reasonable.

381
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll confer you as County Princess (Princess of the Fourth Rank ).

382
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,400
Your title shall be... Shanyang.

383
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,500
I, commoner Jun Jiuling, thank Your Majesty.

384
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,300
Physician Jun, you're no longer a commoner.

385
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,700
I, County Princess Shanyang,

386
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,500
thank Your Majesty for your grace.

387
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,600
Your Majesty,

388
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,200
the princes and princesses are waiting for Physician Jun to give them the inoculation.

389
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Go ahead.

390
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,400
[Red Phoenix Gate]

391
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,100
Physician Jun, they're here.

392
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,900
Miss Jun.

393
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
Physician Feng, I shall go see you tomorrow about the matter of inoculation.

394
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,000
All right. I'll take my leave now.

395
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,900
Thank you.

396
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Older Sister, I missed you so much!

397
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,800
I missed you very much, too.

398
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,900
What is it? Why do you want to see me today?

399
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
Get up.

400
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
What is it?

401
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,710
Older Sister, we're leaving.

402
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,840
Don't worry. Everything has been arranged and settled.

403
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,500
Zhou Jing. Mao Mao.

404
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,800
Remember that when I'm not by your side,

405
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
you need to learn how to take care of yourselves.

406
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,990
Do you understand?

407
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

408
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,200
I'll always remember your courage and kindness

409
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,500
when you were at Qingshan Court. Remain that way in the future.

410
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,000
Miss Jun, if you are so reluctant to let them leave,

411
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,200
why don't you take them as your godsons?

412
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,000
Can I call you godmother?

413
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,600
Then you're my godfather.

414
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,000
Then you're my godmother.

415
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,200
- Godfather.
- Godmother.

416
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Nonsense.

417
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,000
It's getting late, they have to get on the road.

418
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
Come on.

419
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,600
Say goodbye to your godfather and godmother.

420
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,700
- Godfather. Godmother. Take care.
- Godfather. Godmother. Take care.

421
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,200
- Let's go.
- Take care.

422
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,100
Say, am I that old? He called me Godfather.

423
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,410
What's wrong?

424
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,690
Nothing.

425
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,670
Suddenly, I just...

426
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,570
I just suddenly want to cry.

427
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,800
Is there something you want to tell me?

428
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,600
No.

429
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,700
This Jun Jiuling is a bit different from what people say.

430
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,400
Based on you're understanding of her,

431
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,100
was she acting or being her true self at the imperial court?

432
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,100
I think it's fake.

433
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,760
Although I did not have many

434
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,400
encounters with her at Qingshan Court,

435
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,100
from what I know,

436
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,600
she is normally even more rude and daring.

437
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:22,000
Her words and actions today clearly show her longing for power and influence.

438
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,400
What's your opinion on that?

439
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,000
She dares to have such a request in the great hall.

440
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,200
I think that's what she truly wants.

441
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,200
Have all the princes been inoculated?

442
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,800
Your Majesty, besides the third prince,

443
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,400
the rest of the princes and princesses have been inoculated.

444
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,800
The Third Prince has had a cough lately.

445
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,600
Physician Jun said you have to be healthy before being inoculated.

446
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,200
Therefore, we must wait until the Third Prince recovers from his cough before he can get inoculated.

447
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,300
All the physicians have learned almost everything except for Physician Liu.

448
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,000
There are two more who are not as well-versed in inoculations.

449
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,900
After a few more days of practicing, they can return home as well.

450
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,600
It looks like everything is going well.

451
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,800
Yes.

452
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,800
What are they looking at up ahead? It's so lively there.

453
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Today is the 18th of the third month.
(T/N: lunar calendar)

454
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,600
The imperial court examination results have been published.

455
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
- Is the Ministry of Rites' grand exam over?
- Yes.

456
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Wonder how Young Master Ning has done. Miss, let's go and take a look.

457
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,800
Then, I'll go check on Physician Liu.

458
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,200
- Thank you, Physician Feng.
- No problem.

459
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,900
Let's go.

460
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,700
- Excuse us, excuse us.
- Look! Look, my name is there!

461
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,800
I passed!

He got in!
 [Third place : Ning Yunzhao ]

463
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,800

465

Even though you didn't get the first place,

466
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,200
until the palace exam, nothing is set.

467
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,100
Yes.

468
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,200
I won't criticize these writings.

469
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Revise it and wait for my return to discuss it in detail.

470
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,060
Yes, Uncle.

471
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,600
Xiao Ding, how's Qingshan Court?

472
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Young Master, you were busy with the exam a couple of days ago. Master Ning wouldn't let me tell you.

473
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,800
Miss Jun successfully treated the pox and has come down from the mountain with everyone.

474
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,940
She always has had the ability to escape danger.

475

Is Miss Jun back at Jiuling Hall?

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,600
Yes.

477
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,800
Not only that, but His Majesty also summoned her.

478
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,400
His Majesty bestowed her the title of County Princess Shanyang.

479
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,600
Lord Ning was there, too.

480
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,600
He... didn't tell you?

481
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,200
Uncle doesn't like me to have anything to do with her, so of course, he won't mention it.

482
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,500
Then once Madam finds out,

483
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,400
she will cut my skin off.

484
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
Don't worry, I won't tell Mother.

485
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
Thank you, Young Master.

486
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,300
Young Master, there is a congratulatory gift for you.

487
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,000
Leave it.

488
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,000
Young Master, this is from Miss Jun.

489
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,600
[From Jun Jiuling]

490
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,600
Frank, open, and genuine, she is better than I.

491
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,200
All you students studied hard for dozens of years.

492
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,600
Here at the palace exam, you all are pillars of society.

493
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Ning Yunzhao is the best among the scholars.

494
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,800
He has brilliant literary talent and is thus, awarded as the top scholar.

495
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,660
The rest of you keep working hard.

496
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,000
Make the country prosperous and stable.

497
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,440
Look, there!

498
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,600
[Jiuling Hall]

499
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,900
Jinxiu, can I go out to get some air?

500
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,450
Go! Why did you ask me?

501
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,990
From what I see, Chen Qi

502
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,600
is completely in the palm of Miss Jinxiu's hand.

503
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,400
Who wants to control him? It's because he is not very reliable.

504
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,000
When Chen Qi was at Qingshan Court,

505
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,400
he took care of everything very well.

506
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Miss Jinxiu seems to know that.

507
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,800
That's right.

508
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,100
I didn't know. We are not that close.

509
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,000
I have no idea.

510
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,800
Oh, not very close.

511
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,800
Miss! Miss!

512
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Lord Lu is here.

513
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Why is he here again?

514
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,400

♫ The outline of my dream is carved on your face ♫

♫ Times interlace in the watery eyes ♫

♫ Allow me to weigh every word for indescribable
cause and effect ♫

♫ In the long silence, we are separated by a huge crowd ♫

♫ I’ll eventually be passed by ♫

♫ If memories could speak ♫

527

♫ I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain ♫

528

♫ It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫

♫ Seeing you again as if we’re strangers,
I’m wailing in deep sorrow ♫
