00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,810
Where is Meng Hui?

22
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,470
Meng Hui.

23
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,740
- Who am I?
- Shen Yi?

24
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,120
- Who are you?
- Meng Hui.

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
What relationship do we have?

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,750
We like each other. Don't worry. I'm awake.

27
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,490
You scared me to death.

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,360
Auntie, didn't tell me clearly. I thought—

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,570
Let's go.

30
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,740
My younger brother came to pick me up to go home.

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,080
Younger brother? Me?

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,310
Or else what? My dear younger brother.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,750
That... Shen Yi, it's like this.

34
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,510
Right now, she's treating herself as your—

35
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,150
I understand.

36
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,630
You're my sister?

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,330
Biological?

38
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,300
- Then if I'm Shen Yi then—
- Shen Meng Hui.

39
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,710
It was the bunk beds which gave her the inspiration.

40
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,840
My younger brother,

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,960
wasn't close with the family since he was young.

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,080
He's not willing to call him dad or call me sister

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,470
but we have a good relationship. He listens to me, right?

44
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,870
The situation is like this right now. You...

45
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,860
figure it yourself.

46

Let's go.

48
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,710
It hurts. What are you doing?

49
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,520
Be gentle.

50
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,410
Are we wearing couple's clothing?

51
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,230
Parent and child outfits.

52
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,700
Look at what you did to my room.

53
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,010
I like it like this.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,630
Couple exclusive coupons?

55
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,570
Cheap, substantial, and tasty.

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,290
Are we really siblings?

57
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,100
Of course.

58
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,620
Look.

59
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,330
In this world, other than siblings,

60
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,680
which relationship will have a bunk bed?

61
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,880
Hello.

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,930
Okay, we will come home soon.

63
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,700
Let's go. Mom is calling us back for dinner.

64
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,250
Mom?

65
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,830
Wait a second. You're saying...

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,700
Let's go. Start the car.

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,800
It hurts.

68
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,710
Don't.

69
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,270
- Don't move.
- No.

70
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,920
Let's go.

71
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,580
- Hurry up.
- This...

72
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,970
What a rare guest.

73
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,090
You know to come back home now?

74
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,190
I didn't expect that it would be coming back to your home.

75
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,260
Rotten rascal. So disrespectful. Who are you talking to?!

76
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,110
Be nicer to dad.

77
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,260
I...

78
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,670
Dad, I'm back.

79

80
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,390

81
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,240
- Dad, I'm back.
- You...

82
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,670
You... just called me what?

83
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,290
Dad, I'm back.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
Have a seat.

85
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,260
Okay, since you're back then...

86
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,250
Come and have a seat.

87
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,840
Did you guys eat dinner?

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,510
It's already so late and you haven't eaten dinner yet. You two children.

89
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,640
They haven't eaten dinner yet. Let's go let them prepare then.

90
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,360
Thank you, Dad.

91
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,010
Thank you, Dad.

92
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,550
Eat it while it's warm.

93
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,220
- Did work go well?
- It's quite good.

94

Under my sister's help,

97
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,400
I can endure it for a while.

98
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,150
Are you saying you can still hang in there?

99
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,650
Without you, I can still revive my company.

100
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,500
I just don't understand.

101
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
- You can take care of everything then why did you come home?
- I—

102
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,670
I'm came back to keep my sister company.

103
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,690
Your sister?

104
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,150
Looking at how outstanding you are,

105
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,370
if she wants you to acknowledge the ancestors in the future, you will do it too?

106
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,480
Dad.

107
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,680
I don't have you as my daughter.

108
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,070
Qian Shan, I'm done eating.

109
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm also done eating.

110
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,370
Then let's go home.

111
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,020
Go back to what home? Isn't this your home?

112
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,040
Is that so?

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,880
That's right. Didn't we always live here?

114
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,000
- What?
- What?

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Meng Hui, go back to your room first.

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,040
Auntie Zhang, clean up Shen Yi's room.

117
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,820
I don't live here.

118
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,880
You don't live here, right? Okay then, I will live here myself.

119
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,630
- You can't.
- You can't.

120
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,190
I'm next door. If you need anything then call me.

121
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,470
What could happen to me?

122
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,310
Then I will get going.

123
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm so nervous.

124
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,730
But it's quite interesting.

125
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,610
Are you going to let them do this?

126
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,740
Look. This is the first time Shen Yi is living at the house. This is a good thing.

127
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,970
Are we going to actually chase him out?

128
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,520
It's a good thing that he came home but it ought to.

129
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,040
What does he mean by bringing someone home today? Is he forcing me to accept her?

130
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,100
Meng Hui's stress disorder symptoms have relapsed. She needs someone to take care of her.

131
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,590
Do you want Shen Yi to live her behind and come back alone?

132
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,190
Think about it. If it was you,

133
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,570
you wouldn't live me behind and not care, right?

134
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,920
This lifetime, I had no chance to be a mom.

135
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,330
It was always a regret.

136
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,730
Now, I really feel like I have another daughter.

137
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,460
I will listen to you.

138
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,730
Welcome.

139
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,470
Come over here.

140
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,930
This one looks nice.

141
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,300
Come. This one.

142
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,580
This blue one is pretty, too.

143
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,220
No need. It's too expensive, Auntie.

144
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,160
What do you mean there's no need? You're my daughter right now.

145
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,600
Rich people must show extravagance. Do you understand?

146
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,770
This pink one looks nice, too.

147
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,680
The material is not bad. It's just that it's a bit big.

148
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,880
The waist measurement should be smaller.

149
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,310
- Okay.
- Let's go.

150
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,810
How is the clothes in this store? Do you like them?

151
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,030
Come and look at the shoes.

152
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,340
- How is it? Do they look nice?
- They look nice.

153
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,670
This one and this one. For this style, I want everything except the white one.

154
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,580
Let her try on the red and yellow one.

155
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,020
No.

156
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,090
Be careful.

157
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,720
It looks nice.

158
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,750
Youngsters should wear more fresh colors. Do you understand?

159
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,520
We want both.

160
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,160
This one works and we don't want that one.

161
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,200
The yellow one works and the white one doesn't work.

162
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,840
This one works and that won't work.

163
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,380
Which material is that? You're even bringing it out.

164
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,170
The designers are too common nowadays. Change the designers.

165
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,820
Okay.

166
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,060
Auntie, they still have to make sales.

167
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,720
I open this shop.

168
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,420
If I come then they're not open for business.

169
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,760
Boss, have some fruit.

170
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,920
- Here.
- Thank you.

171
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,750
Leave it there.

172
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,730
Auntie, how long do I have to pretend about my illness?

173
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,480
If I don't say stop then you have to keep pretending.

174
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,170
But Shen Yi will worry about me.

175
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,740
To be honest, you're not lacking anything when you reach my age.

176
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,310
I just want a warm family

177
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,650
but I'm stuck between Shen Yi and his dad.

178
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm in a hard position sometimes.

179
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,320
I don't want Shen Yi to be in a hard position

180
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,990
but I don't want Shen Yi's dad to not be happy.

181
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,420
It must be tough on you.

182
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,770
I'm not.

183
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,130
You usually see your uncle serious and old-fashion most of the time

184
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,280
but he really treats me well.

185
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,710
Also, I'm really happy recently.

186
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,620
I have such a kind and considerate daughter.

187
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,560
You can eat and shop with me. What is most important is

188
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,090
we can roast the men with the surname Shen.

189
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,930
I... really hope that one day

190
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,240
you guys can all be serious

191
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,730
and call me mom.

192
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,610
Auntie, don't worry. I will definitely keep you company often.

193
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,040
Why aren't you trying it on?

194
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,780
Forget it.

195
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,310
Shen Yi's dad likes white.

196
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,270
I will follow him.

197
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,730
- Latte?
- Double the thickness. I have been exhausted lately.

198
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,200
I found the girl that I hurt when I was young.

199
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,770
I haven't thought about how I should tell her yet.

200
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,210
Then do you plan to keep it from her?

201
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,600
She came to apply two days ago.

202
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
She's my assistant right now.

203
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,810
Let's wait until we're more familiar then think about how I will tell her.

204
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,950
Apply?

205
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,250
Two days ago? Your assistant?

206
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,980
That's right.

207
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,020
Impossible. You recognized the wrong person.

208
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,320
What do you mean that it's impossible?

209
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,540
You said the person that you found

210
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,690
went to go apply to your company two days ago?

211
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,030
That's right.

212
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,140
When she was young and studying at San Xiao, she took leave for a year due to an injury on her face.

213
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,760
She's injured is the same place that I injured her when I was young,

214
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,570
so until now because of this, people still call her Xiao Ba.

215
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,980
All the files match up.

216
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,830
Why are you saying that it's impossible?

217
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,330
Is it a coincidence?

218
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,950
Did you read the envelope that I gave you?

219
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,580
I forgot about it.

220
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,420
What is it that you are so mysterious about?

221
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,950
You didn't even go confirm at the elementary school and you're already thinking that Xiao Ba is the person you're looking for?

222
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,330
I don't need to confirm. She is the one.

223
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,300
It turns out that you didn't even confirm it

224
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,860
and you think it's her.

225
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,970
Shen Yi, you're afraid.

226
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,040
I'm not.

227
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,470
You are.

228
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,050
- You're afraid of remembering the past.
- I'm not afraid of remembering the past!

229
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,640
If I'm afraid, then I wouldn't let her stay.

230
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,560
Xiao Ba isn't living well right now.

231
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,130
Once I see her, I feel really guilty.

232
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,550
I'm thinking of how to make it up to her.

233
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,320
Are you going to be sorry for all the girls that have a scar on their face?

234
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,290
- Then what is Meng Hui considered?
- I told you before...

235
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,030
[Xiao Ba]

236
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,110
- Hello.
- Director Shen, hurry and come over. I'm scared.

237
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,610
Okay.

238
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,880
I have something urgent. I'll go.

239
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,350
Aren't you going to pick up Meng Hui?

240
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,930
Help me pick up Meng Hui.

241
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,940
She is with Auntie right now so nothing could go wrong.

242
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,140
Shen Yi, are you being serious?

243
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,160
Why are you looking at   me like that?

244
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,580
Sui An, I'm really tired right now. I have no choice either.

245
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,330
How come I grew a pimple?

246
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,780
I will get a bottle of anti-acne essence from Shen Yi later.

247
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,070
That who...

248
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,180
Is that the statistics report? Leave it in the office and let Shen Yi review it.

249
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,280
I already endured some words for a long time

250
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,230
but I can't continue anymore today.

251
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,050
Do you know that our boss has a girlfriend?

252
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,300
- I know.
- Then don't you think your actions are overboard?

253
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,890
Do you know what it means to keep a distance?

254
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,410
What did I do that I have to keep a distance from him?

255
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,230
Moreover, he likes to worry about me.

256
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,590
What can I do? Do you believe that if

257
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,310
I call him right now, he will come back immediately? What to do?

258
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,380
What's going on?

259
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,390
There's a really scary thing in the office. It scared me to death.

260
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,520
I didn't find any weird thing.

261
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,670
There was a bug.

262
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,430
At that...

263
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,200
- Bug.
- So scary.

264
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,920
It probably flew away. It scared me to death.

265
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,360
It's fine. As long as you're fine.

266
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,190
Boss, I want to resign.

267
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,260
Why?

268
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,470
Because I can't see you being a two-timer.

269
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,050
You already have Director Meng. You shouldn't be so fickle-minded.

270
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,250
If you have feelings for Xiao Ba, it's fine.

271
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,120
Then you should've told Director Meng earlier

272
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,030
and not going back and forth without clarifying. I think it's disgusting.

273
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,220
- You misunderstood. Actually—
- Director Shen,

274
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,640
did I disturb you and your girlfriend?

275
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

276
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,070
I can explain it to your girlfriend.

277
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,820
If she is still angry then she can scold me.

278
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,240
I-It's fine for me.

279
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,790
Anyways, I've been used to it since I was young.

280
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,950
Are you acting pitiful?

281
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,740
Don't blame her. She didn't do anything wrong. It's all my fault.

282
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,380
Boss, how could this be?

283
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,060
The scar on her face

284
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,840
was made by me.

285
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,910
I did it when I was young.

286
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,930
So... if she did anything that was bad

287
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,460
then I hope everyone can forgive her.

288
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,200
If there are any careless mistakes then I will take care of it

289
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,010
and be responsible for it.

290
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,800
Then did you misunderstood Director Meng?

291
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,510
You shouldn't mention that.

292
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,120
My apologies. I was a moron just now.

293
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,190
Just treat it like I ate something bad

294
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,640
and wasn't in a good mood. Please don't mind.

295
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,040
Okay, leave. Go work.

296
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,070
Go back.

297
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,290
You're not surprised?

298
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,280
I was the one who made your face like that.

299
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,350
I...

300
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,940
What's wrong with you?

301
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,610
I can't anymore.

302
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,120
I can't anymore, I...

303
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,200
I seem to have a fever.

304
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,300
My head hurts.

305
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,150
[Outpatient Department]

306
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,550
I'm sorry. I think I have to go there later.

307
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,950
I'm at the hospital right now. Xiao Ba is sick.

308
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,470
Do you know what illness Meng Hui has?

309
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,210
So I told you to go take care of her.

310
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,560
I can help you take care of Meng Hui

311
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,290
but can you tell the difference between guilt and love?

312
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,410
I can tell the difference.

313
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,350
I love Meng Hui and feel guilt towards Xiao Ba.

314
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,390
Let me ask you again.

315
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,580
Which one is more important? Guilt or love?

316
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,950
Shen Yi, I'm not going to force you

317
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,330
but don't regret some things.

318
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,730
- Drink some water.
- Thank you.

319
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,730
What's wrong? Did you argue with Shen Yi?

320
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,340
No.

321
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,410
Don't blame him. He's too busy recently.

322
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,530
Moreover, I was actually the one that lied to him.

323
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,630
My illness didn't act up.

324
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,900
Auntie asked me as a favor to let him and Uncle Shen have a better relationship.

325
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,960
It's actually better that fewer people know about this matter

326
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,510
but I think I should tell you or else you'll be worried.

327
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,960
As long as you're fine.

328
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,810
I still have some things that I didn't tidy up yet. Wait for me.

329
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,220
Okay.

[Yestar]

331
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,140
The sunscreen lotion should be replenished if it's used up.

332
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,890
What are you looking at?

333
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,410
It's something important that I gave Shen Yi before.

334
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,690
Then are you not going to give it to him anymore?

335
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,000
I think he doesn't need it now anymore.

336
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,660
It's fine.

337
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,420
Aiyoh!

338
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,100
I have no way to give you the shot when you're like this.

339
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,460
It hurts. I'm afraid of pain.

340
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,210
Please cooperate. You're not a three year old child.

341
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,370
Director Shen, I'm afraid of pain.

342
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,050
It's fine. You won't be able to see it this way then it'll be fine.

343
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
It hurts!

344
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,070
It hurts. Did you inject it yet?

345
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,900
Are you done yet?

346
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,350
It's done.

347
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,630
Thank you, Director Shen.

348
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,110
If there's nothing else then I'll get going. There are things going on at home.

349
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,440
You can't. I'm scared when I'm alone.

350
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,170
I already found someone to come take care of you.

351
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,420
Director Shen, it's personal time right now.

352
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,780
I was going to go eat with Ah Tao.

353
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,770
From today on, you have a double salary. Your mission is to take care of her.

354
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,480
Let's go sit down.

355
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,340
Assistant Jiang, I'm hungry. Buy me some food.

356
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,970
What do you want? Do you want to eat congee?

357
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,590
I don't want congee.

358
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,650
I want a salad, steak grilled at slow temperature without black pepper sauce.

359
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,800
And add lemon chicken breast and shrimps too.

360
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,700
Actually, I don't want shrimp. I want mashed yam, not mashed potatoes.

361
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,920
I want double amount of avocados. Don't add any mangoes.

362
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,880
Most importantly, it must be roasted with sesame seeds.

363
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,270
Don't add anything else except Caesar dressing. Understand?

364
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,330
Okay, that's all.

365
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,300
Come back quickly. The nurse has to come back and take out the injection.

366
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,450
How about this? I will keep her company and you go buy it.

367
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,710
What's going on? It's everything that I don't eat. Your ordered the wrong thing.

368
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,690
I got it wrong then. These were the only ones I remembered.

369
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,060
Then are you still eating?

[Medical diagnosis]

371
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,390
Your illness is quite severe.

372
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,930
Difficulties breathing, numbness in the body, dizziness, blurred vision, frequent fainting spells.

373
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,930
It even hurts to swallow saliva.

374
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,500
Did you do a blood test? You should do a thorough test.

375
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,350
I... I merely have a sore throat. I can just get an injection. Why must I do a blood test?

376
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,420
It's easy to get a high fever from inflammation of the tonsils.

377
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,450
It's that serious?

378
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,870
Yes, if the inflammation is serious, she needs to do an urine test.

379
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,140
Why didn't you say it earlier? Don't worry, I will look for the doctor for you.

380
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,400
From head to toe, we will do an exam.

381
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
X-ray, CAT scan,

382
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,100
electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram. Run tests for the entire body.

383
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,160
That must of cost a lot of money.

384
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,560
It's fine. Your company has an expense account, right?

385
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,120
She has only worked for a few days and doesn't have any health insurance yet.

386
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,800
Then did you bring enough money?

387
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,900
After eating two bites of the salad, I think it's so special.

That... you guys talk. I will go home first.

390
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,870
The salad was quite tasty. You guys eat some.

Can you explain what's going on with the scar on her face?

396

That... was made by our Director Shen.

397
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,730
He accidentally made a mark on her when he was young.

398
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,020
Then is Shen Yi and Meng Hui a misunderstanding?

399
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,170
It is indeed a misunderstanding.

400
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,330
Then Meng Hui doesn't know this yet, right?

401
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,340
Who would dare to tell her?

402
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,980
You can't tell anyone else. Our boss wants to hide it forever.

- Anything is fine.
- Director Shen, I've been chased out by my landlord.

I... I'm well.

00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,640
You are too overboard. Do you know how worried I was?

00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,170

433
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,010
Auntie!

434
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,670
I'm done for. Something happened.

435
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,890
What happened, Xiao Meng Hui?

436
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,020
I have been entrapped.

437
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,260
What... do you mean?

438
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,750
It's just that Shen Yi, he...

439
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,090
I-I didn't hold back.

440
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,530
Foolish girl, why did you lose your composure?

441
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,230
Let me tell you. When your uncle and I met, we held hands after two months.

442
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:41,230
We kissed half a year later and shared the same room on the fourth day of marriage. Don't you think I don't want to?

443
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,780
You must hold back when you're handling a man.

444
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,770
You must restrain yourself and whet his appetite. You will be able to control him in this manner.

445
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,430
Then they will listen to you forever. Do you understand?

446
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,410
Why did you come?

447
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,660
Do you know that a vixen came to Shen Yi's company?

448
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,900
How did you know? Who told you? Does Meng Hui know?

449
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,060
The scar. The two of them have the same scar.

450
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,370
This is why Meng Hui didn't meet with that vixen.

451
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:34,730
Say, will the two of them disappear if they meet?

452
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,210
Do you think this is Lianliankan?
(T/N: A table top game)

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
This is a very serious issue. Calm down.

457
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,520
You even know it's a very serious issue.

You're also a jerk. Are you also like Shen Yi

461

wheeling and dealing with me?

462
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,710
What does this have to do with me?

463
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,390
I can see it now. You both are alike.

464
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,560
I'm warning you that if Meng Hui gets bullied then I will not spare Shen Yi.

465
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,690
How can we let Meng Hui know about this?

Hello, Director Xu. Is there something?

I found out something at the company today.

It's related to you.

I decided to tell you the truth

I don't know how to tell you.

He thinks that you are the girl that he hurt

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,090
W-Why are you here?

483
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,610
Did a new employee come to the company?

484
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,800
New employee?

485
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,020
What new employee?

486
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,100
I need to print.

487
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,440
Did a new assistant come to the company?

488
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,260
No.

489
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,500
There's only one assistant and you know him.

490
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,860
She had her salary doubled a few days ago but I don't envy her at all.

491
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,090
Yes.

492
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,220
Who would be envious? There's really isn't a new female employee.

493
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,700
Xiao Mei, move aside.

494
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,430
Where is she?

495
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:17,990
Shen Yi thought I was her before

496
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,680
so he got together with me, right?

497
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,610
Stop asking.

498
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,900
Where is Shen Yi?

499
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,430
Why isn't he answering my phone call?

500
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,440
Who told you to be so lacking?

501
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,410
Who allowed you to post those pictures and videos on your own?

502
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,620
You let others misunderstood our relationship.

503
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,200
Go clarify our relationship to everyone.

504
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,890
There's no love and relationship between us. It's just your one-sided love. Get it?

505
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,280
I know you have your own reasons.

506
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,360
I also want to help you but I'm sorry.

507
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,320
I really can't endure it anymore.

508
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,180
♫  Leading me  ♫

509
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,700
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

510
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:38,270
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

511
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,780
Let's start all over again.

512
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,420
Meng Hui, do you remember that I told you before

513
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,780
that I hurt a girl when I was young.

514
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,820
I really want to make it up to her.

515
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,460
Hello?

516
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,070
Meng Hui, where are you?

517
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,040
I seem to be near your house.

518
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,820
Don't go anywhere. Wait for me. I'll go pick you up right now.

519
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,530
Okay.

520
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,050
If Shen Yi is going to be responsible for Xiao Ba because of this scar,

521
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,750
that's how he fell in love with her.

522
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,200
Do you know how worried I was? That was too overboard.

523
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,470
Shen Yi!

524
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,980
He thinks you were the girl that he hurt

525
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,830
so he got into a relationship with you.

526
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,330
You're awake.

527
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,540
- Brother.
- Brother?

528
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,530
- Where is sister-in-law?
- Sister...

529
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,490
Did I disturb you guys from dating?

530
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,190
Will she blame me? I can explain it to her.

531
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,760
Then...

532
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,840
Let's go home first. Let's talk when we get back, okay?

533
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,640
Then let's go home, Sui An.

534
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,820
- What?
- What?

535
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,050
What?

536
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:12,190
Why are you going back home with him? Aren't you supposed to go back with me?

537
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,600
He's my boyfriend.

538
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,750
Who is your boyfriend?

539
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,930
What is going on?

540
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,990
Yes, I am her boyfriend.

541
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:44,960

Acne products with salicylic acid works well. Same for sunscreen products with zinc oxide.

543
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:03,710
But their ingredients are incompatible. When they are placed together, they turn into a mess.

544
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,090
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

545
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,260
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

546
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:16,240
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

547
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,180
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

548
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,350
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

549
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:34,880
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

550
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,560
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

551
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:50,300
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

552
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:55,220
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

553
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:05,440
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

554
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,480
♫  Leading me  ♫

555
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,840
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

556
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:23,710
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫
