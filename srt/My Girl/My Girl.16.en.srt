[Episode 16: Eyebrow raincoat, Bearing the rain and wind together]

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,830
I was so scared when the wine shelf fell down.

22
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,610
I was afraid that it would drop on you.

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,690
Meng Hui, do you really not feel my intentions?

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,060
You're my older brother. We grew up together.

25
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,910
We're not blood-related.

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,300
I can't like you. I have a sister-in-law.

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,470
You don't have a sister-in-law. She is just my assistant.

28
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,880
You already misunderstood. You also forced me to call her over and trick you.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,090
Really?

30
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,790
It's real. You're the only person that I love.

31
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,050
We still can't be together.

32
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,750
Why? Do you not like me?

33
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,290
I like you

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,690
but uncle will be mad if we're together

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,720
and mom will be in a hard position.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,860
I don't want them to be upset.

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,710
I already tried really hard to not like you

38
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,250
but I can't do it.

39
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,900
How come I feel like we're acting a television show every day?

40
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,980
- And it's a sad one too.
- What?

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,230
I-I'm saying that I brought this upon myself

42
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,020
but it's not wrong to like someone.

43
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,660
It's all your fault.

44
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,840
It's my fault. Let's go.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,430
I can't walk anymore. Carry me.

46
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,900
Take it.

47
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,640
What are you doing?

48
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,580
Come on.

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you know how much I like you?

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
- I know.
- You don't know.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,480
Okay, I don't know.

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,210
How come you don't know?

53
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,600
Let's talk when we get home, okay?

54
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,430
Don't worry. I'm here.

55
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,910
As long as you like me then everything else won't be a problem.

56
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,820
You came back so late.

57
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,400
How come you even let her get drunk?

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,770
Her body will feel unconformable and she will have a headache the next day.

59
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,350
We had fun today.

60
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,780
It was with friends and we didn't drink that much.

61
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,740
Uncle, I'm sorry.

62
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,010
It's all my fault. Don't blame older brother.

63
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,890
It's fine. I didn't blame you. Auntie Zhang.

64
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,670
Brew them some honey water and watch them finish drinking it.

65
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,490
Okay.

66
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,360
Thank you, Dad.

67
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,030
You got yelled at because of me. Uncle is going to like me less and less.

68
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,190
He likes you.

69
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,480
Then will he allow us to be together?

70
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,830
Don't worry. He will definitely agree.

71
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,230
Then... right now, can I kiss you?

72
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,240
Indeed. No matter who you turn into,

73
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,690
you still like me.

74
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,050
You're awake. Meng Hui.

75
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,460
Are you sober now?

76
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,030
Do you still remember what happened yesterday night?

77
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,230
- I remember.
- What relationship do you have with Sui An?

78
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,360
- Friend.
- Then what about me and Xiao Ba?

79
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,870
- Coworker.
- Who is your boyfriend?

80
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,610
You.

81
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,380
Then what should you call me?

82
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,130
Older Brother.

83
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,360
You... call me again.

84
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,150
Brother.

85
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,990
Auntie Zhang, is the bird's nest ready?

86
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,810
You... why did you push me for?

87
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,470
I don't want to let mom see us.

88
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,500
Don't worry.

89
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,200
Then... I will go to work.

90
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,140
Why don't

91
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,070
you go with me, okay?

92
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,370
[Have you written a letter to your son?

Shen Yi, this child.

Why is he being careless?

97
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,860
Do you need me to send those documents?

98
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,140
No need, you rest and I'll send them.

99
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,820
Assistant Jiang, this is your fault.

100
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,150
There are some things that need to be done by himself.

101
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,510
I will drive you over then.

102
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,450
Director Meng, make way.

103
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,610
Did you eat breakfast?

104
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,830
- So much.
- Pick some. Come on.

105
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,280
Let me report some good news to you.

106
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,760
Director Meng, take a look.

107
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,350
This is our new product.

108
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,840
Brow pencil, brow powder, and brow setting gel. Give it a try.

109
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,940
The color is quite nice. I will help you guys with the endorsement later.

110
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,900
If it's your family business then it must be free.

111
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,300
Director Meng, choose.

112
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,160
This one.

113
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,740
Meng Hui is here.

114
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,350
Did you come to the company to find your brother?

115
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,130
Xiao Ba.

116
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,920
Why are you calling me Xiao Ba?

117
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,640
Don't be so courteous when you come to the company. Call me sister-in-law.

118
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,430
Xiao Ba, my brother already explain to me yesterday.

119
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,780
I actually misunderstood. You guys are only co一

120
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,340
Meng Hui, since you came to the company

121
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,060
I'm eating lunch with Shen Yi.

122
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,700
Why don't you join us?

123
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,410
The restaurant he brought me to last time was so tasty.

124
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,990
That... I'm sorry, let me ask.

125
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,870
Who has this

126
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,240
hand cream? Do you have hand cream?

127
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,170
This ring looks nice.

128
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,880
Xiao Ba,

129
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,850
that ring has a meaningful reason to my mom.

130
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,380
I know. It's given to their daughter-in-law.

131
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,090
So, can you give it back to her?

132
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,170
What are you doing? Are you trying to undermine me?

133
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,110
Do you really think you are the daughter of Qian Shan Group?

134
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,790
Then let me ask you. You call Shen Qian Shan dad but

135
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,850
will he agree?

136
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,510
What are all you guys talking about?

137
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,550
President Shen.

138
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,940
Hello, President Shen.

139
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,860
Hello, President Shen.

140
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,270
Hello, President Shen.

141
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,000
Uncle.

142
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,070
How come you're still calling me uncle?

143
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,410
You should call me dad.

144
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,970
Dad.

145
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,070
Do you like it?

146
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,010
I like it. Thanks, Uncle.

147
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,780
Go downstairs to Qian Shan Group and casually find a jewelry shop.

148
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,670
Buy one that has the same value as that one.

149
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,850
No, more expensive than that one and give it to her.

150
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,320
Yes.

151
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,020
Uncle, that's not good.

152
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,690
Take off the ring on your finger.

153
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,790
This ring has a special meaning to our Shen family.

154
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,360
We have to give it to Shen family's daughter-in-law.

155
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,590
We shouldn't give it to you and it's impossible that we will give it to you.

156
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,070
We shouldn't give it to you and it's impossible that we will give it to you.

157
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,840
Take it off.

158
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,730
Come on.

159
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,750
Take this ring and keep it.

160
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,080
It's just a ring.

161
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,610
This isn't appropriate. Isn't this for the future daughter-in-law?

162
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,540
We'll buy a new one when the daughter-in-law gets married.

163
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,670
I wonder if Dad Shen is lacking a daughter.

164
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,590
You know who President Shen is helping this time.

165
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,950
I know.

166
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,240
He didn't even need to use swear words to reprimand her.

167
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,440
- Where is Shen Yi?
- I will go look for him.

168
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,810
President Shen.

169
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,760
Dad.

170
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,070
Look, you left this.

171
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,140
Thank you, Dad.

172
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,040
Oh right. I forgot to ask you that day

173
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,260
you brought her back and told me what was your relationship with her?

174
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,390
- Coworker.
- What?

175
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,160
Coworker.

176
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,730
Then I understand.

177
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,980
Goodbye, President Shen.

178
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,700
Shen Yi.

179
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,300
Thank you for cooperating with me yesterday. We already handle it.

180
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,300
- That Xiao Ba一
- I already investigated.

181
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,600
- She's fake right?
- The person involved is the only one who can't tell.

182
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,500
Shen Yi can't tell because he cares too much.

183
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,800
That's not right. If Xiao Ba is fake

184
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,030
then go investigate Meng Hui.

185
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,600
Okay.

186
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,000
Is Dr. Sui here?

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm not here.

188
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Why did you come?

189
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,640
Didn't you say you weren't here?

190
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,900
I'm not here now.

191
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't know what happened to my face.

192
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,300
It hurts and it's very itchy.

193
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,600
You have an allergic reaction.

194
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
Then what do I do?

195
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,700
You drank after getting the injection. Having an allergic reaction is a small issue.

196
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
I will be obedient and listen to you in the future.

197
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
In order for you to care for me

198
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
so I drank so much to一

199
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
You can't treat your health as a joke.

200
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,300
How would I know that it was this severe?

201
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Two tablets. Eat it one more time at night.

202
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,200
So you do care about me right?

203
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,200
I don't know if I care about you but do you not care about yourself?

204
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,000
If the allergy is severe, your face could be broken. Let's see what you'll do later on.

205
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,400
That severe?

206
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
But I researched online.

207
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Drinking a little isn't a problem.

208
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,600
What should I do? I have to depend on this face

209
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,700
to earn money.

210
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,400
Don't worry. I'm here.

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,700
If anything happens to your face, I will help you cure it.

212
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,500
Are you at ease now?

213
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,700
Do you know

214
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,300
this is how you caught my attention?

215
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I didn't know.

216
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
This won't do.

217
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I can't give you away like this. Not even to Meng Hui.

218
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,200
Silly, Meng Hui likes Shen Yi.

219
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,000
No matter what situation she is in, she will always likes Shen Yi.

220
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,900
It's just that I don't know if this liking

221
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,900
is a good thing or bad thing.

222
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,000
I want to ask you about something.

223
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,500
It's about Meng Hui's PTSD.

224
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,800
How can she be cured?

225
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,600
From what I know, we need to know her wish

226
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,300
and fulfill her that way she can get well.

227
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,430
Then what is her wish right now that you can't fulfill?

228
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,040
She wants you to accept our relationship.

229
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,500
This indeed is a bit hard.

230
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,400
Dad, I never begged you about anything.

231
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,700
It's been so many years

232
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,600
and I don't know how to be a dad

233
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,100
but I will learn well in the future.

234
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
Is it almost Meng Hui's birthday?

235
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,600
Next week on Sunday.

236
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Then let's invite some of your friends and coworkers on Sunday

237
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,300
to home and hold a birthday party

238
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,000
for Meng Hui and celebrate.

239
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
- Okay.
- Wait.

240
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
Last time, we talked about the lab from France

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,400
their plasma peptide patent.

242
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,600
Let's sign a patent transfer agreement. You can use the technology.

243
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,000
Although the scar-fading serum doesn't sound too reliable,

244
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
but since Meng Hui and you want to do it

245
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
then do it well.

246
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
It's family business.

247
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
We don't need to separate what's yours and what's mine.

248
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,030
What are you doing?

249
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,000
These years, I don't know how to be a son either

250
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,800
but I will learn in the future.

251
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,670
Okay, hurry and go rest.

252
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,400
This is so beautiful.

253
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,500
This way. There's a lot of tasty food here.

254
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
- Macaroons.
- Thank you.

255
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,100
Is it tasty?

256
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,200
Hurry and drink it. Here.

257
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Drink it.

258
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
Are you better?

259
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,800
Well done.

260
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Ah Tao really is an expert.

261
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,000
I can even hear Jiang Jiang's heartbeat.

262
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,800
Dr. Sui, what a coincidence.

263
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,300
I really want to eat sweets.

264
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Hello.

265
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
I can't eat this much. Help me eat some.

266
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,500
I don't eat sweets.

267
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,970
- Okay then.
- Wait a second.

268
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,290
You can't drink alcohol right now.

269
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Meng Hui is here.

270
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,600
- Director Meng is here.

Good!

289
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,800
Oh right. I have a present to give you.

290
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,400
Okay, I also prepared a present to give to Meng Hui.

291
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,400
Do you know how to chose gifts? Necklaces are given by boyfriends.

292
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,800
How would I know he's giving the same thing?

293
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,100
You...

294
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,800
It's dad and son after all. They have chemistry right?

295
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,400
Right. Even the presents are the same.

296
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
They really are compatible. They can read each other's minds.

297
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,100
The one dad gave me, he hopes I'll be blissful.

298
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,400
The one brother gave me, he hopes I'll be happy.

299
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Good.

300
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Calling your boyfriend brother...

301
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Is there a new situation?

302
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,200
Those are diamonds.

303
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,000
A set for wearing around your neck and a set for keeping at home.

304
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Is this how rich people give gifts?

305
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,200
Mom, I'm giving this to you

306
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,800
that way we can wear the same necklace to go shopping.

307
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,300
For me?

308
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Thank you precious daughter.

309
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,850
Dad wanted to celebrate your birthday, so I prepared this for you.

310
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,790
I hope you like it.

311
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,960
Thank you dad. I am thankful to you too.

312
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,840
Director Shen.

313
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,270
I have to talk to you about something very important.

314
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,530
Can you wait?

315
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,040
No, it's very important.

316
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,090
It's okay. Go ahead.

317
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,050
I'll go hang out with Xiao Mei.

318
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,310
So what is it?

319
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,930
Shen Yi, if I tell you I like you, can you be with me?

320
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,610
Why would you like me?

321
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,560
Nobody else has been as nice to me as you.

322
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,930
I am sure your father can be nice to you too.

323
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,440
Sorry.

324
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,470
Without a doubt, it must be because of the scar on my face,

325
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,910
when I thought you wouldn't mind.

326
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,020
Xiao Ba, are you really that girl from the past?

327
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,660
The girl from back then was very gentle,

328
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,900
and always thoughtful toward others.

329
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,940
She had the same personality as Meng Hui.

330
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,460
Meng Hui has a scar on her face too,

331
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,720
but she doesn't want to capitalize on her pain.

332
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,940
She doesn't want others to feel bad or sorry for her because of her scar.

333
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,310
To her, it's like getting hurt two different ways.

334
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:20,780
That's why she gets up two hours early each morning to apply make-up to hide the scar.

335
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,100
But you want to make everyone know about the scar on your face.

336
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,690
You keep using your scar to hurt and threaten me, so I think

337
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,950
you guys are probably not the same person.

338
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,600
H-How are we not the same person?

339
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,890
How could you not believe me?

340
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,470
If you are really that girl,

341
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,150
I will compensate you.

342
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,080
I will give you anything you want

343
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,860
except for love.

344
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,870
I already have Meng Hui.

345
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,230
- We'll go get some food to eat then.
- Let's go.

346
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,310
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

347
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,820
- Meng Hui!
- Meng Hui!

348
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,900
Meng Hui!

349
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,620
Xiao Ba, let's just leave Xiao Ba.

350
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,690
- Meng Hui!
- Meng Hui!

351
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,510
Don't be afraid. We're both here.

352
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,660
It's not water resistant.

353
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,340
What's going on? There isn't a scar on her face!

354
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,910
I...

355
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,580
- Older Brother.
- Older Brother?

356
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,680
It was hard for you to meet a girl that you want to protect.

357
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,020
Don't argue with sister-in-law because of me.

358
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,710
Let's go home then, Sui An.

359
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,690
Why are you going home with him?

360
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,070
He's my boyfriend.

361
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,020
My goodness.

362
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,160
It's not that I want a sister-in-law.

363
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,360
Okay, I want a sister-in-law.

364
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,780
- I will arrange it.
- I'll wear it for now.

365
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,050
Sister-in-law, uncle gave this to mom.

366
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,850
Take off the ring on your finger.

367
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,760
Beauty, I will take care of your younger sister.

368
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,890
Come in.

369
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,440
Meng Hui, you're awake.

370
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,140
Let your mom go make some ginger soup for you.

371
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,500
No need, uncle.

372
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,320
Come and have a seat.

373
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,660
Thank you and auntie during this time.

374
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,970
You're awake?

375
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,130
I'm already clear-minded.

376
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,800
Thank you for tolerating me these days.

377
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,840
Don't say that.

378
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,500
Hurry and go tell Shen Yi.

379
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,660
He is really worried about you.

380
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,080
- I will leave then.
- Okay.

381
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,310
Uncle,

382
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,650
during this time I thought I was auntie's daughter and lived at your house

383
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,470
but I was really happy and felt the warmth of a family

384
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,120
so right now,

385
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,980
I want to ask if you will accept us being together.

386
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:35,980
Meng Hui, you're a very kind girl.

387
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,690
I also hope you can be part of our family

388
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,150
but... but I really hope

389
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,290
that you won't be together with Shen Yi.

390
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,850
This is words from a dad.

391
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,440
I hope you can trust me

392
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,910
and please understand me.

393
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,840
I understand.

394
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,710
During this time, I really troubled you guys.

395
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,510
Qian Shan,

396
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,220
did you see Meng Hui? How come she's not in her room?

397
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,980
She left.

398
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,430
She left?

399
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,780
Did you chase her out?

400
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,140
I didn't chase her out.

401
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,130
How can you still deny?

402
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,010
I really didn't chase her out.

403
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,270
Then how come it's raining heavily outside and she just left just because she said so?

404
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,680
I only told her

405
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,480
that I don't hope she'll become my daughter-in-law.

406
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,170
Meng Hui is such a good child.

407
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,160
Based on what, should you make the decision for Shen Yi?

408
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,710
I indeed can't let her be with Shen Yi.

409
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,600
Why are you always so dictatorial?

410
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,780
Do you know that I've always didn't like the color white.

411
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,130
It's because you like it so all my clothes are white.

412
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,380
I never brought a different color clothing.

413
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,220
Ever since Meng Hui came to this house,

414
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,230
do you know how much warmth and happiness she gave me?

415
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,710
Now you chased her away. Why don't you chase me out as well?

416
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,280
But you never told me that you never liked white.

417
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,510
You never complimented me when I wore other colors.

418
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,920
I...

419
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,310
Dad, auntie said you chased Meng Hui out.

420
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,980
Shen Yi, there's something that I decided to tell you about.

421
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,170
There's some files here. You take a look at it yourself.

422
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,640
Meng Hui, she is...

423
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,760
so that's why you did let us...

424
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Because I'm your dad.

425
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,620
I don't hope my son

426
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,300
get along with a victim that he accidentally hurt back then.

427
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,730
I'm afraid that once you see the scar on her face,

428
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,880
you will feel regret.

429
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,520
I didn't.

430
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,240
Did you not?

431
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,830
Then when you see the scar on her face,

432
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,420
will you not be sad?

433
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,580
Will you not feel bad about acting cowardly back then?

434
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,840
It wasn't me.

435
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,800
I hate myself for not being by your side back then

436
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,300
and tell you to take responsibility

437
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,250
like a man and stand out.

438
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,960
You should be clear yourself

439
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,500
how Meng Hui lived these years.

440
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,240
If one day, she finds out

441
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,030
that you were the person

442
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,950
then will she forgive you?

443
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,530
Let me give you two paths to take.

444
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,880
One path is I will look for her

445
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,060
and I can give her money for treatment.

446
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,680
I can guarantee that the rest of her life will have no worries

447
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,820
but from now on, you don't owe her.

448
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,930
The fate between you guys will be cut.

449
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,950
The second path is you'll look for her.

450
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,400
No matter if you tell her the truth or not,

451
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,840
let this matter rot in your stomach,

452
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,570
or if you will spend the rest of your life to keep her company

453
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,600
but you have to know

454
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,200
that from now on your life will no longer have love.

455
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,670
Your love has been replaced by making up.

456
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,510
After I got injured,

457
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,800
my mom and dad would always argue. They both blamed each other.

458
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,610
After they got divorced, they still blamed each other for not taking care of me.

459
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,690
In my memories, they argued multiple times.

460
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,890
I don't know what I did wrong.

461
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:27,260
Why did I suddenly have nothing?

462
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,090
Later on, they formed a new family.

463
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,090
They finally didn't argue anymore.

464
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,870
I thought I could start a new life

465
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,820
but the bad things didn't end.

466
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,200
I don't know when my PTSD

467
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,710
had started.

468
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,760
It seems like once I have wild thoughts

469
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,380
then I have a lot of troubles.

470
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,840
I don't want mom to see me like this

471
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,630
so I don't go home often.

472
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,850
I also don't contact her that often.

473
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,370
She must think I'm still blaming her

474
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,680
but I just don't want her to worry about me.

475
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,830
I really miss dad and mom,

476
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,680
but I don't want them seeing me when my illness acts up.

477
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,490
I don't want them seeing me turn into a different person.

478
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,710
I don't want them to be worried about me.

479
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,150
I really envy you

480
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,530
so I hope you can listen to uncle and auntie.

481
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,480
They worry about you.

482
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,690
Don't keep arguing with uncle. He's thinking for your own good.

483
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,740
Okay.

484
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,010
I really envy Xiao Ba.

485
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:20,850
You found her and personally apologize to her about what happened back then.

486
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:26,030
You used the best of your abilities to help her and treat her well.

487
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,600
I can see your pain and your sincerity.

488
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,530
I believe that she can see it too.

489
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,780
Meng Hui,

490
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,510
if the person who marked your face appeared

491
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,560
then will you forgive him?

492
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,900
Why?

493
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,160
Because I hate him.

494
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,420
But you said before,

495
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,860
you would forgive him.

496
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,340
Yes,

497
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,740
I will tell him that I already forgave him.

498
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,230
What happened back then already passed a long time ago.

499
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,630
Let's all forget about it.

500
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,800
However, I don't want to see him again in this lifetime

501
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,630
because what happened back then changed my whole life.

502
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,950
I lived a tough life.

503
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,890
Then what happens if he apologizes to you?

504
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,150
There's no need

505
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,940
because I already have you.

506
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:34,040
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

507
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,650
Deliver an umbrella to those two.

508
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,620
President Shen, you–

509
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,220
Since some things were done then admit it.

510
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,080
The only thing we can do right now is help them shelter from the rain.

511

A brow setting gel allows us to be prepared at all times for life's storms,

513
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,900
but when it comes to love, sometimes, the person who shelters you from the storm is also the storm itself.

514
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,050
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

515

Xue Lai, Xue...

516
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:04,120
♫  But I can feel you here in this world  ♫

517
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,350
Auntie Zhang! Auntie Zhang!

518
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,550
President Shen.

519
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,040
She left?

520
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:11,960
Did she take the credit card?

521
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,710
She also take the credit card.

522
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,860
Let her leave. None of them come back.

523
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,600
Let me stay alone in this home then.

524
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,320
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

525
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:39,280
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

526
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,030
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

527
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:49,220
♫  Don't let me  ♫

528
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:54,290
♫ wander the world  ♫

529
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:59,290
♫  Leading me  ♫

530
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:04,800
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

531
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:11,820
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫
