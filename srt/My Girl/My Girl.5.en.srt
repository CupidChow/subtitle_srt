Right. It is lucky that you can apply makeup well.

163
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,170
Then do you ever think about doing surgery for the scar?

164
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,630
It is not that I didn't think about it.

165
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,700
I even looked up for online information last year.

166
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,490
They said that Professor Smith from England

167
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,540
has to personally do the surgery for me

168
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,380
in order for me to successfully recover.

169
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,080
Professor Smith only does one surgery each year in China.

170
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,610
But don't worry. I...

171
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,530
Shen Yi and I will help you for sure.

172
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,830
You are all nice people,

173
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,580
but now, I don't think my life is that different

174
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,600
because of this scar.

175
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,800
Also, I don't want to bother Shen Yi anymore.

176
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,470
You and Shen Yi...

177
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,010
It was all a misunderstanding. We already explained it.

178
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,890
Hello.

179
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,110
I already did a consultation for Meng Hui.

180
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,070
Her scar is too deep and it has been way too long.

181
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,980
It's hard to recover.

182
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:20,140
But if Doctor Smith does the surgery then she might be able to recover.

183
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,610
Sui An, I want to use all of my savings to

184
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,330
help me arrange for her surgery.

185
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,480
I already made an appointment for you.

186
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,480
- Sui An.
- I am here.

187
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,710
Thank you.

188
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,530
- Sorry.
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

189
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,590
I have been lying to everyone all along. Sorry to bother you.

190
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,000
No. No. No.

191
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,890
It is just that we are very careless

192
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,060
and embarrassed you time and time again. Talk about this situation—

193
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,570
No, it's you all who were so generous to me. I'm the one who's sorry.

194
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,990
I will drop out of the show

195
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,530
but how you can let me stay

196
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,210
and be a makeup artist from behind.

197
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,800
Hui, Hui, it's fine. We understand.

198
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,940
Don't worry. In the future,

199
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,220
you can come and go as you wish. Just have fun.

200
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,130
You... did you guys misunderstand my relationship with Director Shen?

201
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,980
What is there to misunderstand about?

202
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,930
It's so obvious. It was live everywhere online.

203
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,610
You've been trending twice.

204
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,430
The only son of Qian Shan Group confessed to her.

205
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,420
- So romantic, right?
- Good job, Meng Hui.

206
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,650
No, you guys really misunderstood. I'm not close with Shen Yi at all.

207
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,660
This is hard to say.

208
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,160
- There's nothing to say.
- Let me tell you this thing...

209
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,610
Excuse me. Who is Meng Hui? Miss Meng.

210
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,200
I am.

211
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,310
What is it?

212
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,890
Excuse me.

213
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,110
This is what Director Shen sent.

214
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,910
Please accept it, Miss Meng.

215
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,120
See? That is real love.

216
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,150
Everything has its vanquisher.

217
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,410
Is there still time for me to explain?

218
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,650
No need. We understand.

219
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,200
Miss Meng, please accept it.

220
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,130
Why are you here?

221
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,750
Sorry for bothering you. I came here to tell you that

222
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,240
I don't have that so called high coverage foundation.

223
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,390
This is what I formulated using 8 different foundations for my own skin tone.

224
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,010
It's the most ordinary brand so I don't have any secret formula.

225
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,620
Hand.

226
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,130
I use tactics to cover my scar.

227
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,300
So no matter what concealer or foundation you give me,

228
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,210
I can cover everything just like this.

229
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,810
That also means you don't have a liquid foundation formula.

230
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,030
Yes, you're right.

231
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,100
So you don't have to date with me anymore. I have nothing to give you.

232
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,130
I know before. It's because my disorder was triggered and I said the wrong things

233
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,050
that ended up like this. I'm very sorry.

234
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,170
It's fine.

235
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,300
The liquid foundation isn't important to me anymore.

236
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,140
You are more important than that liquid foundation.

237
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,370
I already returned everything to Jiang Jiang from today.

238
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,040
I know your good intentions.

239
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,820
I also know when I was suffering from my PTSD you were very generous to me.

240
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,890
I know you're a very kind person.

241
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,240
But, the thing is you unlocked my phone while I was sleeping,

242
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,390
and bought everything from my wish list. I really think that is very problematic.

243
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,910
If I could buy it all, why would I put it on my wish list?

244
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,780
If you do this, how can I pay for everything?

245
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,560
Sorry.

246
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,530
I'm very sorry that my actions put you in a hard position.

247
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,370
How about this? If you have anything else that you want then I'll buy it for you.

248
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,920
Treat it as compensation. Okay?

249
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,850
It's like this. You don't have to give me anything else.

250
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,920
You also don't need to make it up to me.

251
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,640
You don't owe me anything.

252
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,540
You put them in your wish list,

253
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,850
that means you like them.

254
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,300
I brought them because I hope you can be happy.

255
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,440
I had no other intentions.

256
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,430
Even if you don't have the liquid foundation, I would still do that.

257
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,410
Why?

258
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,310
Because I want your life to not be filled with worry.

259
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,500
Say, what did I do wrong?

260
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,810
I can't even tell who is bothering who.

261
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,780
Sorry, I was too excited.

262
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,060
It's fine.

263
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,510
I just want you to give me a chance to take care of you.

264
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,530
I want to keep being by your side.

265
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,260
Let's... be friends, okay?

266
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,610
Only friends?

267
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,250
The most ordinary ones.

268
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,800
Welcome.

269
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,690
[We]

270
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,130
Hey.

271
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,490
You want to buy this?

272
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,130
This one.

273
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,560
You don't even have enough money and you want to buy this?

274
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,800
I want to return a gift.

275
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,030
I can take gifts from a friend like you

276
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,900
so not to mention Shen Yi which I picked up half way.

277
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,210
One, two, three, four.

278
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,380
Can you not count? You're taking so long to count them.

279
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,120
It's so expensive.

280
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,350
It's so hard to have a rich friend. This is too hard on me.

281
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,690
Be good.

282
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,580
Meng Hui,

283
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,080
what's wrong with you? You don't look good.

284
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,530
I feel like my entire body has been hollowed.

285
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,440
Director Shen was just looking for you. I'll help you call him.

286
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,560
Your shoe laces are undone.

287
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,140
Hey!

288
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,460
Thank...

289
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,150
Director Shen.

290
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,170
Can I treat you to a meal?

291
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,490
Forget it.

292
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,490
Aren't we friends? I just want to treat you to a meal.

293
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,700
Then what meal do you want to treat me?

294
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,710
How about Japanese food?

295
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,630
Japanese food?
[¥600 (~$85) per person]

296
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,430
I don't like to eat raw food. I don't have a good stomach.

297
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,340
What about French food? That would work, right?

298
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,690
French food?

299
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,370
Don't you think eating snails are cruel?
[¥999 (~$140) per person]

300
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,550
Will hometown dishes work?
[¥30 (~$4.30) per person]

301
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,410
This one works.

302
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,600
I know a place called Flower Legend. I'll make a reservation right now.

303
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,790
Okay.

304
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,940
Flower Legend?

305
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,490
Hello Jiang Jiang, ask Flower Legend if you can make a reservation today.
[Flower Legend: ¥6547 (~$930) per person]

306
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
What's wrong?

307
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,300
I'm fine. It's just that I'm too anxious to eat with you. My legs have become all soft.

308
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,830
Okay. I'll get going then.

309
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,550
Sorry, I want to resign.

310
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,170
I... I understand.

311
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,680
Are you too tired from work recently so you want to take a break?

312
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,130
After tired from working then you can come here again. We'll welcome you at anytime.

313
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,730
How can you just say that you want to resign?

314
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,910
Don't worry.

315
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,140
Whatever relationship you have with Director Shen, it doesn't.

316
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,330
- You have to help me with this favor.
- Do what?

317
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,420
It's like this, Meng Hui. In the past, Wei Lei was injured. You withdrew from the competition, too.

318
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,240
We would need to suspend our program.

319
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,160
How can we let that happen? I could only delay the finals of the contest.

320
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,940
Once postpone, human resources, material resources, financial,

So, we plan

to apologize to Director Shen not to pursue the problem regarding the schedule of this program.

Don't let the fund be withdrawn.

It's best if we can have an increase.

How come your clothes are still wet?

No, I came to apologize on behalf of the crew.

I'm sorry that the show wasn't able to air because of me.

because I cherish you a lot.

We can't.

A friend gave it to me.

464
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,870
Then you must have given your friend a really expensive gift.

465
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,120
If not, why would your friend also give back an expensive gift?

466
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,330
Are you saying this is a gift in return?

467
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,230
If it was Meng Hui, it's a gift in return.

468

You are really good to her, after all.

469

Boss, I got the one free food ordering coupon.

481
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,680
Look.

482
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,850
Order one more serving.

483
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,460
Boss.

484
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,830
You can also order one more serving.

485
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,590
- I can't eat all of it.
- Order it for your boyfriend.

486
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,070
Is it this one?

487
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,030
No.

488
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,720
Boss, we got one!

489
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,490
Boss, I also got one!

490
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,980
- Are you done?
- Almost.

491
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,750
- Hurry.
- Boss.

492
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,970
I got it, Boss.

493
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,460
Boss, me too.

494
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,240
Boss, I ordered another serving.

495
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,190
Boss!

496
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,160
I got 60 free coupons.

497
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,340
- Send it to me.
- Okay.

498
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,750
I'm so hungry.

499
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,960
I got it while order take out. Treat it like your midnight snack.

500
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,560
You're so awesome.

501
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,850
You could even get such good deals with the coupons, Emperor.

502
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,700
I'm just lucky.

503
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,950
Thank you for treating me to dinner. I'm very happy.

504
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,300
What should I eat?

505
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,700
Let me eat a hamburger.

506
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,580
- That's mine.
- Okay, fine.

507
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,510
That one... was it not my milky tea...

508
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,950
Is Shen Yi gone mad, just for the sake of a little advantage...

509
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,640
He's inviting the whole company to a midnight snack?

510
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,630
You will owe him favors if you accept his benefits.

511
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,250
Boss' illogical logic is good for us.

512
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,210
- Just finish eating.
- As long as we eat, it's okay.

513
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,860
Director Shen, this was prepared for Miss Meng based of your orders.

514

516
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,620
Make them as a sample set and send them to Meng Hui.

517
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,910
But... those are our luxury skincare products...

518
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:32,240
The newest... haven't got the sample sets yet.

519
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,020
You have one now.

15 milliliters.

523
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,500
If this adds up, it becomes formal wear.

524
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:09,720
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by My Girl Team @ Viki.com

525
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,270
Love is just like a sample. When it's gradually added up,

526
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,260
it becomes the weight of a formal wear.

527
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:26,070
♫  Life is like strolling in an endless circle  ♫

528
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:31,200
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

529
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,290
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

530
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:41,310
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

531
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:46,210
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

532
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:51,320
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

533
00:42:51,320 --> 00:43:00,070
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

534
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,620
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

535
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:15,490
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

536
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,220
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

537
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:30,510
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

538
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:35,520
♫  Leading me  ♫

539
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,990
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

540
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:49,860
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫
