♫  Ignite the fairy stick and close your eyes, wait for him to appear  ♫

[Episode 19: Anti-aging is just stalling for time]

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,240
Meng Hui.

22
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,770
You and Shen Yi's matter was done in such a rush.

23
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,800
I haven't been able to give him a gift for meeting each other.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,700
I specifically picked this out for you when I went to the gold shop the other day.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,210
Shen Yi is a kind and caring child. He knows how to live economically.

26
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,450
I wanted to gift you guys with something affordable.

27
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,300
Thank you, Mom.

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,210
There's also this. He'll definitely like it.

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,610
There's one last thing.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,780
Meng Hui, do you have something on your mind?

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,800
Mom, why did you and Dad

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
split up?

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,400
What other reason could we have had?

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,340
We didn't love each other anymore.

35
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,970
There was no point in forcing each other

36
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,580
to remain in a marriage.

37
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,960
Your dad and I split up early,

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,300
so I don't have too many feelings.

39
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,580
If we insisted on staying together because of you,

40
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,050
then we probably would hate each other now.

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,860
That's why we were so decisive back then.

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,040
It must've been hard for you all these years.

43
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,200
That's true. If two people no longer love each other,

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,370
then they might as well not get married.

45
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,420
Did you have a fight with Shen Yi?

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,600
No, he treats me very well.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,590
But he treats me so well it's as if he owes me something,

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,170
like he's trying to compensate me. But compensating isn't love.

49
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,900
Meng Hui, marriage requires love.

50
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,850
But loving someone and being in love are two different things.

51
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,860
In order for two people to maintain their relationship,

52
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,120
they need more than just passion and love. Whether it be remorse,

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,700
trust, or just out of habit,

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,700
at the end of the day, you will become like family, unable to be separated from each other.

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,160
Don't think so far into the future. Appreciate the present.

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,350
The bride is coming.

57
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,020
Here, come sit down.

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,040
Meng Hui, look.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,570
How's this bangle?

60
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,940
This bangle is from the same set as your Auntie's ring.

61
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,730
Try it on.

62
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Take the bangle first, as for the ring,

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,570
you will inherit it in the future.

64
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,230
No need, no need.

65
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,880
Director Shen, a call from the Qian Shan Enterprise. The financial department is looking for you.

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,360
Okay.

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,610
Shen Yi, come with me for a second.

68
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,660
Don't you think it's super tacky?

69
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,950
But it's expensive. It's a token of his regard.

70
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,890
Meng Hui, Auntie understands. Please don't feel discouraged.

71
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,150
I will watch over the planning of your wedding.

72
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,620
It definitely will not end up being an all-red wedding.

73
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,370
As for these old styles,

74
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,580
it's fine if you just pretend and only wear it in front of Shen Yi and his dad.

75
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,400
I prepared another set for you.

76
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,460
I designed it myself. The style is definitely not outdated.

77
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,250
Its price is also not any cheaper than the ones on the table here.

78
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,090
It'll also retain its value no matter where you go.

79
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,360
Accept it. This will be your secret stash of money in the future.

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,320
Uncle.

81
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,610
Meng Hui.

82
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,390
Is there a problem?

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,490
When Xiao Ba first showed up at Shen Yi's side,

84
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,620
why did you hate her so much, and why were you so against them being together?

85
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,380
Why was that?

86
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,990
You...

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,660
You found out everything?

88
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,990
You eventually agreed to us being together.

89
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,280
Was it because Shen Yi hurt me when he was younger,

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,790
so you wanted him to take responsibility?

91
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,860
Meng Hui, I won't comment on what Shen Yi's thoughts are.

92
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,910
Let me speak for myself first.

93
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,730
I've always had a poor relationship with Shen Yi in the past.

94
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,440
That was because when he was younger,

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,620
I never properly played the role of a father.

96
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,810
Ever since he met you,

97
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,410
because of you, he even called me "Dad".

98
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,080
In his form of address, I could hear his gratefulness,

99
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,320
and now,  through this same form of address,

100
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,140
I can hear his reliance.

101
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,580
Because of you, Shen Yi

102
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,660
has changed.

103
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,480
So why would I

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,190
insist on opposing your relationship?

105
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,960
But Uncle, at first, when you were against it,

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,100
it wasn't because you hated me, right?

107
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,350
You were only worried that when Shen Yi saw the scar on my face,

108
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,960
he would be reminded of what happened when he was younger.

109
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,460
Since you're already together now,

110
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,010
you should let go of the past.

111
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,380
Let's not bring it up again in the future.

112
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,540
Of course, I know that might be difficult to ask of you,

113
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,140
but because now I'm both your father.

114
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,220
I hope you two can be happy.

115
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,550
I won't tell Shen Yi about today.

116
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,500
From now on, I won't mention it ever again.

117
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,390
Meng Hui, before today,

118
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,730
it was always us hiding the truth from you.

119
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,470
But from today onwards, you and everyone else

120
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,060
will be the ones hiding it from Shen Yi.

121
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,700
Do you need to spray on so much?

122
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,200
Sunscreen, it's anti-aging.

123
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,780
How are you feeling lately?

124
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780
It's gotten worse.

125
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,250
How could it be getting worse?

126
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,840
I suddenly realized that I've been living in the illusion that everyone created for me.

127
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,890
It's a terrible feeling.

128
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,510
Are you planning on telling Shen Yi?

129
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,450
No.

130
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,590
Before, whenever I relapsed,

131
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,660
everyone would accommodate my act,

132
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,800
so that I could have an easier time.

133
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,900
Now I can be the one putting on an act,

134
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,960
so that it's easier for everyone else.

135
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,740
At the wedding, they'll ask about the relationship between the groom and the best man. What will you say?

136
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,750
Just say that we're schoolmates. You were my senior.

137
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,240
Okay, I will just say that I met you on your 18th birthday.

138
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,560
That's not right.

139
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,270
I told her before that I went to elementary school for three years overseas.

140
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,810
So you and I should've met at 21.

141
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,380
That's not right either. In actuality, you're three years younger than me.

142
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,510
But I'm supposed to be the same age as Meng Hui.

143
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,300
So you and I should also be the same age.

144
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,650
When you were 21, I should also be 21.

145
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,620
That's still incorrect. Meng Hui graduated from university in 2017.

146
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,570
You can't say that you met me in 2013 at my birthday party

147
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,610
because at that time, you and Meng Hui should've been preparing for the university entrance exam.

148
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,590
Are you ready?

149
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,460
Yes.

150
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,490
- Who is Zheng Jue?
- You.

151
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,870
- What is your current name?
- Shen Yi.

152
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,640
- Are you born in the year of the pig or is that Zheng Jue?
- Zheng Jue.

153
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,840
- What is Shen Yi's astrology sign?
- Virgo.

154
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,500
- Who's astrology sign is Leo?
- Zheng Jue.

155
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,970
How come even though I'm the same age as Meng Hui, I am your senior?

156
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,590
Because I went to elementary school for three years overseas.

157
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,320
- What is Zheng Jue's most hated food?
- Bitter melon.

158
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,100
What is Shen Yi's attitude towards bitter melon?

159
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,670
It's delicious.

160
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,220
Not bad. You're getting married soon.

161
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,260
You have to remember all of this. Don't blow your cover.

162
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,730
- Engrave it to your memory.
- All right. We can spot-check each other.

163
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,030
- Stay alert.
- Okay.

164
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

165
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,750
Boss.

166
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,870
These just arrived.

167
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,340
There's so much.

168
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,920
They're your gifts for your wedding.

169
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,970
These are elementary classmates giving to Zheng Jue. Put it away.

170
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,250
Also this one. Don't let Meng Hui see it.

171
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,200
Boss, this is the guest list the wedding company sent over.

172
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,840
Take a look and see if there's any problem that needs to be adjusted.

173
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,190
If there's none then we'll start handing them out.

174
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,820
You can't invite the elementary classmates. If they come then Meng Hui will find out.

175
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,770
Also middle school classmates. Meng Hui thought I was studying abroad during that time.

176
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,430
All of these people know that I'm Zheng Jue. You can't invite any of them.

177
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,520
But Director Shen, if I was your friend or classmate

178
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,830
and you're not inviting me to such an important thing like a wedding,

179
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,810
then there really are no sentiments between us.

180
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,070
I have no choice either. If I invite them,

181
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,860
then Meng Hui and I will have no relationship in the future either.

182
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,280
But Chairman and Chairwoman said before

183
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,370
that you and Ms. Meng's wedding must be grand.

184
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,510
Ms. Meng doesn't have a lot of friends.

185
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,450
You're getting rid of so many people. It's supposed to be a 500 person wedding.

186
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,460
In the end, there will only be a few people in attendance.

187
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,670
This scene won't look that great.

188
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,450
What about the television show from last time?

189
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,320
Director, producer, and workers. Invite all of them.

190
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,140
Boss, those are the people we're working with.

191
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,660
Most of them don't even know your name yet you're inviting them.

192
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,330
Isn't that not good?

193
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,190
They are all witnesses of my relationship with Meng Hui and our love.

194
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,260
It's not important if you don't know their names. The process is important.

195
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,410
Then have you thought if they really came,

196
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,390
then should they prepare gift money?

197
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,670
If they don't gift money at the wedding, will that seem too fake?

198
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,780
Then tell them I will return the money along with their gift.

199
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,340
Aren't you pretty much hiring movie extras then?

200
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,380
If it's not enough people then, Director Zhang, that we collaborate with the eye shadow,

201
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,130
call all their employees.

202
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,790
She's here. She's here. The Boss Lady is here.

203
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,790
She's here.

204
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,910
You came.

205
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,210
What is this?

206
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,680
This is a gift from a friend.

207
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,310
It's so cute.

208
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,260
Why is it missing an arm?

209
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,390
That's right.

210
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,040
Why is it missing a shoulder?

211
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,610
That... that's right.

212
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,950
That...

213
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,010
Return of the Condor Heroes.

214
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,580
One look at it and you can tell which close friend of yours are congratulating the both of you.

215
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,800
An immortal couple who will get along for hundreds of years

216
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,860
and last forever.

217
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,720
This is...

218
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,990
Wedding planner, here to plan your happy day.

219
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,360
I've long heard of you.

220
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,280
Return of Condor Heroes? Where's the condor?

221
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,530
This is the condor.

222
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,350
Our work right now

223
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,770
has reached the stage where we need to define the vision you have for your grand wedding.

224
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,250
Do you have any requests in this aspect, Director Shen?

225
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:24,720
As for my vision, I want a cold atmosphere with a sliver of warmth.

226
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,220
Within the warmth, I want a dignified elegance.

227
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,690
Within the elegance, there has to be a sense of endearment and playfulness.

228
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,160
It has to be a down-to-earth type of endearment.

229
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,270
Anything works with me. I'll listen to him.

230
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,870
Okay.

231
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,670
I can do that, a colorful black.

232
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,140
See if there's anything else we can help you with.

233
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,950
Oh right. I will some of Director Shen and Miss Meng's childhood photos

234
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,520
because according to the wedding itinerary, we'll show a clip of childhood  moments.

235
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,570
We're going to recall you two of developing.

236
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,430
This is a good idea. Our Director Shen must've look nice when he was young.

237
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,990
My... my childhood

238
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,640
photos...

239
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,220
Do you not have photos?

240
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,650
- That's right. That—
- I don't.

241
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,050
I don't have childhood photos.

242
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,660
It's because

243
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,790
when we were young that...

244
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,890
It's fine. My childhood has nothing good to recall about.

245
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,660
Actually, this segment is optional.

246
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,680
That's right.

247
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,760
After all, you two growing up isn't important.

248
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,960
The memories before loving each other have no meaning.

249
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,820
What is important

250
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,290
are your future memories which are worth keeping.

251
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,990
Good!

252
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,660
You said it so well.

253
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
This phrase is so amazing.

254
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,990
Jiang Jiang,

255
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,790
send them Meng Hui and my daily life photos. We'll use that on the wedding day.

256
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,270
Okay.

257
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,430
Everyone, let us all work hard together

258
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,230
to arrange for this grand wedding.

259
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,960
Okay.

260
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,680
Our company will definitely provide the most impeccable and highest quality of service, but it's getting late.

261
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,250
Normally, I should treat everyone to dinner.

262
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,510
You're so courteous.

263
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,450
Mobilization of staff.

264
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,740
But the recent salary of the company

265
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,960
is indeed a bit lacking

266
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,680
so...

267
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,300
I understand what you mean.

268
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,710
Sui An is treating everyone for dinner tonight.

269
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,220
Then I might as well accept than try to respectfully decline.

270
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,750
Please join our company for dinner.

271
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,600
Boss, I'm sorry. I forgot to remind them.

272
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,050
Forgot what?

273
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,390
Our Boss never eats bitter melon.

274
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,660
Don't spout nonsense. Who doesn't eat bitter melon?

275
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,650
I don't eat bitter melon.

276
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,420
- No.
- Sui An doesn't eat bitter melon.

277
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,560
Boss, you used to tell us to never order bitter melon.

278
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,250
Who said it?

279
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,270
I don't like eating bitter melon. It's me who doesn't like eating it.

280
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,270
Do you hear that?

281
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,940
Meng Hui doesn't eat bitter melon. Hurry and take it away. Don't let me see it.

282
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,880
Waiter!

283
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,270
It got taken away.

284
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,300
Eat this one.

285
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,110
Put it in, okay?

286
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,050
Hello, everyone.

287
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,720
Director Xu?

288
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,190
The boss of the restaurant told me that there was a LS Company gathering today and they asked why I didn't come.

289
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,360
I didn't tell them that I already resigned.

290
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,120
I couldn't tell everyone when I left

291
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,920
so I brought two bottles of alcohol.

292
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,040
You guys won't think I disturbed you guys right?

293
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,600
No, you won't.

294
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,380
That's good then. Waiter.

295
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,540
Open the wine.

296
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,800
Thank you.

297
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,590
You eat it.

298
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,450
Eat some of this. This one is tasty. I'll help you get some.

299
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,380
Here. A toast for Director Shen and Miss Meng.

300
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,870
Wishing that your love endures forever.

301
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,840
Forever!

302
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,790
Stop drinking.

303
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,500
Drink less.

304
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,710
Drink less. If you drink more then it's easy for you to talk nonsense.

305
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,380
Shen Yi, after working with you all these years, I'm leaving just like this.

306
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,570
But I'm thankful for your help.

307
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,240
Thank you for recommending me to Qian Shan Enterprise.

308
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,430
Let me give you a toast. Starting from today, let's be happy.

309
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,320
Shen Yi has a bad alcohol tolerance.

310
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,400
If you want to drink,

311
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,490
then I'll keep you company.

312
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,780
- Come on.
- Shen Yi, let's drink.

313
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm fine.

314
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,000
What are you thinking about?

315
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,930
You drank a lot.

316
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,040
I'm happy.

317
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:10,350
Do you remember the questions that I asked you before?

318
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,920
I remember. Do you remember?

319
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,790
- Who is Zheng Jue?
- That's me.

320
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,320
That's right. It's you.

321
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,240
What's his zodiac sign?

322
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,050
Pig. I'm a pig.

323
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,450
Who is a Leo?

324
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,150
I am a Leo.

325
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,090
Who are you?

326
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,130
I'm Zheng Jue.

327
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,010
The Zheng Jue of Zheng Jue.

328
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,640
Who doesn't like eating bitter melon?

329
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,330
I don't like eating bitter melon. I was about to throw up just now.

330
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,760
Meng Hui's face

331
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,950
who marked it?

332
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,320
I marked it.

333
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,190
Wrong!

334
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,540
It was me.

335
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,510
It was me who did it.

336
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,760
We have to tell Meng Hui that you did it. That's right.

337
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,490
That's right.

338
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,750
Come over.

339
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,450
What happened before

340
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,380
don't tell anyone else.

341
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,160
No one else.

342
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,100
Do you hear me?

343
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,610
I can't anymore.

344
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,110
You're drunk.

345
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,210
I'm tired.

346
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,450
You know it.

347
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,860
Meng Hui, you knew it all along.

348
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,070
Also you and you.

349
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,900
You all knew.

350
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,490
Everyone of you,

351
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,980
you all know...

352
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,130
- Come on. Let's sober up. Come on.
- I'm not drunk.

353
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,140
- You are drunk.
- I'm not. I can still...

354
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,970
Let's go get some fresh air.

355
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,310
- Bye.
- Bye.

356
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,090
How did you all know?

357
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,070
The scenery will look very nice.

358
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,100
Please forget about what happened today.

359
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,210
I'll drink first.

360
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,640
Then... let's discuss the scar-fading serum.

361
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,540
Okay.

362
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,070
- Shen Yi.  Sui An.
- Ever since we got the patent...

363
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,260
- Sui An.
- Wait, wait, wait...

364
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,890
What situation are you talking about?

365
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,650
We might have ruined your business.

366
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,180
Hello, Wei Lei?

367
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,220
Sui An is drunk, can you come get him?

368
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,210
I'll text you the address.

369
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,230
My head hurts.

370
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,060
Hello, Jiang Jang.

371
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,290
Did I drink a lot last night?

372
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,420
Well... not a whole lot.

373
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,490
How come I don't remember anything?

374
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,340
Did I cause any problem?

375
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,710
No, you didn't.

376
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,130
Why are you stuttering?

377
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,720
Is there something you are not telling me?

378
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,060
N-No, of course not.

379
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,100
I'll be at the office soon. You'd better tell me

380
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,930
everything that happened last night

381
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,080
without leaving out a single detail.

382
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,610
Well, Boss, I'm taking a day off today.

383
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,000
Why?

384
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,750
I'm getting a medical check-up.

385
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,170
Okay, then tell me everything tomorrow.

386
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,630
- I have to do blood tests tomorrow.
- Then the day after tomorrow.

387
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,910
- The day after tomorrow I have to undergo an endoscopy.
- Then the day after that.

388
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,000
That day I have check-ups scheduled for my ears, nose, throat, and eyes.

389
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,810
Your medical check-up is really all encompassing.

390
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,300
Well, I'm going to be busy this month.

391
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,620
Sorry, Director Shen. Goodbye.

392
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,610
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

393
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,890
What should I do? Should I cover things up for Meng Hui in front of Shen Yi,

394
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,980
as well as cover up for Shen Yi in front of Meng Hui?

395
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,380
This is...

396
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,490
I'm going to end up with a split personality if I have to go on like this.

397
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,480
So you choose to escape.

398
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,080
How can you stay so calm? Aren't you worried too?

399
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,470
Anxiety only makes the situation worse for you.

400
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,110
Do you have a solution?

401
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,600
No.

402
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,800
How do you stop yourself from feeling anxious?

403
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,220
Ah Tao, I'm curious about something.

404
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,920
As a psychologist, have you ever encountered a problem you cannot resolve?

405
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,220
I feel as if you'd never need help from someone else.

406
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,040
Of course I have problems.

407
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,360
Your problem is my problem.

408
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,530
I can only be happy if you are happy.

409
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,180
- Really?
- Yes.

410
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,930
Wait, if my problem is your problem,

411
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,190
then I am the cause of your problem.

412
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,230
Don't think of it that way.

413
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,780
Forget it. I am just useless in your eyes.

414
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,520
- I'd like to pay the bill.
- One moment please.

415
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,950
Can I pay with my credit card?

416
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,880
No need, sir. The lady over there already paid.

417
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,430
- Hello.
- Hello, Sui An. Did we both get drunk last night?

418
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,170
I guess so.

419
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,740
Please tell me the truth about this.

420
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,000
What?

421
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,780
Do I have a habit of saying the wrong things when I am drunk?

422
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,380
- You do.
- Are you sure?

423
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,950
I've only witnessed it once.

424
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,250
From the possibility,

425
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,330
whether we can confirm it or not, it doesn't matter right?

426
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,860
From the possibility then that is one hundred percent.

427
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,780
Don't worry, Shen Yi.

428
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,860
If you caused a problem with what you said,

429
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,090
I'm sure I would have fixed the situation for you.

430
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,340
What about you?

431
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,430
Will you also spout nonsense if you're drunk?

432
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,360
I won't.

433
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,100
I usually don't get drunk.

434
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,630
But from what I know about you, I think you wouldn't.

435
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,540
Hello? Hello?

436
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,640
Did you really do something?

437
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,640
How come I don't feel at ease?

438
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,560
I didn't say anything wrong

439
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,240
but...

440
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,890
I've seem to have done something wrong.

441
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,170
You're awake. Do you still remember what you did yesterday?

442
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,620
Yesterday, what did I do?

443
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,290
If you can't drink then don't drink so much.

444
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,950
Have you thought about the severe consequences of drinking too much and not being able to control it?

445
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,700
- Do you know that a woman's—
- Enough.

446
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,030
I understand. I will take responsibility.

447
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,830
You...

448
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,800
will be responsible for me?

449
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,910
I'm being serious.

450
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,330
Don't worry. I wasn't forced to take responsibility.

451
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,280
Then...

452
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,110
Then what are you thinking of me right now?

453
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,170
A sooner or later attitude.

454
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,650
Since you said that you'll be responsible,

455
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,690
should we continue from before?

456
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,880
I want to calm down a bit first.

457
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,780
I keep feeling like last night

458
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,460
had some things

459
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,190
that I forgot about.

460
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,090
Then I'll get going first.

461
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,280
Wait a second.

462
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,860
Let's have dinner tonight.

463
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,080
Okay, no problem.

464
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,880
See you tonight.

465
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,630
I really traveled far and wide to search for it

466
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,580
and found it without any efforts.

467
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,580
- Hello, Wei Lei.
- Ah Tao, let me tell you.

468
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,140
Just now, I–

469
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,040
I caught the white wolf with empty hands.

470
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,110
Caught the white wolf?

471
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,670
Come in.

472
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,280
Dr. Sui, this is the list for the appointments for tomorrow.

473
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,850
Wait a second.

474
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,690
Reserve a place for me near the window at Latamu restaurant for tonight.

475
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,120
Put a rose on there as well.

476
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,490
Okay.

477
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,080
Order a small cake.

478
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,590
Make it very pretty.

479
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,570
The ones that girls like.

480
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,150
Okay, I'll go do it.

481
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,600
Oh right. Meng Hui called this afternoon and you weren't here.

482
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
She told me to tell you when I see you

483
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,570
that she has something to talk to you about.

484
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,750
I know.

485
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,720
I actually have something to tell you today.

486
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,560
What is it?

487
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,320
Yesterday, you and Shen Yi were drunk.

488
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,590
That's right.

489
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:57,590
Did we do something overboard and say drunk words that we shouldn't be saying?

490
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,280
It's not drunk words.

491
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,130
It's true words.

492
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,970
What true words? Don't overthink.

493
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,460
Shen Yi is actually Zheng Jue.

494
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,990
The person who marked my face was him and no you, right?

495
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,660
Come in.

496
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,840
Hello, Miss Wei.

497
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,320
Did Dr. Sui forget about me? How come it's been so long and he hasn't came back yet?

498
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,950
How could he?

499
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,960
Let me tell you. Dr. Sui told me today

500
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,960
to reserve a popular French restaurant near the window.

501
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,420
He even told me to prepare roses that were this big

502
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,960
and a girl's most favorite

503
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,760
small cake. I worked with Dr. Sui for many years.

504
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,660
I've never seen him be so considerate to any other girl.

505
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,960
Really? Then is it a pink cake?

506
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,140
There's also a little heart.

507
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,070
You took care of it, right? Love you.

508
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,810
Go do your work.

509
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,370
Meng Hui, don't misunderstand. There must be something wrong.

510
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,530
I'm the one that's Zheng Jue.

511
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,410
Sui An, thank you.

512
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,860
You helped Shen Yi and I do so many things

513
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,530
but this is my business with him. I don't want a third person to get involved

514
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,020
so in the future, don't take this to heart.

515
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,500
I already know everything and I'm no longer scared.

516
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,220
Shen Yi is very lucky to have a friend like you.

517
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,310
I am also very grateful for all your help.

518
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,580
I'm  really not as good as you think I am.

519
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,440
I'm actually the one to blame and it's all my fault. From the start,

520
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,250
it...

521
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,760
And what?

522
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,220
Did you eat dinner yet?

523
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,830
Not yet.

524
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,100
- I just bought it. Take this and go eat it.
- Thank you.

525
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,010
Couple's Cups?

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,540

527
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,260
Earrings?

528
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,170
Go upstairs.

529
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,880
Thank you.

530
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,160
Don't be courteous to me.

531
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,030
I won't tell Shen Yi about what happened today.

532
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,100
I'll go upstairs now.

533
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,330
I'm sorry Wei Lei, I had a lot of important things to do tonight.

534
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,450
I forgot you were here.

535
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,150
Explain this to me, who is this?

536
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,410
Where did you find this?

537
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,010
If I didn't find this then would you not tell me you had this pair?

538
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,560
All the things are new which means you recently received it.

539
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,670
You're being a two-timer.

540
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,160
Wei Lei, you've misunderstood.

541
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,200
I've never liked anyone else except you.

542
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,530
Like?

543
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,930
To you, I'm just so unimportant.

544
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,830
You placed me out of your mind and totally forgot me

545
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,480
and you even said that you like me?

546
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,960
Then what do you think the situation should be like?

547
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,930
What kind of explanation do you want?

548
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,900
Did you...

549
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,970
Forget it. I don't want to know.

550
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,270
Tell me who you met.

551
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,570
If you say it then I'll believe you.

552
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,550
- I met Meng Hui.
- You're lying.

553
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,350
How could you forget me if you're meeting Meng Hui?

554
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,160
What I said is the truth, Wei Lei.

555
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,060
What about the little cake?

556
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,740
T-There's no little cake.

557
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,750
You're lying. Your assistant already told me the,

558
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,140
restaurant, flowers, and also the little cake.

559
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,540
I'll go buy it now.

560
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,770
Who did you give the cake to?

561
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,120
- I gave it to Meng Hui.
- Do you think I will believe you?

562
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,970
Miss Wei, Miss Wei! You can't go in.

Miss Wei, this isn't appropriate.

This isn't good.

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,170
Why are you here?

570
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,440
- What are you doing? What is this?
- Stop looking.

571

Tell me, who gave those to Sui An?

572
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,640
The gifts are all for couples, is he having another girlfriend?

573
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,780
What do you mean by another girlfriend?

574
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,290
Or it's someone you've kept in your heart.

575

These couple cups, pillows,

and this custom-made puzzle. Who gave it to him?
