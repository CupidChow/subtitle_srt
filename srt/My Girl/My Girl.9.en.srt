21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
What are you doing?

22
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,400
Every day, I see you with a peach.

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,800
Why are you eating a peach during work hours?

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Did you feed the fish?

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes, I did. I treat them as if they are my children.

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll give you two of them.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Thank you.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,200
Where were you?

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm getting older. I needed to go to the bathroom.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
How come you brushed your teeth now?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
I worked overnight.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't let the clients see you like this.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
- Get off work early.
- Okay.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,100
Clean up your stuff.

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,800
Didn't you sleep last night?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
I've been very busy lately, working a lot of nights.

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,600
You should rest when you are tired, and not spend time playing games.

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,800
It's important to maintain a regular daily routine.

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't just read books related to work.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Read some novels and essays as well to broaden your perspective.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Although our purpose at LS is to service 4S women,

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,600
but to men,

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,500
sophisticated inner qualities are also very important.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,000
You can only improve your work efficiency if you maintain a tidy work area.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
This is one of the qualities that S4 women should have.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,300
Self-discipline.

47
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,200
With self-discipline comes freedom.

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,500
It's important to go to the gym each day for an hour.

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,700
Come in.

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,200
Here's your coffee, Ms. Xu.

51
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Thanks.

52
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Is this not freshly brewed coffee?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
I made it with coffee powder. I didn't know

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,000
there would be a difference, but since you drink coffee a lot, you could tell.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,600
I am not an expert on the subject,

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,200
but I do drink a lot of coffee, so I know the difference in taste.

57
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Are these shoes new?

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,900
They're so pretty! Are they UR?

59
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,200
Those brands are worn by you young people.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Stylish, you know? To be stylish.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,600
Director Xu, it's like this. I want to report something to you.

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,000
In the last quarter, we already exceeded our budget,

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,800
so there are some videos that we still haven't been able to come to an agreement on.

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,200
The suppliers are asking whether, regarding to the expenses, we could...

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,600
You still haven't handled the proposal from last month?

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,000
What you're missing

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,400
is not being smart enough.

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,200
Fine, I'll discuss it with the agency later.

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,000
Give these files to Director Shen.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
Okay.

71
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,600
Boss, I already put the files away for you.

72
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
Okay.

73
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Hello, Director Meng.

[Report on the termination of the development of LS's liquid foundation]

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,700
His goal is to make that liquid foundation this lifetime.

76
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Why did Vice President Xu come back so early?

77
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,800
Once she came back, my stomach hurts.

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
My heart also hurts.

79
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,500
Don't you think her style is different from all of us?

80
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,600
She treats the office like she's walking the red carpet everyday.

81
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Who could possibly match her style?

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Vice President Xu, Director Meng called you to her office.

83
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,400
Director Meng? Which Director Meng?

84
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,270
Why are you here?

85
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,800
Why didn't you tell me such an important decision?

86
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
I didn't request you to do this right?

87
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Are you helping the Boss make decisions now?

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,200
What's wrong with helping the Boss make decisions?

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,400
Do I have to report what I did?

90
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,190
Vice President Xu, I think you don't know the current situation.

91
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
It's a good thing to share your Boss' burden

92
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
but if you get too involved,

93
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,400
then you're just meddling in other people's business.

94
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,800
I think you're the one who doesn't know your position.

95
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Based on what should you be interfering with Shen Yi's work?

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,700
Is this HR?

97
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,000
In half an hour, prepare to let her resign. I don't want to see her.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,700
What right do you have to fire me?

99
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,200
I'm the Vice President of Xiamei.

100
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Fine, then tell me our company's philosophy on flawed beauty.

101
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,800
Perhaps, I'll give you another chance.

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Flawed beauty, beauty without flaws.

104
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
You don't understand what unflawed means right?

105
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,300
At LS, we service 4S women.

106
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,100
Smart, stylish, sophisticated, and self-disciple.

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,600
Don't think that by sitting here,

108
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
you are the CEO.

109
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Shen Yi is just playing house with you.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Did you think that if you learned some superficial knowledge, Shen Yi would fall for you?

111
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,200
He's just putting up with your childishness and immaturity.

112
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,300
You don't understand him at all.

113
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,600
Call two security guards.

114
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,000
You don't understand Xiamei and Shen Yi.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,400
Are you leaving yourself or do you want me to invite you?

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,900
Director Meng fired Vice President Xu.

117
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
- Is this real?
- Meng Hui is amazing.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
When firing a staff, you need to pay N an additional month of salary.

119
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Director Meng, calm down.

120
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,000
We're doomed this time.

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sorry.

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,600
This was all of a sudden. I didn't have a chance to tell you about Meng Hui.

123
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,400
This is too much, Shen Yi.

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,600
What right does Meng Hui have? Did you give her the right?

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
This is complicated

126
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
but I don't want to explain it to you.

127
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Don't want to explain it to me?

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,200
Shen Yi, ever since I created this company with you until now,

129
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,600
I never discussed anything else with you other than company issues.

130
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I hope at least at the company,

131
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,400
you can treat me as a business partner that you can trust.

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,200
At least tell me why.

133
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
How about this?

134
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,000
I can guarantee that I'll think of a way to make her leave.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
You've been working hard recently.

136
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I'll give you a three day break. Rest well.

137
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,800
She said I don't understand Xiamei

138
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,600
or you. I knew you for four years.

139
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
I know what you want.

140
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Beauty without flaws,

141
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,200
so you persisted to make the liquid foundation.

142
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,600
We know how hard it is to make a formula with liquid foundation to cover a scar

143
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,200
but I never said it wouldn't work

144
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,000
because that's what you want to do and I'll support that.

145
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,500
I don't blame you for what happened today.

146
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I know you have your reasons.

147
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,440
After three days, I'll come back to work.

148
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
- I want to talk to you.
- Hold up.

149
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Aren't you having a meeting?

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,100
Let's talk after you finish the meeting.

151
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Boss, let's have the meeting first.

152
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,390
Who made this proposal?

153
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,400
When I saw the report today, I was thinking

154
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
our company's technology is top-notch.

155
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,800
Our concepts are also in line with current trends.

156
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,200
We're doing great in all aspects but why are we losing money?

157
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Until I saw this proposal today,

158
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
I finally understood.

159
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,200
The proposal is not bad.

160
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Ultra flat tube, futuristic, creative.

161
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
It's great.

162
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,600
The proposal suggests an ultra flat tube.

163
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,400
Yes, the shape is quite unique.

164
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,000
But compared to other shapes, the manufacturing progress is more complicated and it costs more.

165
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,400
The brow pencils on the market right now all use round plastic tubes.

166
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,200
Consumers are already used to it.

167
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
There's no point in trying to be innovative.

168
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,700
Yeah, that's what I said before...

169
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,440
Let's talk about colors. What is trendy now is natural eyebrow shape and coloring.

170
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,850
Thick eyebrows are so out of fashion.

171
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,510
Yet you guys developed this... graphite gray?

172
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,770
Multicolored black? Did you guys even do market research?

173
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,420
I've known a long time ago that these colors are not good.

174
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,190
They are really not good.

175
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,250
Let's talk about pricing. Even though our company is focused on high-end cosmetics,

176
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,790
our eyebrow pencil sales are not as good as our other products.

177
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,800
Eyebrow pencils are usually cheap and do what they're supposed to.

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,710
A two hundred dollar eyebrow pencil may not work any better than a twenty dollar one.

179
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,120
I already talked to you...

180
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,950
About this.

181
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,750
Why are you looking at me? You didn't disagree then.

182
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,050
We didn't agree either.

183
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,190
Redo the proposal.

184
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,860
But—

185
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,460
Who should we listen to?

186
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,470
What do you think?

187
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,550
Let's hear from you.

188
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,350
We'll listen to Director Meng.

189
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,270
We'll work on it again.

190
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,130
Listen, I want LS cosmetic lines

191
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,110
to become the bestselling products this year.

192
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,030
Don't you think we are dealing with a whole new food chain now?

193
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,580
I think Director Meng has a unique vision.

194
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,920
Listen, I think there is something going on between the two of them.

195
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,410
Have you ever seen Director Shen listen to another person before?

196
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,680
- Everybody...
- Director Meng.

197
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,690
- Hi, Director Meng.
- How are you doing, Director Meng?

198
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,260
Director Meng.

199
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,270
Thanks for your good work, Director Meng.

200
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,190
Work on two proposals... the original one and a second one.

201
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,770
Oh.

202
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,670
It doesn't matter who is at the top of the food chain,

203
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,410
because we are always at the bottom.

204
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,690
Let's get back to work.

205
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,910
- Get up.
- I can't do it anymore.

206
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,130
I'll die if I keep working.

207
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,660
You've worked hard the last two days doing overtime.

208
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,710
I'll be giving each of you a present.

209
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,840
You've never talked to me about this.

210
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,350
Be quiet.

211
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,150
The financial manager will receive a pillow for his neck and back pain.

212
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,070
Xiao Mei will get a wardrobe bonus.

213
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,640
The marketing manager will get approval for a flexible work schedule.

214
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,200
The product manager will get a vacation for two to Bali.

215
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,630
Wang Da Wu will receive two tickets to a basketball game.

216
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,870
Jiang Jiang, you'll get a box of peaches.

217
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,540
You'll get a ticket to a concert.

218
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,360
You will receive an Iron Man figurine.

219
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,900
You'll be receiving your gifts in a couple of days.

220
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,540
Gosh, Bali!

221
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,710
You'll be getting a present too.

222
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,050
Looks more and more like underground office romance to me.

223
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,190
I've reached my limits.

224
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,840
But what do we do with Meng Hui?

225
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Her condition might get worse if she leaves the company.

226
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,940
I'll think of something.

227
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,680
My company will close if she stays.

228
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,170
Didn't you say she gets along well with everyone?

229
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,160
Do you spend time at your company cultivating relationships with your employees?

230
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,270
She thinks of herself as a God,  not as a CEO.

231
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,970
How would she know what each person wants?

232
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,880
She is simply wasting money.

233
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,650
Director Shen.

234
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,800
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

235
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,260
There were a lot of people around just then, and I also felt a bit embarrassed because of my age,

236
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,460
but I want to thank you.

237
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,300
Thank me for what?

238
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,000
I have been having a lot of neck pain recently.

239
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,480
I never thought you would be aware of that

240
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,670
and give me a pillow to alleviate the pain.

241
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,620
You don't need to thank me.

242
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,520
I just want to come over and tell you thanks.

243
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,680
Director Shen.

244
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,350
I never thought you would be like this.

245
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,620
You might look aloof, but you are really warm-hearted.

246
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,940
You can tell that my relationship with my wife is not very good,

247
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,280
so you gave me a couple's vacation package.

248
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,650
I am so thankful toward you.

249
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,550
I'm glad you like it.

250
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,630
Director Shen, let me work on the new product research.

251
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,330
I might not be able to achieve a perfect scar-concealing effect,

252
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:31,370
but I will work hard to make it the best product.

253
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,190
Let me report to you about something else. Our new product can already

254
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,860
beat all the other foundations currently on the market.

255
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,180
- I appreciate it.
- It's my job.

256
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,790
Thanks, Director Shen. We're going back to work.

257
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,630
Go ahead. Keep up the good work.

258
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,100
Thanks, Director Shen.

259
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
Thanks for the great gift.

260
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,740
How do you know what each of the employees wants?

261
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,640
The financial manager's computer is put on his desk 10 cms higher than usual.

262
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,650
This shows that he must be dealing with neck and back pain.

263
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,070
Xiao Mei is acting like she has a new crush,

264
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,790
so she will appreciate new clothes.

265
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,240
The marketing manager has to keep an eye on data,

266
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,940
so he's drinking a lot of tea each day.

267
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,820
The product manager is stuck in the research lab all day;

268
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,240
the scratches on his face is likely a result of his fights with his wife.

269
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,620
So I think he will benefit from taking a couple's vacation.

270
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,740
You should think of your employees like your family.

271
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,680
You should develop a relationship with them,

272
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,720
attend to their needs and they will attend to yours. This is what entrepreneurship should be like.

273
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,900
If you only see them as tools,

274
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,870
then you are just a lone warrior.

275
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,960
You always give off a feeling of loneliness,

276
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,720
with a sour expression on your face,

277
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,830
as if everybody owes you.

278
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,200
You really don't need to be like that.

279
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,660
I never knew you were so perceptive.

280
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,260
I like to closely observe.

281
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,140
Well...

282
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,400
what do you want?

283
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,700
I want to do research on liquid foundation.

284
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,430
Why?

285
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,330
Because that's what you want. It's my gift to you.

286
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,210
You are doing it for me?

287
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,290
You came to work at the company in order to give me the liquid foundation?

288
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,970
No wonder when Xing Yao said she would stop it

289
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,990
and you got so mad.

290
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,580
You wouldn't be mad that I fired her right?

291
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,940
Even though you guys knew each other for many years but she doesn't understand you.

292
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,240
She even told me that LS's flawed beauty means beauty without flaws.

293
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,130
That's is wrong, right?

294
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,690
If she doesn't even understand the company's philosophy on beauty,

295
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,200
then she's just a robot working on an assembly line.

296
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,050
Our Xiamei doesn't need a robot like her.

297
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,010
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by My Girl Team @ Viki.com

298
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,480
Then... what do you like about me?

299
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,410
I went to your house and saw the charity certificates on the wall. I  know

300
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,100
that you're a person that's cold on the outside but very warm in the inside.

301
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,390
I like you. Even though I was hurt by this world before,

302
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,810
but I can have the warmth to face this world.

303
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,650
I'm not as good as what you think.

304
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,990
I did wrong things when I was young.

305
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,230
I hurt a girl.

306
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,260
I avoided my mistakes before.

307
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,460
Until now, I still didn't look for her.

308
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,990
If you really feel very apologetic,

309
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,570
why don't you take the initiative to look for her?

310
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,420
If I were her and saw you right now, no matter what you did,

311
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,750
I will definitely forgive you.

312
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,240
Why?

313
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,990
Because you're talented and amazing.

314
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,870
Look! This is our newest order form. I never thought I'd be earning money from making cosmetics.

315
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,990
Sit down. Follow the protocol.

316
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,940
I let Director Zhang look at the new proposal.

317
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,020
Do you still remember who Director Zhang is?

318
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,570
I remember. The senior that I met at the golf field.

319
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,910
The eye shadow from his company is very popular.

320
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,360
He said he wants to do a collaboration with us and release a product together.

321
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,890
- Are you happy?
- I wouldn't have these results without your help.

322
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,880
Then do you know where your problem is right now?

323
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,600
If you want to make cosmetics, you can't only rely on capital.

324
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,830
If you have time, watch some Korean dramas,

325
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,030
look at some Japanese fashion magazines. You need to improve your sense of aesthetics.

326
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,900
You have to love this industry.

327
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,540
Love?

328
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,240
Just like this time, you relied on an eyebrow pencil and eye shadow

329
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,710
to make up for the imperfections and attributes.

330
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,090
Don't you feel full of confidence and a sense of accomplishment?

331
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:18,120
Sorry. After going to the rooftop yesterday, I got a cold.

332
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,180
What a coincidence. I also went to the rooftop.

333
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:36,070
After skin care, the first step is to apply primer all throughout your face.

334
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,900
The next step is to apply foundation.

335
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,180
This foundation is good for combination and oily skin.

336
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,070
Shen Yi, how come Meng Hui is still here?

337
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,730
Why are you here?

338
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,680
- Sit down first.
- Brow pencil to outline the shape and fill it in carefully.

339
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,770
Xing Yao, I want to discuss something with you.

340
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,370
Can you go on paid leave for a while?

341
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,300
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I know.

342
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,290
You and Meng Hui can't show up at the company at the same time.

343
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,640
So you're saying that you want me to leave and let her stay?

344
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,710
It's just for a short time.

345
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,690
Shen Yi, I started working with you when the company was worth nothing.

346
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,500
Now the company has grown and prospered,

347
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,860
if you think Meng Hui is so capable, then have her work in the company.

348
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,560
You can even give her a position as a director.

349
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,330
But how can she replace you as the CEO?

350
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,140
As your working partner,

351
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,240
I cannot accept your arbitrary attitude.

352
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,710
You are not the Shen Yi I knew and worked with for four years.

353
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,390
What secret are you hiding?

354
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,250
It's not me. It's Meng Hui.

355
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,460
I can tell you the truth,

356
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,390
but you have to promise to keep the secret for me and Meng Hui.

357
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,000
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

358
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,980
I hope you can understand my decision.

359
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,470
I have to find a way to help her recover.

360
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,800
I understand you,

361
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,520
but I am concerned that you are misguided into making wrongful decisions.

362
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,960
Since it's all a misunderstanding, I'll continue to have trust in you.

363
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,530
I can stay and take care of her.

364
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,910
I'd be happy if you stay, but...

365
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,930
Though you've known each other for many years, she doesn't understand you.

366
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,350
She even said that LS's flawed beauty means beauty without flaws.

367
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,150
How can she recover from her disorder?

368
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:04,450
From what I know, she wants to help me develop a liquid foundation.

369
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,220
So even if our current formula cannot perfectly conceal scars,

370
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,480
I still want to do a new product release.

371
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,510
In doing so, it might help in her recovery.

372
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,310
Don't worry. I'll go and apologize to her.

373
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,530
You have more important things to take care of.

374
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,580
At the investors' meeting, you will be grilled

375
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,380
about the development of liquid foundation. It would be a fight for you.

376
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Don't worry. I'll take care of the problem between me and Meng Hui.

377
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,880
- Why are you here?
- Director Meng.

378
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,260
It was me who stopped the work on the liquid foundation.

379
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,870
We have not been successful at coming up with a formula. If we had kept at it,

380
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,540
it would be simply wasting money. Now Director Shen wants to work on a new liquid foundation

381
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,400
without scar-concealing effects.

382
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,490
The investors are not happy about it.

383
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,050
What if Director Shen cannot appease them?

384
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,770
LS might lose all its investors.

385
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,280
I'm afraid you are the only person

386
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,510
who could resolve this crisis for the company.

387
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,900
Where is Shen Yi? Tell him to come to my office.

388
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,390
He is in a meeting with the investors.

389
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,060
How come he is at the meeting alone? Why did no one tell me?

390
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,800
He does not want the investors to treat you harshly,

391
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,040
so he is taking over the responsibility for you.

392
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,310
I cannot let him attend the meeting alone.

393
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,690
Director Shen, we gave you our money

394
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,830
because we trusted you.

395
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,230
I understand. That's why I am grateful that you are willing to meet with me today.

396
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,960
Let's do away with pretty words.

397
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,220
We are all businessmen, and we cannot continue to invest without a prospect of profits.

398
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,950
I say we should immediately cut the losses. We're not going to invest anymore.

399
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,210
Whether we do the liquid foundation or not is up to you.

400
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,710
Our company has always been in charge of LS's publicity.

401
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,650
In an interview last year,

402
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,670
how much controversy did you cause when you said you'd make this foundation?

403
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,440
Now you said you won't work on it anymore.

404
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,670
Whether you're going to make it or not, who's going to make this decision?

405
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,680
I admit that the research on a flaw-concealing foundation

406
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,590
was solely my idea from the beginning. I take full responsibility.

407
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,960
How?

408
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,860
That's right.

409
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,510
If the new product does not turn a profit, I will provide compensation for your loss.

410
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,730
I just said that I was going to rely on you.

411
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,860
You also believe in this?

412
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,630
Shen Yi, who are you apologizing to?

413
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,200
Why are you here?

414
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,130
Go back first. I'll tell you when I go back, okay?

415
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,200
Leave? How can I leave you here alone?

416
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,810
- Who is this?
- Who?

417
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,770
How can I leave when they are bullying you?

418
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,030
Were you yelling at him?

419
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,820
Me? I didn't.

420
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,180
Then who did?

421
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,510
Do you know who he is?

422
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,920
He's Shen Yi, the son of Shen Qian Shan.

423
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,930
He is my man.

424
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,160
See? Didn't I say they are a couple?

425
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,100
After they went to the rooftop together, they both came down with a cold.

426
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,140
How do you think they got infected?

427
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,310
I'm glad I don't have to keep a secret anymore.

428
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,240
Be quiet.

429
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,270
Director Shen, what do you say?

430
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,890
She's right.

431
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,560
Please excuse my bluntness, but

432
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,920
you're all garbage.

433
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,390
Losers like you

434
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,020
who invest a little bit of money but demand a lot in return,

435
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,590
aren't you blood-suckers? I use the money I make from real estate,

436
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,900
restaurant and entertainment business to support this company, whereas you

437
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,480
want to reap profit by doing nothing. You are ungrateful and unreasonable.

438
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,540
Rather than raising you guys, I would do charity.

439
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,870
Aren't you here to ask? Just in time, let me ask you guys.

440
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,990
You invest in the cosmetic business, but what do you know about cosmetics?

441
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,440
To a person with a scar, is concealing the scar the most important thing?

442
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,950
Or is it more important to make the scar appear smooth?

443
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,470
You stick to covering the scars just to generate profits.

444
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,710
You have already been told that it is not possible

445
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,970
to make a product that conceals scars, so why are you still insisting?

446
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,830
Director Shen, were you trying to tell us what she just said?

447
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,180
Is what she saying right?

448
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,600
It's a complicated explanation,

449
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
so maybe we should just stop here today.

450
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,020
Be careful.

451
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,530
When something bad happens to a person,

452
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,790
what hurts her is not the scar on her face,

453
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,000
but the look of repulsion on other people's face.

454
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,620
So all this time, your philosophy on makeup has been wrong.

455
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,200
What we have to do is to not cover the scars

456
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,760
but change how people see scars.

457
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,960
Is that really how you think?

458
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,620
Shen Yi.

459
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,620
What's going on? How did it end up like this?

460
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,890
What Director Meng said is right and you guys already heard it.

461
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,620
My philosophy is the same as Director Meng's.

462
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,120
I will terminate the development of a scar-concealing foundation.

463
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,180
What?

464
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,390
Please don't worry.

465
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,530
LS is not closing its doors. Please trust me.

466
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,680
We are changing our research direction.

467
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,400
We want to make the scar smooth, not just conceal it.

468
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,630
Shen Yi, can I talk to you alone?

469
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,200
What's going on?

470
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,950
Shen Yi, you cannot always side with her.

471
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,800
Do you realize the consequence? We are not only talking about you.

472
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,050
Even your father has never acted so arrogantly in front of others.

473
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,780
My father has also never defended me in front of others.

474
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,610
Meng Hui, I think I've found my new goal in life.

475
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,230
As a CEO, I know my thinking is too ahead of the times.

476
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,360
It's normal that I am not understood.

477
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,720
Don't worry. I've thought through everything I said today.

478
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,280
I can take care of whatever happens to the company.

479
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,790
So don't worry, I'll resolve everything.

480
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,120
But you are the cause of the problem...

481
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,810
What did you say?

482
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,050
Nothing.

483
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:36,230
So you're saying Meng Hui made a mess at your stockholder meeting?

484
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,890
That's right.

485
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,480
And you didn't blame her but got convinced instead?

486
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,390
You also told everyone that's she the new Director Meng of LS?

487
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,150
How come I feel like you're blaming me?

488
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,740
Meng Hui bumped into the reason why you started making the liquid foundation.

489
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,210
Meng Hui was your start.

490
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,000
To be more accurate, she's just like Meng Hui.

491
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,640
A girl with a scar is your start.

492
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,620
That's right. I entered the cosmetics industry

493
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,720
and everything I did these years was for her

494
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,610
but I never thought of the meaning of using makeup.

495
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,860
Using Meng Hui's words, I'm belittling this issue.

496
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,960
Just like how it was when I first started working on the eyebrow pencil proposal.

497
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,260
I think my career is lost right now.

498
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,720
It seems like I was busy all these years for no reason.

499
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,710
But your expression seems like you're relieved.

500
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,670
It's because I've realized that my relationship with Meng Hui has become more and more clear.

501
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,900
I already found the meaning of establishing LS Group.

502
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,260
Frankly, most people don't have an ideal occupation.

503
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,270
I'm a plastic surgeon. Some people come to me to change their faces.

504
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,720
Others come for beauty treatments.

505
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,990
But these patients...

506
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,680
they can't be considered patients.

507
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,980
I never thought of the meaning behind plastic surgery.

508
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,640
Plastic surgery just helps people look beautiful.

509
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,990
But what if people,

510
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,150
are originally already beautiful?

511
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,990
Director Meng said that a liquid foundation that can cover scars

512
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,130
does not exist.

513
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,290
Because of your Director Meng's "heroic" attempt,

514
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,330
LS is now being attacked from all sides.

515
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,250
A risk of investors taking back their investments.

516
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,130
I don't think so.

517
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,400
Director Meng, don't you think because of you being naive,

518
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,490
it allowed everyone to be at risk.

519
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,690
Isn't it too overboard?

520
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,550
Maybe for those who are incompetent, this is a dangerous situation,

521
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,000
but to everyone, it's a new start for LS.

522
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,370
That's right.

523
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,150
I think what Meng Hui said is right.

524
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,660
In the past, we misunderstood and misinterpreted the true meaning of beauty.

525
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,380
There's a different meaning from covering scars.

526
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,350
It's avoiding pain.

527
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,600
Director Shen, if you could lower your standards for the coverage of the foundation,

528
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,330
our liquid foundation is already very amazing.

529
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,130
- That's right.
- Yes.

530
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:07,930
Very good. From now on, everyone prepare for a new liquid foundation press conference.

531
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,700
If it can't cover scars then it can't

532
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,770
but I believe that we can make the most perfect liquid foundation.

533
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,930
I also have another idea I want to carry out. We can discuss it later.

534
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,370
Okay.

535
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,690
We'll have to trouble you guys then.

536
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,870
How long do you need to prepare for the press conference?

537
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,430
- Seven days.
- Seven days?

538
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,250
How about five days?

539
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,390
Five days?

540
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,080
Work overtime and it'll be three days.

541
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,930
Three days?

542
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,940
- I thought it would take a long time.
- Me too.

543
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,330
Aren't we in a rush? We'll work hard.

544
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,070
We'll work hard.

545
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,200
[Smack it a few times and it'll work!!!]

546
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,510
Shen Yi.

547
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,570
Aren't your knees bad? Put on some pants.

548
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,190
I know how to print now.

549
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,020
I'm here. Get well.

550
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,830
I'm fine. I'll just watch here and learn from you.

551
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,200
Write a few more words.

552
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,010
Jiang Jiang.

553
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,360
Director Shen, you're awake.

554
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,030
Let's take a look first.

555
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,480
Come on.

556
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,760
One, two, three. We got this!

557
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,580
Xiao Mei.

558
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,530
Is there any trouble with work recently?

559
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,620
There was but not anymore.

560
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,660
Is there really none? You can tell me. It's fine.

561
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,050
Even though Director Meng can't directly solve the problems,

562
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,960
but she gives us a lot of inspiration.

563
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,040
Really?

564
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,690
Look at our product manager.

565
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,200
In order to bring his wife and children on vacation for ten days or so,

566
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,510
he's working very hard.

567
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,830
Okay. I'll give you guys a vacation after we're done with this.

568
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,670
Director Meng already gave us one.

569
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,140
- Call a taxi!
- Where are you going?

570
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,300
No, in the future, when employees go out

571
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,400
I will call them a car.

572
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,950
Xiao Mei, contact the dessert shop.

573
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,720
Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,

574
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,150
I will prepare afternoon tea for my employees.

575
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,490
Will the bill be split?

576
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,340
I'll pay.

577
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,220
Well... go get busy.

578
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,180
I'm idle right now. I'll go do this.

579
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,860
You've worked hard, Director Shen.

580
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,680
You're raising all of us alone.

581
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,590
- I'm going to work overtime now!
- Go get some rest also.

582
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,990
Okay!
