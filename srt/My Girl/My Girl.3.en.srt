21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,670
Oh my god! Why is there such a big scar on your face?

22
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,290
If he knows that you have such a large scar on your face,

23
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,030
how would he look at you?

24
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,770
Would he like you right now?

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,670
If he knows that you have such a large scar on your face,

would he like you right now?

Looking for Meng Hui?

30

Why aren't you rehearsing?

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,840
With you here, I can't be the winner.

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,570
Why must I work so hard?

33
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,500
Moreover, the dress rehearsal is not that interesting as  Meng Hui who's such a joke.

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,950
What's wrong with Meng Hui?

35
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,230
In front of a beautiful woman, men will

36
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,020
indeed be blind.

37
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,400
Meng Hui has a secret that she's hiding from all of us.

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,300
What secret?

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,540
The girl that you know is not her true self.

40
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,390
You think she is beautiful,

41
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,710
- but she has another face. She has—
- How do you know?

42
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,260
I have eyes. Of course I can see.

43
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,680
Wait.

44
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,630
You wouldn't happen to know this too, right?

45
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,720
Then—

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,640
Does she know that you know?

47
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,790
Wait, she must not know that you—

48
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,970
I don't have time to listen to you.

49
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,410
I understand everything about her, so you don't have to gossip about her to me.

50
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,150
Also, don't mention her name in front of other people.

51
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,620
Wow! Are you serious?

52
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,650
You accept this?

53
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,770
Meng Hui is a really cute and normal girl.

54
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,800
I hope you will stop slandering her

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,760
and won't bother me either.

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,830
Why should I listen to you?

57
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,890
If you can keep this secret, I will ensure you will be in the top five.

58
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,620
It's a deal. Don't worry.

59
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,870
I will definitely keep my mouth shut.

60
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,360
I won't even mention half of her name.

61
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,110
Amazing. Meng Hui is amazing and so are you.

62
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,920
I really can't believe that.

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,850
If you treat me like how you treat her,

64
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,780
I would've fallen in love with you.

Thank you, but I don't eat sweets.

67

Just leave it there for now.

68
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,790
Director Shen, should we tell Miss Meng Hui to give you—

69
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,600
No need to be so obvious.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,990
Don't misunderstand. I've already said it clearly

71
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,210
that we are just friends.

72
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,090

I'm here!

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,240
Why didn't you answer my phone call?

80
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,310
I...

81
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,510
My cellphone was on silent mode. I didn't hear it ringing.

82
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,940
You can't do that next time. Okay?

83
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,930
Director Shen doesn't eat desserts.

84
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,640
I don't eat sweets.

85

Is it sweet?

Yes.

87
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,800
Is it the cake that is sweet, or am I the sweet one?

88
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,730
You are.

89

Okay, then let's eat dinner later. Don't forget.

If you're really busy, then forget about it.

98

Post-traumatic stress disorder will cause her to have some psychological suggestions.

99
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,750
It will also give her some status and experiences.

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,150
It's okay. I'll pick you up later tonight.

- What's wrong with him?
- This is bad. Miss Meng is going to order the food.

121
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,130
Desserts look nice but are not nutritious. Grilled food are too greasy. It's easy to get allergic reactions from seafood.

122
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,420

About this... this might incur ridicule.

No, no, no. I think that your boss

Don't think that she usually looks depressed and is afraid of doing many things

163
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,080
but once she has PTSD, she's invincible.

164
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,920
There was once she thought she was a psychologist. She came to my office to understudy for a month.

165
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,650
She memorized three psychological books.

166
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,720
That also means that every time she makes a wish in her normal state,

167
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,710
- it will come true in this state?
- Yes.

168
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,070
- Her dream will come true every time?
- Yes.

169
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,650
Then, my boss—

170
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,900
Then, will my boss really become her boyfriend?

171
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,490
If you put it like that, it does seems like it.

172
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,730
They went to the ferris wheel. Let's go.

173
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,570
You can't use the Amusement Park Pass. Isn't it written here?

174
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,590
Shouldn't this cover all attractions in the amusement park?

175
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,300
It could be because it's higher than all the attractions here.

176
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,960
That's why it's a separate fee for this. If you want to ride this, go over there to buy tickets.

177
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,210
- Then...
- It's okay. We don't have to go on it.

178
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,570
I just really want to go on the ferris wheel,

179
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,160
but I'm really happy you can go on a date with me.

180
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,260
I heard that at the highest point, looking down on the city,

181
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,220
will have a really calming feeling.

182
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,140
But down here, I already feel really well.

183
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,050
Could you take a picture with me outside of the ferris wheel?

184
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,500
To pretend that I already rode it.

185
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,490
This is my first time dating so I don't want to have any regrets.

186
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,630
Don't worry. I will make sure you get to ride it.

187
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,380
Then, that one is for four people, right?

188
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,320
Since it's only us two,

189
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,950
can you give us a 50% discount, or...

190
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,420
we can share the cabin with them.

191
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,880
Who wants to share the cabin with you? Are you crazy?

192
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,000
Can't you see we are in a relationship? You are really blind.

193
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,790
Then... we will make up for the tickets.

194
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,490
Go over there.

195
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,830
How cute!

196
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,210
Have you ever won a doll before? I never have.

197
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,030
[Sale price: ¥50. ¥10 per try]

198
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,830
- It's quite a bargain.
- You can catch it in one try?

199
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,220
It's just a matter of angles. As long as my aim is accurate, I can catch it.

200
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,910
It's okay.

201
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,670
It was a mistake.

202
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,560
I want to make a complaint! It's impossible to catch any. I want to make a complaint!

203
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,180
- This is a scam!
- Yay!

204
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,080
- I got it!
- You're amazing!

205
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,310
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

206
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,860
I'm so jealous of them.

207
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,630
Hello? That B... B010 machine.

208
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,720
Buy one.

209
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,120
Hello?

210
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,240
It's okay. As long as we've tried it, it's okay.

211
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,510
Money can't buy happiness.

212
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,760
I must catch a Pikachu for you today.

213
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,000
It's okay. As long as we tried, it's okay.

214
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,900
The current traffic condition is just like how Director Shen feels now.

215
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,670
It must be difficult to get a taxi at this time.

216
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,590
Yes. What should we do?

217
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,770
Get a ride for me. I'm going back.

218
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,970
Get a ride?

219
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,590
The Porsche in your boss' collection is finally showing up, right?

220
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,090
Why is there a bicycle in the middle of the street?

221
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,800
It must be really hard for you to work for Director Shen.

222
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,370
I've got used to it.

223
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,860
That's the ride he wanted.

224
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,830
If your boss doesn't treat this problem,

225
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,700
that might have a long-term impact.

226
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,680
Frankly, Director Shen is a nice person. You will understand once you get to know him better.

227
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,390
Even though he doesn't like to spend money sometimes,

228
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,250
he is still a good person.

229
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,850
You are good at finding excuses for him.

230
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,640
If you give him a few more chances, you will like him.

231
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,830
Seeing how much joy he has created for us,

232
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,710
just stop blaming him.

233
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,340
I think that you are a decent person.

234
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,920
I know Shen Yi is a good person.

235
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,430
It's written all over his body to decline this

236
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,980
but he still didn't expose Meng Hui's beliefs and even worked hard to cooperate with her.

237
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,880
I'm grateful for him.

238
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,310
Were you happy today?

239
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,720
It doesn't matter if I was happy or not.

240
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,230
What's important is that you're happy.

241
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,580
You have so many friends that care about you.

242
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,500
If something happens, they will all help you.

243
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,780
It's a pity that I couldn't get the Pikachu for you.

244
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,370
It's okay. I found something that is even cuter than Pikachu.

245
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,110
What is it?

246
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,620
It's already been 1.5 hours!

247
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,810
I still have some matters at work. I should go. You should go home—

248
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,380
I—

249
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,530
- What?
- There's so many people at night.

250
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,280
If you wear this, I can find you right away.

251
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,060
Director Shen, you are not asleep yet?

252
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,560
If you haven't slept yet, I can't sleep either.

253
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,250
Boss, do you want noodles? I will get a bowl for you.

254
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,200
Hello, Director Xu.

255
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,120
Hello, Director Xu.

256
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,380
You're awake?

257
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,210
Yes.

258
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,490
You seem exhausted lately. There's so much uncompleted work, too.

259
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,550
Are you busy with something? Is there anything I can help with?

260
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,570
Recently, there might be some work I need your help with

261
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,410
because... I still have some personal situation to take care of.

262
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,110
Have you recently been dating Meng Hui?

263
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,520
No.

264
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,090
We should be.

265
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,180
Could it be that the news from the program's team is true?

266
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,650
Are you with Meng Hui?

267
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,650
Actually, it's just a trivial matter in life.

268
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,170
It won't affect work. It's just that time has been a bit tight lately,

269
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,610
so I need you to help me.

270
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,150
Don't worry. I founded this company with you.

271
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,710
Of course I will help.

272
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,550
Don't forget to take a rest.

273
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,450
I will help you settle these documents.

274
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,740
Thank you.

275
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,120
Bye.

276
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,430
Didn't you say to eat breakfast together? Where are you?

277
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,380
Putting on eyeliner.

278
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,350
What do you mean?

279
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,940
You are taking such a long time to do your makeup. Aren't you afraid he will blow his top?

280
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,060
If my makeup is beautiful, he will be happy when he sees me.

281
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,740
Why don't we skip breakfast today?

282
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,290
I have to attend a meeting so I won't have time.

283
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,630
He hung up on me!

284
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,630
Meng Hui, don't think too much.

285
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,670
Shen Yi really likes you,

286
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,870
but he's a workaholic and also petty, right?

287
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,630
I know that work is more important to him than I am,

288
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,630
but why can't he even give me a little bit of time?

289
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,220
Even if...

290
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,710
What?

291
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,160
Even if he watches the fireworks with me,

292
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,370
I saw that in idol dramas, they would see really romantic fireworks.

293
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,680
Fireworks?

294
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,360
That's right. Like the ones in idol dramas.

295
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,660
Especially those grand fireworks.

296
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,840
That's what Ah Tao said.

297
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,450
Are young girls so materialistic nowadays?

298
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,540
Director Shen, girls like this kind of fantasies.

299
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,270
That's also really normal.

300
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,370
Are you still doing your eyeliner?

301
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,510
No, I'm not. I did my makeup two hours in advance.

302
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,150
It's just that I'm caught in the peak hour traffic jam.

303
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,800
- You know—
- I know.

304
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,290
You want to say that you could earn a lot of money at this time,

305
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,300
but you can't buy happiness with money.

306
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,050
- No, you can't.
- No, I can.

307
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,910
Jiang Jiang told me that you prepared a surprise for me.

308
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,980
Is it fireworks? Is it the splendid kind

309
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,450
that can only be enjoyed from the other side of the city?

310
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,290
Is this the fireworks that you prepared for me?

311
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:20,220
Nothing matters but love. It's good enough if there's atmosphere.

312
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,210
That's true. This is more like your personality.

313
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,200
Don't rush. Wait till this is done before we light another.

314
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,580
This way, time will be longer.

315
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,520
You really prepared this firework for me? Are there any others?

316
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,060
A grand display of fireworks

317
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,060
and a stick of an ordinary sparkler,

318
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,900
actually produces the same results.

319
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,750
It's different.

320
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,150
Can you see what is different about me today?

321
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,020
You're fatter.

322
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,800
It's the eyeliner. I used a ¥100 eyeliner pen today.

323
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,010
Let me tell you as the owner of a makeup company.

324
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,830
The result of a ¥10 eyeliner and a ¥100 eyeliner

325
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,990
have the exact same effect.

326
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,120
It's just like a grand display of fireworks and an ordinary sparkler.

327
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,770
A ¥100 eyeliner pen means you are in my heart.

328
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,730
As a makeup artist, my heart wanted

329
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,330
to choose the best one because of you,

330
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,760
but you only gave me a stick of sparkler.

331
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,140
You never had me in your heart.

332
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,440
Just like you never cared about me.

333
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,920
I think that you're thinking too much.

334
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,790
It's just a matter of opinions on consumption. Let's not talk about fireworks.

335
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,400
Do you think a ¥100 eyeliner pen

336
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,630
is worth a praise? But I think it's wasteful.

337
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,720
Do you know what ¥100 can do in this society now?

338
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,840
It can buy 30 eggs, 30 catties of vegetables,

339
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,910
4 catties of meat. ¥100 can feed an ordinary family

340
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,030
for three days. ¥100 can let 25 children

341
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,020
have a charity lunch meal.

342
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,150
Charity, benevolence, donation?

343
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,690
Then will you give the ¥100 for today's date to the kids?

344
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,390
Charity, benevolence, donation?

345

I've been thinking about her recently.

356
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:09,430
Do you think that by not apologizing,

357
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,290
I'm adding more wrong on top of a wrong?

358
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,740
What should I do

359
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,980
to make it up to her?

360
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,340
Weren't you thinking of a way?

361
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,840
You have been working hard to produce a liquid foundation.

362
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,570
Isn't it because of her?

363
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,100
I need to produce a liquid foundation that can cover scars.

364
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,610
That way, when it goes on the market,

365
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,390
she will be able to buy it.

366
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,740
Then...

367
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,970
She'll forgive me.

368
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,020

- When will Professor Smith from Britain

will come to China this year?  The scar surgery for this year keep it for us.

374
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,460
Doctor Sui, you always schedule an appointment for Professor Smith's surgery every year.

375
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,820
But no one will do this surgery until next year.

376
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,710
There's only one patient per year. Isn't that a pity?

377
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Get well prepared in case we have a patient this year.

378
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,440
- Go back to work.
- Okay.

00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,720
♫  Life is like strolling in an endless circle  ♫

479
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,780
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

480
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,960
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

481
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,920
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

482
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,900
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

483
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,030
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

484
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:14,320
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

485
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:21,190
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

486
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:30,070
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

487
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:34,850
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

488
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:45,240
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

489
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,210
♫  Leading me  ♫

490
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:55,640
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

491
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:02,310
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

492
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,500
