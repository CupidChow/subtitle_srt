[Episode 7: Eye Shadow, Daily Cosplay]

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,780
With his character, he will be alone forever.

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm his girlfriend.

23
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,760
Let's go.

24
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,170
Jiang Jiang, this act... how much did it cost?

25
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,460
Next month, my parents are urging me to get married and bring her home for a meal.

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,590
Look, how about you make the introductions or tell your friends here what it costs?

27
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,970
What are you saying? She's my girlfriend.

28
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,420
Enough, Xiao Jiang, stop acting. We won't laugh at you.

29
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,570
Based on your logic, if he doesn't have the money to treat you to a meal,

30
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,290
how would he have the money to hire a girlfriend?

31
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,060
Your receipt.

32
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,660
Thank you.

33
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,550
Young lady, your qualifications seem good.

34
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,340
Why do you like Xiao Jiang?

35
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,020
Such a great girl being with him...

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,590
one meter seven has become one meter five.
(T/N: lowered your value.)

37
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,960
Don't waste your breath. We don't even know if he's one meter five.

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,620
To impress us, he's become one meter seven.

39
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,800
Let's go.

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,610
Do you know what the corporate culture at our company is? Profits shared equally.

41
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,730
Isn't this... doesn't this mean he still can't afford it?

42
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,830
Equal shares aren't so we can save money.

43
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,060
It's fairness to all, mutual respect. That's something you haven't learned in your twenty-something years.

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,060
I don't care what you think of me

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,130
but you can't talk bad about her!

46
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,580
Let's go.

47
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,350
What's going on? What's so great?

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,140
- What's going on with you? You're usually the most boisterous. You're like a different person now.
- True.

49
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,600
- That's right.
- No.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,300
What she just said was that she's his girlfriend.

51
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,490
She's my major client.

52
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,800
How could it be her?

53
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,030
My hand hurts.

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,100
You were so cool and manly just now. What's wrong now?

55
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,030
What we did there was great, but now I feel a little jittery.

56
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,680
Thank you for helping me today.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,740
No need to thank me. You were very cool just now.

58
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,960
Even though you say that, they are all my classmates after all.

59
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,970
Should I fix another day and treat them to a meal?

60
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,100
And apologize to them at the same time.

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,930
You're being so useless. Why would apologize to the when they acted like that?

62
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,560
Why are you angrier than me?

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,020
Why are you that easily bullied?

64
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,170
Frankly, I'm used to them being like this.

65
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,140
But I'm not used to it.

66
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,460
And during the New Year's performances, it was the same. All the boys were princes or soldiers,

67
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,170
and I acted as Snow White then.

68
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,390
I acted as a prince in the past too.

69
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,590
Even though it is a little difficult and it's a bother,

70
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,460
it doesn't prevent us from becoming better people.

71
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,920
[LS]

72
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,030
This is great. As long as I can fulfill her wish.

73
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,080
I can make it up to her then.

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Boss, thank you for yesterday.

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,110
I didn't expect that, although you verbally said that you didn't care

76
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,570
but in your heart, you still value me.

77
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,170
Don't thank me. Just settle the bill.

78
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,300
Altogether, it's ¥5,280. Divided over the next three years,

79
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,030
¥$146.66 will be deducted from your monthly salary.

80
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,460
What do you mean? Isn't yesterday already paid for?

81
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,830
Weren't you the one who took the initiative and arranged it for me?

82
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,300
Yes. I made the arrangements.

83
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,140
- But, who's the one who impressed them?
- Me.

84
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,560
- Who ate the food?
- Me.

85
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,770
- Who treated their classmates?
- Me.

86
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,630
You're the one who got all the benefits. If you don't pay, who will?

87
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,740
Do you know how embarrassed I was yesterday?

88
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,670
You showed up with a grand entrance.  You said the average would be ¥228.

89
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,660
That's followed by three exclamation points.

90
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,990
You even said I was as important as a hand cream.

91
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,760
What's the deal? Now you're asking your hand cream for money?

92
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,210
When you apply hand cream ten times a day, only two of the times are effective.

93
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,080
Everything else are just psychological benefits.

94
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,610
You're too good at calculations.

95
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,960
You even say that we've weathered the storms in the same boat for four years.

96
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,870
I see you're just squeezing out all my value to you.

97
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,670
Right now, I really can't make sense of this.

98
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,130
All those arrangements yesterday... were they really out of concern for me?

99
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,110
Or just to make you feel more comfortable with yourself?

100
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,500
- What are you saying?
- What good you did for me

101
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,480
wasn't really because you wanted me to know that you take me as a close partner.

102
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,440
You just thought that by doing that you can placate me

103
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,570
and let yourself feel like a magnanimous, generous boss.

104
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,860
I'm telling you. I'm not fooled.

105
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm just your assistant, not your friend. Between us, there's no other sentiment at all.

106
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,830
Excuse me.

107
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,970
Is that true?

108
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,640
Treating him well... it's not because I like him.

109
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,260
It's only to make me feel better.

110
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,320
What just happened... I'm sorry. I was too impulsive.

111
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,640
Actually... the fact that you could think of me...

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,210
I'm already quite satisfied.

113
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,310
There's no need to bring money into it.

114
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,740
I really did just want to help you come up with an expense account. I wasn't trying to placate you.

115
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,070
Then, why are you trying to collect the money from me?

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,280
It was a receipt. You ripped up the receipt.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,460
The winner of the Cosmetics Competition is

118
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,650
Wei Lei!

119
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,310
I didn't expect that the winner would be Wei Lei.

120
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,980
She really is very brave.

121
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,090
That's right. Her professional abilities are great.

122
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,560
Wei Lei's stage walk was very good.

123
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,990
Performance is  excellent.

124
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,300
I want to thank

125
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,020
my makeup artist, Meng Hui.

126
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,380
She's a very talented makeup artist.

127
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,000
Not only her skills

128
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,430
and her generosity of measuring beauty,

129
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,000
I used to understand the word 'beauty' in a very narrow description.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,570
Face is just for people's attention.

131
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,780
Mutual attraction between souls is genuine, deep love.

132
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,220
Beauty is multi-level.

133
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,720
Inner appearance is more important than outer appearance. Inner beauty is more important than outer self.

134
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,600
T- This isn't appropriate.

135
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,150
Do whatever you guys need to do. Can't you tell I'm trying to confess?

136
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,740
Hurry and leave.

137
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,770
Leave.

138
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,430
Sorry.

139
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,630
I was indeed a bit too petty.

140
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,580
I was a bit too competitive, a bit too vain,

141
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,030
a bit too judgemental, a bit too self-centered,

142
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,600
but Meng Hui, you're too good.

143
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,450
You  are making me become a newer me.

144
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,860
It's not that exaggerating.

145
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,380
Meng Hui, do you know those nice people in the stories

146
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,170
usually don't have a good ending and they'll be used

147
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,110
but don't worry, you won't since you have me.

148
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,610
You need a beautiful friend like me who is not evil and debauched.

149
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,920
What you mean is that you want to be friends with me?

150
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,650
From now on, you're my best friend.

151
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,780
In the future, whenever I buy a purse, I'll definitely buy you one. If I discover any skincare secrets, I'll send it to you immediately.

152
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,050
If I get any serums, I'll give you a bottle. If I receive any discounts, you'll get 50% off.

153
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,240
I can share everything with you except for men.

154
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,710
Meng Hui.

155
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,360
Whatever, who cares about men, I'll give him to you too.

156
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,030
What are you talking about?

157
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,110
Wei Lei said she wanted to be friends with me.

158
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,090
You don't have to think about this.

159
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,460
I told you that your nice attitude will be used by someone.

160
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,350
You only need a friend like me by your side.

161
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,160
In case someone steals your boyfriend in the future, I can help you get rid of the thief.

162
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,280
Thank you for being kind, but I don't want her to be troubled like this.

163
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,170
She will always stay by my side.

164
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,510
That's because besides her, no one else likes you.

165
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,630
If you break up with her in the future and get together with someone else, you won't see the last of me.

166
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,740
- What are you doing here?
- I came to go eat with her.

167
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,100
What a coincidence. I also came to go eat with her.

168
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,620
Meng Hui, I told you that your taste in men was not good.

169
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,840
I can give you the crown that I won.

170
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,010
He can't bear to lose something. What can he give you?

171
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,430
Give it to her.

172
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,210
See, I'm useful to you. After saying one thing,

173
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,000
I was able to obtain all his assets.

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,460
Are you sure you have that ability? Have you forgotten about that vaseline from three ago?

175
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,780
Don't bring that up. You have the guts to bring it up. I don't have the guts to listen.

176
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,850
C- Can you two stop arguing? Can't we all eat together?

177
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,150
- I'm not eating with her.
- I'm not eating with him.

178
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,720
You choose one.

179
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,080
Then, let's have a meal together next time.

180
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,990
Let's go.

181
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,040
Bye bye, let's eat together next time!

182
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,190
Shen Yi, not only do I want to eat a romantic candlelight  dinner with your girlfriend.

183
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,440
We're going to go purse shopping, get manicures,

184
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,720
and use your card to buy all the shades of Louboutin's ¥1,000 lipsticks.

185
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,050
This is what you owe me.

186
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,460
Let's go.

187
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,180
Director Shen, should we cancel the credit card first?

188
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,220
It's fine as long she's happy.

189
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm willing to spend as much money she wants if she's happy.

190
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,460
These are the statistics for autumn and winter this year.

191
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,060
Make contact with every member of the staff.

192
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,090
On Monday, be sure to remember to notify each person that they are required to attend.

193
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,220
Okay, I'll go confirm it.

194
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,580
[Wednesday - go to a theater with Meng Hui. Thursday - Have dinner with Meng Hui. Prepare gift. Reserve restaurant. Tuesday - Meng Hui's live broadcast]

195
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,200
Director Shen, we're done talking.

196
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,890
You all worked hard.

197
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,680
What day of the week is my date with Meng Hui?

198
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,630
It's this Saturday.

199
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,210
Shen Yi. Did you forget that

200
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,640
Saturday is the company's' team building event?

201
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,110
Is it this Saturday? I thought it wasn't settled on which day of the week it was.

202
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,510
It's best if you don't let your relationship affect work.

203
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,870
Does everyone in the company have to go?

204
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,020
Other than me, all senior-level company employees must attend

205
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,190
because I have to go to England to see if we can get the money back.

206
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,860
If we can't then we might be asked by the investors.

207
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,920
Remember to notify them.

208
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,330
Then, c-can we change the team building...

209
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,130
Let's do this. I'll ask Human Resources

210
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,010
if we can change the team building to Sunday.

211
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,770
Hurry, hurry.

212
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,500
[LS team building notification is Saturday. Attendance is required.]

213
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,640
How about you change the date?

214
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,560
There's no need.

215
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,230
I can just bring her along, right?

216
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,600
[Restaurant. It's delicious!]

217
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,080
Two little bees...

218
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,350
flew into the center of the flowers.

219
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,150
Flying, flying.

220
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,480
Hello, everyone. Is this the team building event for LS?

221
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,890
Are you new?

222
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,620
She looks a bit familiar.

223
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,620
Isn't this the girl that went on trending with our Boss?

224
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,280
Miss, were you recruited by Shen Yi?

225
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,010
Yes, I was recruited by Shen Yi.

226
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,790
Come. Sit here.

227
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,380
Sit here.

228
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,470
Which department are you and what do you do?

229
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,770
I'm a makeup artist.

230
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,650
Makeup artist? You're fighting on the front lines.

231
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,230
- Then, you have to work hard.
- Fighting.

232
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,930
I will.

233
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,150
How long have you been here?

234
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,820
I-I just arrived not long ago.

235
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,290
It's poor timing to have to come to team building as soon as you got here.

236
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,360
Never mind. If you escape from this one, you'll have to do the next. You have to get used to it sooner or later.

237
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,210
I'm telling you. Not only is there team building,

238
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:20,680
there's also the end-of-the-year lottery. You have to spend money there too.

239
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,030
- You have to spend money at the lottery too?
- Yes.

240
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,610
Do you not know what our prize is?

241
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,600
They're coupons for buying our own company products.

242
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,020
After all, the wool still comes from the sheep's back, keeps the good stuff within the family.
(T/N: idiom: In the long run, whatever you're given, you pay for.)

243
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,620
Wasn't there use to be free take-out

244
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,230
with those scratch-off tickets?

245
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,860
You're dreaming.

246
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,440
How many times has that happened?

247
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,290
It all depends on the monster's mood.

248
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,670
Why is Shen Yi still not here?

249
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,710
Is it traffic? How about I call him?

250
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,190
We have to take advantage of the time when the monster's not here.

251
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,360
Let's give her the low-down on LS's office unwritten rules.

252
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,600
- Right.
- "Unwritten rules"?

253
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,730
Excuse me, do you know how to order?

254
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,990
Yes. Meat and vegetables, cold and hot, salty and sweet combos.

255
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,830
- Wrong.
- Wrong.

256
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,550
Just remember one thing. If you help save money for the company,

257
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,120
- you would be saving money for yourself.
- That's right.

258
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,280
Here. We substitute wine with tea.

259
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,170
Because the tea is free.

260
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,560
Here, here.

261
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,100
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

262
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,560
Director Shen.

263
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,780
You're here, Director Shen.

264
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,690
Sit here, Director Shen.

265
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,280
How about you sit across from me?

266
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,190
Don't worry, Director Shen. We'll take good care of Meng Hui.

267
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,350
No worries, I'm okay with sitting here.

268
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,000
If there's nothing else, everyone can make a report on their work.

269
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,570
Everyone has arrived. Are you going to order or not?

270
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,710
We're going to order.

271
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,380
- Here.
- I'm here.

272
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,800
- Why don't you order instead—
- You can order.

273
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,160
How about two servings of this signature dish?

274
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,330
Is there anything else you all would like to add?

275
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,330
- There isn't. There's no need.
- It's enough.

276
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,650
Yeah.

277
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,860
- Then what about a vegetable platter?
- Meng Hui, I'm allergic to vegetables.

278
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,490
- You're allergic to vegetables?
- Yeah.

279
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,240
Let's order some seafood.

280
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,090
I-I'm allergic to seafood.

281
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,300
Yeah, I'm allergic to seafood.

282
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,180
- What about chicken?
- What a coincidence.

283
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,170
I'm allergic to proteins.

284
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,070
- I'm lactose intolerant.
- I'm on a diet.

285
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,900
I took Chinese medicine and can't eat certain foods.

286
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,930
You're going to only order two dishes when there's over ten of you?

287
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,470
A-Also you all want the free drinks?

288
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,800
You don't need to save money.

289
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,270
- It's enough.
- It's a lot.

290
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,890
Right.

291
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,680
Then that's all for now.

292
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,140
Right.

293
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,630
Sorry, I'm late.

294
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,850
I'll punish myself by drinking some plain boiled water. Hello, Director Shen.

295
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,290
Where's Jiang Jiang?

296
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,500
Assistant Jiang is at the program committee meeting, so he can't come.

297
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,350
You've all worked hard on the program recently.

298
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,920
You also worked hard.

299
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,410
- I think I know where it's wrong.
- Don't say anything.

300
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,520
Don't say anything.

301
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,330
Meng Hui.

302
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,900
What job were you recruited for by Director Shen?

303
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,280
- Meng Hui is my girl—
- Female assistant!

304
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,010
Female assistant?

305
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,470
I like this one.

306
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,990
You can't eat vegetables. Didn't you say you're allergic?

307
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,270
You're allergic to seafood. You can't eat it.

308
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,280
You're allergic to proteins. You can't eat chicken.

309
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,420
You're lactose intolerant. You're on a diet.

310
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,400
Then, you took Chinese medicine, that's too fishy.

311
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,510
I think Jiang Jiang is going to unemployed.

312
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,000
How much money would this meal be?

313
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,900
You can only look at it and not eat.

314
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,930
You sent it to the wrong chat. Director Shen is in this group chat.

315
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,230
Wonder how much Set A is. Can only look but can't eat.

316
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,030
Waiter.

317
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,400
One of each.

318
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,910
One of each?! This...

319
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,260
I'm treating you guys this meal.

320
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,810
Really?

321
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,620
Thank you, Director Shen.

322
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,740
You should have said it earlier.

323
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,570
Waiter, we want to order!

324
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,380
- Right.
- Hurry, we want it all.

325
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,040
- Here.
- Add the seafood.

326
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,240
Little Mei, you need to get the meat.

327
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,230
- There's meat.
- Get some meat.

328
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,080
You go get some.

329
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
- The mushrooms are not bad.
- Hurry and eat.

330
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,770
- This is not good.
- Are you done?

331
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,800
There's no more. You should go get some.

332
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,160
- You eat, you eat.
- So slow.

333
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,770
You eat, you eat.

334
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,750
Assistant Meng.

335
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,820
I have something to discuss with you, come out.

336
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,280
Okay.

337
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,020
Is there meat on your side? Can you give me some?

338
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,920
- Is there still some meat over there?
- Give me a little.
- That's not cooked yet.

339
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,470
This piece is not bad.

340
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,350
- Pass me two pieces of that meat.
- That's good.

341
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,950
I can't eat anymore.

342
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,570
What shall we do? There's still food left?

343
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,120
- Pack it up.
- Pack it up.

344
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,020
- This is great.
- Really.
- Here's some more.

345
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,590
Happy.

346
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,140
Are you all done eating?

347
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,190
- We're finished eating.
- We're finished eating.

348
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,740
Waiter, check please.

349
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,270
There's no more paper. Waiter, is there any more paper?

350
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,340
Are you going to use the restroom?

351
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,730
I drank too much water.

352
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,730
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Does anyone have any soap?

353
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,450
It hurts. My stomach really hurts.

354
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,630
- I can't. I can't.
- Hurry.

355
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,150
I'm sorry about today, I made myself a joke.

356
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,170
It's fine, I'm really happy.

357
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,860
Why?

358
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,960
Because everyone viewed me as my own person today.

359
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,720
When you weren't here, they all cared for me a lot.

360
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,760
Also, if you didn't treat me as myself, why would you bring me here?

361
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,110
Sure enough, she is not a simple female assistant.

362
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,700
She can endure Shen Yi, so she is certainly not average.

363
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,290
Oh right, why didn't you let me say that you were my girl—

364
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,880
When you weren't here, everyone was talking about company matters. I didn't want it to be awkward.

365
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,410
How do they being awkward have anything to do with us?

366
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,920
I only want to eat with you.

367
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,370
Actually, today you already were so accommodating to me.

368
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,810
You really didn't have to be so considerate and good to me.

369
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,920
That is because...

370
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,610
because I should do that stuff.

371
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,420
If you treated them that well like you did to me,

372
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,680
your atmosphere would be even better.

373
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,750
You also need to consider your employee's feelings.

374
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,070
Why?

375
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,750
I give them their paychecks; they are my employees.

376
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,140
Why should I get these complicated emotions get entangled with work?

377
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,340
Right now I close my eyes and invest in real estate,

378
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,110
internet, medical beauty, and variety. All is for making money.

379
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,410
Only LS is losing money, I also give them really high salaries,

380
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,510
do I not give them enough salary, so I have to consider their feelings?

381
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,540
Leave it alone.

382
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,690
Waiter, split the bill, we'll pay.

383
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,200
It's okay, you don't have to worry about me.

384
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,690
But if you don't have a good relationship with co-workers, won't it affect work?

385
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:14,290
All of these years, except for you, no one has been able to affect my work.

386
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:22,260
Then I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.

387
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,420
As long as you're happy, then it's a good thing.

388
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,800
Then I'll go in first.

389
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,180
♫ Turn, turning around ♫

390
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,000
♫ Turning around now ♫

391
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,390
♫ And around, and around, and around, and around, and back ♫

392
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,900
♫ Please take me back ♫

393
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,870
♫ Please take me back now ♫

394
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,500
♫ How could you deny me that ♫

395
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,950
Do you want to come in and drink a cup of coffee?

396
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,480
Is that okay, would that be bothering you?

397
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,010
Then forget about it, I'll go in now.

398
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,490
I... suddenly am a little thirsty.

399
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,680
- Wear this, I'll go brew the coffee first.
- Okay.

400
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,690
There's no more coffee, is juice fine?

401
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,790
Okay, sorry for bothering you.

402
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,640
My house is very small, you can look around.

403
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,950
[Chonghai No.1 Primary School Class of 2006 Graduation Book]

404
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,140
You are looking at my childhood pictures?

405
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:04,150
Meng Hui, did you study at Chonghai when you were little?

406
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:13,440
Then, did you ever transfer schools?

407
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,150
I transferred once in primary school.

408
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,040
Which primary school?

409
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,700
Jiangbei No.5 Primary School, what's wrong?

410
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,510
Always...

411
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,640
Always at school No.5 right?

412
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,300
Afterwards, I went to Chonghai.

413
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,470
You never went to school No.3?

414
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,220
Never.

415
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,180
I still have some stuff to do at work, I'll be going then.

416
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,490
But, but the juice.

417
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,780
How can you identify the wrong person?

418
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,690
The girl from that year went to school No.3.

419
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,900
But Meng Hui went to school No.5 and then went to Chonghai.

420
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,500
She never even went to school No.3.

421
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,800
So these two people aren't the same person.

422
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,100
After I knew this, I was all confused, I didn't know how to face her.

423
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,330
Is that possibly such a coincidence?

424
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,100
It's my fault.

425
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,370
When I first saw the scar on her face, I thought she was that person.

426
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,980
- Then what are you going to do now?
- I don't know.

427
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,080
Then I'll ask you, do you like Meng Hui?

428
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,350
I don't know.

429
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,550
You are already both together, why don't you just try it out and see for yourself?

430
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,290
Is it even that important if she is that girl from the past?

431
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,720
You really don't like her at all?

432
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,410
Meng Hui is a very good person,

433
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,830
but what if the girl from the past appears later?

434
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,060
That wouldn't be fair to Meng Hui.

435
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,570
Come in.

436
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,580
Director Shen, I'll get going then. I don't want to interrupt your time with your female assistant.

437
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,440
Sit down.

438
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,140
Since everyone thinks I'm your assistant, they let me in.

439
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,510
Your office is so big.

440
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,720
Why did you think to come today?

441
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,950
The program team asked me to send the proposed plan.

442
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,090
Meng Hui, these days I've been very busy with work.

443
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,550
I probably won't have much time to be with you.

444
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,300
I understand, everyone says you are a workaholic.

445
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,720
After you started being with me, you started working less.

446
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,460
It must've been hard for you, keep it up!

447
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,040
Okay.

448
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,900
Meng Hui, thank you.

449
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,190
Come here.

450
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,710
What happened?

451
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,850
This is today's meeting agenda.

452
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,510
Then I'll let you work.

453
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,250
Okay, then I'll contact you later.

454
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,930
Oh right, if you have a ginger yellow-colored tie, I suggest you switch to that one.

455
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,350
It matches your office the best.

456
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,900
Okay.

457
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,530
Miss Meng Hui has really good taste.

458
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,440
It's just that Shen Yi is the CEO.

459
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,530
If you wear clothes that are too revealing,

460
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,330
it could cause some unnecessary troubles.

461
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,020
Revealing?

462
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,360
We are office ladies. At the workplace, there are unwritten rules.

463
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,260
If usually wearing clothes that look too good,

464
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,130
it might waste time when discussing things.

465
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,670
Director Xu, the people here for the meeting came early. Can you help me with it?

466
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,270
Okay, I got it.

467
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,130
Bye bye.

468
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,030
I mean that, for the style at the workplace,

469
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,740
it may be very different than what you usually wear.

470
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,140
Hello, you must be Director Xu.

471
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,920
This is our modified scheme, can you help Director Xu hold it?

472
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,740
Everyone says that you are young, promising, and very competent.

473
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:52,040
Hello, I am LS's vice president, Xu Xingyao.

474
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,940
Then which director is she?

475
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,210
I'm here to deliver some materials.

476
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,720
I might have to trouble you two and let you wait a little. I have to escort,

477
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,870
Director Meng.

478
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,040
Miss Meng, Director Shen wanted me to tell you that you will attend the cocktail party tomorrow.

479
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,940
Cocktail party, me?

480
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,050
It's to make up for the team building event last time.

481
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,100
But I've never attended something so formal before.

482
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,380
Are they any particular requirements for the dress code?

483
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
For clothes,

484
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,310
since it's for a cocktail party, if you wear a formal dress it would be fine.

485
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,780
Miss Meng in a formal dress will definitely look beautiful.

486
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,300
Okay, thank you. Bye bye.

487
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,800
Bye bye.

488
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,130
What color clothes are you wearing tomorrow?

489
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,000
[Let's wear green]

490
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,350
Is it good if we wear green clothes?

491
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,500
Is he very busy?

492
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,970
Come, let's look at the front.

493
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,780
- Shen Yi.
- Director Zhang.

494
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,630
- Hello.
- Hello.

495
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,830
The show that your company broadcast was pretty good.

496
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,530
I heard that you also met a girlfriend.

497
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,020
When will you introduce her to us?

498
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,750
Today is for business, it's not really suitable to talk about that here.

499
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,070
Then, let's drink.

500
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,710
Look, who's that? Why is she dressed like that?

501
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,640
Is she shooting a drama?

502
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,240
I don't know.

503
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,230
Who's that?

504
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,850
Why did you come here?

505
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,520
Didn't you ask me to come?

506
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,000
I didn't know it was this type of cocktail party. I thought it was an ordinary one.

507
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,840
Who is this?

508
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:45,730
- This is...
- This is Miss Meng, Meng Hui.

509
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,830
She is Director Shen's girlfriend.

510
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,750
- She's his girlfriend?
- Girlfriend?

511
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,980
When I asked you, you kept talking about other matters.

512
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,140
Look now, you already brought her here.

513
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,420
I am going to go to the bathroom.

514
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,560
It's okay, you only wore clothes that weren't appropriate.

515
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,740
You are an adult, the guests are also adults.

516
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,870
It's not a big deal.

517
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,560
As long as you behave well and elegantly,

518
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,130
everything will be natural.

519
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,640
Things are already like this, if you keep restraining yourself, things will be even more awkward.

520
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,730
It's just a social party,

521
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,370
what you wear is not important. Meng Hui you can do it.

522
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,450
Don't trouble Shen Yi.

523
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,250
Don't let someone else come out.

524
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,410
Miss Meng.

525
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,200
I also dressed wrongly because I am so busy.

526
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,460
Everyone here doesn't work with secret organizations. I hosted this gathering

527
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,840
because I wanted everyone to be together and chat together. I didn't do it to just play golf.

528
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,490
Thank you.

529
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,790
I heard that you are a makeup artist.

530
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,690
Yes, I also will do some advertisements and makeup reviews.

531
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,350
So I'm very interested in today's chatting topic.

532
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,690
It can't totally be fully considered that I don't fit in here.

533
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,650
Interesting. Then Miss Meng, you work at the front lines of the market. I want to ask you,

534
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,760
do you have any ideas about next year's makeup trends?

535
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,900
Director Zhang started off by producing eyeshadow. He's very good at it.

536
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,400
I can't talk about any innovative ideas, but I have some of my own thoughts.

537
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,200
In terms of eyeshadow trends, I think next year's trend

538
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,480
might be science and technology.

539
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,030
Girls are interested in unreal things.

540
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,800
Like the mermaid colors from the past two years,

541
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,620
and the unicorn colors too.

542
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,010
Talking about the truth, has anyone ever even seen a mermaid or a unicorn?

543
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,040
You don't even need to talk about their colors.

544
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,120
Interesting.

545
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,960
Doing makeup is like wearing clothes.

546
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,570
When we choose our eyeshadow, we already have chosen what role we are playing for the day.

547
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,380
For example, for work, we would use earthy colors.

548
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
For dates, we would use a peach blossom color.

549
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,620
For fighting, we would use a burgundy color. For parties, we would use polarizing colors.

550
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,810
For example today, I didn't realize it was such a casual setting,

551
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,360
I even added some shimmer to my eyeshadow.

552
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,190
Director Zhang.

553
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,000
LS is planning to spend ¥$200 million on research and development next year.

554
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,410
I wonder if your esteem company is willing to collaborate with us to market limited collection products.

555
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,630
You underestimated your girlfriend.

556
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,410
She actually doesn't need you to use these methods to help her.

557
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,470
Rather than saying you're saving a damsel in distress,

558
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,740
you're actually trying to alleviate your own worries.

559
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,970
Thank you for changing your outfit for me.

560
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,470
I am very happy. I also got to meet a lot of seniors in the industry,

561
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,170
and learned about next year's trends.

562
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,500
In the future,

563
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,490
can you not

564
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,840
show up at my work unannounced?

565
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,350
Okay, I won't do that again. I caused you trouble today.

566
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,660
I thought about it for a long time...

567
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,150
should we take some time apart for a few days?

568
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,570
Is it because of me?

569
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,370
No.

570
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:17,000
It's because of me. Too many things happened recently.

571
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,210
I want to organize my thoughts...

572
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,900
and...

573
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,770
our relationship.

574
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,710
Okay. I'm also quite busy these few days anyways.

575
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,270
Let's get in touch in a few days. I'm going to get going first. Bye!

576
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,430
I'll take you home.

577
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:41,370
No need, there's a bus outside.

578
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,100
It goes directly to my house, don't worry.
