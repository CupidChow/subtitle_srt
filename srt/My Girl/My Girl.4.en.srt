[Episode 4: Liquid Makeup Remover. A test for true love.]

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,000
I didn't expect that dating would be this tough.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
You think it's hard?

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
That's because you're not really in love.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
You're just acting with her.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
That's why you feel tired.

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,800
You have to believe that love is wonderful.

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Someday, you'll meet the right person

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,700
and at that time, you won't think the other party is troublesome.

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,800
I have to console them.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,000
I have to spend time and money. I can't handle it.

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,700
You can use true love to reform her.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,800
Isn't there a phrase that says "nothing else matters more than love?"

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,300
Do I have true love?

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,400
I merely want her to recover soon so that I can obtain the liquid foundation.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,400
So pick one between time and money.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,000
Miss Meng wanted to see fireworks last time to test your sincerity

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but you didn't make it happen.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,600
But this is a good opportunity to redeem yourself.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
What should I do?

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,000
The complimentary fireworks display for the public will be four months later.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Why don't you wait for four months to watch a complimentary show?

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,500
Or spend ¥50,000 for a private firework display?
(T/N: Approximately $7,075)

43
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,100
Why don't I tell my hospital to put on a fireworks display?

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,000
Take her there to watch.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
This hotpot smells great.

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
It smells really great.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,700
No need. It's not appropriate.

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,160
You can do more research.

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,300
- Hurry up.
- Okay, I will do more research on this.

50
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,200
Shen Yi, why are you going to all that trouble just for a bottle of liquid foundation?

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,900
Could it be that, what you really want, is not that liquid foundation?

52
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,100
You know what I want.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
That incident happened many years ago.

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Moreover, you didn't deliberately ruined her face.

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,600
- Can't you just let it go—
- You should know that

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,500
I can't let it go. I will never be able to do it.

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
I understand.

58
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,200
I really want to help you.

59
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Boss, Miss Meng hasn't replied to your text yet?

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
She's  probably busy.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
It has been more than an hour.

62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,800
No matter how busy she is, she still needs to reply.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Looks like Miss Meng is still angry with you.

64
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,620
Should we call her out?

65
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,300
Go and look for the most expensive Michelin 5 star restaurant.

66
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,500
"The most expensive Michelin 5 star restaurant?"

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
Did I hear that right?

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Book a nice table for dinner.

69
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Dinner? Oh my God.

70
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,600
Prepare a gift too.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,400
Gift? God!

72
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
Use the listing from Ah Tao.

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Shangri-la?

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,600
Chinese restaurant? Would there be too many people?

75
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,700
Western restaurant?

76
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,200
I wonder if Miss Meng likes Western cuisine.

77
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,000
Director Xu.

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
What evening event do you have? An appointment with a client?

79
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
No. Would Director Shen bear to spend so much money on clients?

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Meng Hui?

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
That's right.

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,000
What's wrong? Must he spend so much just for a date?

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Does she likes Shen Yi or his money instead?

84
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Director Shen is willing. It's strange for us too. Isn't that so?

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,500
In any case, I have never seen him so willing to spend so much money.

86
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,100
Have you completed your work?

87
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
You can serve the food now.

88
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,010
The flowers that you like. The toys that you like.

89
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Did you catch all these?

90
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
No, I bought them.

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,600
It's ¥100 for three. Isn't it more worth it than trying to catch them?
(T/N: Approximately $14)

92
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,300
Look, you can also have three kinds of happiness at the same time.

93
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
Thank you.

94
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,400
I'm happy if you are happy.

95
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,600
Let's eat.

96
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I checked with Ah Tao. These are your favorite foods.

97
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,600
If you don't like these...

98
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,700
it's fine.

99
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,500
I prepared an even bigger surprise.

100
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,300
You can start now.

101
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Haven't you always wanted to watch a grand display of fireworks?

102
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
Does it look beautiful?

103
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Did you prepare all of this?

104
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
It can be considered so,

105
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,400
but I found the best and most beautiful angle in the city.

106
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,800
This angle happens to avoid all the buildings from blocking the view.

107
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,300
You must be feeling a sense of accomplishment.

108
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Look at them.

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
After being busy for the whole day, they could even see such a beautiful scene after work.

110
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,000
Everyone must be very happy.

111
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,500
How could there be such an angel like you?

112
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,900
Look at my boss. It's really hard to pluck feathers from an iron rooster.
(T/N: Hard to get anything from a stingy person)

113
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,200
Looks like he values Miss Meng very much.

114
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Look at the scenario today. There's dinner and he bought flowers, too.

115
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,400
He also caught toys and there are fireworks to watch.

116
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Isn't this a good price-performance ratio with a true meaning of love?

117
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,800
In my opinion, with his rate today,

118
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Miss Meng will resume her former self this evening.

119
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Price-performance ratio?

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,700
Love can't be measured by money and time.

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,200
Look. I have made your wish come true.

122
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Am I sincere to you then?

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,920
[Alex & Becky]

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,200
- It's getting late. We should—
- I will escort you home.

125
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,000
I drove today. If it wasn't a special event today,

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
I definitely wouldn't have driven a car.

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Although there were some flaws,

128
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,400
you are special to me.

129
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,200
I suddenly remember there's a curfew in my family.

130
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
It's so late. I can't go back.

131
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,500
You are living alone. Why could there still be a curfew?

132
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,600
Even if I forgot my keys?

133
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Isn't this place a hotel?

134
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,400
Why don't we book a room here to rest?

135
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,500
No. We can't do this.

136
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,400
If you are complaining it's too expensive, let's look for a cheaper hotel.

137
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
This is not what I meant.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
- Let's go to your home then.
- No.

139
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,800
Why not?

140
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Aren't I your girlfriend?

141
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Because...

142
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,690
These are all probably prepared by Jiang Jiang, right?

143
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,770
I am really tired right now.

144
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,790
I feel exhausted.

145
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,000
This is only ten kilograms.

146
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,930
I'm talking about Meng Hui.

147
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,160
Why did you book a room at a hotel with him?

148
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,150
You took such a big step so prematurely.

149
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,870
You weren't like this before.

150
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,000
I know that he won't agree. I just wanted to try and see

151
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,650
if he really does not like me.

152
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,220
So, all my previous efforts were discarded?

153
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,950
How does she know that I'm not sincere about it?

154
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,200
Women sometimes use money and time to test love.

155
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,360
Love can be seen and touched because of these two.

156
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,580
You have to make her feel safe.

157
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,120
But it doesn't mean that the money and time you spent on her is proof of your true love.

158
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,110
Even more so, you should let her see your true love.

159
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,270
Don't you think it's strange?

160
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,660
Shen Yi has never talked about his hobbies,

161
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,910
ideal, and past.

162
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,580
I think I don't even know him.

163
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,390
I think he doesn't even know me either.

164
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,870
You are making everything too hard for yourself.

165
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,730
Both of you have only been together for a short time. You should give him more time, right?

166
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,850
Shouldn't two people get to know each other better before they get together?

167
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,790
Must I fall in love with her before I can obtain the liquid foundation?

168
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,140
How could I possibly fall in love with a woman?

169
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,650
Why can't you, Shen Yi?

170
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,290
Why don't you be serious about love?

171
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,240
Sometimes, I really want to ask you this question.

172
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,790
You have always been alone. Don't you feel lonely?

173
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,600
What about loneliness? Don't I have you?

174
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,620
Let's train again.

175
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,580
You have me?

176
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,910
Am I the same as a girlfriend?

177
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,260
Moreover, at this time now,

178
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,950
how will you obtain the liquid foundation?

179
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,980
I will think about this again.

180
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,570
I can't always be accommodating.

181
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,370
If not,

182
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,700
I will fall into my own trap.

183
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,480
What you did to your nose... is it nose cartilage or ear cartilage?

184
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,270
Ear cartilage.

185
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Tie her hair up.

186
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,290
Go away.

187
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,770
There are scars behind your ears. Tie up your hair and let Meng Hui cover up the scars.

188
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,210
Are you a devil?

189
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,560
Guarantee I get you into the final round.

190
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,420
How's it?

191
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,610
This scar is quite deep.

192
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,260
If I could see the process of how she covered the scar,

193
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,060
I might possibly invent the formula.

194
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,750
- So what Wei Lei did was use ear cartilage.
- I always thought it was costal cartilage.

195
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,620
How much money did she spend on it?

196
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,990
You can't even tell!

197
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm going to get Meng Hui to cover up my scar.

198
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,840
Fine.  I will get her in a moment.

199
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,750
Great.

200
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,240
They'll kick off the recording at 8 o'clock. It's now 7:40.

201
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,420
Tell me. Where is that Demon Prince for the kickoff?

202
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,840
She just sent me a message. She's in a traffic jam on Third Ring road.

203
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,530
- Is there a substitute?
- The sub is stuck on Fourth Ring road.

204
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,150
Oh my god.

205
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,640
In my dreams, I never thought I'd be cut because of traffic jams.

206
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,540
What can we do?

207
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,560
There're so many workers in the show's team. We can find someone to take her place.

208
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,670
Knock her out in the first round.

209
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,960
Meng Hui.

210
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
I think it works, good looking too.

211
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,430
However, if the sugar mama is on stage, will we be able to eliminate her in the first round?

212
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,280
We'll talk again once you're ready.

213
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,910
You want to replace me.

214
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,830
Meng Hui, I have the scar at the back. Shen Yi asked you to put some foundation on.

215
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,870
Fine. Sit down.

216
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,480
You, too.

217
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,520
Childish.

218
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,770
The tactic is a bit childish but it's useful. That's good enough.

219
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,060
You just take your time to sit here.

220
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,990
I'm going on stage.

221
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,820
Take her to the hospital immediately!

222
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,180
Hurry. Hurry.

223
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,130
- What's going on? Why you did that?
- I didn't...

224
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,530
I saw it and you still made an excuse!

225
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,100
You saw it.

226
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,470
No matter how much you hate Wei Lei, you shouldn't have done it!

227
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,830
Do you know how important a face to a woman?

228
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,900
You don't know how hard she worked to be pretty.

229
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,390
You don't even know you ruined a person's face! You'll—

230
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,130
You will feel so guilty!

231
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,150
If you are so worried about her, why don't you go see her?

232
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,460
Get out! Get out!

233
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,340
M-Miss Wei.

234
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,730
Did you hear me? Get out!

235
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,940
I don't want you to see me like this.

236
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,800
Don't you hate me?

237
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,450
You must be happy right now.

238
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,580
I didn't come to joke around.

239
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,330
- Miss Wei Lei, please calm down.
- How can I calm down?

240
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,170
I know that you all look down on me,

241
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,230
but do you know how much work I went through to get to this place today?

242
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,220
Ever since I was little, when I wasn't pretty, I received so many sarcastic remarks.

243
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,320
I starved every day to be able to lose weight,

244
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,790
only being able to eat a few steamed vegetables.

245
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,470
I have no problem with my teeth.

246
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,410
I still removed four of them.

247
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,450
You surely know how the needle for whitening teeth hurts the kidneys, but I still endured the injections.

248
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,330
Do you think I don't know that there's a problem with my nose?

249
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,390
But I don't dare fix it.

250
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,730
I'm afraid that after it's fixed, I'll have to worry every day about the feeling I'd have if the surgery isn't successful.

251
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,010
Then it would have to go back to having the feeling of being a really ugly person. None of you can understand that.

252
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,240
Thank you.

253
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,530
Before the finals, I'll have the show staff prepare a makeup segment.

254
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,530
If you really have the strength for it, you will surely be able to get back into the show.

255
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,850
Meng Hui hurt your face.

256
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,340
I hope that you will forgive her.

257
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,660
Meng Hui.

258
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,020
Didn't she knock over the camera?

259
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,540
It doesn't have anything to do with her.

260
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,840
It was my bad luck.

261
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,120
I saw it and you still made an excuse!

262
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,040
You saw it with your own eyes?

263
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,300
Prepare her dinner.

264
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,470
No need. Thank you.

265
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,620
When I think about how the show could be messed up,

266
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,180
I can't eat.

267
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,540
Don't worry. I'm here.

268
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,640
I will find a way for her to recover.

269
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,560
I only saw it from one side. Without making any distinction between right and wrong, I yelled at her.

270
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,400
I really messed this up.

271
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,900
If you want her to know your true feelings,

272
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,280
then you need to be more mindful.

273
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,620
Talk with her.

274
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Miss Wei Lei, let me introduce myself.

275
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,700
I'm Sui An, director of this hospital.

276
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,500
From now on, I will be taking care of your nose.

277
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,150
Dr. Sui,

278
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,000
please sit.

279
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,600
I just want to ask you. When can I have my surgery?

280
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,400
Can I recover in a month?

281
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,800
I still need to film the show.

282
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,800
It hurts!

283
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
I haven't touched you yet.

284
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,400
This time, it really hurts.

285
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,800
How many times has your nose been operated on?

286
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,100
Just... one.

287
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,300
How many?

288
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Two.

289
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,040
Think again.

290
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,400
Four times. This will be the fifth time.

291
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Then, why did you have so many surgeries before?

292
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,100
To make it perfect.

293
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,200
At first, it was just a hyaluronic acid injection.

294
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,800
Then, it was swayed and I did a thread lift at a clinic.

295
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,400
Later I changed it into polytetrafluoroethylene.

296
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,800
But the surgeon who put in the polytetrafluoroethylene put it in crooked.

297
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,400
They took it out and then re-did it again. Plastic surgery, you know,

298
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,700
the pace of recovery can never match the trend.

299
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,700
After the Korean style was no longer popular, I changed my nose tip and also made my nose wing more narrow.

300
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,340
Just any kind?

301
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,520
Didn't you just say you didn't want to have surgery during recovery?

302
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Miss Wei Lei, your surgery has great risks.

303
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I have to re-evaluate it.

304
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,100
You mean, I can't do the surgery?

305
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,200
The percentage of surgery failure is great.

306
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,490
Aren't you worried?

307
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,600
What's the use of worrying?

308
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,000
The worst scenario is for me to be ugly.

309
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,200
Seems like I've never experienced that.

310
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,100
When I first had plastic surgery,

311
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,600
I already understood there would be a day like this.

312
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,070
It was my fault. I shouldn't have blamed you.

313
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,500
It's okay.

314
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Can you forgive me?

315
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Let's break up.

316
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,500
Why?

317
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,200
You don't know what kind of person I am.

318
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,500
I also don't know what kind of person you are.

319
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,600
You never believed me.

320
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,200
You have never fully opened your heart to me.

321
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,000
What's worse is you have never shown your heart to anyone.

322
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,580
What are you talking about?

323
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,400
You isolate yourself.

324
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,000
You're lonely and depressed.

325
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,600
Aren't you tired living like this?

326

Whatever happened, can't you tell me?

327

Okay, I agree.

Let's break up.

329
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,600
Acting timid all day,

330

but you tell on us to the teacher.

331
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,200
Did we bully you?

332
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,200
N-No.

Carrying a broken backpack

334
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
is not our fault, right?

335
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,400
Right.

336
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
After this, don't let me see you again.

337

[Zheng Jue]

341
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,200
My mom bought me a new backpack. I'll give it to you.

342
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,700
You don't have to.

343
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,100
Mind your own business.

344
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,400
Since you don't want the new one,

345
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,600
then I'll just give you my old one.

346
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Anyway, I can't bring two bags to school.

Thank you.

348
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
I still don't know what your name is.

349
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,900
My mom once told me there's no need to leave a name when doing something good.

350
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,500
Then, can we be friends?

351
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,300
Of course!

Get him!

353
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,000
Didn't you tell on us to the teacher?

354
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,800
You told them we bullied you and we broke your backpack?

355

- N-No...
- No?

356
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,500
After you talked with the teacher, I had to stand in the hallway all afternoon.

357
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,800
If it's not you, who else?

358

Wimp. You dare do it but don't admit it.

Why are you carrying a girl's backpack?

363
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,200
This time, if I don't teach you a lesson,

Meng Hui broke up with me. I agreed.

Our relationship wasn't real anyway.

377

There's nothing between us.

How can I help someone else with theirs?

From now on, if Meng Hui has a problem, don't come to me. I'm sorry.

Alright, stop doing makeup. You can take a break.

388

Mr. Su, I have to tell you something. Wei Lei's nose is broken.

What?

00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,770
If Wei Lei's nose is broken,

391
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,880
then isn't her face ruined? How can we shoot the show?

- That's right.
- What a pity.

What a pity? It's not natural anyway, that's all.

Don't say that.

00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,310
Wearing makeup can make someone like you,

401

but you can only really know if he loves you without makeup on.

00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,170
Stop the recording! Now!

485
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,130
Shen Yi! This will ruin the show!

486
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,390
I'll take responsibility.

487
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,730
Why did the live show stop?

488
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,080
Is our TV broken?

489
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,780
I don't know.

490
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,970
Let's start over.

491
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,160
When we remove the disguise,

492
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,290
it's a new beginning.

493
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:30,480
♫  Life is like strolling in an endless circle  ♫

494
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,560
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

495
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,690
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

496
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:45,650
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

497
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,620
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

498
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,750
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

499
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:04,270
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

500
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,990
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

501
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:19,840
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

502
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,620
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

503
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:35,090
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

504
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,960
♫  Leading me  ♫

505
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,370
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

506
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:52,270
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

507
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:06,120
