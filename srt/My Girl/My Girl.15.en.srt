[Episode 15: Tears are the natural eye make-up]

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,300
Meng Hui is asleep

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Shen Yi.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But why would she call me her older brother?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,700
Right now the problem  is complicated.

25
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
In Meng Hui's mind,

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,200
she is your biological daughter from your marriage prior to Shen Yi's father.

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,800
It was after your marriage that you brought her to the new family.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,900
I understand.

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,800
So our family is formed from remarriage.

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I am Meng Hui's birth mother. I have a daughter now?

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,200
I did tell her before I wanted to have a daughter like her.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,400
Who would've known that she really put my words in her heart.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,600
Technically speaking

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Meng Hui and I are not related by blood,

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,400
but just an older brother living together.

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Yes.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Great, I can still be her boyfriend.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Are you laughing at me?

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Meng Hui is taking me as her boyfriend.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,800
You better think why she said that.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,300
Yeah, why is that?

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,200
Meng Hui is treating you as her older step-brother

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,600
and thinks she has a sister-in-law.

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
Xiao Ba.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
This is fake, a misunderstanding.

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
You ask Meng Hui if she thinks this is a misunderstanding.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,100
Then do you believe it is a misunderstanding?

48
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,100
What's the point if she believes it or not?

49
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
Meng Hui right now is Sui An's girlfriend.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,100
That was all fake, can everyone please get that sorted out?

51
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,600
However, to Meng Hui this is all real.

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
What did I ever do wrong?

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,200
Meng Hui, what do I do? What are you going to do!

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
This is all your fault.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,600
Why are you blaming me?

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
You still think you are so good and innocent?

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300
This is all your doing.

58
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,000
Why are you being so nice to Xiao Ba behind Meng Hui's back?

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Meng Hui wanted to convince your dad and pretended to be your older sister.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Good, you acted like you disappeared.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Now this is good, Meng Hui really became your younger sister,

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Sui An is really now your Brother-in-law. Are you content?

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,200
I already said this was a misunderstanding, it was fake.

64
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,100
It was fake between you two at the start.

65
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,400
What happens if the act becomes real?

66
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Stop, stop, stop.

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Please calm down. Calm down.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Actually, I have a part and I'm responsible too.

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I didn't come up with better options to let Shen Yi come home.

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,100
So all of you, please stop blaming her.

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,400
Then can I blame Meng Hui?

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Of course not!

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Right now she is my daughter.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
Whatever she does is right.

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Then can I blame Sui An?

76
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Sui—

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,900
Doctor Sui has to cooperate with my daughter in dating.

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,800
It's already not easy.

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't  blame him, don't blame him.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Then I can only blame Shen Yi.

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
You two were doing good, but why did you fight with her?

82
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,200
R-Right now Meng Hui is

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,400
alone in the room. I will go to accompany her.

84
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,000
The rest... the rest of you guys talk about it.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,500
Auntie can cooperate to anything.

86
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,600
Now let's all think how Meng Hui can recover.

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,400
We still need to observe this situation.

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,600
We need to know what her wish is.

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
How to satisfy her.

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,200
I was wrong.

91
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,700
It's my fault.

92
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,600
Yes, before I did ask you for a favor

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,900
to help me take care of Meng Hui.

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,990
I will always take care of her.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,600
If what you said about taking care of her was

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,400
by being her boyfriend,

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,300
I don't want it.

98
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,200
But she does.

99
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,300
Shen Yi. I think you should take this opportunity to make things clear.

100
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,700
What does that scar mean to you?

101
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,000
I am very clear.

102
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,900
Originally you could go and keep running away,

103
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,800
but now the  opportunity to choose is here.

104
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,200
To you, which is more important. Meng Hui or the scar?

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,300
If you can't think of your answer... then you really don't love Meng Hui.

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
And you two are not suitable to be with each other.

107
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,600
Sui An. Why do I think you've changed?

108
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,100
You would even harm me just  to be with Meng Hui.

109
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,400
Are you hiding something from me?

110
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I already wanted to ask you!

111
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Why are you all of sudden so nice to Meng Hui?

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Are you guys...

113
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,000
Sui An. Why do I think you've changed?

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Are you hiding something from me?

115
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,100
[Meng Hui]

116
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Sorry.

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,300
Lets go.

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
In this school, I really hate that boy.

119
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
Every single day he complains to the teacher about us.

120
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,900
Acting like we bullied him.

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Isn't it you that tattletales on us?

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Saying we bully you, taking your backpack.

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,300
N-No.

124
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,500
Say it clearly. That day I did bump you and I didn't bully you.

125
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
Did I do it on purpose? You need to tell the teacher.

126
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,300
I had to stand outside for the whole afternoon.

127
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,600
It really wasn't me.

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,900
It was me! You guys stop bullying him!

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Hello Shen Yi.

130
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
I've been thinking about her a lot recently.

131
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Actually I've been searching for you.

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
There hasn't been any progress.

133
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
But if there is any news, I'll tell you.

134
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,200
[...]

135
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
You are?

136
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,100
Teacher.

137
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,400
Sui An.

138
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,500
This is my daughter Meng Hui. When she was a child, she was very clingy.

139
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,600
I purposely put her in that school

140
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
so she can be more independent.

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,000
But every day after class, she still runs back to me to play.

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The truth, is it that fearful?

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The reason why I'm asking you out for lunch is because I have important things to show you.

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,800
If you have time, take a look.

145
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
What is this?

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
You'll have a different opinion after you look at it.

147
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Did you read the envelope I gave you?

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
I forgot.

149
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,000
You didn't even go to the elementary school to confirm

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,100
and you already think Xiao Ba is the person you're looking for?

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
I don't need to confirm. She is the one.

152
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Let me ask you again.

153
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Which one is important? Guilt or love?

154
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,200
He's my boyfriend.

155
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,300
Who is your boyfriend?

156
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,200
Teacher, I'm sorry.

157
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
At the time, if I didn't provoke Zheng Jue,

158
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,400
then he would not make a mark on Meng Hui's face.

159
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
If there's a chance,

160
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,500
I want to make it up for Meng Hui and Zheng Jue.

161
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,710
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Later on, did you bump into Zheng Jue?

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,600
I did.

164
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,000
He's my junior in university

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,100
but I never told him what happened back then.

166
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,090
I kept hiding it from him.

167
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,260
[Zheng Jue]

168
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,300
Director Shen, are you looking for something?

169
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,400
Director Shen, these were all prepared by Dr. Sui.

170
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,600
Director Shen, Dr. Sui really treats you well.

171
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Director Shen, don't be made at Dr. Sui.

172
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,500
No, look at all these years that Dr. Sui took care of you.

173
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,800
I think this issue

174
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
you can't blame Dr. Sui.

175
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,500
He just wants to keep Miss Meng company and date her.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400
He did it to help you.

177
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Just treat it like he's dating you.

178
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
That's right. I'm going to write a sever ties letter.

179
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,700
This pen too.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
I will go pick up Meng Hui right now.

181
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,400
That... the suit...

182
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,000
is too.

183
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
The car...

184
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,400
I-It's fine.

185
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,050
My Little Meng Hui, how come you got up?

186
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,290
What did the doctor say? They said to rest and well. How could you get up?

187
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,170
Have a seat.

188
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,830
How do you feel, baby?

189
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,490
I feel much better.

190
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,540
Oh right. I made soup for you. Give it a try.

191
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,970
Be careful.

192
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,850
It tastes good. You must've made it for a long time.

193
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,850
Of course. I already made it for ten years.

194
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,210
As long as you like drinking it.

195
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,780
Drink it slowly.

196
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,780
Thank you for picking me up today.

197
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,370
Blow on it.

198
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,230
Does it taste good?

199
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,620
You have to drink all of it. Don't leave any.

200
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,680
Older Brother.

201
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,820
Shen Yi, why are you standing there for? Hurry and greet your younger sister.

202
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,660
You're here, Older Brother.

203
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,730
Are you doing it on purpose?

204
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,750
Meng Hui, we haven't gone on a date for a long time.

205
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,640
Do you want to go out together later?

206
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,330
- Okay.
- You can't.

207
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,820
It hasn't been that long since you recovered. You're still a patient.

208
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,190
The doctor said that she'll get better if she goes out and walks.

209
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,210
That's right. The doctor did say that if she goes out and walks then she'll recover faster.

210
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,560
Go ahead and walk. Hurry.

211
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,240
Then please bring Meng Hui's belongings back home.

212
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,940
I will send her back after the date is over.

213
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,140
Take care of Little Meng Hui.

214
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,040
Be careful. Come back earlier.

215
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,670
Auntie, bring this back first. I will find someone to bring it back.

216
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,730
But...

217
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,820
Hello.

218
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,810
Do you want one? Which color?

219
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,460
The pink one.

220
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,970
Okay.

221
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,520
Older Brother, why are you here?

222
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,910
I'll buy it. How can I let Meng Hui spend someone's money?

223
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,120
Boss.

224
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,390
Meng Hui.

225
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,690
That way you won't get lost.

226
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,110
Don't be sour. You also get one.

227
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,580
Here. This is for you.

228
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,690
Big Brother, can you give me another color?

229
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,600
Brother, it's the same style.

230
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,690
Let's go.

231
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,510
Give me one. I'm also afraid that I'll get lost.

232
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,270
Okay.

233
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,320
Meng Hui, you can't just focus on dating.

234
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,590
You have to let me evaluate him first to see if he treats you well

235
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,410
or if I treat you well.

236
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,070
How good siblings treat each other is different from couples.

237
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,270
I'm going to let you understand today if it's the same or not.

238
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,680
Older Brother, Doctor Sui is your friend for so long.

239
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,670
Don't you know if he's good or not?

240
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,490
Even biological brothers need to settle their accounts clearly. Moreover, one can't predict a person's heart.

241
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,270
If you pick a boyfriend, I have to agree.

242
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,950
I have the right to say if he has the ability to take care of you.

243
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,620
I don't have the right.

244
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,220
You do?

245
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,210
Ferris wheel is for couples to ride together, right?

246
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,830
Brother, where is sister-in-law? How come she didn't come?

247
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,070
I insist on riding.

248
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,280
See, during the important time, he doesn't know how to protect you.

249
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,310
How can you let such a man take care of you?

250
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,480
But when she's in that state, I will never leave her because of someone.

251
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,220
May I ask, which do you guys want?

252
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,620
Mister, your cotton candies.

253
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,770
Thank you. Meng Hui.

254
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,390
Thank you.

255
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,710
I finally understand now.

256
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,030
You are now taking advantage of someone's precarious position. I'm going to make you—

257
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,060
Shen Yi, this is my last time helping you.

258
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,520
If you still don't understand why  Meng Hui is treating herself like your younger sister

259
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,780
and me being her boyfriend then you guys should just break up.

260
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,800
Meng Hui.

261
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,760
Something suddenly happened at the hospital. I have to go back. Let Shen Yi go back home with you.

262
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,300
We will meet up another day.

263
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,710
Okay.

264
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,210
Take it.

265
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,420
I'm leaving.

266
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,140
Come on. I will take you a place.

267
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,410
- How much is it?
- It's free. The mister just then already paid.

268
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,530
He said that he's giving it to you.

269
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,000
So cheeky.

270
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,280
Sui An looks mature

271
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,720
but he actually acts on impulse.

272
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,200
He looks gentle and caring but he still left you behind.

273
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,670
He doesn't care about you at all.

274
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,620
Also, his hospital.

275
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,500
The market hasn't been that great these past two years.

276
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,840
I feel like it can't continue to stay open much longer.

277
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,980
Anyways, I feel like he isn't the one.

278
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,250
Why don't you break up with him?

279
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,700
If you're embarrassed to say it then I'll help you say it.

280
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,730
When you find boyfriends in the future, you have to find ones like me.

281
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,850
Brother, why are you talking about Dr. Sui like that?

282
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,170
Meng Hui, why aren't you sitting in the driver's side?

283
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,920
I'm afraid that sister-in-law will be mad if she found out.

284
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,330
I...

285
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,170
Meng Hui, you don't have a sister-in-law.

286
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,420
Xiao Ba and I aren't like what you think we are.

287
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,250
Older Brother, are you treating me like an outsider?

288
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,970
Why would you think that?

289
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,530
Since you were young, you never treated a girl this well.

290
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,940
You've been acting so attentive and considerate toward Xiao Ba

291
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,360
and does everything she wants. It's obvious she holds a special place in your heart.

292
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,400
Then... then if that's the case.

293
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,510
But I am even more attentive and considerate toward you

294
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,200
and I always care about your feelings.

295
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,820
Are we also different then?

296
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,560
We're siblings.

297
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,650
We're siblings that aren't blood-related.

298
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,350
That's what I'm afraid of.

299
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,080
It was hard for you to meet a girl that you want to protect.

300
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,660
Don't argue with sister-in-law because of me.

301
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,900
Okay.

302
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,860
What do you want me to do?

303
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,610
You want a sister-in-law, right?

304
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,390
Okay. Xiao Ba, Xiao Jiu, and Xiao Shi. You can have anyone you want.

305
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,530
It's not that I want a sister-in-law.

306
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,650
Okay, I want a sister-in-law. I will arrange it.

307
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,130
Come over.

308
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,800
Vice President Xu, didn't you tell us to not meet privately at the company?

309
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,400
How come you came looking for me yourself?

310
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,030
What is this?

311
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,280
Apple stem cell repair technology is a cheaper alternative to using plasma peptides.

312
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,000
I put in tremendous efforts and used all my contacts to find him.

313
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,800
He came from abroad just waiting for Shen Yi to sign it.

314
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,410
Now you ruined it. Do you know how much time and money was wasted?

315
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,700
Does your heart ache for Shen Yi's efforts?

316
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,740
You have to be responsible for this.

317
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,010
If I'm responsible then that means you are.

318
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,350
Moreover, I didn't come to the company to work.

319
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,200
Did you forget why you arranged for me to be at the company?

320
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,510
Moreover, it was you who wanted to show that you saved the critical situation for the blood albumen.

321
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,920
You ruined it yourself.

322
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,700
You even remembered that I spent money to recruit you.

323
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,020
I'm your boss.

324
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,120
Shen Yi is your boss, right?

325
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,690
If you reprimand me like this and Shen Yi were to see,

326
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,750
will he misunderstand?

327
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,470
Do you really think you're something to Shen Yi?

328
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,950
Sister.

329
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,050
Xing Yao, why are you looking for Xiao Ba?

330
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,340
Nothing.

331
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,430
Handle the red file and change the time.

332
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,540
It's fine. Leave it there for now. Work isn't important.

333
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,840
Today, can I bother you

334
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,470
and come home with me to meet my family?

335
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,780
Okay.

336
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,130
But who will pick up the work?

337
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,480
Xing Yao, please handle the files. You've worked hard.

338
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
What do I do?

339
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,630
If time passes then I might be your female boss.

340
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,090
Get out.

341
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,590
Hello auntie and uncle, I'm glad to be a guest at your home.

342
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,620
I'm Shen Yi's friend.

343
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,160
Let me introduce you. This is my dad,

344
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,120
this is my auntie, and this is my—

345
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm his younger sister. I'm Meng Hui.

346
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,750
I'll go out and walk the dogs.

347
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,640
How would you know how to walk the dogs? Wait for me.

348
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,560
You guys talk for a while.

349
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,790
I will go brew some tea for you guys.

350
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,330
The situation is a bit complicated right now.

351
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,980
Meng Hui is actually my girlfriend and not my younger sister.

352
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,780
Your girlfriend looks so beautiful.

353
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,830
So, I called you over today to act as my girlfriend.

354
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,820
If she calls you sister-in-law then deal with it.

355
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,930
As for the reason, I won't be telling you.

356
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,700
I will thank you well afterwards.

357
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,220
It's fine. The fact that I can attend such a warm family gathering like this,

358
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,650
I'm already very happy.

359
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,840
Since I was young, I never did this.

360
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,900
Shen Yi, Sui An is here. Help him park the car.

361
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,390
I'll take care of her.

362
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,260
Auntie.

363
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,080
Sui An? I heard from my coworkers at the company

364
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,700
that Sui An and Shen Yi are best friends.

365
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,030
They're enemies now.

366
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,060
Oh right. What do you like to eat?

367
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Tell me and I will have them make it for you.

368
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,760
- Auntie, I like eating一
- Seeing how you're so skinny

369
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,210
you must like eating vegetables, right?

370
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,560
I will stir fry some vegetables to nourish you. What color do you like?

371
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,660
- I will go buy clothes with you.
- Auntie, tomorrow—

372
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,970
You don't have time, right? You must be busy with work.

373
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,560
It's fine that you don't have time this month. We can go next month, okay?

374
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,630
I will let Shen Yi invite you and we'll go together as a family.

375
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,900
I will go get cake for you guys to eat.

376
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,100
Auntie, you're acting in front of Meng Hui?

377
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,390
Shen Yi already told you.

378
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,930
You have to cooperate with us and he will thank you afterward.

379
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,550
Okay. Auntie, don't worry.

380
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,470
I will cooperate with you.

381
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,720
Auntie,

382
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,270
take a look. Your jewelry is so beautiful.

383
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,850
Looking at this quality, I can tell it's the finest jade.

384
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,470
It really is impressive. Shen Yi told me a few days ago that he'd buy me a set of jewelry.

385
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,450
It was a matter from two days ago. He probably forgot.

386
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,670
Auntie, look at this.

387
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,860
How could I accept such a valuable gift?

388
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,550
This is my first time coming and you're giving me a such valuable jewelry.

389
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,240
I didn't think you would like me. I will temporarily accept it.

390
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,060
Thank you, Auntie. I will wear it first.

391
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,220
It looks nice.

392
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,030
Auntie, this was given to mom by uncle.

393
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,450
It's an heirloom? Is it given to their daughter-in-law?

394
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,360
Auntie, I didn't think you would like me.

395
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,160
Auntie, don't worry. I will definitely get along with Shen Yi.

396
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Yes.

397
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I really like you.

398
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,700
Auntie, I also like you.

399
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,160
I like this too.

400
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,340
I really like it. Thank you, Auntie.

401
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,510
It looks so nice.

402
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,140
Auntie, don't worry. I will wear it for a few days.

403
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,510
After I finish cooperating then I will return it.

404
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,700
It looks so nice.

405
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,740
I can't eat anymore. I'm full.

406
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,580
You already look so pretty and you're still on a diet?

407
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,830
I'm already looking like this.

408
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,140
Forget it. I'm not eating either.

409
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,090
Sister-in-law, don't be courteous. I will eat some more with you.

410
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,580
I'm not eating anymore.

411
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,690
I'll go take a look.

412
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,490
Uncle.

413
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,490
Why did you come?

414
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,750
You weren't full, right?

415
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,600
I'm already full from anger.

416
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,320
Uncle, because sister-in-law is always mentioning the scar

417
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,480
so you're not happy?

418
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,430
I know you and older brother feel guilty because of what happened back then but I think

419
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,920
if a person can be brave and talk about what they went through,

420
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,340
then that means they really don't mind.

421
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:31,040
I hope you and your older brother don't put yourself in a hard position.

422
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,650
Since the pain was already made then don't make it bigger, ok?

423
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,060
Since the pain was already made

424
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,210
then don't make it bigger?

425
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,250
- Is that really what you think?
- Yes.

426
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,440
Meng Hui, you're really a good girl.

427
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,410
I want to be alone right now. You go do your things.

428
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,060
Okay, remember to eat.

429
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,550
Hello, Xiao Ja.

430
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,420
I want you to help me investigate a person.

431
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,310
A new employee at Shen Yi's company, Xiao Ba.

432
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,360
It's windy on the balcony.

433
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,810
No thanks. I'm not cold.

434
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,490
I'm still a bit cold. I'll just wear it.

435
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,130
Thank you.

436
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,700
You actually don't like me.

437
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,910
You just want Shen Yi to feel like you like me, right?

438
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,750
I'm sorry.

439
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,710
I seem to not be able to do things well.

440
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:13,700
The person you like was always Shen Yi.

441
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,740
What's the point of liking?

442
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,980
To him, Xiao Ba is the special one.

443
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,030
I'm sorry. I seem to hurt you.

444
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,450
It's not your fault.

445
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,380
At the start, it was us that left out an important problem.

446
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,130
From the start to finish, no matter who you become,

447
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,280
the person that you like will always Shen Yi.

448
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,180
Give it to me.

449
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm drinking apple juice.

450
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,860
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

451
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,190
Why are you following me?

452
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,320
I'm worried that you'll get drunk.

453
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,670
You're following me even to the bathroom?

454
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,710
Shen Yi.

455
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,780
You remember?

456
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,450
Where is sister-in-law?

457
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,650
There's no sister-in-law.

458
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,230
I... I just...

459
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,320
[Xiao Ba]

460
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,280
That day, I just...

461
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,590
Answer it.

462
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,110
Don't drink anymore. I will explain when I come back.

463
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,110
Men say something but do something else.

464
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,010
Wei Lei, stop drinking.

465
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,920
Who are you to me? Why should you care about me?

466
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,300
I told you so many times that I'm with my girlfriend.

467
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,750
This is my personal time right now.

468
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,480
Other than personal time, I can do anything at anytime

469
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,320
but not now.

470
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,590
I will drink for you.

471
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,030
Me.

472
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,220
I know...

473
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,020
What are you looking at?

474
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,610
Young lady, where are you going?

475
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,120
What are you looking at?

476
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,920
I didn't look at you.

477
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,500
He wants to beat me up.

478
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,780
Why don't you try and see?

479
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,870
What do you guys want to do?

480
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,140
Young lady, let's go have a few drinks.

481
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,660
Let's go.

482
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,400
Okay, wait for me.

483
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,620
Okay.

484
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,630
- Come on.
- Jiang Jiang.

485
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,370
Be obedient and wait for me here.

486
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,810
- Close your eyes.
- She's mines.

487
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,340
Look at her figure.

488
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,530
Ah Tao. Ah Tao, are you fine?

489
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,800
Ah Tao, can I open my eyes now?

490
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,170
You can now.

491
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,170
I'm so dizzy.

492
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,200
I told you before that you can't drink right now.

493
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,240
Some things,

494
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,610
can only be said once you're drunk.

495
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,490
We only have a doctor and patient relationship.

496
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,650
Either don't care about me

497
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,100
or obey me.

498
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,010
- Let's drink.
- Brother, sorry.

499
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,930
Sorry, we didn't do it on purpose.

500
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,790
She was the one who f-forced us to drink.

501
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,520
Where is Meng Hui?

502
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,070
Stop drinking. I will keep you company.

503
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,330
Beauty,

504
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,630
are you drunk?

505
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,810
Are you drunk? Let's drink some more.

506
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,500
Let's go and drink some more.

507
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,890
Let's drink.

508
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,820
- Who are you?
- I'm her older brother.

509
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,730
Her older brother?

510
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,550
Don't worry.

511
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,750
I will take care of your younger sister.

512
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,530
Younger sister.

513
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,400
What are you doing?

514
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,140
I suggest you keep your hands to yourself.

515
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,070
Do you want to hit me?

516
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,930
Let me tell you. If you break these things,

517
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,670
it will cost a lot of money. Try me.

518
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,610
Look everyone. He was the one who did it.

519
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,230
What's going on?

520
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,260
Boss, he broke it.

521
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,980
Everyone saw that he broke it.

522
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,940
So cheesy.

523
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,950
What's so great about this?

524
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,500
I will pay for it.

525
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:21,010

No matter how intricate the eye shadow looks, it still pales in comparison to your unwavering gaze at me.
