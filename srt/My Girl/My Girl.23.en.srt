[Episode 23: The scar on your face, the wound in my heart]

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,650
During this time, I often think back at when we first met.

22
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,740
These ten years, I kept letting myself believe

23
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,940
that I don't have any feelings for you

24
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,780
but I know I still love you.

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,220
Y-You also love me, right?

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,710
No matter what happens,

27
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,870
I'll still love you.

28
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,090
Then, I can't abandon you even more and go to England myself.

29
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,550
We already missed out on each other for ten years.

30
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,030
During these ten years, each day,

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,800
I was doubting your feelings towards me.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,400
I was afraid that you felt guilty so you were together with me.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,600
I often throw tempers with you

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,740
and I want you to argue with me.

35
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,450
I just want to see if you still care about me.

36
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,630
You won't blame me, right?

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,970
I'm not a good wife or lover.

38
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,790
I only cared about myself and left you out.

39
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,210
I'm sorry, I really think I'm so useless.

40
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,880
Compared to you, the scar is considered nothing.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,530
I'm not going to England.

42
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,650
I want to stay by your side and take care of you.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't need you to take care of me.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,220
I can take care of myself.

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,070
But I can't be at ease with you.

46
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,970
Your PTSD can get triggered again at any time.

47
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,380
I can go with you.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,090
Then, what about your company? You worked so hard to created LS Company.

49
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,780
The company can't do without you, right?

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,650
- Also, what about the scar fading serum?
- The company has Jiang Jiang, Da Shu, and Xiao Mei.

51
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,980
If it doesn't work then there's still my dad.

52
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,070
Don't worry. The company will keep running even if I'm not there.

53
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,160
Shen Yi, I really don't care about this scar anymore.

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,410
But I care!

55
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,840
Do you know why I have PTSD?

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,150
Since I was young, how many accidents have I experienced?

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,240
It was only that time.

58
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,510
How many times do I have to experience pain

59
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,410
for me to develop PTSD?

60
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,920
That scar, it's that scar.

61
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,510
Do you think it's on your face?

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,250
It's actually in my heart.

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,530
Everytime I see this scar,

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,120
my heart really aches.

65
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,500
Do you know when you

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,440
tell me that you want to do that recovery surgery,

67
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,760
how happy I was?

68
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,440
It can finally be even with us.

69
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,630
I finally won't owe you anymore

70
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,900
but you suddenly said you're not doing it anymore.

71
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,350
Do you want this scar

72
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,460
to delay me for ten more years?

73
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,360
Shen Yi.

74
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,420
Meng Hui,

75
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,770
let's divorce.

76
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,310
When I first started pretending to have PTSD, I didn't intend for this to happen.

77
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,030
At the start, I was just thinking

78
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,300
of letting her wake up and know her feelings about me. Do you understand?

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,200
I didn't expect that she would let go of our opportunity to do the surgery.

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,020
Why is she like this?

81
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,820
You're saying that you want to divorce with Meng Hui?

82
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,650
I was wrong.

83
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,080
At the start, I thought

84
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,630
as long as she can be by my side

85
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,660
then she can be blissful.

86
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,430
I didn't think that for me, she would

87
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,160
give up an opportunity to recover the scar.

88
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,390
I really did go overboard.

89
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,960
I am believe the lies that I said.

90
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,440
I even lied to her saying that I forgot what I wanted the most.

91
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,320
At the start, she just wanted to divorce me.

92
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,010
I agree.

93
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,780
When she recovers, she'll then know

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,830
the surgery is the most important.

95
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,440
Are you letting go like that?

96
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,880
It's such a rare opportunity.

97
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,770
Sui An used five years to exchange for this surgery

98
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,760
and she gave up like that.

99
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,430
Divorce and let Meng Hui do the surgery.

100
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,370
That way, perhaps, she can recover

101
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,540
from PTSD.

102
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,400
The bride does her makeup at five o'clock.

103
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,760
- The makeup artist—
- No need. Our Meng Hui knows how to do makeup more than anyone else.

104
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,430
- Okay.
- Yes. That's right.

105
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,160
In that case, we don't need to spend money on a makeup artist. At seven o'clock, we'll decorate the wedding car.

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,270
- I—
- That, our President Shen will provide the car.

107
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,130
Although Ferraris require a lot of fuel, he is willing to spend the extra money.

108
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,000
We're saving the money for the car as well?

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,590
At eight o'clock, the videographer and photographer will arrive at the venue.

110
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,140
They will cover the whole wedding. Afterward–

111
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,390
For the videography, we have a professional team.

112
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,140
President Shen used to do a reality show. He has funds.

113
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,900
Guess we can save money on that as well.

114
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,740
As for the fresh flowers,

115
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,780
it is currently the peak wedding season. If we transport them from nearby cities,

116
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,380
we can only get 25,000 or so. It'll be a bit difficult to get 30,000.

117
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,020
There's no need.

118
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,120
No, President Shen. You've misunderstood me.

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,620
President Shen, what I meant is give me some more time.

120
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,650
Once I think of a method then we'll have it. We'll definitely have it.

121
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,540
There will definitely be a solution.

122
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,720
But there's no bride anymore.

123
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,890
Why?

124
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,060
- The wedding is canceled.
- Canceled?

125
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,020
Director Shen, this...

126
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,960
Director Shen.

127
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,590
The wedding is canceled?

128
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,960
Shen Yi, this is...

129
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,420
You also know my situation.

130
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,390
It's a bit special. The divorce papers will take a bit longer.

131
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,630
Let's live separately first.

132
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,750
I'll move away tonight.

133
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,190
Where are you going?

134
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,380
I'm going to move to Sui An's house. Don't worry,

135
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,250
I will take care of myself.

136
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,120
There won't be anything that happens so you won't have to be worried.

137
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,860
Do you have to be like this?

138
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,210
You already said it very clearly before.

139
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,580
You wanted to divorce me. I did this

140
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,590
just to fulfill your wish.

141
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,880
I know I didn't take good care of you

142
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,720
but I really don't want to leave you.

143
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
But I must leave you.

144
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,050
I can't see the scar on your face anymore.

145
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,360
Only if we completely separate

146
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,480
then we can live better.

147
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,150
Okay, I will let go.

148
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,930
Don't worry, I will also take care of myself.

149
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,780
I already let Wei Lei come to keep you company.

150
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,830
I'll get going then.

151
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,160
Do you want me to send you out?

152
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,710
Wei Lei.

153
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,030
Shen Yi has left.

154
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,900
Men are all bastards. Scars recover but they forever the pain.

155
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,960
Enough, don't cry.

156
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,800
H- He didn't recover.

157
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,750
Shen Yi said that his heart will hurt once he sees me.

158
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,350
Okay.

159
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,470
Who would've expected that

160
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,160
Director Shen just wanted to get married and it ended up like a mess.

161
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,770
I think the road to happiness is strewn with setbacks.

162
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,600
Maybe relationships are like doing business.

163
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,480
The more you give the more you gain.

164
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,860
That might not be the case. Think about it.

165
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,110
Before Director Shen knew Director Meng, he didn't take things seriously.

166
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,310
So you are saying there is a sum you must pay?

167
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,410
Life is like this. If you owe a debt on the East then you have to make up for it on the West.
(T/N: Saying if you owe something, you must pay it elsewhere.)

168
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,850
Perhaps, in the past, Shen Yi was too fussy over other matters and took advantage of it

169
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,960
so he has to suffer more when it comes to the wedding.

170
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,990
So you win and suffer. It makes sense.

171
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,990
Then, can they still be saved? Will Director Shen and Director Meng divorce?

172
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,490
How about we come up with another plan to get them back together?

173
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,380
I don't think there's much hope.

174
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,170
I also feel like it's unnecessary. It's over for them.

175
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,440
That's so sad then.

176
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,360
D- Director Shen?

177
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,990
You scared me. Why are you sleeping there?

178
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,960
Thank you guys. Don't worry about me.

179
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,600
Boss, don't give up.

180
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,980
Just treat it like I'm dead.

181
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,080
He was kicked out of the house.

182
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,440
Is this a divorce by agreement?

183
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,780
I heard that after people get their hearts broken, they will use work to numb themselves.

184
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,230
Will that mean our workload will be...

185
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,680
I heard that someone's personality will have a huge change after they've been heartbroken.

186
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,970
Will he be more strict than before?

187
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,610
But, Boss already changed once.

188
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,160
From petty to outgoing, if he changes again then he'll just go back.

189
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,400
He'll go from being generous to extremely petty again.

190
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
What are you looking at?

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,550
He clearly loved me so much before.

192
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,100
It's actually quite hard for Shen Yi to make his heart feel moved by someone.

193
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,980
During that time, I tried so hard

194
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,270
and he wasn't moved at all.

195
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,190
Maybe I just don't have much persuasiveness.

196
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,530
After all,

197
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,720
I used a lot of efforts on Sui An

198
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,670
and he didn't put me in his heart.

199
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,450
I never took the initiative.

200
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,810
It was always Shen Yi giving me things.

201
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,670
I was thinking that Shen Yi has another reason why he's separating from you.

202
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,290
Don't think nonsense first.

203
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,140
Actually,

204
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,420
Shen Yi is actually a good person.

205
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,000
After so many years, I don't know how many kids he has helped.

206
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,410
Then, you said you cared about the scar on your face,

207
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,350
are you being serious or lying to him?

208
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,390
I also don't know.

209
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,770
But what is important now is that Shen Yi cares.

210
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,850
Promotion strategy?

211
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,450
Then let's...

212
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,000
just lower the prices and offer discounts. All the products that Meng Hui and I developed together,

213
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,370
put all them on discount and all the samples that I prepared for her,

214
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,440
give them out for free.

215
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,730
But if you randomly put products on discount then people will doubt that there's a problem with them.

216
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,350
Can't I decide what to do for my own marriage?

217
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,150
Can't I decide on my own company?

218
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,780
But, you at least need a reasonable explanation.

219
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,940
Just tell them that the boss's wife ran away. The boss doesn't want to do this anymore. A clearance sale.

220
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Boss, we're a high-end skincare and top-selling cosmetics brand. We're not a two dollar store.

221
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,440
Be more clear-minded. You have to raise all of us.

222
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,280
I wonder what they are talking about in there.

223
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,050
She's out.

224
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,860
Right now, I feel like

225
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,540
love is something really scary.

226
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,790
Let's think of another way. It can't just continue like this.

227
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,510
All right. Let's discuss how we can throw our boss back into the fire pit of love.

228
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,680
Okay.

229
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,730
I was thinking the key to this problem...

230
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,370
We can just eat out home. I'm not in the mood even if you invite me out.

231
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,970
I didn't invite you out but them.

232
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,040
They sent me news

233
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,330
saying that they helped you invited someone and you had to meet that person no matter what.

234
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,350
Who?

235
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,900
Do you still remember her?

236
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,020
Xiao Ba, how come it's you?

237
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,300
I have a name. I'm Xia Yan. You're not allowed to call me Xiao Ba anymore.

238
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,470
Come on and talk about it.

239
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,570
Why didn't you do your makeup today?

240
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,300
Don't ask. There's a time difference. You don't need to know.

241
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,980
I'm sorry about what happened before

242
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,470
but I didn't want to do those things. I was Xu Xing Yao who told me to do it.

243
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,620
Xu Xing Yao?

244
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,460
She said she would give me money to go to work at Shen Yi's company

245
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,440
and put a scar sticker on my face.

246
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,420
Shen Yi misunderstood and thought I was you.

247
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,530
He thought that he made the scar on my face so he feels guilty

248
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,030
and wanted to use all methods to make it up to me.

249
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,430
He's so thoughtful and perfect

250
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,840
so without knowing, I treated it like it was real

251
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,380
and ended up liking him.

252
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,900
If there wasn't me then perhaps you guys would've been together long ago.

253
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,860
Because of your scar, he will have no restraints when it comes to you.

254
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,870
It's not like that.

255
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,110
He said something to me once.

256
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,940
I've never told you.

257
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,420
He said he can give everything I want because of this scar

258
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,780
but except for love.

259
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,370
Guilt and love are two different things.

260
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,770
He doesn't want to deceive me or his own heart.

261
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,010
What? You don't believe it? I don't have to come so far

262
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,980
to tell you these lies.

263
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,700
I believe you and also him.

264
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,670
Actually, I thought about this for a long time.

265
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,170
I think I don't really like him.

266
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,080
After some time, I didn't want to think of him.

267
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,340
Guilty and compensation are not everything to me.

268
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,250
I don't have to keep yearning for him.

269
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,980
I just like the feeling of being in love.

270
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,470
Whether it's a handsome guy who has no restraints when he's with me.

271
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,660
I can get everything that I like.

272
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,940
Also, these people...

273
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,050
they told me that you're separating from Shen Yi.

274
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,340
I was surprised when I heard. Are you certain?

275
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,380
If you don't want this a man then perhaps... I might have a chance.

276
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,970
Oh right. This.

277
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,260
I forgot to give it back to him when I left.

278
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,600
Help me give it back to Shen Yi.

279
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,860
Hurry.

280
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,280
Director Meng, we know that there's a small problem with your guys' relationship recently.

281
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,330
It's not easy to make this step so we helped you invited Director Shen.

282
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,700
Meet at your old place at six o'clock. Be there or be square.

283
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,710
You must go.

284
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,130
Is he still willing to meet me now?

285
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,840
Director Shen is just stubborn but he feels so bad inside.

286
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,130
Recently, he can't eat or sleep well.

287
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,380
He's been relying on melatonin to keep going,

288
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,750
and he's been eating bitter melon while reminiscing the past.

289
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,330
If you guys don't get back together, our company is going to become a two dollar store.

290
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,570
Please.

291
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,860
Please. Please.

292
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,760
Boss, 6 o'clock at the Observatory. I'm giving you and Director Meng one last chance.

293
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,830
How come it's you?

294
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,170
That's right. How come it's me?

295
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,530
- Do I changed my shoes?
- No need.

296
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,790
This is for you.

297
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,510
Did you come especially to give me this?

298
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,330
No.

299
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,990
[Love House]

300
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,650
Hello.

301
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,000
Hello, Meng Hui. Shen Yi is drunk.

302
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,170
Okay, I'll bring him over right now.

303
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,240
Come on.

304
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,860
- I can still drink. I can still drink.
- Shen Yi.

305
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,130
It's just being heartbroken.

306
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,610
Who hasn't been heartbroken? It's not a big deal

307
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,080
But this is a divorce.

308
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,870
I don't want to have a divorce.

309
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,340
What are you doing? What are you doing?

310
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,180
I'm not drunk.

311
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,800
Let go of me.

312
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,730
Come on.

313
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:21,310
Meng Hui, can you forgive me?

314
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,200
Go with me to get this surgery.

315
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,930
Okay?

316
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,670
Shen Yi.

317
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,980
Coming!

318
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,990
- Meng Hui.
- Whats wrong?

319
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,960
It's hard to explain.

320
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,430
He's drunk and wanted to sleep on the streets

321
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,050
so I can only bring him back here.

322
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,060
Are you okay?

323
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,540
Shen Yi?

324
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,420
Meng Hui, I have to go to the airport.

325
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,980
I'll have to trouble you with him. I won't bother about it.

326
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,460
Help me carry him to the bed.

327
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,930
Shen Yi!

328
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,590
Let me help you pour a glass of water.

329
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:55,800
- Shen Yi.
- Meng Hui, you clearly know that I can't catch you

330
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,340
and you want to hide inside.

331
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,010
Meng Hui. Meng Hui, come out.

332
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,090
Shen Yi, I'm right here.

333
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,460
You're not. Meng Hui is inside.

334
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,270
Meng Hui thinks I don't love her

335
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,000
and think I only feel guilty towards her

336
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,260
so she's hiding.

337
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,790
I'm not hiding inside.

338
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,010
I know you don't felt guilty towards me.

339
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,890
No, you don't know.

340
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,270
You told me to prove that I love you.

341
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,070
But how I do prove it?

342
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,360
Switch it around. You said, you love me

343
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,910
and I trusted you.

344
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,580
I don't want to trust that you don't love me.

345
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,730
I-I love you.

346
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,470
Then, prove it to me.

347
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,120
Just right here. Prove it to me

348
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,770
that you love me.

349
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,540
You teach me. How do you prove you love me?

350
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,370
Once I learn,

351
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,800
I will prove to you, okay?

352
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,190
Say,

353
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,810
the two of us

354
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,760
started from the scar

355
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,180
but I love you.

356
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,560
It wasn't making it up to you.

357
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,700
Do you think that I wanted to fall in love with you?

358
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,410
I can't control myself.

359
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,480
I didn't want to.

360
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,670
I wanted you to heal your scar

361
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:14,770
that way I won't owe you and it's even with us. How great is that?

362
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,600
But you didn't go do it. You didn't even go the second time either.

363
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:26,030
Now, until now I still owe you.

364
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,690
What is unlucky

365
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,090
is that I still fell in love with you.

366
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,350
Say, did you do it on purpose?

367
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,550
You purposely made me pay attention to you.

368
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,980
But now you're denying it, right?

369
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,110
Enough, enough.

370
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,870
How much didn't you drink?

371
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,590
One can beer.

372
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,890
One can beer and you're this drink?

373
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,800
One bottle of red wine.

374
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,660
One bottle of white wine.

375
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,380
That's not right.

376
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,580
Half of bottle of white wine.

377
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,780
Shen Yi,

378
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,610
do you believe that you will definitely regret when you  wake up tomorrow?

379
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,570
What's wrong with you?

380
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,910
Who bullied you?

381
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,470
I'll go beat them up!

382
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,190
Don't.

383
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,150
Don't.

384
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:03,350
Meng Hui, let me ask you one more time.

385
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,220
Do you love me?

386
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,920
As long as you say it then I'll believe you.

387
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,940
I love you.

388
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,650
Do I feel guilty towards you?

389
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,840
- No.
- Is it the scar that I love?

390
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,150
Shen Yi.

391
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,990
Shen Yi, what's wrong? Shen Yi, don't scare me.

392
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,530
Shen Yi.

393
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,880
Shen Yi, don't scare me.

394
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,540
Shen Yi.

395
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,390
Meng Hui.

396
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,410
Shen Yi.

397
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,430
Y-You guys, why are you looking at me like that?

398
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,790
Meng Hui did I get drunk and argue?

399
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,840
It's fine. I already thought it through.

400
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,700
Since you want me to go do the surgery then I'll go.

401
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,480
T- Then, you're fine with leaving me?

402
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,680
You'll go to England with me.

403
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,550
Then, what about my company?

404
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,650
There's Jiang Jiang, Xiao Mei, Da Shu, and all them at the company.

405
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,110
Then, are we still going to divorce?

406
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,950
No, we're not divorcing.

407
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,520
Then,

408
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,110
can my PTSD be cured?

409
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,760
You have to see what you want the most.

410
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,080
Perhaps, what we think you want

411
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,180
is not what you truly want.

412
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,700
Only the person themselves will truly know what they want then that will do.

413
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,220
You're getting closer now.

414
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,770
Sui An,

415
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,560
we've been brothers for so many years.

416
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,890
You know my personality

417
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,340
so don't hide it from me.

418
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,950
Did I get an illness so everyone is...

419
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,490
Don't worry, I know I've experienced a lot recently.

420
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,430
I have the ability to handle it.

421
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,560
Just tell me.

422
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,730
Acute alcohol poisoning?

423
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,650
This is the second time I'm delaying my flight.

424
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,270
Meng Hui, called me in the middle of the night saying that you fainted.

425
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,530
If you can't drink then drink less.

426
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,100
It's in the middle of the night and everyone is here to sleep with you. You're amazing.

427
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,400
You were the one who brought him along to drink.

428
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,930
I couldn't stop him.

429
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,630
Oh right Jiang Jiang.

430
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,910
- The wedding can be held again.
- Good.

431
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,530
I'll contact the wedding company right now.

432
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,600
Hello, this is the wedding company. Who is this?

433
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,240
Hello, I'm LS Company's Jiang Jiang.

434
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,370
I have some goods news over here that I want to tell you.

435
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,140
Our Director Shen's wedding can be held as planned.

436
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,490
I want to ask if you have time to come to the company

437
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,370
to reconfirm the wedding's order of events?

438
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,970
That's right, then—

439
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,280
- Do it again.
- He hung up. Call again.

440
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,930
Okay, I'll call again.

441
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,300
Hello, the person is not by the phone, I'm a voicemail.

442
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,820
This is a wedding planner who has changed careers. If you would like me to resume my previous job,

443
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,480
please pay in full beforehand.

444
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,850
If it's full payment then do it.

445
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,470
Director Shen.

446
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,550
I heard you two have gotten back together.

447
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,100
Congratulations!

448
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,410
- Okay, we'll meet at the company then.
- Okay.

449
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,200
Sui An!

450
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,030
Why did you come out?

451
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,450
You're not going to keep Meng Hui company some more?

452
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,810
When are you leaving?

453
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,800
Are you really leaving?

454
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,310
When is the flight?

455
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,640
The flight has already been delayed.

456
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,260
Since Shen Yi and Meng Hui have made up,

457
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,910
then I'll tell them over in England.

458
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,510
I'll leave after they get married.

459
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,930
Don't you have anything to tell me?

460
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,750
I'm sorry.

461
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,390
So beautiful.

462
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,490
Meng Hui looks so beautiful in the wedding dress. I also want to wear it.

463
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:06,390
Meng Hui, I made a big sacrifice for you.

464
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,540
Its been so many years. Who has seen me without makeup?

465
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,090
In order to be your bridesmaid, I'm giving it my all.

466
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,350
Miss Wei Lei said that in order to contrast Meng Hui, she won't be wearing makeup today.

467
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,530
Do I look good?

468
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,650
I think...

469
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,350
You call this not wearing makeup?

470
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,210
It's semi-permanent makeup.

471
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,550
Director Shen, Doctor Sui.

472
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,800
- Hello.
- Of course, I have a red envelope. Director Shen.

473
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,740
You're here.

474
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,220
Come on. Come and sign in.

475
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,190
- Come on.
- Let's take a photo.

476
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,540
Come on. It's not appropriate for me to stand in the center, right?

477
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,030
Okay, come on. Hurry up.

478
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,490
Okay.

479
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,470
Okay.

480
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,590
- I'll show you around.
- Okay.

481
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,700
Take a look around.

482
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,620
It's so beautiful.

483
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,470
Director Xu!

484
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,490
Why did you come today?

485
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,170
I've been Shen Yi's coworker for so many years.

486
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,270
Coming here to drink some wine isn't going overboard, is it?

487
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,040
Why did you bring her here?

488
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,130
You guys are so inefficient.

489
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,280
Yes, yes.

490
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,250
Can I not enter?

491
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:38,040

492
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,890
We gave up the most valuable thing for each other.

493
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,810
Only the person we love can receive the gift we gave.

494
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,950
♫  Unable to escape, unable to retreat  ♫

495
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:56,960
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

496
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,950
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

497
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,980
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

498
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,160
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

499
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:21,060
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

500
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:28,320
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

501
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:37,110
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

502
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,980
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

503
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:52,420
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

504
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:57,290
♫  Leading me  ♫

505
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:02,670
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

506
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:10,230
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫
