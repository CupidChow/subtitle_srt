Is soup done and dishes are cooked?

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Not yet.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
This is not efficient enough.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
It takes time  to get the flavor for the soup.

35

If you start now, it's too late.

You take care of food supplies.

He likes having face and would not like that high profile.

I just only want to see a few old good friends.

What time is it?  He's still not arrived yet?

57

No need to, Auntie, I have a matter to discuss with him.

Everyone here is practically family.

70

Whatever you have to say, just say it directly.

71

- Uncles, hello.
- Hello.

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,200
This son of mine never even comes home.

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,100
Now that he's in trouble, he knows to come home to find his dad.

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,400
I want you to lend me ¥50,000. I'll pay you back within half a year.

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,700
This is the loan agreement. It even includes interest.

76
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,200
What, you're treating me as a bank now?

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,600
The interest I'm paying you is 10% higher than that of any bridge loans available on the market right now.

78
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
It really is like father, like son.

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,500
You're my son.

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,400
Won't all this money be yours in the future anyway?

81
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
About your transfer from one account to another,

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,200
this isn't profitable for me.

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
Fine.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,100
If you don't think the interest is enough,

85
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,400
then give me your terms. How should I repay you?

86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,000

No need for repayment.

89
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
Shen Yi.

90
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
No matter what business you do, you earn money.

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,200
Except for your cosmetics, you've been incurring losses since the beginning.

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,200
You might as well come back and do some legitimate business with me.

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,600
That's right, Shen Yi. The group has so many businesses that need your help.

94
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,340
I think what I'm doing now is pretty good.

95
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,380
What do you mean pretty good?

96
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,200
What is your business' current turnover right now?

97
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
How about your profits?

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
That small business of yours,

99
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,400
your annual turnover can't even beat

100

the quarterly turnover of two of my subsidiary companies.

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,400
I work so hard in order to have a right to speak.

102

Although my business is small, I didn't use a single cent–

103
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
What right to speak do you have?

104
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,400
I just want to escape from your control!

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I don't need anyone controlling my life!

106
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm controlling you?

107
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
Your mom controlled you for so many years.

108
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,800
You're not blaming her, yet you're blaming me for controlling you?

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Qian Shan, don't get to worked up.

110
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,300
Since you're unwilling to lend me the money, I'll get going.

111
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,200
You're not allowed to leave!

112
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,800
If you dare walk out this door, then don't ever come back!

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,700
It's not easy getting your son to come home. Don't kick him out.

114
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,000
Who said I was the one who kicked him out?

115
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
There are no overnight grudges between father and son.

116
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Tha's right.  Every family has its own problem.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,400
Alright, that's enough! I don't need your pity.

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,700
I know all of you came here today to see me make a fool of myself.

119
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,300
What do you mean? We all came because you called us here to watch your son make a fool of himself.

120
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Boss, this is the contract to take make the investment.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,600
This is the termination of investment agreement.

122
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Boss, don't worry.

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
Once we find that French lab's

124
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,000
buyer, then perhaps, we can turn this situation around.

125
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
B- Boss.

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Just then, one of the suppliers said

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,300
we have to settle the accounts by the end of this week, otherwise, they'll sue us. Also—

128
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,400
Calm down, explain it slowly. What's wrong?

129
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,800
They also... already announced they have terminated their collaboration with us.

130
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,600
This group of people is too evil. They hit us when we are down.

131
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,300
Boss, this is a breach of contract. You can't sign this.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
I'll sign.

133
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,870
I'll sign anything today.

134

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,800

What's the situation right now?

138
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,400
Director Wang has also withdrawn his investment from LS.

139
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Director Sun has terminated collaborating with them.

140
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,600
These bastards. They bend and take advantage of the situation.

141
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,400
They totally don't understand what's known as bullying the young and poor.

142
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,300
These investors really are something.

143
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,400
They didn't even try to figure out the situation before withdrawing their funds.

144
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
They should consider a person's request for help and forgive too.

145
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,700
How could they make things difficult for Shen Yi like that? Here.

146
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Who else is still investing?

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Ask them to withdraw as well.

148
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
We're going to interfere?

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,400
Since half of the investors are already gone, they might as well all withdraw.

150
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

151
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,400
Qian Shan, why do you have to treat him like that?

152
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
I know you want him to come back.

153
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Why can't you just tell him directly?

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,200
By doing this, aren't you making him more lonely and

155
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,900
push him further away.

156
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,800
If I don't do this, how could he come home?

157
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,600
There are many ways to get him to come back.

158
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,900
Why must you go through all this trouble?

159
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Look at the kids in daycare who play in the mud.

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,600
At first, they're all playing very enthusiastically.

161
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
They even forget to go home for dinner.

162
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,800
After their friends leave one by one,

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,200
by then, I won't even need to call him home.

164
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,400
He will come back himself.

165
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,000
How old is Shen Yi?

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Do you think he's playing in the mud right now?

167
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Considering the scale of his company right now,

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,400
in my eyes, it's just a daycare.

169
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,600
The methods he uses to do business are no different from kids playing in mud.

170
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm the one who brewed the tea. If you want to drink it, brew it yourself.

171
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,600
When will he come?

172
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
He's here.

173
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
He's here.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Director Shen, I heard all the investors have withdrawn.

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
How's the financial situation right now? Can you tell us?

176
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,300
Has your funding been cut off? Please tell us.

177
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,200
Our current financial situation is fine.

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,800
The new foundation will also go on market as planned. Please do not worry.

179
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Director Shen, will you be using the profits from this foundation

180
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,800
to alleviate the company's financial burdens. Do you have confidence?

181
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Can you please answer?

182
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Director Shen, please give us an answer.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
Is the company going bankrupt?

184
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
Boss, Boss!

185
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Director Meng says she's going to livestream herself taking off– She's going to livestream putting on makeup!

186
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Wait!

187
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Move out of the way!

188
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
Director Shen, please sit.

189
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,100
Sorry.

190
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,600
It's time, she's starting.

191
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Hello, everyone.

192
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,400
Today, I'm going to review LS's liquid foundation.

193
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm going to be reviewing its coverage.

194
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,160
[Online comments]

195
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Oh my god, how does she have such a huge scar?

196
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,300
The filter is broken. I feel so bad for my goddess.

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
This Bai Rimeng

198
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,100
looks alot like Director Meng from the press conference that day.

199
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,600
When I was young, someone slashed my face. That's why I have a scar on my face.

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,000
But most people probably don't know about it because I normally use foundation to cover it up.

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,600
So that's why I think I have a right to speak about the coverage of any foundation.

202
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,700
My scar is quite deep, so normally,

203
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,400
I'll use concealer first.

204
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
I normally will use these colors.

205
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Red, green, yellow, and ivory.

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,700
Then, I'd use my own mix of foundations to even out my skin tone.

207
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,800
But normally, after two hours, I have to do a touch-up.

208
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
But LS's foundation

209
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,400
has skin-adhering ingredients.

210
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,800
That's why it lasts longer than most foundations.

211
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
It's also very moisturizing,

212
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
so it won't settle into dry patches or get cakey.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Most importantly, it can even out your skin tone.

214
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
It really cuts down the number of steps I have to do.

215
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
Next, I'll demonstrate it on my face.

216
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,390
All right, this is the final result after covering it up.

217
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Director Meng is currently a popular influencer with hundreds of thousands of followers.

218
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,200
A casual ad like this and so many people are watching.

219
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
The video has hit the charts.

220
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
Its ranking is still going up.

221
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,600
A lot of people are saying they've been sold on LS's foundation.

222
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm going to be a promoter and support Director Meng.

223
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
I'll go write a PR announcement.

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm going to go contact the media.

225
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
What is this even meant to achieve?

226
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,400
This is such a sensitive time.

227
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,100
What if she turns the public opinion against us again?

228
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Director Xu, didn't you originally say you were going to contact the French lab to save this desperate situation?

229
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,200
But right now, the person saving us is Director Meng.

230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,800
- That's right!
- Yeah!

231
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
What did you say?

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What I want to tell everyone today is that

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,200
LS's foundation is, indeed, able to cover up scars.

234
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,800
Truthfully, as long as you have the skills,

235
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,600
any foundation can cover up scars.

236
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
But LS won't use this fact to promote their product,

237
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,200
because our philosophy towards cosmetics has changed recently.

238
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,400
From covering up scars to smoothing them out.

239
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
That's why we started on a new project,

240
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,000
to develop a serum that can fade scars.

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,400
I believe that there are many others like me on this planet.

242
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,200
In our search for perfection, the premise is that we admit our imperfections.

243
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,000
LS wants to help everyone get one step closer to perfection.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
I didn't think she'd use this kind of method...

245
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,600
All right, that's all for today. Thank you, everyone.

246
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,000
Boss, Boss! Director Zhang that makes eyeshadows,

247
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,600
he called and said he'll invest in our company!

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Should we make an appointment to meet some day?

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,800
He said any time is fine. As long as we secure this collaboration,

250
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
we can overcome this.

251
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,600
We can overcome this!

252
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
As for that wretched patent,

253
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,800
whoever wants it can take it, right?

254
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Right!

255
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,400
Boss, Director Meng's video has been shared over 200,000 times.

256
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
There are over 100,000 comments, mostly positive.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,400
Everyone's sold on this foundation.

258
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,000
They're asking us when it's coming out. It's pretty amazing.

259
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,700
So what you're saying is that a lot of people have seen the scar on her face?

260
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,800
The media is brewing the gossips fiercely.

261
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,200
Everyone's recommending and promoting the liquid foundation simultaneously.

262
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,900
There are people linking it with you two together.

263
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,200
But don't worry, Xiao Mei is working on a public statement.

264
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,300
We will control and minimize the damage this has on Director Meng.

265
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,400
Turn around.

266
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
- To where?
- Ah Tao's house.

267
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Ah Tao said she's not at home.

268
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,400
Sorry,

269
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I regret to inform you we're temporarily suspending our collaboration.

270
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,800
From this today forward, the collaboration between our company and Bai Rimeng has officially been terminated.

271
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,000
All the previously signed contracts and agreements

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,160
have all been nullified.

273
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,800
Meng Hui, are you there? Why aren't you picking up my calls?

This scar is terrifying.

283
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
What kind of grudge deserved a slash to the face?

284
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
She probably was someone's mistress.

287
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
What's her problem?

288
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Wasn't she also the one who said that kind of foundation can't be made?

289
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
If Shen Yi is wrong, is she not allowed to call him out?

290
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,600
Regarding cosmetics, Meng Hui is obviously more professional than Shen Yi.

291
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,200
She even had a scandal with Shen Yi before.

292
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,400
Now that she has this scar, Shen Yi is definitely not going to want her.

293
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
If you don't understand the situation, don't make things up.

294
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Shen Yi is already regretting it to death right now.

295
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,200
He wasn't able to always be by her side.

296
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Who are you? What's your problem?

297
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
For this ugly chick, you're coming after me?

298
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,000
This is probably Meng Hui's other account. Stop leeching off of Shen Yi's popularity, okay?

299
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,400
Give up already. Shen Yi is Shen Qian Shan's son.

300
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,700
Qian Shan Group will not want a daughter-in-law like you.

301
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,000
Took away our Shen Yi.

302
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000

Hello?

Hello, are you Bai Rimeng?

307
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to ask you how much you charge for advertisements.

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,200
How much do you charge for writing a short post? Let's collaborate.

309
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,700
Sharing a post works too. I'll send you the money immediately. Hello? Hello?

Damn, turns out Shen Yi made another account.

311
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
What kind of magical love story is this?

312
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
The overbearing CEO is going online to protect his wife. Is there a need to be so vulgar?

313
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
Is she a Mary Sue?
(T/N: Fictional novel about a rich girl with her enviable and unrealistic life)

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Bai Rimeng is a goddess after all. I'm so envious of her.

315
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,800
He can find another girl instead of her.

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
Why are you here?

317
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,500
You finally came.

318
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,400
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

319
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,000
I ruined everything.

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,400
It's because of me that LS ran into so many problems.

321
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,100
No, it's all my fault.

322
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,400
I shouldn't have left you alone.

323
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,700
Otherwise you wouldn't have ran into all the problems.

324
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,300
From now on, if you feel sad

325
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,000
don't come alone to watch the stars.

326
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,300
Let me be with you.

327
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,300
I hope my livestream can help LS.

328
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,300
You didn't have to do it.

329
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,200
I barged into your life

330
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
and you led me from one dream to another.

331
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,500
I am grateful towards you.

332
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,200
But now I know

333
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,700
there is another girl in your life who is more important.

334
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,500
To me, I am not the most important person.

335
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,000
No.

336
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,800
From now on, you are the most important person.

337
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,150
Shen Yi, I see things clearly now.

338
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,700
We are not compatible for each other.

339
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,000
I agree with what you said before. Let's break up.

340
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,800
I don't want to break up with you.

341
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,430
♫  Turn, turn it around  ♫

342
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,000

♫  How could you deny me that  ♫

359
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,000
So you forgave him?

360
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
He left you alone at the press conference because he was going after another woman,

361
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,500
yet you forgive him.

362
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,400
He didn't mean to. There was a good reason.

363
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,400
He told me he will never leave me by myself again.

364
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,800
How could you be so gullible?

365
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,400
What do you know? This is love!

366
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
I should not have kept him from you.

367
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I am never going to involve myself in situations

368
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,100
where no one would thank me. I don't want to feel embarrassed when I see Shen Yi.

369
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,500
You are the obstacle in the path of the hero and heroine.

370
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,900
The more you interfere, the more they love each other.

371
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
Are you Bai Rimeng? I've been following you for a while.

372
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,200
I really like your cosmetics review. Can I have your autograph?

373
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,700
Sure.

374
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,380
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

375
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,830
How come you are more well-known than me now?

376
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,060
Popular opinion and trends really change quickly.

377
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,740
It's normal. One day you are popular, the next day you are reviled.

378
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,820
Some people will like you, others will hate you.

379
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,400
If there are people criticizing you, there will be others who will come out to defend justice.

380
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,590
On the third day, a new point of interest will take over.

381
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,590
People will forget the whole incident.

382
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,860
They will only remember two things.

383
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,900
One, the liquid foundation works well.

384
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,930
Two, Shen Yi loves you a lot.

385
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,290
The people who are against you envy you.

386
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,770
It's because they are not loved by Shen Yi.

387
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,200
Okay, since you have an expert on love here,

388
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,850
you won't need me anymore as the psychology expert.

389
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,840
I need to go to a school reunion where I will be drinking.

390
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,700
Take my car and drive Meng Hui home.

391
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,070
Watch over her. Make sure she eats.

392
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,820
You are too protective over her.

393
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,470
I'm leaving.

394
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,330
Protective urge.

395
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,090
Protective urge is the desire to protect someone

396
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,470
so that he or she will not get hurt.

397
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,980
If you see her get hurt, you will become furious.

398
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,630
You can't help but want to stand up for her.

399
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,960
Protective urge.

400
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,450
Director Shen, do you want coffee? I'll get it for you.

401
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,100
You don't need to. I'll get it myself. Just do your work.

402
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,620
It's what I usually do.

403
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,120
There's nothing much to do these days.

404
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,980
My boss doesn't need me.

405
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,850
Are you busy? Let's have dinner tonight.

406
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,590
I have to attend a class reunion tonight.

407
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,070
Coincidentally, it's at the same restaurant where you met with your old classmates last time.

408
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,180
Let's see each other another day.

409
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,520
When you were young, did a lot of people think you were a boy?

410
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,960
Yes.

411
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,200
Her class reunion

412
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,480
probably won't go any better than mine.

413
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,570
Come in.

414
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,800
Boss, is there anything else you need me to do today?

415
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,280
There shouldn't be anything else. I'm going to see Sui An soon. You can go home.

416
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,260
May I borrow your car?

417
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,820
Sure. The car key is inside the pocket of the blue suit.

418
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,020
Boss, can I borrow this suit too?

419
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,740
Thanks, Boss.

420
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,660
Sir, do you want flowers?

421
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,130
Yes, give me the most beautiful bouquet.

422
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,310
- Is it a gift for a girl?
- Yes.

423
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,850
Is there anything special you want?

424
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,620
I want flowers that will put the spotlight on her.

425
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,050
Why are you here?

426
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,490
- Where are your classmates?
- They are not coming out yet.

427
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,940
Let's wait then.

428
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,650
Why? What are we waiting for?

429
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,360
Honey, these flowers are for you.

430
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,320
Why are you leaving so quickly?

431
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,390
Do you feel bored being with us?

432
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,050
We haven't taken our pictures yet.

433
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,970
Me as well!

434
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,780
Who is he?

435
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,900
Well...

436
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,360
You have a boyfriend? How come you didn't tell me?

437
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,130
You were my Prince Charming.

438
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,810
I don't want you to get married.

439
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,530
She is not your personal Prince Charming!

440
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,640
She belongs to us!

441
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,940
Let me see. These flowers are so pretty.

442
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,180
If you steal Ah Tao from us, you'll have to take care of her for life.

443
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,160
Oh no, you are mistaken.

444
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,630
All right, behave yourselves.

445
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,320
Where's the car? Let's go.

446
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,490
We're leaving. Bye.

447
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,150
Bye, Ah Tao.

448
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,800
Ah Tao is so cool.

449
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,620
Aren't we similar?

450
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,890
Didn't you say everyone treated you like a boy back then?

451
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,620
Yes, we are alike.

452
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,010
Then shouldn't you also

453
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:38,080
be discriminated against, be laughed at, be bullied?

454
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,940
Who told you I was bullied?

455
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,610
I was very popular at school.

456
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,380
Is that why you wore a suit today

457
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,200
and drove the car here and bought me flowers?

458
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,030
You wanted to help me out?

459
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,500
Stop talking. I feel so embarrassed.

460
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,330
Why are you so cute?

461
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,880
You even wore cologne.

462
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,170
- I-I didn't.
- You did.

463
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,640
Nope.

464
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,490
Older Sister, take a look. I heard you went home. Use these.

465
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,380
Also, look at what else I bought. Isn't it very sophisticated?

466
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,890
You spent ¥5,000 on that?

467
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,390
I can finally go on vacation next week!

468
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,400
A trip to Bali for two,

469
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,230
with plane ticket, hotel and spa all included, I want it too!

470
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,520
Who told you not to make requests?

471
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,860
If there's a request, there's a budget. Right?

472
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,100
- Come here, quick!
- What's that?

473
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,950
Director Shen has gifts for us.

474
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,820
It looks like we were very successful in changing him.

475
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,260
Where's mine?

476
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,230
- What did you get?
- This packaging is really nice.

477
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,860
- Thank you.
- What's this?

478
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,410
It's my turn.

479
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,590
Hair growth tonic?

480
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,680
Is he criticizing my lack of hair?

481
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,590
You indeed don't have much.

482
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,080
Why did Director Shen give me two movie tickets for couples?

483
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,820
Movie tickets aren't bad. They're at least better than hair growth tonic.

484
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,140
But I'm single.

485
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,230
I'm not single. I'll take my wife.

486
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,050
Give it to me, Xiao Mei.

487
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,760
Looks like we still need to give Director Shen a few more years to change.

488
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,310
What are you doing?

489
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,530
I'm displaying the lipsticks.

490
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,500
Why do you need to display them?

491
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,320
Because these are for you.

492
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,040
Why do you need to give me lipsticks?

493
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,920
Maybe because the flavor of these ones are pretty good.

494
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,810
[The End]

495
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,800
We finished it.

496
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
Do you want to watch something else?

497
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,590
Let's not. I have to go soon.

498
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,970
How about you don't go home today?

499
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,340
That's not appropriate.

500
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,890
What's wrong?

501
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,250
Did we live together before?

502
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,700
When I wasn't completely aware?

503
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,200
Did I force you?

504
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,580
No, we never lived together.

505
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,900
The path of our lives was just very similar,

506
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,800
the places we went to temporarily coincided and our daily travels were pretty much the same.

507
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,930
- Drink some water first.
- Thanks.

508
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,260
In the future, could you stop saying "thank you" all the time?

509
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,910
You're welcome.

510
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,790
Sorry, this is my first time dating someone.

511
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,230
Stop saying "sorry" as well.

512
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,880
I also have no experience.

513
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,760
So in the future, if I do something wrong,

514
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,940
please help me out.

515
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,740
Congratulations, you finally found the one.

516
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,130
Thanks brother, I wish you luck as well.

517
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,340
Are you able to confirm your feelings now?

518
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,230
Are your feelings towards Meng Hui guilt or do you actually like her?

519
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,480
The girl's face that you hurt when you were young, you were able to miss her for ten years or more.

520
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,090
Are you sure it isn't because you triggered Meng Hui's PTSD

521
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,370
and want to take responsibility for her?

522
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,650
Before, I couldn't say for sure,

523
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,740
but now, I know very clearly.

524
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,720
In the future, if the other girl appears, what will you do?

525
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,420
I will apologize to her.

526
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,130
Whatever she wants I'll give her.

527
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,330
But I know in my heart,

528
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,220
that the one I like is Meng Hui.

529
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,570
That's good.

530
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,930
Meng Hui is still waiting for me. I'm going to get going first.

531
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,740
Go home.

532
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,400
I'm taking this.

533
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,790
[2nd Year, Class Four, Teacher An Yusheng]

534
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Come in.

535
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,890
Miss Wei Lei.

536
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,250
Dr. Sui, do you still remember our agreement from before?

537
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,370
You have to do the injection for me.

538
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,960
Sorry, I'm busy tonight. Let's do it another day.

539
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,940
How could you change something we already agreed on?

540
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,070
The injection won't take up much of your time.

541
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,740
Then let me get another doctor for you.

542
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,590
I wholeheartedly reject.

543
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,740
Who could be as attentive as you?

544
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,460
Miss Wei Lei, don't worry. All our doctors here are very professional.

545
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,810
All our doctors are licensed.

546
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,430
Are you okay?

547
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,600
Do you think I'm okay?

548
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,200
Where did you injure yourself?

549
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,060
My foot hurts.

550
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,720
Your skirt.

551
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,370
Does it hurt?

552
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,320
Yes.

553
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,590
How about like this?

554
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,070
Your ankle is fine,

555
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,230
but you scraped your heel.

556
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,110
I have some alcohol. Let me take of it for you.

557
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,940
Let me look at your other foot too, okay?

558
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,470
You shouldn't wear these shoes anymore.

559
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,200
Do you hear me?

560
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,670
Is there something else you need?

561
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:03,240
Dr. Sui, my appetite hasn't been well,

562
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,030
and I haven't been able to sleep well lately.

563
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm really scared.

564
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,270
I'm not a psychologist. If you're having trouble sleeping, you should go find Ah Tao.

565
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,070
I've had my nose fixed several times.

566
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,760
Although it looks fine,

567
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,620
I feel like it's become very fragile.

568
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,290
When I sleep, I'm scared to put pressure on it,

569
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:37,370
worried that it'll deform. When I eat, I'm afraid to open my mouth too wide,

570
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,370
because I'm also worried that it'll deform.

571
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,350
I can't even laugh like I used to.

572
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,660
I'm not scared that people will find out I did plastic surgery.

573
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,280
It's just whenever I think of people

574
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,510
looking at my deformed nose,

575
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,690
I can't even look at them directly in their eyes.

576
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,780
Let me take a look.

577
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,070
Don't worry, your nose is fine.

578
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,760
Really?

579
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,400
It's normal to have these worries during the recovery period.

580
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,210
If you're afraid, don't look in the mirror these next few days.

581
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,790
You have me. Don't worry.

582
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:48,250
Then... will you reply to my WeChat messages 24/7?

583
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,010
If I know you'll be there for me, I will feel much more at ease.

584
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,110
I won't overthink.

585
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,710
- Director Shen.
- It's fine, no need to be so formal.

586
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,240
Director Shen, shall we start?

587
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,230
Let's discuss the progress of our new blush.

588
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,570
Okay.

589
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,460
According to our market research and experiments with the formulation,

590
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,430
we decided

591
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,200
on this mousse blush

592
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,700
as our newest flagship product for this season.

593
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,090
This new product is very suitable for Asian women‘s skin.

594
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:52,160
It contains all-natural floral extracts with fine pearlescent powder.

595
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,460
In addition to being a makeup product, it also has skincare benefits–

596
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,960
Don't move.

597
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,960
What's wrong, Director Shen?

598
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,430
- How long has it been?
- I worked on this proposal for a whole four months.

599
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,880
I'm asking you how long have you been married.

600
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,080
I've been married for almost five years.

601
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,040
Then when your wife chooses a blush,

602
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,530
would she choose powder, oil, or cream-based?

603
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,570
I- I...

604
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,340
She...

605
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,940
Look at you. You don't know your wife well enough,

606
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:34,250
unlike Meng Hui and I. We're always together so we know each other well.

607
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,800
He has an ulterior motive.

608
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,820
He's not even talking about blush. He just wants to show-off.

609
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,760
You guys in the marketing department must really understand women, right?

610
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,300
- Your girlfriend—
- She likes rose red, doesn't eat fatty meats, hates lace,

611
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,570
only drinks Americano, only gets solid-color manicures,

612
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,330
allergic to seafood, only eats egg whites, not the yolk, likes cats, hates dogs,

613
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,700
really hates guinea pigs, sleeps on her right side, her favorite fruit is guava.

614
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,650
I did all my research before I pursued her.

615
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,070
Is this comprehensive enough?

616
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:09,340
How could you be so mechanical about getting to know someone? It feels like you're treating her as a client.

617
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,340
Did you guys even go through the process of getting to know each other?

618
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,900
That's unlike me. I quite enjoy

619
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,560
the process of getting to know my girlfriend.

620
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,970
- Xiao Mei.
- I'm single.

621
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,110
You'll have problems if you go too long without dating.

622
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,470
Stop playing around and appreciate fate.

623
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,770
Otherwise, you'll lose your chance.

624
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,690
Just like Meng Hui and I. We wished we could've met sooner.

625
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,370
I need to go. I'm moving this afternoon.

626
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,150
I'm leaving first.

627
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,140
What are you doing?

628
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,410
Nothing much. What are you doing? Are you having dinner?

629
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,380
Yeah, let me show you.

630
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,750
Okay.

631
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,270
Look at what I ordered today.

632
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,620
Wow, it looks very delicious.

633
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,540
- Have you ate yet?
- Not yet.

634
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,730
Let me order for you.

635
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,990
No need. I'm going downstairs to eat later.

636
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,510
Okay.

637
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,140
Xing Yao, why are you here?

00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:02,350
Different shades of lipsticks deal with different troubles.

640
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,860
It was understated bean paste red yesterday.

641
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,850
Today, it's strong intense red.

642
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,040
Tomorrow, it's bright and refreshing red.

643
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,530
♫  Unable to retreat  ♫

644
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,740
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

645
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:23,610
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

646
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:28,450
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

647
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,750
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

648
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:42,240
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

649
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,930
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

650
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:57,810
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

651
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:02,600
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

652
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:12,840
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

653
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,940
♫  Leading me  ♫

654
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:23,370
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

655
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:31,520
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

656
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:40,020
