[Episode 10: Makeup brushes with different purposes]

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Director Meng.

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,800
You look so stylish even in your work clothes.

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,100
Have a seat.

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,400
How do you keep such a good figure?

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,900
You are probably one of those people who never gain weight no matter what you eat?

26
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,600
You shouldn't eat so little even if you are on a diet. It's bad for your body.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
No, I can't eat that.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,800
This is a diet assigned by Director Xu.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,800
It is not weight loss. It's self-management.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,000
A successful woman stays away from meat,

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,700
fats and sugar.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,100
You shouldn't eat so much meat.

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,000
It's important for men to watch over their bodies,

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,300
especially in middle age.

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,000
You don't look so well, successful woman.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
That's because I haven't exercised yet.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,900
You're eating so little and you're even exercising?

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,600
Are you using love to produce energy?

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
You don't know.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,700
If I continue to gain weight, Director Xu will yell at me.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,200
She said that a successful woman will plan her whole week

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,800
from day 1 to day 7 in detail.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,200
But for me,

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,600
I haven't even written down what I should do for the first day.

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Why don't you want to be like me?

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
You think I am not successful enough?

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,000
You only tell me to be myself!

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,100
It is good to just be yourself.

49
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,000
Go ahead, eat.

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
Okay.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,000
Eat more vegetables.

52
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,400
Director Shen.

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,000
Director Shen.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Are you done eating?

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
I got too much.

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Clean up the plates.

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
It's more important to run for my life.

58
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,800
Are you giving up on self-management?

59
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,200
The price of becoming a successful woman is too high

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,700
for me to pay.

61
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,200
That's true.

62
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,600
It's difficult to copy another person's success.

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
But I heard that induced vomiting, in the long term,

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,900
will make your face bigger.

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Who?

66
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Who's making themselves vomit?

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,200
No one. I just want to remind those who are making themselves vomit to take care of their bodies.

68
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,800
If you signed up for a gym membership then go exercise.

69
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Who is talking that didn't exercise?

70
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Me! Me.

71
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,200
I bought a gym membership card so I can put it in my purse to ward off evil spirits.

72
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
If you are such a slick talker, you should use it to focus on your work.

73
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't hang around with Meng Hui all day.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You just wasting your time.

75
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,600
If Director Meng does nothing but waste time,

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,000
how come the idlest person in the company

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
- seems to be you?
- You!

78
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Actually, teamwork is like a set of makeup brushes.

79
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,200
Even the best makeup artist cannot do her job

80
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
with only one brush.

81
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,800
We all have our strong points.

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
We can find the positions that suit us best.

83
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Yes, yes, yes.

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,400
But there's a difference between brushes that you use regularly and ones that are rarely used.

85
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Director Meng and Director Shen are like an eyeshadow brush.

86
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
It's used until the hairs are frayed.

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
But some people are like a lip brush.

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
It won't be used once in 800 years.

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Shen Yi.

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,200
I have too much lotion on my hand.

91
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,000
Put it on your leg.

92
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Lately, Meng Hui took over Shen Yi's job,

93
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,800
and Shen Yi took over my job.

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
I am left with nothing to do.

95
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Are you sure Shen Yi is not trying to get rid of you

96
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,400
and save money?

97
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Boss, did you and your wife collaborate to make me fail my performance goals

98
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,500
so that you can have an excuse to fire me?

99
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Sorry, sorry. I was overthinking.

100
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
You may continue.

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
Depending on?

102
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,400
When you want to share every little thing with someone,

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,000
when you want to contact someone even though you have nothing special to say,

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,400
you're already depending on this person.

105
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,600
In other words, you've been moved.

106
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm been moved?

107
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,100
Impossible.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,900
This... isn't this Ah Tao?

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Don't you believe in science? Why would you use an app like this?

110
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,300
I registered in order to know my clients more.

111
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,400
How did you know my username?

112
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,800
Once you realize you're somehow always connected with someone,

113
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,400
it's not because you guys are a match made in heaven.

114
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,100
Instead, it means that with this person,

115
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,400
you want to become a match made in heaven.

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Is my late maturity

117
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,400
finally going to bloom?

118
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
[By Liu Yixin]

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
From today on, I want to...

120
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,700
work in front of you, Director Meng

121
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
because that way, I can be more efficient.

122
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,400
I can also learn from you, Director Meng.

123
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
How come it's not spicy?

124
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,090
You're complaining even when you can eat it.

125
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,800
Director Meng.

126
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,900
What kind of man would a successful woman like you fall for?

127
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm saying you can't just think about work in life.

128
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,300
You have to think about love once in a while.

129
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,200
Assistant Shen, is this sexual harassment?

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,400
Sorry. Sorry, Director Meng.

131
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,580
Did I tell you to apologize?

132
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Assistant Shen,

133
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,530
are you still thinking about the hot pot whether it was spicy or not?

134
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
It's spicy now.

135
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,780
Surprise!

136
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,120
It's 4 am. Why are you not sleeping?

137
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
You aren't rested. How many hours have you slept?

138
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,230
Is it right to sacrifice your health for work?

139
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,040
Director, we never realized how much you care.

140
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,600
Boss, you are getting cuter and cuter!

141
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,880
I am touched beyond words.

142
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,740
Why don't you go home and rest?

143
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,940
We need to work harder to make the product release successful!

144
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,400
What do you want to do?

145
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,040
Collaborate.

146
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,530
I am confident that the product release event will help Meng Hui recover.

147
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,730
It is because of me

148
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,450
that she wants to develop the liquid foundation.

149
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,120
When is the event taking place?

150
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,540
This Saturday.

151
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,560
Why are you nervous? I won't force you to attend.

152
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,770
Don't come if you are busy.

153
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,280
I have time, but not you.

154
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,950
What do you mean?

155
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,840
I found out something about that girl from your past.

156
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,570
This Saturday is the anniversary of the founding of No.3 Primary School.

157
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,930
All your classmates from the same year will attend.

158
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,980
It's a good opportunity.

159
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,780
She might be there.

160
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,480
It's this Saturday?

161
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,570
I know Saturday is the day of the new product release for Meng Hui.

162
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,560
But you have to make a choice, Shen Yi.

163
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,830
Where is Doctor Sui?

164
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,350
I'm here to get my stitches out.

165
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,330
Miss Wei.

166
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,050
I know you'll tell me the nurse can take my stitches out.

167
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,020
But this surgery was personally done by Professor Smith.

168
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,560
You promised me you'd take care of the aftermath. I want to be flawless.

169
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,310
Miss Wei, you don't need to lie down to get the stitches out. You can stay seated.

170
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,460
But I'm tired.

171
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,970
Pinch me then. Plastic surgery is the same as how you're pitching me.

172
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,030
If you keep pitching this spot then do you think it'll get better?

173
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,460
It's done.

174
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,060
I know you hate me.

175
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,660
We are doctor and patient. Why would I hate you?

176
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,010
Your stitches are out. Go home and rest for a couple days.

177
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,740
Don't eat spicy food, swim or bathe.

178
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,500
Contact me if you need anything while you recover.

179
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,590
I'll do my best to give you an answer.

180
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,970
Since you don't hate me, Dr. Sui

181
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,830
you can do the skin booster injections for me.

182
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,030
Talk to the nurse if you want the injection.

183
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,470
I have other things to attend to.

184
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,310
I envy those natural born beauties.

185
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,570
I have to go through so much pain to become a little more beautiful,

186
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,760
but my doctor is not understanding.

187
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,720
Let me prepare.

You're back.

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,760
This is a rendering of the product display stand.

207
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,730
We're about to succeed and have the press conference.

208
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,590
After the product demonstration, in the last segment, you need to get up on the stage and speak.

209
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,360
Thank you for giving me the opportunity

210
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,980
to fulfill my wish, but...

211
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,950
Don't hesitate. We need you.

212
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,640
Meng Hui, do you remember I told you about

213
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,600
the girl I hurt when I was young? I want to do something for her

214
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,470
but I have been unable to find her.

215
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,200
But I just heard

216
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,870
that there is going to be a school reunion this Saturday.

217
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,810
I've already gone over the press conference agenda with them hundreds of times.

218
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,210
For the ending speech, just follow the script and nothing will go wrong.

219
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,360
I understand and respect your decision.

220
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,340
Go to bed.

221
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,340
[Laff is changing. One shade fits all.]

222

[Reunion of the days of youth]

223
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,670
Director Meng, this product release event is very important.

224
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,430
Those are new reports from the media here and over there are traditional ones.

225
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,400
- They are important media partners.
- Hello.

226
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,820
- How are you?
- Here, this way.

227
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,500
Director Meng, let me confirm the schedule with you.

228
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,260
In a while, we will let the model display it

229
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,310
and the product manager will go up and explain the principles behind it.

230
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,120
Finally, Director Shen will go on stage.

231
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,790
The wine party is last.

232
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,040
- I'll go check there first.
- Okay.

233
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,460
Sorry, I recognized the wrong person.

234
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,970
Are you Zheng Jue?

235
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,740
You've changed a lot.

236
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,140
I almost didn't recognize you.

237
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,100
It's almost time to start. Let's get in our seats.

238
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,340
This way, please.

239
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,240
Let's have our product manager present our product.

240
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,080
Hello, everyone! I am Gao Yi De, product manager of LS company.

241
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,010
Let me first present to you,

242
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,810
released by our company,

243
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,810
a new liquid foundation.

244
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,100
Not only is this new foundation high in coverage and highly moisturizing.

245
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,790
Director Meng, it's about time for him to talk

246
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,790
But Assistant Shen is still not here.

247
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,200
I'll go make a call.

248
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,900
There's a lot of cosmetics and liquid foundations

249
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,560
but what our LS Group can do is

250
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,730
offer high coverage while being highly moisturizing.

251
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,760
Not only will it make our skin even more flawless

252
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,710
with it's high coverage,

253
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,710
It's hydrating enough.

254
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,660
Then how long will it last?

255
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,000
It can last one day.

256
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,420
How is it? Isn't it great? It can last one day.

257
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,900
Sorry, you might have to delay the upcoming event

258
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
How do I delay?

259
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,080
- That works too.
- So...

260
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,640
This new liquid foundation of LS Group...

261
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,060
[Meng Hui]

262
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,480
Good. I'll return the stage to our emcee.

263
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,140
Thank you.

264
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,820
Okay. Thank you Manager Gao for bringing us

265
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,670
such an amazing introduction to the products.

266
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:42,350
Next, we'll have LS's spokesperson come up to the stage to introduce the foundation.

267
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,330
Let's welcome them.

268
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,500
Where are they?

269
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,890
Where are they? How come they're not going up?

270
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,390
Where are they?

271
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,720
Did you see their CEO?

272
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,030
Director Meng, Assistant Shen still hasn't come. What do we do?

273
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,810
It's fine. There's me.

274
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,460
Read it according to what's written on the draft.

275
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,750
Hello everyone, I'm Meng Hui, the CEO of LS Group.

276
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,760
As what our Product Manager said,

277
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,360
our new company's liquid foundation changes colors.

278
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,960
It's based off the same principles as our company's color-changing lipstick.

279
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,200
This foundation will adjust accordingly to each person's skin tone.

280
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,410
It can cover and avoid the troublesome issue of picking colors.

281
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,340
One bottle can solve all your problems

282
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,310
but we invited you guys to attend this press conference not just for the liquid foundation.

283
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,950
I also want to introduce a new product that LS Group is creating.

284
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,300
Plasma Protein Repair Scar Fading Serum.

285
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,650
What is that?

286
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,700
Does our company even have that?

287
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,590
This is LS Research and Development Laboratory's new product project.

288
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,370
It was recently included in the agenda.

289
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,910
Recently included in the agenda?

290
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,670
This is the company's secret.

291
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,270
Director Shen only told it to me. Why did Director Meng say it out?

292
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,110
Xiao Mei, we haven't negotiated the patent yet. Why is she revealing this?

293
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,130
I didn't write it in there. She said it herself.

294
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,490
- If she said it herself then how did she know?
- How would I know?

295
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,880
- What's this?
- What's going on?

296
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,600
Why didn't we know about this?

297
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,050
Director Meng, we never received any news regarding this product.

298
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:42,140
Then may I ask, what products are used Director Meng?

299
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,150
It's a new plasma protein technology that supposedly has repairing capabilities.

300
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,140
It's over. She even revealed our reserved technology.

301
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,250
Then can I ask Director Meng, is this technology developed solely by LS,

302
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,420
or is there a collaboration?

303
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,700
We're collaborating with a lab in France.

304
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,010
From what I know, there is only

305
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,070
one company in France that researches plasma proteins.

306
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,910
But they did not sell this patent.

307
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,770
Does LS really have this technology?

308
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,660
Please answer.

309
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,610
Please answer.

310
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,250
That's right. Please comment.

311
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,320
Please answer the question that I've asked.

312
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,190
Do you have the patent?

313
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,860
You dare to talk about it even though you don't have the patent.

314
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,920
This concludes our press conference. Thank you.

315
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,460
Director Meng!

316
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,060
Meng Hui!

317
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,630
Meng Hui, how do you feel right now?

318
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,760
- I'm very sleepy.
- Sleepy?

319
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,440
Leave her to me.

320
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,430
I'll go with you.

321
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,640
Shen Yi, I think you guys temporarily shouldn't meet.

322
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,950
Stay behind and take care of this mess.

323
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,500
Jiang Jiang, let's go.

324
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,440
Sorry, make way.

325
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
The press conference is already over.

326
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,970
Be careful.

327
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,650
How come I can never do anything well?

328
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,040
They don't even have the patent for the technology for their new serum. They are lying to consumers.

329
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,650
investors took back their investments from LS Group.

330
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,570
The ability to cover things with this liquid foundation is completely different from what was introduced.

331
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,840
LS is always scamming us with products they can't even make.

332
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,970
They don't even have the patent, yet they want my money?

333
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,390
The person talking fainted because she couldn't answer.

334
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,870
Shen Yi, what do we do? The press conference was a mess because of Meng Hui.

335
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,510
Don't blame her. You know she has a special situation.

336
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,140
It's fine. I already contacted the lab at France.

337
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,620
As long as we seize this patent,

338
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,390
then this will become our marketing strategy.

339
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,410
You're saying you found the lab researching plasma proteins?

340
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,360
I actually contacted them a few days ago. I wanted to give you a surprise

341
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,900
so I didn't say it but good thing it's like that

342
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,080
in order to save this situation.

343
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,000
Xing Yao, you probably don't know that after the press conference ended,

344
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,570
that lab was already brought by someone.

345
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,710
That's impossible.

346
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,850
Why do you think the situation is getting worse?

347
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,200
It's because everyone knows we can't possibly make that serum.

348
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,790
It's reasonable for investors to withdraw now.

349
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,490
I'll go confirm right now. They can't go back on their words.

350
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,600
If the patent wasn't reserved, then at the press conference–

351
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,550
I'll go confirm it right now.

352
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,260
Shen Yi, hurry and change the situation.

353
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,840
At this time, are you still willing to be by my side?

354
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,670
If we left at this time

355
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,780
then what will happen to you?

356
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,600
Director Shen, although your ideas are usually a bit extreme,

357
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,430
but you usually persist until the end so this time,

358
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,830
we won't admit defeat!

359
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,650
[Bali Time]

360
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,330
There's also Director Meng!

361
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,650
With all us together!

362
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,950
We already came up with a contingency plan for you.

363
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,600
The most important thing for us right now is to work on crisis management and to appease our investors.

364
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,700
We need to solve the company's finance issue.

365
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,330
Do you have a proposal?

366
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,610
It's all here.

367
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,920
This is the best news that I've received today.

368
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,070
If everyone is ready then think about what else we're lacking.

369
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,910
We're lacking in money.

370
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,080
How much?

371
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,290
The original investors withdrew their investment. At the end of the month, we also need to settle the bills with suppliers.

372
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,050
Our current liquid capital is not enough to sustain–

373
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,870
Just get to the result.

374
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,640
You should go talk to your dad.

375
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,640
Give me the original conclusion.

376
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,030
We need 50 thousand.

377
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,210
That much?

378
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:07,580
I have already calculated your current cashflow. There's a huge deficit.

379
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,380
But if you go talk to your dad then everything will be solved.

380
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,200
Impossible.

381
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,590
I think there's no hope.

382
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,310
How is there no hope?

383
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,800
Who is Shen Qianshan? He can move his fingers and we'll over come this trouble just like that.

384
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,800
He is his biological son after all. He can't just watch and do nothing, right?

385
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,560
Don't you know this father and son is like fire and water?

386
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,750
I have gossip.

387
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,700
I heard Old Shen is cold and

388
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,390
who can make one's hair stand up in anger.

389
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,540
When Director Shen was young, one time,

390
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,740
he and his mother lived in concealment for many years.

391
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,080
Then Shen Qianshan showed up at his mom's funeral. Guess what happened?

392
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,490
Shen Qianshan didn't offer any condolences and took Shen Yi away with him.

393
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,600
- What?
- My goodness.

394
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,840
No wonder our Director Shen would be like this today.

395
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,270
Is Meng Hui here? I want to see her.

396
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,570
She's resting.

397
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,350
She hasn't woke up yet.

398
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,710
Then can I go in and keep her company?

399
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,510
She's not suitable to meet you in this state. Go back first.

400
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:43,460
Actually, I'm the most worried about Meng Hui right now. I don't know how she's doing.

401
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,640
Ah Tao isn't letting me see her.

402
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,020
I really regret it. I shouldn't have left her behind.

403
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,950
Once she wakes up and thinks about the mess at the press conference,

404
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,020
she'll be really upset.

405
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,580
Shen Yi, it already happened. Don't blame yourself.

406
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,490
If only I had the chance to do it again.

407
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,830
I just realized now that to me,

408
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,440
Meng Hui is the most important person.

409
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,400
I like her

410
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,190
not because she was the person from back then. I'm not making it up to her.

411
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,630
I really... really like her.

412
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,880
Then think of a way to solve the problem.

413
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,150
That way, Meng Hui won't think she dragged you down.

414
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,700
You're awake.

415
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,950
Do you want to sleep some more? I made you congee.

416
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,470
I can't fall asleep. Once I think about what I did at Shen Yi's company

417
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,260
I feel bad.

418
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,290
It all passed and the problem will be solved.

419
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:28,270
You're a patient right now so  you should rest well. I'll go get you some congee.

[Missed Call from Shen Yi]

421
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:52,800
Let's temporarily separate for some time. I need to figure out our relationship.

422
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,920
I am the assistant? Meng Hui, recall it a bit.

423
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,910
I told you to call me Director Meng at the company!

424
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,030
Although it's still a bit lacking but it will do.

425
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,900
Then... you have to suffer a bit.

426
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,170
Are you going out yourself or do you want me to invite you?

427
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,070
All of you here are garbage.

428

Please answer my question.

429
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,720
I'm afraid he would disturb you from sleeping

430
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,910
so I didn't let Shen Yi come in.

431

I really gave him so much trouble.

432

We're indeed not suitable.

433
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,530
You should think this way. Shen Yi came to look for you which means you're important to him.

434

There's someone even more important than me in his heart.

He didn't go to the press conference because of her.

436
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:22,100
I thought he wanted to make the liquid foundation so that LS Group would make profit,

437
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,530
but I just realized that what I thought was wrong.

Do you like Shen Yi?

439
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,020
But he probably doesn't like me.

00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:59,100
Sorry, you're having so much pressure. I will think of a way to make it up.

441
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,820
Then think about a way to solve the problem

442
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,720
that way Meng Hui won't think she dragged you down.
