[Episode 2: Concealing the hidden truth]

20
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,960
They sincerely asked me to be a judge but I categorically rejected it.

21
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,910
I never forgot my initial goal. I entered the production team in order to gain experience and become a more professional judge of beauty.

22
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,070
This is essentially doing an incognito visit or being an immortal descending on earth.

23
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,630
Even though I'm well-known, as a person, I keep a low profile.

24
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,180
Unfortunately my partnered model is of low quality and is holding me back.

25
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,390
Her temper isn't good either.

26
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,120
Oh my God! I broke it! Who will come and save me?

27
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,720
Oh my God! Do you know how much this costs?

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,500
I'll pay for it.

29
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,030
It turns out her ex-boyfriend fancies me. No wonder she looked so unhappy.

30
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:34,160
Should we go home together after work? I also have some academic questions... I need to ask you.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,750
So you see, in the production group, I used my professional ability to control everything and used my exceptional popularity to beat Wei Lei.

32
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,460
Even Shen Yi was conquered by my charm. Even the way he looked at me was weird.

33
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:54,870
Wait and see. After I've sold all the old goods from LS, he won't be able to leave me.

34
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,970
I want to ask something. Who is Shen Yi?

35
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,170
Our production group's sponsor. He likes the outstanding person that I am.

36
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,250
Then... what do you want to do?

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,680
Since he has feelings for me and I think he's decent, we should try it.

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,550
Then can you tell me, what kind of person Shen Yi is?

39
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,130
He... looks pretty calm.

40
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,770
He seems cold on the outside but he's actually very gentle. Everyone says he's frugal,

41
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,930
but I actually think this his most attractive quality. He is frugal with everyone but generous with me.

42
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,340
- I'm so touched.
- Is this true?

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,190
Oh right, I have to film in the afternoon, so I can't chat anymore. If we get together, I'll introduce you to him.

44
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,230
Teacher A'Tao, the story that Miss Meng Hui is imaging is too exaggerated!

45
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,600
This is her artistic amendment of harsh reality. This is to satisfy her imagination.

46
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,440
Then how will she get better?

47
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,280
We can extract from the facts she just gave us.

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,770
Firstly, she wants to become a blogger who advertises goods.

49
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,260
Secondly...

50
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,940
she wants Shen Yi.
[Meng Hui - the day dreaming extraordinaire]

51
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,890
Miss Meng Hui's Weibo grew by tens of thousands of fans overnight!

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,750
- Who is this? Shen Yi's girlfriend?
- Isn't he known for being stingy? Who would like him?

53
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,090
I can't be Shen Qian Shan's daughter-in-law now.

54
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,030
It looks like this time... she has a chance to achieve her goal.

55
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,210
Don't you want to try it? It's a color that doesn't suit everyone. LS barbie-pink lipstick will fix dark skin!

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,710
It's this. Many people are paying attention to you, so...

57
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,810
All right, I'm going to cut you off. This program...

58
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,310
is more focused on fashion and I use that as the headline.

59
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,980
Teacher Zi Xin is so handsome!

60
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,910
You like Su Zi Xin?

61
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,100
Teacher Zi Xin is not only handsome. He is also good at his job.

62
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,590
His character is also excellent. Yesterday, I saw him getting a competitor out of trouble.

63
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,200
- He's super nice!
- Then you should go and get him!

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,330
How?

65
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,870
You don't need to put any on there. Thank you.

66
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,200
I'll do a demonstration. You can learn.

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,190
- Three, four, five. Yes, good.
- Wei Lei is going in. She's going in!

68
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,840
- It's starting. It's starting!
- I'm betting on Meng Hui!

69
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,750
- I'm betting on Wei Lei.
- I'm betting on Shen Yi!

70
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,620
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,930
No need, thank you.

72
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,360
This pen...

73
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,360
You are filming tomorrow, so don't catch a cold.

74
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,410
I'm sorry. I didn't know that you don't have a neck.

75
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,410
Director Shen!

76
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,110
Why did you fall?

77
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
Your makeup is messed up! I'll wipe it for you.

78
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,250
Oh, I was mistaken. This is for removing makeup.

79
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,620
H-Have any of you seen Wei Lei without makeup?

80
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,290
Get the number four camera over there! It's for a special article. A special article! I want to expose this!

81
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,890
Fine! You win! You can continue.

82
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,090
Bye!

83
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,710
I said that we were missing two thousands.

84
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,690
Alright.

85
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,190
Oh.

86
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,280
Don't move.

87
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,950
Just then that... flirtation, was it Shen Yi?

88
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,880
Talented!

89
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,050
Brilliant!

90
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,600
A master!

91
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,820
I've learned it!

92
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,990
All right, no more chatting. I'm going to review notices.

93
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,460
Look, look!

94
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,910
Teacher Su, I thought for this season...

95
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,100
Because of last season, the viewer feedback was that your hosting was good. But it could be a bit more stylish.

96
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,780
- Okay, okay. Then carry on Teacher Su.
- I'll get on with my work.

97
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,820
Teacher Su, this is the schedule.

98
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,020
Thank you.

99
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,810
What does this means?

100
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,770
Where I am from, this is a greeting.

101
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,020
Did you come to deliver that to me?

102
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,430
This is tea to soothe my throat?

103
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,550
I'm doing cues every day and also need to do reviews. This is perfect.

104
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,290
Thank you. You're very thoughtful.

105
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:03,760
Don't you want to try it? It's a color that doesn't suit everyone. LS barbie-pink lipstick will fix dark skin!

106
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,330
Let's see what the netizens are saying.

107
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,850
Why are you looking at reviews? Director Shen, we had a whole warehouse of the barbie-pink color!

108
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,340
It was one of those dead colors that no one cares about.

109
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,650
Half an hour after Miss Meng Hui's video was released, it was sold out! She's the queen of sales!

110
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,900
Can the sales of one lipstick save the losses in makeup sales of your entire marketing department?

111
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,270
- N- No.
- Then why are you happy?

112
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,870
How many more of these partnership will there be?

113
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,070
It hasn't started yet.

114
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,810
But, according to my prediction, Miss Meng Hui must have done this due to a private relationship

115
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:04,150
and specially helped our company... No, helped you advertise.

116
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,910
That means... you didn't spend money?

117
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,590
That's right!

118
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,070
Then how much does it cost her to send one video?

119
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,460
That depends on the situation. The cheapest is a few thousand yuan. The more expensive ones can cost tens of thousands of yuan!

120
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,470
How many advertising positions can we get now? If we want to advertise for three days straight, how much will it cost?

121
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,780
Currently, we can get sixteen spots. The average price is...

122
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,430
roughly 20,000 yuan.

123
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,830
Let her record another video. Let her promote the fluorescent purple color that we couldn't sell.

124
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,130
Okay.

125
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,730
Management fee.

126
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,270
Why aren't you leaving?

127
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,750
Director Shen, does our filming this time count as work-related?

128
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,860
- It's the same as the last time.
- Okay.

129
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,690
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

130
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,130
Secretary Jiang, does that mean Director Shen isn't giving us a budget?

131
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,950
"The same as last time" means that as this video cost nothing

132
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,240
then the next one can't cost anything either.

133
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,680
So this means... to put aside our pride and ask for another free advertising video?

134
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,500
From what I know of him, yes.

135
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,550
Even if we are putting pride aside, it should be his pride.

136
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,780
After all, his relationship with Miss Meng...

137
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:16,860
This is a small gift from Director Shen. This is a series of lipsticks in all colors from LS. We hope you like them.

138
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,140
Shen Yi gifted this? I'm so grateful.

139
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,670
You don't need to be grateful. We also have a favor to ask.

140
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,490
Say it.

141
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,830
Can you record another video? With this lipstick.

142
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,590
Record a video?

143
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,870
That's right. Just like the one you recorded for Director Shen.

144
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:44,580
You mean that Shen Yi is gifting me lipstick so I can record him a video? He's so clingy.

145
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,840
That's right. That's right.

146
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,620
Fine, I'll do it.

147
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,340
Shen Yi, thank you for the lipstick you gifted me! I love you!

148
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,120
You want... to record it... like this?

149
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,790
Doesn't it look nice?

150
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,340
It does! It does! Thank you, Miss Meng.

151
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,290
It's free, so don't be picky! Take it back and show Director Shen!

152
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,040
Okay, thank you Miss Meng.

153
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,310
Let's go. Let's go.

154
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,170
Hello, Director Shen. The advertising video has been recorded, would you like to see it yourself?

155
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,490
No need, just release it.

156
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,990
You want to be this... casual?

157
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,400
Even if you sold all the lipstick, it would only give us a profit of a few millions.

158
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,370
Right now, I'm dealing with stocks and  funds. This is about tens of millions in cash flow.

159
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,370
But there are some things that are difficult for me.

160
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,240
Is how a video turns out that important?

161
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,450
Shen Yi, thanks for sending me these lipsticks. I love you, too.

162
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,040
Shen Yi, thanks for sending me these lipsticks. I love you, too.

163
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,040
Shen Yi, thanks for sending me these lipsticks. I love you, too.

164
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,420
Shen Yi, thanks for sending me these lipsticks. I love you, too.

165
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,670
Thank you.

166
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,600
- This is great.
- Thank you.

167
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,970
Thank you.

168
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,170
[Sold Out]

169
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,690
Shen Yi, thanks for sending me these lipsticks. I love you, too.

170
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,280
It's just promotion of a product, isn't it? I can do that. Shen Yi is your ex-boyfriend, right?

171
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,940
From now on, I'll accept him.

172
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,890
I'm done for!

173
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,060
What do I do? How do I explain this to Shen Yi? I'm done for.

174
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,120
Shen Yi, thanks for sending me these lipsticks. I love you, too.

175
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,890
- Come here. Don't leave.
- I watched it.

176
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,760
Who told you to send it out? Did you get water in your brain?

177
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,620
Why are you all mute?

178
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,500
Speak up!

179
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,520
You told me to send it out.

180
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,030
I told you to send it out? Are you kidding?!

181
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,060
Such a big issue, and you didn't report it to me before sending it out?

182
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,720
I was worried about disrupting your business worth tens of millions.

183
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,440
I can put aside that other business. I'm not struggling for that money, but this video...

184
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,450
I've spent over a million on it. I'll have to pay for it.

185
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:38,490
Uh... that... actually, you didn't lose money on it. The fluorescent purple sold out. You made a profit.

186
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,300
- How long has it been out?
- 3 days.

187
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,810
- Coverage?
- All LS storefronts in China that sell this type of product. Also, all department stores we've contract with.

188
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,340
Also, other platforms like Weibo, WeChat, Moments, that type... it's not easy to estimate.
(T/N: Moments - social network platform like Facebook)

189
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,880
What are the consequences?

190
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,160
A lot of gossip about you and Miss Meng Hui.

191
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:14,480
This was our error. We thought you and Miss Meng Hui had a special relationship.

192
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,530
What did you say?

193
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,750
This...

194
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,110
Where is she?

195
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,560
- Have you seen Director Shen?
- No. You're looking for him?

196
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,230
I'm avoiding him.

197
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,160
That's unfortunate, then. I just happened to need to see you about something.

198
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,840
Director Shen, I can explain that matter on Weibo.

199
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:25,860
Who asked you to randomly post those pictures and that video on your own? It caused everyone to misunderstand our relationship.

200
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,640
If I tell you that when I sent that out 3 days ago,

201
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,220
I wasn't the person I am now, could you understand that?

202
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,560
But the me from 3 days ago and the me from right now is the same person. So who is going to take responsibility for this?

203
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,580
The me from right now.

204
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,270
Right. How will you take responsibility?

205
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,070
I will do my best to compensate you for the economic losses.

206
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,900
For financial losses... that's a must. But you need to go find Jiang Jiang and tell her that you and I have no relationship at all.

207
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,500
And, right now the most important thing is

208
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,480
you need to make clear to everyone what's the relationship between us. The two of us

209
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,420
are absolutely not dating. All of that is your wishful thinking. Do you understand?

210
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,590
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go!

211
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,900
- Right, right.
- Let's go.

212
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,610
You don't need to clarify for us. We all understand.

213
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,670
You two go ahead and chat. We all understand. You're not dating.

214
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,210
I don't understand. What relationship do you and Shen Yi have?

215
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,040
What is that "wishful thinking"?

216
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,740
Every time my behavior gets out of control, it ends up being so many problems.

217
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,130
Now the entire world doesn't believe me and thinks I'm a liar.

218
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,200
Do you understand this feeling? Even if you had 100 mouths, you wouldn't be able to explain it clearly.

219
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,810
I can.

220
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,150
Why has the entire world become a mess after I woke up?

221
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,870
The person who made the mistake is obviously not me, but I have to take the blame.

222
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,210
Meng Hui. Meng Hui. Meng Hui!

223
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,550
They aren't all problems though, right?

224
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,600
You fulfilled many wishes, you became a makeup artist and even a product selling king.

225
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,090
Your Weibo account even gained many followers, right?

226
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,410
I can't be like that anymore.

227
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Everyone thinks that I harassed Shen Yi. Now even the show crew thinks that I lied to them.

228
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,530
I'll maybe get fired tomorrow.

229
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:15,190
It's not that serious. Don't worry. I'll think of a solution, alright?

230
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,260
What solution?

231
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,090
Hello.

232
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,560
This is for you.

233
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,770
Excuse me. I received a coupon for a free consultation here.

234
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,610
You're Jiang Jiang, right? Please come in.

235
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,470
Let's do some basic tests first.

236
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,600
Mild depression. If it's okay, can I ask you what your job is?

237
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,110
I am a CEO's personal assistant.

238
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,080
Your work environment is considered to be high risk.

239
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,570
Sign this first then.

240
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,620
Sign on which side?

241
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,730
You also have some decidophobia.

242
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,970
Germophobia.

243
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,550
- OCD.
- That's not it. I—

244
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,320
Fear of missing out.

245
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,120
No, no, no. I'm...

246
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,010
I have hand cream right here.

247
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,850
Servant type of personality.

248
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,120
Then do I have any hope of being treated?

249
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,930
As long as you come to consultations regularly and on time, there shouldn't be much of an issue.

250
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,370
I will definitely cooperate until the end.

251
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,080
Then I will schedule next week's consultation. As long as you keep coming twice a week, you should be fine.

252
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,590
What is the fee?

253
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:27,210
Our Dr. Tao is a first-grade psychological consultant. The fee is 4,000 yuan for about an hour.

254
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,560
If every session is 1.5 hrs, the total cost per week would be 12,000 yuan.

255
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,990
How about I just stay untreated.

256
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,700
As long as you help me out with something, I will be your consultant for free.

257
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,460
I also offer drop in service, 24/7 standby.

258
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,980
Help with what?

259
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,120
Post-traumatic stress disorder?
(T/N: Aka, PTSD)

260
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,010
PTSD will give her some psychological hints.

261
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,230
It will also make up her background and experiences.

262
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,410
So everything that she did was out of her control.

263
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,330
I gave you a lot of troubles. I am sorry. I hope that you will forgive her.

264
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,760
Then why did she get PTSD?

265
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,160
The reason is very complicated. She has only had these symptoms for the past 2 years.

266
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,870
This type is probably one left from the trauma she had.

267
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,980
Tracing the cause back to its root, you could say that it is from an incident that happened in her childhood.

268
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:33,940
Let me give an example, when people meet a setback, they will give themselves some psychological hints.

269
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,490
Let's say if they were punished by their boss, they would think that it would be good to be the boss of their boss.

270
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,470
Or, it would be good if I had a billion dollars. Or they would think it would be good if I had a girlfriend.

271
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,760
If I wouldn't have to spend any money for the rest of my life, it would be all good.

272
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,740
Yes.

273
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,110
But we all know that this is fake, right?

274
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,070
Right.

275
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,050
But Meng Hui's difference between us is that she thinks it's all real.

276
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,800
This, I can understand.

277
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,620
But the issue is who will be responsible for the problems caused?

278
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,140
Let me explain this more clearly to you.

279
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,750
The person who took out the screw, broke the table, and made the bottles fall, was not her.

280
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,250
But the person who took initiative, confessed to her mistakes, and took the blame was her.

281
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,460
The person who went to the show and apologized to you was her.

282
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,260
But the person who was shooting, filming videos, and making Weibo posts was not her.

283
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,460
Do you understand now?

284
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,200
It's a little complicated.

285
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,040
Ah Tao means that A owes you money but you are asking for B to pay you it.

286
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,700
Then if I don't ask B to pay, where did my money go?

287
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:46,050
You mean that you want me to forgive her because of her disorder?

288
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:50,020
Boss, have you not understood yet? Even I understood it.

289
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,860
Does she gives you a paycheck?

290
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,660
I have something to do. I'll head out first. You can send off this psychologist later.

291
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,410
Okay.

292
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,200
Is your Boss very hard to convinced?

293
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,410
Our boss has a very hard mouth but a soft heart.

294
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:40,030
Today's chart that we are looking at shows the statistics of the cosmetic industry gathered by the marketing department through research.

295
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,700
The person who took out the screw, broke the table, and made the bottles fall, was not her.

296
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,090
But the person who took initiative, confessed to her mistakes, and took the blame was her.

297
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,080
Can you not ask Xiao Mei to pay for it?

298
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,760
Don't you think this responsibility is very heavy?

299
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,120
But this is the responsibility that I need to take.

300
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,020
I can't hurt others because of this matter.

301
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,070
I don't want anything to do with you.

302
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:15,120
The two of us are absolutely not dating. All of that is your wishful thinking. Do you understand?

303
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,500
- Director Shen.
- Let's end the meeting.

304
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,480
D- Director Shen?

305
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,060
- These days it has been so busy at work. I have no time to go shopping.
- Me too.

306
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,480
- Director Shen.
- Director Shen, it's so late. What are you doing here?

307
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,140
Uh...

308
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,020
Is Meng Hui here?

309
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,250
I just saw that she was in the makeup room.

310
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,990
Thanks.

311
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,760
Let's go.

312
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,640
Hi.

313
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,940
Why are you here?

314
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,430
I was just passing by. What are you doing?

315
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,420
We have to use these clothes tomorrow, so we must wash and dry them today.

316
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,490
Why don't you use the washing machine?

317
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,440
All these have to be handwashed.

318
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,040
All of these clothes, why are you the only one washing them? Where are the others?

319
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,500
They have other stuff to do.

320
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:03,930
- Are you being bullied?
- I'm fine. Don't get too ahead of yourself. I'm really fine.

321
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,060
I'll help you wash them.

322
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,900
Use that.

323
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,150
Aren't we going overboard?

324
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,400
Let's all wait for her to quit, too avoid it getting awkward later.

325
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,570
Let's just go take a look.

326
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,430
Meng Hui, we just finished working. How can we leave you alone to do all of this?

327
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,850
- Quickly dry your hands.
- Exactly.
- Dry your hands.

328
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,260
Go, go, go. Let's go talk over there.

329
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:26,320
- Come here. Rest a little bit.
- Listen to us, leave it to us.
- Go, go, go.

330
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,460
Sometimes I think life is pretty magical.

331
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,570
Ten minutes ago I was in there washing clothes.

332
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,880
worrying about if I would lose the job that I like tomorrow.

333
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,830
Ten minutes later, we are sitting here stargazing and everything seems to be resolved.

334
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:09,800
That day, it was me who was too harsh on you in front of everyone.

335
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,560
Mistakes made by A shouldn't be blamed on B.

336
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,170
This makes it very unfair for B.

337
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,970
You... know everything now?

338
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,630
I should be the one apologizing.

339
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,400
No matter what the reason is, for the victim,

340
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,850
A and B must be the same person.

341
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,380
Since I was the one who made the mistake, I should be the one who bears the responsibility.

342
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,100
Otherwise, it's not fair to others.

343
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,850
Will that be a vexation to you?

344
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,650
Are you talking about my PTSD illness

345
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,190
that mixes up fantasy and reality?

346
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,230
When I make a mistake, I should clean up the mess myself.

347
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,890
Sometimes I feel so helpless.

348
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,120
But, there's nothing absolutely good in the world.

349
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,430
And there's nothing absolutely bad either. So looking at it from a different perspective,

350
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,770
it's like Heaven gave me a special gift.

351
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,210
Gift?

352
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,780
In everyone's hearts, there are always some things that they want to do but don't dare to do them.

353
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,260
Often times, we are held back by rules and conditions,

354
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,070
burying our real thoughts in our hearts.

355
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,020
But PTSD, to some extent,

356
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,580
actually gave me courage, leading me to do things I wouldn't dare to.

357
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,430
Just like after getting drunk, you think you are very tough and become confident.
(T/N: "jiǔ zhuàng sǒng rén dǎn" is a saying that refers to alcohol induced confidence/courage/aggressive attitude)

358
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,470
You don't need to worry about me.

359
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,850
I'm already used to it.

360
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,850
And now, I'm working on overcoming it.

361
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,980
Ah Tao said that as long as I can be a little braver,

362
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,980
more confident, and forget about...

363
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,910
and forget about the past,

364
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,910
everything will be alright.

365
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,410
You can do it.

366
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,660
I will keep this secret for you.

367
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,990
Why... did you want to be a makeup artist?

368
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,990
Because I want to make everyone beautiful.

369
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,160
What about you? Why do you want to produce cosmetics?

370
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,370
I...

371
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,130
Because...

372
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,620
I just want to make one person beautiful.

373
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,460
Since I was the one who made the mistake, I should be the one who bears the responsibility.

374
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,470
Otherwise, it's not fair to others.

375
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,400
Why would you make trouble?

376
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,540
Why would you scratch her face?

377
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,520
Look at our home.

378
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,620
I can't even get out of bed.

379
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,560
Are you forcing me to die?

380
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,520
The doctor said it will leave a scar.

381
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,830
Plastic surgery will be very expensive.

382
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,640
Zheng Jue's parents divorced. Looking at their situation, his mom won't be able to pay for it.

383
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,240
The kid is usually well-behaved.

384
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,360
He has never fought with his classmates before.

385
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,330
I think we need to know more about this situation.

386
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,670
We roughly understand what happened;

387
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,400
but as the headmaster,

388
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,720
I still need to hear from Zheng Jue about what really happened.

389
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,580
If he didn't start it,

390
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,410
then there is room for negotiation.

391
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,930
Zheng Jue, tell us. Did you start it?

392
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,420
Zheng Jue! Zheng Jue!

393
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,240
Zheng Jue. Hurry and tell us.

394
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,060
Zheng Jue!

395
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,720
No... it wasn't me.

396
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Did they fight with you first?

397
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,510
How about that girl?

398
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,900
Is she with them?

399
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,750
Yes. She is with them.

400
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,400
Hello? Sui An. I thought of her again.

401
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,970
I made her face look like that.

402
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,890
Is she still blaming me now?

403
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,380
How is she doing?

404
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,630
I still haven't produced a foundation that can cover scars.

405
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,300
Her face... what does it look like now?

406
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,730
Will people make fun of her?

407
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,640
My God! You have such a big scar on your face.

408
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,600
Will people bully her?

409
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,580
So... you know how to cover scars,

410
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,230
because you have a scar, too.

411
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,250
Shen Yi, calm down.

412
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,240
Everything is over already.

413
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,970
It's not over yet.

414
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,860
Meng Hui,

415
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,290
how do I always find out your secrets?

416
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,760
Wei Lei, could you please not tell anyone?

417
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,990
I don't want others to know.

418
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,130
Shen Yi doesn't know?

419
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,570
Please don't tell him.

420
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,320
That's not fair.

421
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,040
I only had a nose surgery, but so many people criticize me.

422
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,410
Every day, I have to live carefully.

423
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,840
You have such a big scar on your face,

424
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,880
but you live as if nothing happened.

425
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,420
This world favors good looks.

426
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,970
Tell me... if Shen Yi found out you have such a big scar,

427
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,040
how will he look at you?

428
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,790
Will he still like you then?

429

a pimple or a scar.
