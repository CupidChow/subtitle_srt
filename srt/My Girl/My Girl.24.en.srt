[Episode 24: Serum - restarting time]

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,200
What's wrong?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You look very beautiful today.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,200
You haven't had anything to eat all day. I brought some food for you.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm good. The dress is too tight.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,300
Have a bite, here.

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Put it down. I'll eat it later.

27
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Are you happy?

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Of course.

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,200
All my dreams have come true.

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,800
What's wrong?

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm not sure why, but I've started feeling a bit tired just now.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,400
I really want to sleep and I feel dizzy.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,200
Are you really tired?

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Sit down first.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Ah Tao, Ah Tao!

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
- What's wrong?
- Meng Hui said she feels really tired and wants to sleep.

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Isn't this very similar to the previous few times?

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
What previous few times?

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,300
It's nothing.

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you happy?

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,400
Yes.

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Do you feel blessed?

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,200
Yes.

44
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,970
Do you feel like a dream or wish of yours has come true?

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,430
The person I want most in life is right before me.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
She's fine. She will recover after she takes a nap.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,400
Is it the type of recovery I'm thinking about?

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,800
The type of recovery that brings us back to zero.

49
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,520
If you're tired, go to sleep. Don't force it.

50
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,610
I'm fine.

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,200
Is it straight?

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
It's straight.

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,700
We'll just be doing a run through. It'll only take five minutes, just five minutes.

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,200
Then, you can go and sleep. Once you wake up,

55
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,100
you'll be back to your happy life.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,600
Tell the people inside to hurry up. Cut short the wedding run through.

57
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
The agenda has already been set.

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,300
Listen to me, cut it short.

59
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,600
- Hurry.
- Okay.

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,700
These five minutes...

61
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,300
Listen up everyone, we'll be shortening the run through.

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,100
Have it done in within five minutes.

63
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,600
Why? Why?

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,500
The bride is tired.

65
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,150
It's so hard earning this family's money.

66
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,200
Director Shen, congratulations.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,800
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
You...

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
look beautiful today.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,100
It's alright. I look even more beautiful in a wedding dress.

71
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,800
I wonder who will be lucky enough to have me as their bride.

72
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,470
After I leave for England, I will make sure to call you.

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,700
No need.

74
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,400
A break up doesn't require an adjustment period.

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,000
In case a call from you would take five years, becoming  long-distance love.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
Come back and request for getting back together.

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,500
That suits your ideal world!

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
Wei Lei, do you have to be so harsh and sarcastic?

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,230
Me, harsh and sarcastic?

80
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,100
Please rephrase your words.

81
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,600
If yelling at me will make you happy,

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,800
then go ahead. But I feel like you won't.

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,800
You don't want to argue with me. You just don't know how to communicate with me.

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
If you have complaints,

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,400
you can explain it to me.

86
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
I will always listen.

87
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
Hurry up and go.

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,600
Wei Lei, Sui An has his own reasons.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,400
Don't blame him and don't make things hard for yourself.

90
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Relationships, you know. You have to bicker in order for it to be realistic.

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Look at Shen Yi and I. We got along so well for ten years yet we still ended up divorcing.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,400
Rekindle old flames just like a snap of fingers!

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,600
Everyone, come over and take a group photo.

94
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,100
Let's take care of your guys' matters first.

95
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,600
Three, two, one, look over here!

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,300
Let's go.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hold up, it didn't turn out well.

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,000
What's wrong with people these days?

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Are rich people all like this, rushing even when it's their wedding?

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've really had enough of this.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How come you women take so long to do your makeup?

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,600
Two hours. Meng Hui is the one getting married, not you.

103
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,400
Who said mothers aren't allowed to dress up for their child's wedding?

104
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,000
Also, even though I took two hours to do my makeup,

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,600
whose fault was it that we were late? It was because you were looking for your phone.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,900
Right before we left, you had everyone help you look for your phone.

107
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,800
Is your child's wedding not more important than a phone?

108
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Let's go, go, go.

109
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
Didn't I end up finding my phone in the end?

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
We left the house late because the car broke down.

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Calling the taxi only wasted 30 minutes.

112
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
You should've planned it better.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
I planned it all out.

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,500
I sent all our cars out to help Shen Yi pick up his bride.

115
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,200
Who knew the car I saved for us would break down?

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you trying to blame me for sending out the wrong cars?

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,500
That's enough. Stop trying to explain. You might as well be absent.

118
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,600
Since you were absent for most of Shen Yi's life anyways.

119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
If you're absent this time, you should just stop being a father.

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Chairman, Chairman's wife.

121
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Please continue the argument at home. The wedding is about to start.

122
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Hurry, hurry, I still have a speech to make.

123
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
He only knows how to blame it on me.

124
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
The elevator is temporarily out of service.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
What about the backup one?

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,800
The electrical wiring for the elevators is malfunctioning. The repair will take 20 minutes.

127
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
But the wedding is about to start.

128
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Where is the venue?

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,600
On the top floor, the 26th floor.

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Are they asking me to fly up there? Tell them all to come down.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,600
That's enough. What are you yelling for? Let's hurry up and climb the stairs.

132
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Over here.

133
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,800
My heart.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Remember, our budget is limited.

135
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,000
We only have these firecrackers.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Our budget is limited.

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,800
Once I set off my firecracker, then it's everyone else's turn, understood?

138
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Understood.

139
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
Shen Yi's parents haven't arrived yet?

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm not sure, but the long awaited day has finally arrived.

141
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Director Shen and Director Meng are finally getting married.

142
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Before, my life was a mess.

143
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,400
I always encounter a lot of weird things

144
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
and cause a lot of troubles

145
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
but after I met you,

146
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,000
all of these troubles became happy memories.

147
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,400
Even though I'm crying the next second

148
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,600
but as long as I'm in your arms

149
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,200
then I can get courage again

150
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,000
so I hope in the future,

151
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can also become your pillar of strength.

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
When you need me,

153
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I will give you courage and happiness.

154
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,800
Before I met you,

155
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,100
my life was filled with flaws.

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,400
If I describe it with colors

157
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,490
then it's black and white

158
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,320
but after you appeared,

159
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,300
my life was complete.

160
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,200
It became rich and colorful.

161
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Do you know before you appeared,

162
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,000
I was in such a bad state. If I had to give myself a score,

163
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,280
I think there was only one point

164
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,800
but you said, you're a 99 points girl.

165
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,200
Then we're 1 plus 99 points

166
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,200
our life in the future will be 100 points.

167
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,780
Meng Hui,

168
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,600
are you willing to spend the rest of your life with me?

169
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,000
I do.

170
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,400
Brother, wish you happiness.

171
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
What's wrong with you?

172
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,800
Okay, it's time to throw the bouquet.

173
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Now, let's invite the beauties here—

174
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
Wait a second.

175
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
We'll throw it ourselves.

176
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,270
Okay, let's invite the groom's dad,

177
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,000
Qian Shan Company's CEO,

178
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,400
Mr. Shen Qian Shan, will be giving a speech to the couple.

179
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,000
Let's welcome him with a round of applause.

180
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,200
- Where is President Shen?
- Mr. Shen?

181
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,500
Mr. Shen, are you here?

182
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,400
Shen Qian Shan?

183
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Start the live broadcast and put my dad on the screen.

184
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,700
For the live broadcast, hide the frame so that the time doesn't show.

185
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,000
Endure it.

186
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
President Shen, we're doing a live broadcast.

187
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
What live broadcast?

188
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
I already waited for twenty something years.

189
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
What will happen if you let him wait for a couple more minutes?

190
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,000
President Shen, it already started.

191
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
That... Shen Yi.

192
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I waited for twenty something years to wait for these few minutes.

193
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,800
It's not easy for you and Meng Hui.

194
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
There has been ups and downs—

195
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,400
I am from Qian Shan Group. Hand over the equipment to me.

196
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
Go prepare the events for later.

197
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,600
I hope that in the future, you two will stand together through thick and thin,

198
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,700
the hard days are over and the good days are here.

199
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Life is originally not perfect.

200
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,200
Then, after you two bump into each other you'll—

201
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,300
What's wrong? How come the time on there is 2020?

202
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,800
I truly wish you happiness.

203
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
Xu Xing Yao, it's you again!

204
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Perhaps, they got it wrong. It's fine.

205
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
But everyone didn't think it's weird.

206
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,200
That means, the person that is wrong is me.

207
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Which year is it?

208
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
What is this?

209
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
[Hui & Yi]

210
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
So it's 2020 right now

211
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
and not 2030?

212
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,500
Don't be anxious. Don't think too much.

213
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Okay, hurry up.

214
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,600
Then, why is everyone lying to me?

215

230
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,000
I thought I was a makeup artist, went to the variety show,

231
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,800
and even thought I was your girlfriend.

232
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,100
You even accommodated me.

233
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,200
Is the cake more sweet or me?

234
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,800

I made the investors made angry and ruined your press conference.

237
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,000
I also thought we were siblings. It wasn't you.

238
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There's also a time that I thought we were siblings.

239
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,300
Do you know how much I like you?

No, it's not making it up to you.

I know you're not making it up to me.

You treat me so well. You didn't owe me anything long ago.

- Meng Hui!
- Auntie.

Don't worry, Auntie. Our Director Shen will take care of Miss Meng.

280
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,000
Auntie, don't worry.

281
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,200
Meng Hui just fell asleep. Trust me.

282
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Who did this?

283
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Who dared to ruin my son's wedding?

I won't ever spare them!

285

I'm already climbed to the 19th floor. Do you want me to go down now?

286
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,000
Director Xu, seems like you have to do the resign procedures again.

287
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,110
She should be fine now. It's different from the usual this time.

288
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,100
I think she will be able to fully overcome her PTSD.

289
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,200
Really?

290
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,470
You were right. The scar is what caused her PTSD.

291
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,020
But right now, she really doesn't care about this scar anymore

292
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,550
so those troublesome situations from before won't happen again.

293
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,480
Go home first. Don't delay your flight.

294

If there's anything then call me.

295
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,130
Okay.

296
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,200
Once Meng Hui wakes up then I'll use the fastest method to bring her to England to meet you.

297
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,900
We'll recover the scar together

298
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,790
but if...

299
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,660
she doesn't want to go,

300
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,610
I'm still thankful.

301
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,950
Don't forget that this time I'm going to England,

302
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,820

coming to China for the rhinoplasty surgery, named Wei Lei.

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,910
I accidentally bumped my nose.

Is it severe?

310
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,620
No, no.

311
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,010
It doesn't hurt at all

312
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,470
but I'm just really worried.

313
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,050
Can you arrange a follow-up appointment for me?

314
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,570
Don't worry, Miss Wei Lei. Don't be so worry

315
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,310
Dr. Sui has been keeping us up to date regarding your case.

316

But you have to hurry because Dr. Sui is leaving for our laboratory tonight.

317
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,390
Oh right. This time, Doctor Sui is coming over here

318
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,070
to participate on a project we're working on for stem cell cartilage regeneration for nose repair.

319

for the nose?

322
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,860
Isn't he going to England to recover the scar?

323
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,710
No, we've always been discussing working together for nose surgery.

324
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,470
He kept saying that he had a lot of things to do in China

325
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,050
so he can't stay abroad.

326
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,090
This time, he took the initiative to look for us.

327
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,180
He said he wanted to specialize in rhinoplasty reconstruction.

328
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,620
I'm guessing that it's because of you.

329
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,040
I might have to go to England for a trip for a while.

330
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,610
Then, how long until you'll come back?

331
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,880
Five years.

332
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,990
♫  No one understands, no one knows   ♫

333
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,890
♫  My pain  ♫

334
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,230
Wei Lei, I must go.

335
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,700
♫  How deep it is  ♫

336
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,870
I think the Sui An you liked back then

337
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,240
should be responsible

338
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,830
and a man that can endure everything.

339
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,180
I don't think I am that man.

340
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,360
To me, you're the best person.

341
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,270
Don't worry, I'm here.

342
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,160
When I needed you the most,

343
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,830
you've always been by my side.

344
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,480
You never gave up on me.

345
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,760
♫  No more regrets ahead  ♫

346
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,940
What time is it now and you didn't go pick me up?

347
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,900
What happens if I didn't make it on time if I go to the airport alone?

348
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,140
Why are you staring at me? Don't you see me having so much luggage? Don't you know how to help me a bit?

349
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,130
Say, I have such big luggage. I don't know if it's overweight.

350
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,040
So once I get there, I need to buy skincare and cosmetics.

351
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,390
That's right and also clothes.

352
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,220
It's fine, you'll do your work and I'll play for a few days first.

353
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,650
You...

354
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,370
already knew?

355
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,760
I'm so clever. Once I thought

356
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,000
that Sui An loves me so much and is so responsible,

357
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,960
how could he leave me here because of someone else?

358
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,070
It must be because of me.

359
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,330
Actually, I never doubted you,

360
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,520
wasn't mad at you, and never thought of breaking up with you.

361
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,460
I just wanted to give you a surprise

362
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,990
and then focus on showing in front of you

363
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,530
to tell you that I want to go with you.

364
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,930
Believe it or not, whatever I wear will become a trend. Tomorrow, all the major streets and small alleys

365
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,630
will pick up this trend and recommend these shoes, clothes—

366
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,940
Wei Lei,

367
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,480
thank you.

368
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,890
Because

369
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,630
it's also important to be with you.

370
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,230
Also, who said that I'm giving up on my career?

371
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,680
I can go anywhere to make a living.

372
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,930
I can also find some time to get a postgraduate degree, to pursue my studies.

373
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,530
Don't you know Harry Potter?

374
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,240
[Half a year later]

375
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,220
Hello, everyone.

376
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,140
I am the Vice President of LS Company, Li Xiao Mei.

377
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,340
I'm really grateful today that all of you are present at LS

378
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,850
press conference for our regenerating serum.

379
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,710
This serum, in addition to using a patented formula from France,

380
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,530
we also used biotechnology,

381
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,990
to add epidermal growth factor,

382
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,660
EGF, into the serum.

383
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,680
It's main effect is to target damaged skin,

384
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,970
and reduce pigmentation and acne scars.

385
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,640
Our belief remains the same.

386
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,010
Makeup can cover up scars

387
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,460
But only love can smooth scars.

388
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,240
Thank you.

389
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,990
I already prepared everything.

390
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,870
Isn't it still early? Let's drink a cup of coffee—

391
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,370
Stop.

392
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,390
Their airplane lands at five o'clock.

393
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,040
Taking into account the time it takes on the shuttle and luggage retrieval,

394
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,000
we must arrive before five o'clock to the airport. I already prepared everything.

395
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,440
If we head over now, it'll take one hour and fifteen minutes. Today is Friday, there will be a bit of traffic.

396
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,660
so you have fifteen minutes we before we get going.

397
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,100
- Then—
- I'll buy the coffee later. Dress up and get your purse.

398
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,120
We're leaving immediately. Stop wasting time.

399
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,140
I know.

400
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,650
How come after marriage, men become so controlling.

401
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,340
Oh no, I forgot to bring hand cream.

402
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,220
Why do you have so much hand cream?

403
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,940
I originally had them.

404
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,220
But, you never brought hand cream along when you were with me.

405
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,990
I wanted to give you a chance to impress me.

406
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,740
Isn't this what you wrote in your Dating Psychology book?

407
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,210
You have to affirm your partner,

408
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,250
to let them show and let them

409
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,280
a feeling of needing and rely on each other.

410
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,410
Didn't you say in fifteen minutes we—

411
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,220
Stop trying to avoid this question on purpose.

412
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,930
Explain it to me first.

413
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,270
There's not enough time.

414
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,700
♫  Turn it around now  ♫

415
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,100
Hello.

416
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,140
Meng Hui changed her flight? I don't have to pick her up?

417
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,850
So she actually arrived yesterday but no one told me.

418
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,910
Okay.

419
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,710
Then, right now, you have a lot of time

420
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,350
to explain well.

421
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,180
♫  Turn, turn it around  ♫

422
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,940
♫  Turn it around now  ♫

423
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,540
♫  How could you deny me that  ♫

424
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,580
Say it.

425
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,230
Don't talk to me about turnover.

426
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,900
I'm not doing this to earn money.

427
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,810
So what if it earns 20 million yuan a month?

428
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,640
Aren't I still living a ¥2000 life?

429
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,130
Happiness isn't measured using money.

430
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:19,350
I'm not going to England. I went 80 or more times to England this year.

431
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,460
How much value is this event?

432
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,200
You want me to invest one billion yuan? Are you kidding me?

433
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,880
The bus is leaving the station. Please hold on tight and stay seated.

434
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,610
For those who have not swiped their card, please pay for your ticket.

435
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,480
I forgot to swipe the card.

436
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,900
I already swiped it for you.

437
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,310
You owe me ¥1.80.

438
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,800
Kiss me one more time.

439
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,140
The bus is leaving the station. Please hold on tight and stay seated.

440
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,670
For those who have not swiped their card, please pay for your ticket.

441
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,240
How is it? Isn't it nice taking a walk down memory lane?

442
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,000
Are you still hurting?

443
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I recovered very well. If you didn't mention it then I would've forgotten it long ago.

444
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,950
Let's go.

445
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,180
You want to act  as the princess?

446
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,020
You're the darkest. Why don't you act as the dark princess?

447
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,880
Can you do it?

448
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,260
Wait a second and take a look first.

449
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,000
She hasn't even tried yet. What are you guys laughing at?

450
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,040
We also didn't say much.

451
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
Just let her give it a try.

452
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,180
Okay, let her try then.

453
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:09,070
Thanks to our Channel Manager Lazarini

454
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,430
Look. Even if the kids made a mistake, they didn't do it intentionally.

455
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,420
Rather than punishing them, blaming them, hating them,

456
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,810
what is important is what kind of adult they'll become.

457
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,710
Just like you.

458

461
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,850
Do you have any plans these few days?

462
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,300
I have to visit dad and auntie tonight,

463
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,860
then handle some work at the company in a couple of days.

464
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,340
Then look at Wei Lei's live fashion show from abroad.

465
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,560
Why is your schedule so full?

466
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,100
But I'll always have time for you.

467
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,900
Then, do you have time tomorrow night?

468
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,610
What is it?

469
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,200
It's a secret.

470
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,800
Do you want to bring me to watch the fireworks?

471
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,180
Or fairy light sticks?

472
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,030
Two sticks?

473
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,710
If you finish one stick then there's another stick.

474
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,180

Thanks to all language moderators!

477
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,710
It's her. I heard that she often bullies the classmates at school.

478
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,160
That's why she got a cut on her face.

479
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,780
It's so scary so let's no longer do bad things.

480
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,050
She didn't do it.

481
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,790
She didn't bully me. She was injured in order to help me.

482
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,850
I lied.

I'm sorry.

485
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,500
It's fine. I already don't blame you anymore.

♫  The eye shadow blooms  ♫

487
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,620
♫ The blush is also laughing ♫

488
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,610
Do you think I look ugly?

489
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,660
No, you're the prettiest.
