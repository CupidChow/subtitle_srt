00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,820
Who is it?

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,260
Xing Yao, how come you're here?

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,020
I forgot to tell you.

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,570
I moved in across from you.

25
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,670
Did you drink?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,310
I had a dinner party after moving in  this afternoon.

27
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,190
In some cases, you have to drink a few cups in order to negotiate.

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,030
Good thing you didn't go

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,950
or else I would have to drink the alcohol for you.

30
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,570
I know. You...

31
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,700
can't drink alcohol.

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,930
I'm fine. I'm fine.

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,070
That...

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,310
I'm drunk. It's not convenient for me to be alone.

35
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,270
Can you help me pull my zipper?

36
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,330
Director Xu, that's too much for Shen Yi to do. Let me do it.

37
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,810
It takes me twenty minutes to reach his house. Wait for me.

38
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,460
Meng Hui, that...

39
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,970
- Turn around.
- I...

40
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,690
No, turn the phone around.

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,890
Meng Hui is here, too.

42
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,160
No need to bother.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,100
It's okay. I have Shen Yi.

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,740
Don't mind me too much.

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,040
I don't see Shen Yi as a man.

46
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,260
Thank you.

47
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,790
No, you said you couldn't take off your clothes

48
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,200
and it's not convenient for you to be alone.

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,680
That's right. I can't reach it. Look.

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,220
Then how did you put it on?

51
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,360
Perhaps I'm drunk.

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,470
I can take it off when I'm sober.

53
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,410
She left.

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,150
Do you think she's trying to provoke me?

55
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,890
Even if they're normal colleagues

56
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,810
and no matter how intimate they are, does he need to help her pull the zipper?

57
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,360
You finally understand.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
She took the initiative to move next door to Shen Yi's house to be his neighbor.

59
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,950
Are you still not going to pack up your luggage and move into Shen Yi's house

60
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,870
to announce your position?

61
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,590
Living together?

62
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,650
But it hasn't been that long since we confirmed our relationship.

63
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,480
That makes sense.

64
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,870
From a psychological perspective,

65
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,830
when the male species wants to establish a family, the first thing they'll do is build a nest.

66
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,820
Once they set up their awareness of territory,

67
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,700
it will also increase loyalty to their partners.

68
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,580
They come together to fight against the outside attacker.

69
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,960
But isn't the purpose of building a nest to keep out the cold and stay warm?

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,040
Wrong. It's to reproduce offspring.

71
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,470
Reproduce? That's not too good.

72
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,840
Hello?

73
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,940
Are you having a meeting this afternoon?

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,380
Let's go together.

75
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,390
Okay. I will go later.

76
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,020
Bye-bye.

77
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,300
You're going to his company this afternoon?

78
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,590
We're discussing the blushes.

79
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,690
This is a good chance.

80
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,050
Is Xu Xing Yao there?

81
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,490
Listen to me. Don't talk about the blushes today. Just show her.

82
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,050
Show?

83
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,020
Show off your love. Mark your territory and let everyone know

84
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,910
that you and Shen Yi are a couple.

85
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,440
I feel like this blush duo is really great.

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,850
Blushes also come in pairs now.

87
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,610
Perhaps, some blushes are still single

88
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,680
but don't be in a rush. I think they can find their pair soon.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,060
Also, look at this box. It's so tiny.

90
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,630
It can fit exactly two colors. Three is too much.

91
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,680
Miss Meng, have you ever used a gradient blush?

92
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,740
If you go to the left, it's purple

93
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,710
and if you go to the right, it's pink.

94
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,240
Whatever color it is, it depends on the mood of the brush.

95
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,160
It has nothing to do with the size of the box.

96
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,710
Are Director Meng and Director Xu still talking about the shade range?

97
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,980
It seems like they're discussing something else.

98
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,710
How come I feel like I can understand everything but can't at the same time?

99
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,160
Stop thinking about it. They're not talking about blushes.

100
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,740
Meng Hui, you decide.

101
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,610
Shen Yi, this is an important matter that involves the company's quarterly earnings.

102
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,860
I think it's best we don't let our emotions affect our decisions.

103
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,800
But I made this blush to give it to Meng Hui as a gift.

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,360
I don't care whether we profit or not.

105
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,940
- Did I never mention it?
- No.

106
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,050
You really didn't.

107
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,390
I said it now.

108
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,270
Boss is awesome.

109
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,560
How was it? You showed your love. What was Xu Xing Yao's reaction?

110
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,330
She was so disgusted by Shen Yi that she threw up.

111
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,700
Eat one.

112
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,610
Thank you.

113
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,270
When I was drinking, I didn't think so much.

114
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,690
It might delay work these few days.

115
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,390
Your health is more important than work.

116
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,750
It's so tasty.

117
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,940
I don't know how to thank you.

118
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,470
Are you talking about the congee?

119
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,470
You don't have to thank me. Meng Hui made it.

120

This isn't right.

125
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,450
I drank too much from pulling all-nighters.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,300
Forget it.

127
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,510
You don't seem like someone who takes care of people.

128
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,750
People usually take care of you.

129
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,900
Anyways, I'm like that.

130
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,810
If I have a fever, throwing up, or something's wrong

131
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,730
I will drink this.

132
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,450
It's probably because I think it works and I feel better after drinking some medicine.

133
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,650
Then... do people not take care of you when you get sick often?

How come you didn't bring it to Meng Hui?

It's not good to give her half discounted food.

Look, she left it with me.

Stop eating meat. If you get chubby then you have to get skinner.

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,190
like she's keeping you company to buy groceries.

161
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,120
Then... how should I say it so that she won't misunderstand?

162
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,420
I just want to take care of her. I don't want her to think I have any intentions.

163
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,570
Don't you?

164
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,790
I...

165
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,700
I... Of course, I don't.

166
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,770
Shen Yi, I don't agree with you guys living together right now.

167
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,710
Why?

168
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,370
Are you sure you like Meng Hui and it has nothing to do with the girl that has a scar?

169
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm sure.

170
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,400
I recognized the wrong person before.

171
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,410
Sometimes, I think that it's a good thing Meng Hui isn't her

172
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:14,030
or else I couldn't tell the difference on how I feel about Meng Hui.

173
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,530
Say, what if...

174
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,820
I'm saying what if,

175
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,660
the girl I love is the person that I hurt,

176
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,470
I would be in pain.

177
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,180
I want to tell you...

178
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,970
Forget it. Let me think about it.

179
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,670
What is it?

180
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,460
Nothing. Eat. I'm hungry.

181
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,950
What do I do, Wei Lei? I think Shen Yi is going to mention about us living together today.

182
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,140
Say, should I immediately promise him or wait and see?

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,340
Listen to me. Be persistent.

184
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,490
Let him mention it three times.

185
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,870
Here.

186
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,640
Today, you came to tell me something?

187
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,740
Yes.

188
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,290
Then, are you going to say it?

189
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,570
You...

190
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,190
You...

191
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,710
What's your opinion on climate warming?

192
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,130
I mean global warming.

193
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,210
The penguins at the South Pole are about to lose their habitats.

194
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,260
What should they do?

195
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,320
Isn't it enough for you to donate to a children charity?

196
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,700
You want to support environmental protection as well?

197
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,040
No, I wanted to ask

198
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,770
if penguin should live somewhere else.

199
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,590
Are you saying that you want to help the penguin find a new home?

200
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,660
I think... penguins are suitable to live with polar bears.

201
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,250
They can take care of each other.

202
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,630
Then...

203
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,540
But the polar bear suddenly goes to pick up the penguin. What happens if he gets rejected?

204
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,240
That's right.

205
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,420
He keeps hinting and doesn't want to say it directly.

206
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,100
This is too much! He's waiting for you to say it.

207
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,580
So what the polar bear meant is that it wants the penguin to mention that they want to live together

208
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,900
that way the polar bear won't be afraid of getting rejected.

209
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,440
That isn't what I meant.

210
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,270
It's just that polar bear and penguin haven't known each other for a long time.

211
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,570
Polar bear doesn't know if living together is too soon, penguin

212
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,900
would think it's not appropriate.

213
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,540
I think penguin knows polar bear's good intentions.

214
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,440
Being together is to take care of the penguin even better.

215
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,270
Also, penguin knows that polar bear has a lot of worries and not willing to mention it

216
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,200
but to penguin, the problems that polar bear are thinking aren't problems.

217
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,140
Because penguin really understand polar bear's heart.

218
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,180
So the polar bear doesn't have to be afraid that penguin will misunderstand

219
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,970
because to penguin, polar bear is a very good...

220
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,110
companion.

221
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,160
Does penguin really think that?

222
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,620
I think... so.

223
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,590
Let's go then.

224
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,690
Go where?

225
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,340
Let's go help penguin move her house. Hurry.

226
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,850
Then let's start packing up now.

227
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,470
He came to help me move.

228
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,730
Monster. I bet he planned this a long time ago.

229
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,100
Done. See if there's anything else you need to bring.

230
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
You finished already?

231
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,590
My Pikachu slippers, Cinnamoroll pajamas, Hello Kitty cushion

232
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,380
and my diffuser light. You didn't take any of them!

233
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,990
Your luggage is so tiny. How can it fit my whole house?

234
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,060
Don't worry. The North Pole has everything.

235
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,250
I've gone to the North Pole before. There really isn't anything.

236
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,490
Go take a look now. There's really everything. Let's go.

237
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,830
Oh.

239
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,740

240
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,460
Let's go.

[Love House]

242
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,320
When did you put this up?

243
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,880
These past few days.

244
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,330
Let me go put the luggage away.

245
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,540
He set up the room?

246
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,030
- How did you know?
- Did he also prepare couple slippers?

247
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,720
- Yes.
- Then the next step is to tell you to change your clothes.

248
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,350
I prepare this especially for you. You will feel more comfortable when you wear this.

249
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,800
- Okay.
- Hurry and go change.

250
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,800
Did he also prepare couple toothbrushes?

251
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,280
Let me tell you. You probably did something with the faucet, too.

252
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,800
It's going to leak and put you in a very embarrassing situation. Your clothes are going to be soaking wet, and then he'll show up.

253
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,830

Wait for me.

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,190
Wasn't what I said, right?

262
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,730
Did you install a security camera at Shen Yi's place? How come you know everything?

263
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,980
Let me tell you. This is all scripted.

269
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,030
Then what are you going to wear?

270
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,470
It doesn't matter if I wear something or not.

271
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,950
You're not wearing anything?

272
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,230
Change into it. I will go make the bed.

273
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,650
Make the bed?

274
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,990
What are you guys doing now?

275
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,970
He's going to make the bed and I'm changing my clothes.

Oh my god! The wild beast is finally appearing.

277

Are you done?

279
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,510
Almost!

280
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,070
Wait a second.

281
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,940
Your house only has one room, right?

282
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,020
That's right.

283
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,600
Then... is it only one bed?

284
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,180
No, it can't be considered that.

285
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,500
What's wrong? Are you not used to it?

286
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,620
I will think of another way then.

287
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,790
It's fine. I will get used to it.

288
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,280
Really?

289
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,710
Meng Hui, how come you're not replying to me?

290
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,690
Let me tell you. Don't fall into Shen Yi's trap!

291
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,720
- He's just consumed by lust and wants to trick you into bed–
- Wei Lei?

292
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,180
Wait a second. Raise it up.

293
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,580
What did I see?

294
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,640
Shen Yi, you're really amazing. You guys are already living together

295
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,940
and only have one bed? Shen Yi, are you even a man?

296
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,280
This isn't right. Shen Yi, you're really a man.

297
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,790
Sweet dreams. I'll stop here. Bye-bye.

298
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,020
Then I'm turning off the lights.

299
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,960
Goodnight.

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,540
Goodnight.

301
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,480
Do you like it? I prepared it for you.

302
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,100
Get some sleep.

303
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,650
You need to adjust this color some more.

304
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,390
I want the prettiest shade of pink in the entire world.

305
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,690
These are all too flashy.

306
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,420
Then do you have any requests?

307
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,790
It's...

308
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,230
The prettiest shade of pink in the world

309
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,830
is when a girl is shy,

310
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,230
scarlet red that emits from within.

311
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,520
That's the color I want.

312
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,010
Do you understand?

313
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,710
It looks like you guys don't understand. Think about it.

314
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,010
How he said it, it is quite romantic.

315
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,350
The way he described it was also very touching.

316
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,080
But from a practical standpoint, that's the same as asking for a colorful black.

317
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,730
Am I supposed to do it based on feelings when I make it?

318
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,190
You don't understand this.

319
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,600
When you have time, go ask Miss Meng.

320
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,230
Now you mention it, you're clever.

321
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,280
Shen Yi.

322
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,410
You just came back?

323
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,920
- That's right.
- Shen Yi, you're back.

324
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,140
Director Xu is also here.

325
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,650
I just moved in and I'm eating dumplings today.

326
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,170
I haven't bought vinegar yet. Can you lend me some?

327
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,980
Okay.

328
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,890
What do I do? I feel like I'm going to fail.

329
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,620
Are you dumb? She's borrowing vinegar from you then borrow dumplings for her.

330
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,320
Shen Yi?

331
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,350
Did you come to get the vinegar? I finished using it.

332
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm returning this back to you.

333
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,300
Actually, I didn't come to get the vinegar.

334
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,220
Meng Hui wants to eat dumplings and we were going to order takeout

335
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,950
but I don't want her to wait too long so I wanted to borrow some dumplings from you.

336
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,240
I... I don't have dumplings.

337
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,890
If you don't have dumplings then why are you borrowing vinegar?

338
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,450
But is it okay for me to do this? Will it make Shen Yi be in a hard position?

339
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,050
They're coworkers after all.

340
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,310
Also Xu Xing Yao liking Shen Yi, well that is her problem

341
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,340
but Shen Yi treats me well.

342
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,030
Making him stuck between us

343
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,410
isn't too good, right?

344
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,390
Are you looking for me?

345
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,970
Have a seat.

346
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,820
You already know that the patent we want was bought by someone else.

347
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,230
We need to find new supporting technology

348
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,600
so you need to go to France to keep negotiating.

349
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,080
No problem. You understand me.

350
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,310
It's my skill to negotiate.

351
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,380
Oh right. How long do I have to stay this time?

352
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,630
Half a year to one year.

353
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,320
Shen Yi, why are you suddenly like this?

354
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:50,190
Did you misunderstand something from last night or was it Meng Hui?

355
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,650
Xing Yao, do you like me?

356
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,450
It's nothing like that.

357
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,480
Don't think nonsense. It's a misunderstanding from moving.

358
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,680
I'm actually going to move soon.

359
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,020
I won't borrow vinegar from you in the future anyways.

360
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,360
Let Meng Hui be at ease.

361
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,270
Dr. Sui, long time no see.

362
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,340
Do you need something?

363
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,420
You forgot our promise that fast?

364
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,850
Don't you only need whitening injections once every thirty days?

365
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,670
It's not time yet.

366
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,780
I'm here today for a tanning treatment.

367
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,610
You just got the whitening injection last week. Now you're here for tanning.

368
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,570
Are you trying to become a zebra?

369
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,610
My time is limited. Go find another doctor if you want to do anything.

370
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,970
I bought your post surgery care, whitening injections, skin booster injections, laser surgery and anti-aging procedures.

371
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,100
I'm about to become your hospital's shareholder.

372
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,760
Can't you take care of me more?

373
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,780
- Miss Wei, today I have—
- Are you avoiding me?

374
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,270
Can't you tell that I like you?

375
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,370
What do you like about me? That you can get a discount for plastic surgery?

376
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,010
Tanning is bad for your skin. You should reconsider.

377
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,950
Are you worrying about me?

378
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,400
How come you don't like me?

379
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,150
Is it because I'm not beautiful enough?

380
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,110
You're really beautiful

381
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,420
but I can meet seven beautiful girls like you every day.

382
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,570
My job is to help those with facial defects.

383
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,890
For example, those children with congenital cleft lips.

384
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,050
And also, those whose appearances were damaged in accidents and reconstructed.

385
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:44,280
And not for those assembly line products which transform an individual's aesthetics into public aesthetics.

386
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,320
Don't waste your time on me.

387
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,630
You're not the type I like.

388
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,680
Do you know how many  people are chasing me?

389
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,840
Then how come you don't look for someone that likes you?

390
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,160
Because I don't dare to.

391
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,910
I'm afraid that they will ask what I looked like back then

392
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,870
and what I will look like in the future.

393
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,210
Only when I'm with you can I let go of all my restraints.

394
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,480
I don't have to worry about the day that I will be exposed

395
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,030
or the day I become ugly and old.

396
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,590
Sometimes, I really envy Meng Hui.

397
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,430
She has Shen Yi and no matter what she changes into,

398
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,760
she doesn't have to be afraid.

399
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,230
I cried so beautifully.

400
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,070
I don't know if he felt moved or not.

401
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,340
For someone like you with long narrow eyes, European double eyelids are not suitable.

402
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,640
If you really want it, these Korean double eyelids are more suitable for you.

403
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,370
No, I want this kind.

404
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,540
You're Wei Lei. I've seen you on television. You're prettier in person compared to television.

405
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,340
I want to do this kind.

406
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,210
Which doctor should I book for a consultation?

407
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,300
You actually have really beautiful eyes. They're long and narrow.

408
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,070
It matches your face.

409
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,550
Even if you want to do this, it doesn't suit you.

410
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,350
But I want to do this.

411
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,480
The 7mm kind.

412
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,080
Let's do it for her then.

413
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,860
But...

414
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,890
There are all kinds of beauty on this planet.

415
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,760
There is no mainstream or non-mainstream,

416
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,880
outdated or popular. The ones you find beautiful might not even find themselves beautiful.

417
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,650
Everyone wants to chase after the beauty that they want.

418
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,730
Is that so wrong?

419
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,250
She even knows how many millimeters she wants. That means she did her research.

420
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,230
Let's do like this.

421
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,650
Right, I want this kind. My boyfriend likes it.

422
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,900
Wait a second.

423
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,040
You're doing single eyelids for your boyfriend?

424
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,350
No. What are you doing?

425
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,860
If it's for yourself thinking that it's pretty

426
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,090
then I support whatever change you do.

427
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,070
But if you're doing it to please others like pleasing your boyfriend,

428
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,060
I advise you to reconsider it.

429
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,830
Are you saying that because you don't have a boyfriend?

430
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,320
If your boyfriend is only with you because of your European double eyelids,

431
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,550
then do you think he likes you

432
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,130
or your double eyelids?

433
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,720
I...

434
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,640
Sui An, my brother.

435
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,090
Wei Lei, my best friend.

436
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,730
Dr. Sui, do you think it's a coincidence?

437
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,260
I already said I'd stop bothering you,

438
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,310
but we keep meeting.

439
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,760
Fate is such a wonderful thing.

440
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,670
Thank you.

441
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,630
This is yours.

442
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,560
Sui An is used to taking care of me.

443
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,470
You're my girlfriend, so he's extending his love.

444
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,280
If he's really extending his love, then he should take care of this ex-girlfriend as well.

445
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,360
- Let's go fix our makeup.
- Okay.

446
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,980
Sui An, Wei Lei isn't a bad person.

447
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,440
I know. I was too biased towards her before.

448
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,720
If you're afraid that I'll be awkward, then that's not necessary.

449
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,390
We're not considered anything.

450
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,570
Don't miss out on it because of me.

451
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,290
Forget it.

452
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,900
You're so ungenerous when complimenting other girls.

453
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,180
Because... I can only see good things about Meng Hui.

454
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,740
Oh right. I invited you out to eat today because I had something important to give you.

455
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,450
Take a look at it when you have time.

456
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,590
What is it?

457
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,410
You may have different ideas after reading it.

458
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,870
Hello?

459
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,740
A visitor? For me?

460
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,310
Why are you here?

461
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,410
If I still don't come,

462
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,440
then I'm afraid I would be a grandpa and still wouldn't know.

463
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,940
Isn't that normal?

464
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,380
You didn't know when you became a dad that year.

465
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,700
Look at this. This is your Uncle Wang's niece.

466
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,100
They are a family of scholars. I met her before.

467
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,700
She is sweet-tempered and very elegant.

468
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,170
If you don't like her, this is Uncle Liu's nephew.

469
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,990
How come it's a man?

470
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,210
I took the wrong one.

471
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,440
Take a look. There are so many ladies here.

472
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,270
They are all a suitable match for you in terms of social status.

473
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,130
The ones you pick from here will be stronger than the one you already chose.

474
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,990
If you insist on doing this,

475
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,130
then you might never have a grandchild.

476
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,140
I think the two of you aren't suitable.

477
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,240
Why?

478
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,480
That troublesome Meng Hui, no matter what, I won't accept her

479
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,830
as our Qian Shan Group's daughter-in-law.

480
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,370
I'm not even admitting that I'm your son.

481
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,730
She won't be Qian Shan Group's daughter-in-law.

482
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,760
The fact that we're related by blood,

483
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,550
you can't deny that.

484
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,910
How do you know

485
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,830
the decision that you made is right?

486
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,140
That Meng Hui and you walked until today

487
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,150
because of that scar.

488
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,540
Shen Yi, let it go.

489
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,150
I already investigated.

490
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,750
She graduated from Chong Hai's No.1 primary school.

491
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,350
She isn't the girl that you harmed.

492
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:03,060
If you don't trust me then look for yourself. I have documents here.

493
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,640
You recognized the wrong person.

494
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,390
I knew long ago. I'm with her

495
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,120
because I like her and not because of that scar.

496
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,510
Then since you know,

497
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,980
how come you're still facing that scar?

498
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,230
You can choose a better girl.

499
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:26,220
Let me tell you once again. I'm with her because I like her and not the scar.

500
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,790
That's because you don't understand being human.

501
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,870
Let me ask you. If one day,

502
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,100
that girl that you hurt

503
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,900
stood in front of you and you saw the scar on her face,

504
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,730
will you still be this adamant

505
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,100
and think Meng Hui is still the most important person?

506
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,790
What do you mean?

507
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,810
Let me tell you again. The lab that you contacted from France,

508
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,000
I already bought all of them.

509
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,450
What?

510
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,670
If you keep arguing with me,

511
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,940
even if I have to let this technology become toilet paper,

512
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,360
I wouldn't save any for you.

513
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,990
What do you want me to do?

514
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,610
It's very simple. Break up with her.

515
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,440
The patent for the technology for plasma protein repair

516
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,270
or Meng Hui. Pick one yourself.

517
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,680
Reconsider it.

518
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:35,590

00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,490
Blush can act as camouflage.

520
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:47,490
It adds a layer of shyness on top of authentic emotions,

521
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,250
but sometimes if the camouflage is too intense,

522
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,910
we can't see the truth.

523
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,060
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

524
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:05,110
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

525
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:09,790
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

526
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,280
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

527
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:24,270
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

528
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:30,420
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

529
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:39,140
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

530
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:44,020
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

531
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:53,560
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

532
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:59,430
♫  Leading me  ♫

533
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:04,800
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

534
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,590
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

535
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:24,240
