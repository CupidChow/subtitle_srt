21
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,930
What is your occupation?

22
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,710
A freelancer. I evaluate beauty products.

23
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,900
I will usually accept endorsements.

24
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,610
A jobless displaced person.

25
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,810
I'm also trying to be a makeup artist and I went on a television show before.

26
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,050
A service-type business.

27
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,010
I also work part-time at LS Beauty as a consultant

28
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,980
and give them professional advice.

29
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,150
Turns out that you're relying on Shen Yi.

30
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,140
It should've hurt back then.

31
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,280
I already forgot

32
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,090
but I think that people who see this scar

33
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,240
would think that I was in pain back then.

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,470
Scars bring people fear.

35
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,190
Sometimes, it's because it provides people with a lot of mental association.

36
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,970
Mental association?

37
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,520
Say, Shen Yi faces the scar on your face every day,

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,080
would he have any mental association?

39
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,010
Is this a vegetable or a fruit?

40
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,250
Avocado is a member of the flowering plant family Lauraceae.

41
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,810
It's a kind of fruit.

42
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,940
Since it's a fruit,

43
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,900
then why is it mixed with the vegetables?

44
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,760
Uncle, there are thousands of fruits in this world.

45
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,270
There isn't a rule that fruits should be grown in a certain way. You can try to understand it.

46
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,980
Why should I understand it?

47
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,140
I can find a nutritious vegetable.

48
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,300
I don't understand you but I know

49
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,340
Shen Yi likes to eat avocado.

50
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,260
You're a clever girl. From what I know about Shen Yi,

51
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,930
even if you follow him for a lifetime,

52
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,490
he won't give you this much money.

53
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,050
Why don't you immediately leave him and get this amount of money?

54
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,640
You don't understand Shen Yi or me that well.

55
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,110
That's because you don't understand money.

56

You're still very young right now.

65
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,820
is real love.

He gave a big sum. He's not afraid I will buy another patent?

But we're not lacking money right now but technique.

75

If we don't have the technique, it will be difficult to create the scar whitening essence.

Don't you think our son is angry at you?

He's complaining that my life is too long and he's helping me to reduce it by a few years.

Stop caring about how the money was spent.

Shen Yi's girlfriend calls you dad then doesn't that mean

111

Shen Yi will call you dad too?

Why are you so firm?

115

This lifetime, what I regret the most

116
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,190
is not being by Shen Yi's side that year

117
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,700
and being responsible as a dad.

118
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,860
Shen Yi was young back then

119
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,510
and accidentally hurt the girl.

120

He encountered trouble and had no one to rely on.

121
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,120
Half of his life

122
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,060
was lived with regrets and being scared.

123
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,110
Do I want the other half of his life to be lived like that as well?

124
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,850
If every day he's with Meng Hui and sees the scar on her face

125
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,530
then we're forcing him every day

126
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,400
To think about what happened when he was young...

127
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,270
Qian Shan, you have to use another method.

128
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,020
Shen Yi will understand your reasons.

129
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,280
You're awake.

Did I disturb you?

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,550
What time is it? You already woke up to do your makeup.

132
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,070
It takes me a long time to do makeup. I need two hours to completely cover the scar.

133
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,790
Stop doing your makeup.

134
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,550
You're not going to work today. Let's go sleep.

135
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,210
Stop messing around. I'm almost finished.

136
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,470
Sleep for a while and I'll go make breakfast.

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,100
What a nice spread.

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
You're not eating?

141
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,600
I already ate.

142
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,900
Okay.

143
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
It's so tasty.

144
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
Do you have something to say?

145
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
No.

146
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
But the look on your face right now is just like Uncle Shen

147
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,900
written "I have words to say."

148
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,400
Meng Hui, no matter who you meet,

149
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,300
do you have to wake up two hours earlier to do your makeup?

150
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm already used to it.

151
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Do you really care about that scar

152
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,200
or are you afraid of seeing the scar?

153
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,110
No.

154
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
Actually, because of this scar

155
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
or when you have no makeup on, I won't think you're not pretty

156
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
so in the future when you're home,

157
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,100
can you not do your makeup?

158
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
Why?

159
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,300
Because I want you to sleep for two more hours.

160
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,140
Do you really not mind?

161
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,190
Thank you, I will reconsider.

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,400
I will go to work then.

163
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
- Bye.
- Be careful.

164
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I already understand that women right now don't know anything based...

165
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
based on what–

166
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
- Give me the opportunity.
- No.

167
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
- But you should give me the opportunity...
- Give me the money first.

168
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,000
- Why am I so unlucky today?
- I'm sorry.

169
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Director Shen.

170
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's fine. Let me do it.

171
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
[Name: Xia Yan]

172
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,100
[Educational History]

173
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,800
Who is this?

174
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,200
A young lady who came for the interview.

175
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,400
I don't know where she got the news that we're recruiting.

176
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,000
Totally ignorant. No learning experience and ability.

177
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,800
Her personality is sensitive and weak.

178
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,400
Youngsters nowadays have big hearts.

179
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Here, these are the ones that passed today.

180
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Did she leave?

181
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,700
Not yet.

182
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,000
She's still talking to the product manager because she wants samples.

183
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She's really something. Forget that she failed the interview. She even tried to get samples from us.

184
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,600
Do another interview.

185
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,000
But she doesn't have the ability and一

186
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,500
I will personally interview this person.

187
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Manager, just give it to me.

188
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
This won't do. Don't casually touch those.

189
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,400
You guys already used it so you wouldn't want them.

190
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
These have already been used.

191
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
These are already expired.

192
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,000
Even if they're expired, it's the company's.

193
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Miss Xia.

194
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Sister, you can just call me Xiao Ba.

195
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Miss Xiao Ba, from your resume

196
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,600
you had no experience from the cosmetics industry, right?

197
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
No, these makeup products

198
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I have experience using them.

199
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,800
Then do you understand our company?

200
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I understand. I really understand it.

201
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,800
The company's product is just a bit expensive so I can't afford them

202
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,000
but I've brought the single products before.

203
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Thank you for your recognition

204
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
but we're discussing about techniques.

205
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
I also know techniques about the products.

206
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,200
I... when I do my eyebrows with one hand, I never shake.

207
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,100
I can finish doing my lipsticks in two steps.

208
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,100
Did you graduate from Xiao San Elementary School in Jiangbei?

209
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,000
She even went to elementary school for seven years.

210
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,400
Seven years?

211
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,700
Why did you study for seven years?

212
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,700
What's going on?

213
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
What did you say?

214
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,700
I'm sorry.

215
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,400
Can I sit down?

216
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,500
Please have a seat.

217
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm very sorry.

218
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,000
I was too excited just then.

219
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,700
Something big happened when I was young

220
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,200
and then I got hurt.

221
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,000
I had no choice. I could only stay behind.

222
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
It's fine.

223
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,400
I... I'm much better. It's nothing big.

224
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
People should move forward, right?

225
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,100
Miss Xiao Ba, we already sympathize your experience

226
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,200
but our company requires a professional degree and patience.

227
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,100
How come you had no job longer than one year when you grew up?

228
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,800
That's because...

229
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's because...

230
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They complain that I'm ugly and don't like me.

231
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
- Her tears are fake.
- And then...

232
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
they're not willing to get along with me so they fired me.

233
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Our apologies. We sympathize with your bad encounters

234
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
but I'm very sorry that

235
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,900
you don't meet our company's lowest standard of requirements.

236
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,000
- I still hope you一
- Come to work tomorrow.

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,500
- This一
- Director Shen.

238
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,300
President Shen, think twice.

239
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,400
You're the CEO's assistant.

240
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
What?

241
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,600
This...

242
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,800
Boss, is there nothing hard being the CEO's assistant in your heart?

243
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,600
You've misunderstood. It's a very special job

244
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,100
so I gave it to you.

245
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,600
Gave it to me? This...

246
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,400
But my job doesn't need to be completed by two people.

247
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,000
That... I want to ask...

248
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,200
Was I recruited?

249
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
No way.

250
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
No way.

251
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm very sorry. I was too stirred up just then.

252
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Director Shen, don't worry. I will work even harder.

253
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
This has nothing to do with hard work.

254
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,800
I hope we won't miss any unnoticed talent again.

255
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,700
These years...

256
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,480
Did you live well?

257
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,500
That... I drank too much water. I have to go to the bathroom.

258
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,600
Enough. Let's go.

259
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
I will let you get familiar with your work.

260
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
This way please.

261
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,800
Let's go.

262
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,400
You're back.

263
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,360
How did it go? Were there any surprises with the recruit?

264
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,700
It's was alright.

265
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,000
Your expression seems weird.

266
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,900
Does it look bad?

267
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,200
It's just like I cooked some unpalatable food for you and it's hard to swallow.

268
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,800
Even if I don't like eating it, I will still eat it. I passed the age of being picky.

269
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,200
Then... Will you eat chili?

270
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,400
I won't eat it. I will get pimples easily.

271
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,900
You even said that you weren't picky.

272
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,530
Meng Hui,

273
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,000
can you give me some of your silicone scar treatment sheets,

274
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
concealer and scar-fading oil?

275
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Okay.

276
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,900
Are you going to use it to do research on your scar essence and liquid foundation?

277
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,290
Yes.

278
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,400
Okay, I will send it to the company for you tomorrow.

279
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
No need.

280
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,600
Meng Hui, don't go to the company during this time.

281
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm afraid that you'll be too tired.

282
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,400
Assistant Xiao Ba, these documents have been in your tray for a whole day.

283
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,200
I hope you can get them earlier next time.

284
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,100
You already delivered them to me.

285
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,400
If the documents are urgent

286
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,600
then you must give them to me directly so I can give them to Director Shen

287
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,100
or things will be delayed, okay?

288
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,100
All these documents are urgent documents.

289
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm just asking you to take them out and give them to Director Shen.

290
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,000
You can't even do such a simple task?

291
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Please look at my high heels.

292
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,200
It's lambskin.

293
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,200
If I always walk then the bottom of the shoe will get ruined.

294
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,800
Also, my heels are 8cm high.

295
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,000
Doing this every day...

296
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,800
it will affect Director Shen's work

297
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
so I have to trouble you.

298
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,800
I told you to copy the contract. What did you do?

299
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,300
This is the contract that you told to copy.

300
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,000
Do you know these are the important contracts for LS's next season?

301
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Is this your work attitude?

302
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,400
I'm merely reducing the papers for the company.

303
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
I told you to make copies

304
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,800
and you're reading novels during work hours?

305
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,400
This... This... What happened?

306
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Assistant Jiang, take care of your people.

307
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,500
[Overbearing CEO and his overtime]

308
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Sorry, sorry.

309
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
I didn't observe well.

310
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,400
Ease your anger and I will make another copy then send it to you.

311
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,500
Look at the documents I just sent you. Adjust the fonts.

312
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,600
Adjust it's font size from five to four and send it to Director Shen. Okay?

313
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Director Shen can just read this. Why must the font size be adjusted?

314
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,600
This is where you're wrong.

315
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,000
As assistants, we need to have a serving attitude.

316
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You being like this is only causing people trouble.

317
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,300
I feel that it's troublesome for me just to adjust the font size.

318
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,800
Everyone has a different position.

319
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,600
You're an assistant right now. What?

320
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,000
Are you hoping that Director Shen will work for you?

321
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,600
I already organized the files.

322
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,660
Director Shen, you personally took care of these?

323
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,400
The Human Resources Department just called me to say you didn't go there to accept the job.

324
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,200
What is going on?

325
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,200
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

326
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,100
When I was walking,

327
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,200
I stepped on dirt along the way.

328
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,300
I was afraid of this since I was young.

329
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,000
The lady from the Human Resources Department has already lectured me

330
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and Assistant Jiang...

331
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,400
I didn't know. I was just teaching her how to be an assistant.

332
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,000
How come she ended up crying?

333
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,400
Pay attention to your manners when you speak?

334
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
Manners?

335
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,800
Wait, this too.

336
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Put this away.

337
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,200
Keep this.

338
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,200
What are you guys doing?

339
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Director Shen instructed that all sharp objects must be removed from the desks.

340
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
- Take them all away?
- Yes.

341
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,700
Do you know what those are?

342
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,900
This... is a product that Director Shen brought back from abroad.

343
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,800
We need to remove this, too.

344
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,600
As for this, this is our trophy for the patent for LS.

345
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
Director Shen also said

346
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,450
all these desks' sharp corners

347
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,200
need to be taped.

348
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,600
Which table doesn't have corners?

349
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,000
What? Is she raising children at the company?

350
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Tape this as well.

351
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,000
Take this.

352
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,400
This is a right angle.

353
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,200
- It's sharp?
- It's a right angle.

354
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,400
It's sharp.

355
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,700
Don't you think this is similar to the past?

356
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,600
Director Shen is playing with fire.

357
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,100
Just like fire,

358
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,800
he will burn himself sooner or later.

359
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
Stop talking.

360
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,660
Hello, Ah Tao.

361
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,200
I think I've been bullied.

362
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm sorry, Director Shen.

363
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,100
Since young till now, I don't have many interactions with others.

364
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,400
Then... These years, how did you live?

365
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,800
Just...

366
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,590
I have to live on even if I'm sad.

367
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,200
Even though I say I'm used to it,

368
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,800
but sometimes I think,

369
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,800
if my face didn't have this scar

370
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,000
then will my life be better?

371
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,600
Perhaps, I can have some friends.

372
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Do you not have friends?

373
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,800
Who is willing to get along with me?

374
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,900
Are you willing to see this face everyday?

375
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,970
Why wouldn't I be willing to?

376
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,600
When everyone sees a scar, they have fear.

377
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,500
Looking at it

378
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,660
reminds them of bad things.

379
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Then... have you thought about covering the scar?

380
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,200
You said that your makeup techniques aren't that bad.

381
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,600
So... if you take some time every day then it wouldn't be hard to do.

382
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,400
I... kept exposing this scar because I was thinking

383
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,200
that there will be someone in this world

384
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,400
that is willing to accept my look.

385
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,600
They are also willing to understand and get close to me.

386
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,300
They might think I'm also cute, right?

387
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,900
[Proposal]

388
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Miss Meng Hui, it's an honor to collaborate with you this time.

389
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,200
I heard that after the company accepted the endorsement,

390
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,800
they highly valued it. After looking at your proposal,

391
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
they're very satisfied.

392
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
I will definitely do it till perfection.

393
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,200
So if there's anything that needs to be added or changed then tell me directly.

394
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
No, it's all good.

395
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,800
Then if it's all good

396
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,900
then we wouldn't be meeting this time, right?

397
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,400
In order to set apart our product's features from the rest,

398
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,400
and for a marketing effect, we have a presumptuous request.

399
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,300
Which is when you film can you...

400
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,900
After all, everyone has their unique qualities.

401
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,400
What you mean is

402
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
to let me reveal my scar when I film the video?

403
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,600
That's right. I hope you don't mind.

404
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
It's fine. I didn't mind a long time ago.

405
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,700
So are you agreeing to it?

406
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,340
I hope we can collaborate next time.

407
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Meng Hui.

408
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
Have a sit.

409
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,500
Why are you sitting here?

410
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,400
I passed by a bakery shop and I brought it for you.

411
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,300
Didn't you not let me go in? So, I waited outside.

412
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,400
Thank you.

413
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,800
Why did you put on makeup today?

414
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,700
I met a client.

415
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,800
Was it the proposal I saw before?

416
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,600
How did it go? There wasn't any problems, right?

417
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I didn't accept it.

418
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,000
They want me to reveal my scar when I film the video

419
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,200
so I rejected.

420
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Scars are pain after all. I don't want people to be sad when they see it

421
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,400
and don't want your heart to ache because of me.

422
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,200
Even though I know you don't mind how I look

423
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,200
but why should I let the person that loves me have lots of troubles?

424
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,270
Okay, let's go home.

425
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,300
There's no work tomorrow.

426
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,500
Let's go.

427
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,800
The cake.

428
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,960
Why do you look like life has taken its toll on you?

429
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,900
It's only 8 am.

430
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,220
Thinking about what Xiao Ba is going to do today,

431
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,460
my mind is weak and I don't want to go to work.

432
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,370
Turns out the highest level of being an assistant is to make your boss fearful of your work.

433
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:25,350
That way, your workload will decrease. Is that right?

434
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,360
Hearing that you said Xiao Ba had an accident during her childhood

435
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,300
but she faces life, doesn't care about what others say,

436
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,060
full of love, hope, and is a happy girl. Right?

437
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,000
That's right. Every time I talk to her,

438
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,460
she will only say a few lines then mention her accident during her childhood.

439
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,080
She repeats that she doesn't mind.

440
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,240
Even thought she experiences a lot of darkness before

441
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,990
but she still hopes that she can make friends

442
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,100
but when we really want to be her friend,

443
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,460
she was arrogant and declined us.

444
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,560
- It seems weird.
- It is weird.

445
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,870
A person who experienced an accident,

446
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,020
they won't easily talk about this repeatedly.

447
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,870
If she's really a happy girl,

448
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,940
she should have resolved her feelings and be at peace.

449
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,920
Things like making it hard for her coworkers

450
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,440
and being lazy won't be part of her habits.

451
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,730
Do you understand what I mean?

452
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,260
That's right. We didn't even put her in a hard position.

453
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,120
We're not telling her what to do.

454
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,140
There are many instances where we already helped her complete the tasks.

455
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,160
In the end, she still said that everyone is alienating her.

456
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,690
No one is willing to talk to her now. We're afraid that we will get scammed.

457
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,430
Think about it carefully.

458
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,890
Is this state right now like what she said,

459
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,170
that everyone is bullying her but she's really strong and acts like she doesn't mind.

460
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,790
This is the result she wants.

461
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,940
Then say, why is she doing this?

462
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,740
Is she deliberating making us alienate her to make Shen Yi sympathize with her?

463
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,420
Then what you mean is that she's faking it?

464
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,960
This is the report of the cosmetics industry of ten years.

465
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,700
These are all of the cases LS has worked on since establishment.

466
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,580
I have already organized these for you. Place these in the folders in the table.

467
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,560
If you have time then you can learn more.

468
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,110
Actually, they're avoiding you not because they hate you.

469
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,730
They just want to finish their work faster.

470
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,330
I-I didn't say that I'm blaming everyone.

471
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,140
After all, I...

472
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,510
This is the copy and scanner in the company.

473
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,000
These are the instructions and protocols for each of the various functions.

474
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,710
Also, a beginner's guide to Microsoft Office.

475
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,840
If you don't understand something then you can come look for me.

476
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,210
Do you have any more troubles? I can teach you them.

477
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,700
No one has treated me this well before.

478
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,540
Director Shen, you helped me organized all this

479
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,340
so it must of wasted a lot of your time.

480
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,570
Why don't I treat you to a meal

481
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,780
in order to thank you?

482
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,450
No need. My girlfriend is still at home waiting for me to go back and eat.

483
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,070
You have a girlfriend?

484
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,480
I envy her.

485
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,460
I also want to date

486
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,690
but... I don't even have friends

487
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,050
so not to even mention someone to eat with.

488
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,700
Okay, let's eat tonight.

489
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,070
Hello, Meng Hui.

490
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:39,890
Can I bring someone to eat tonight?

491
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:45,310
Actually, I always thought

492
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,730
if I should introduce her to you.

493
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,710
I invited someone tonight and didn't have time to tell you. I'm sorry.

494
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,630
It's fine. Bye-bye.

495
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,860
What did she say?

496
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,890
My girlfriend has something to do today. Let's go next time.

497
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,770
It's fine.

498
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,290
We can eat. I know a new restaurant that's really delicious.

499
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,720
Let's go.

500
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,400
Calling takeout works, too.

501
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,640
Stop looking. Noveau riche.

502
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,090
Only extreme noveau riche would reserve those private rooms with long tables for a meal.

503
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,150
Let's be here. The mood is good.

504
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,040
Thank you, Auntie.

505
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,230
Meng Hui,

506
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,880
you don't have to be afraid.

507
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,570
I came to look for you today

508
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,020
because I have something to ask from you.

509
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,890
I didn't get in the way from you and Shen Yi's date, right?

510
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,460
I will apologize to you.

511
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,080
Auntie, you're too courteous.

512
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,250
Actually, I really want Shen Qian Shan

513
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,990
and Shen Yi to be closer

514
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,300
but one is an old stubborn man and the other is a young stubborn man.

515
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,550
If you said they weren't biological then I wouldn't believe that.

516
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,390
You see that I don't have kids

517
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,850
but I really like kids.

518
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,540
Look at others who painstakingly gave birth to children and are still suffering.

519
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,090
But me, I picked up a big son.

520
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,070
And Shen Yi is so talented.

521
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,630
I was secretly happy.

522
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,200
Eat something.

523
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,400
Give it a try.

524
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,240
So I came to look for you today

525
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,460
to make an alliance with you and be on the same line.

526
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,850
We can solve the problem of the father and son simultaneously.

527
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,520
A-Alliance? What do you mean?

528
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,960
Look. Shen Qian Shan listens to me

529
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,130
and Shen Yi listens to you, right?

530
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,140
Wouldn't we succeed then? If we succeed, we will solve this problem.

531
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:26,300
If we have chemistry then the family will as well.

532
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,660
I know you're not willing to put Shen Yi in a hard position

533
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,950
but you have an advantage that he can't reject.

534
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,120
This is an example of the Wooden Barrel Theory.
(T/N: The capacity of a barrel is determined by the shortest wooden plank; a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.)

535
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,600
Back then, when Auntie was still a top salesperson,

536
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,160
there were so many people that said

537
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,680
one must make up for their shortcomings

538
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,730
in order to increase their competitiveness.

539
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,000
I say you should just focus on building your strengths.

540
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,360
I fully used this advantage

541
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,980
to successfully get married. Do you understand?

542
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,880
Like me. What advantages do I have?

543
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,700
My advantage is that I can't give birth

544
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,800
so Shen Qian Shen is afraid of me.

545
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,950
When I mention the problem of children and mentioning Shen Yi calling me mom,

546
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,120
he can't reject

547
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,550
and what about you? You also have your own advantages.

548
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,580
What advantages do I have?

549
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,780
Don't you have a stress disorder?

550
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,890
That won't do, Auntie.

551
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,350
Reconsider.

552
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,850
Didn't you want that protein patent?

553
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,290
You're amazing.

554
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,150
I didn't expect you would have that many coupons in your cellphone.

555
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,590
I will go home first then. See you at the company tomorrow.

556
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:17,240
I actually had a dream all along.

557
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,050
When I was young, I heard that when you ride the ferris wheel

558
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,230
and make a wish at the highest point

559
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,170
then it will definitely come true

560
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,360
but it's been too many years.

561
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,530
No one rode it with me.

562
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,740
Even though I'm a girl,

563
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,540
riding the ferris wheel alone is a bit sad

564
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:47,160
but I want to ride it once.

565
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,540
Okay, I will tell Jiang Jiang to purchase the ticket for you.

566

Hello, Auntie.

568
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,800
Shen Yi come home now. Meng Hui has a relapse of her stress disorder.

569
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,930
What?

570
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,150
Can we go ride the ferris wheel right now?
