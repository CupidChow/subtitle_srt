[Episode 17: Cushion, Fastest speed of Love]

21
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,960
Do you remember that Xiao Ba said Director Xu was the one who found her?

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,670
- Yes.
- Right?

23
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,290
This Director Xu. She's—

24
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,950
It's working hours. Don't you guys have things to do?

25
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,080
Let me tell you guys. Don't dig deeper into this.

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,960
That's right.

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,220
I feel like there's a lot of relationships and history involved here.

28
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,940
Don't spout nonsense.

29
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,280
It involves four people in two love triangles.

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,730
God, two love triangles?

31
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,410
How did you calculate it?

32
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,460
This is a combination and permutations problem. The key to solving it is the scar on her face.

33
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,900
That's right. Her face clearly doesn't have a scar but calls herself Xiao Ba.

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,430
Do you think we're Shen Yi? He's silly, not stupid.

35
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,940
At that time, Shen Yi said he made that mark on Xiao Ba's face

36
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,450
but her face doesn't have one.

37
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,300
Director Meng's face does have a scar.

38
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,110
I'm asking. What is the percentage of Shen Yi knowing the wrong person?

39
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,020
This "yu" (again) word of yours is very wise.

40
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,100
No, no. That's impossible.

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,400
How could someone fall down in the same place two times?

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,180
I think Director Shen

43
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,490
really could have done it.

44
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,860
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it.

45
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,500
Recently, I've troubled you regarding Xiao Ba.

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,610
It's fine. It's part of my duty.

47
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,190
Also, didn't you increase my salary?

48
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,510
Oh right. Xiao Ba resigned right?

49
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,030
Recently, you don't have to work overtime

50
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,480
so your double salary ends today.

51
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,920
Yes, Xiao Ba left too early.

52
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,460
- Director Shen, you do your work. I'm getting off work.
- Wait a second.

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,220
Director Shen, I really can't work overtime today.

54
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,520
I have a personal matter for you to help me with.

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,070
I want to meet with Meng Hui and tell her something important. You make the arrangements.

56
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,870
As an assistant, there's seven days of the week, twenty-four hours in a day,

57
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,250
360 degrees with no weak spots. Your private matters are my business matters

58
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,220
but I don't do work after work hours.

59
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,360
Didn't you say you work for twenty-four hours? How is there time for getting off work?

60
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,890
That was when the salary was doubled so I could work twenty-four hours.

61
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,700
I realized that your personality is much stronger after you met Ah Tao, especially when going against me.

62
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,150
After you knew Ms. Meng Hui, you became more outgoing

63
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,300
but it's not going against me.

64
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,700
You make arrangements to let Jiang Jiang have a double salary

65
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,210
of this month. Add another month.

[Yestar]

67
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,670
I already visited Meng Hui's mom.

68
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,680
Auntie is a very good person. After so many years,

69
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,250
she never thought about investigating who was responsible.

70
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,270
Do you want to ask anything?

71
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,460
Then... when Xiao Ba first appeared,

72
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,780
how come you didn't tell me?

73
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,830
Because you made a wrong decision back then.

74
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,890
I don't know if you love or feel guilty towards Meng Hui.

75
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,890
It matched when Xiao Ba appeared

76
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,740
to let everyone know clearly.

77
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,030
I don't just feel guilty towards her.

78
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,920
I know you already found the answer

79
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,200
so I gave you the pictures.

80
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,140
Say,

81
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,850
if I tell her the truth,

82
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,560
will she forgive me?

83
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,180
Do you dare to gamble on it?

84
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,120
I already thought it through

85
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,240
to tell her the truth.

86
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,660
Even if she doesn't forgive me,

87
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,110
I will keep staying by her side.

88
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,120
Meng Hui, I actually found Zheng Jue.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,720
I helped you invited him. Let's meet at the observatory.

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,730
Do you want to go?

91
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,860
I heard that she often bullies students at school

92
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,860
and her face was marked.

93
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,360
So scary. We shouldn't do bad things in the future.

94
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,680
Let's hurry up and leave.

95
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,180
Don't be nervous. I've always been here.

96
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,660
I'm already prepared.

97
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,160
Did you come to let me meet Zheng Jue?

98
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,090
He actually has been by your side all along.

99
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,490
These few years, he lived a tough life.

100
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,470
He feels guilty and regretful.

101
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,330
He was always looking for you and thinking of ways to make it up to you.

102
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,510
Actually these years,

103
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,350
he lived a lonely life

104
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,600
but he's a very good person now.

105
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,850
Trust me. He's not a bad person.

106
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,790
He really changed.

107
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,250
He's thinking for others and doing a lot of good things.

108
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,800
- He also treats you well.
- Enough.

109
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,570
Why are you talking for Zheng Jue?

110
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,060
I...

111
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,380
I just want you to forgive him.

112
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,630
I already said it clearly to you

113
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,930
that it's impossible for me to forgive him.

114
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,890
So, Sui An used to be Zheng Jue?

115
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,920
- He—
- You guys, really are...

116
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,480
I didn't mind a long time ago.

117
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,810
Look. My scar on my face can be covered now.

118
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,230
You guys even invited me to such a formal place, I feel a bit embarrassed.

119
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,510
Don't put it to heart. I'm really fine.

120
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,600
Meng Hui, you got it wrong. Actually, I'm—

121
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,030
If you think like that then I'm at ease.

122
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm very sorry for what happened when we were young.

123
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,200
I should've came out from the start and admit my mistake.

124
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,760
I didn't think this apology

125
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,830
would be late by so many years.

126
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,500
Sui An.

127
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It's all good right now.

128
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,900
We met each other.

129
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,700
Now that the matter is clear,

130
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
I won't disturb you two.

131
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,900
I'll go for now.

132
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,300
Bye-bye!

133
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,200
Be careful on the road!

134
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,000
I was wondering why he was so nice to me before.

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Turns out he's Zheng Jue.

136
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,400
And that's why you two fought.

137
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,000
Why did you hide that from me?

138
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,800
You guys have a good relationship too, of course I won't mind

139
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,200
Meng Hui. If you don't want to forgive, you don't have to

140
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
But you will be upset, right?

141
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,600
I—

142
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
One is your very good friend.

143
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
The other one is someone you like a lot.

144
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,300
You're of course upset for being in the middle.

145
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
It's all my fault.

146
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
I shouldn't have

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,500
let you meet Zheng Jue.

148
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Forget about him.

149
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,490
Say, if she knew I did that.

150
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,000
What will happen?

151
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,200
So you can't say it.

152
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
We thought about the situation as too simple.

153
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,900
How about this. From now on, I'm Zheng Jue.

154
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,400
Between you and Meng Hui,

155
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
do not mix any other kind of feelings.

156
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,700
Let's settle on that.

157
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,300
But this isn't fair for you.

158
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,800
It's fair.

159
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,400
Did you mark Meng Hui's face?

160
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
The news really flew quick.

161
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier but went straight to Meng Hui?

162
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,400
A person must be responsible for his actions.

163
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,000
What happened, it will always reveal itself one day.

164
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,800
I wasn't talking about you.

165
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,200
Sui An, if you want to be responsible for Meng Hui.

166
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Just be nice to her!

167
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Like last time when she made you her boyfriend.

168
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
You accompanied and cared for her.

169
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Why do you have to say it just to make the wound bigger?

170
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
But it's the truth.

171
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Rumors, if you said that for a lifetime, it becomes the truth.

172
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,520
Shen Yi, remember.

173
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,600
There are some rumors when you keep to yourself forever,

174
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
they become the truth.

175
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,300
Also, don't let her know she's stuck in rumors.

176
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
This is the best choice for all of us.

177
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,280
If it's good for her, I agree.

178
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,650
♫  What's wrong with being imperfect?  ♫

179
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,500
♫  After rain it becomes sunny, meeting the light  ♫

180
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,800
♫  Being imperfect is also beautiful  ♫

181
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,800
Don't be too nervous.

182
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
My mother only looks fierce.

183
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,200
But she's actually really sweet, she won't make it hard on you.

184
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
I-I'm not nervous.

185
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,400
You relax, I'm not worried.

186
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Don't worry. I'm relaxed.

187
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,600
We were supposed to buy bird nest drink. It's hard to make.

188
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Does Auntie eat cherries? Did we buy the wrong fruits?

189
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,500
And you said earlier you weren't nervous.

190
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,700
It'll be fine.

191
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,600
Coming!

192
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,600
Mom.

193
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,400
Meng Hui, you're home so early.

194
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Hi Auntie.

195
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
This must be Shen Yi.

196
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,010
Please come in and sit down.

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,700
Shen Yi.

198
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,300
Why do you look so familiar?

199
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,100
Mom, I'm Meng Hui's boyfriend. I'm Shen Yi.

200
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,300
Please let Meng Hui to me, I promise I will take good care of her.

201
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,700
What are you doing? Get up first.

202
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,600
Let me show you something.

203
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,200
Sit.

204
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,500
Guess which one is me.

205
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
How did you know so fast?

206
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I didn't have a scar before.

207
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
Because... she's the prettiest.

208
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,400
No. I'm also pretty right now.

209
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Yes, in my eye, you're the prettiest.

210
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,400
Pick another one, I can guess you right away too.

211
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
Okay, let me see.

212
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
Did you finish picking?

213
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,300
This.

214
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,600
Come, eat some fruit.

215
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,300
Don't worry, don't be so formal.

216
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,300
Shen Yi.

217
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,100
Is your dad is the Shen Qian Shan of Qian Shan Enterprise?

218
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,700
Then you and Meng Hui, how long have you been dating?

219
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,400
W-We aren't dating.

220
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
Shen Yi...

221
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,800
W-We are getting married.

222
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,600
Shen Yi!

223
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,200
I was just asking.

224
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,300
He's good.

225
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Then you two—

226
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,300
I don't care if we have a boy or girl, it's up to her.

227
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,800
I-I don't think I can decide on that.

228
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,400
It's all luck.

229
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
I wasn't asking that—

230
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
I will give all my assets to her.

231
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,100
Under my name, there's a cosmetic company that's doing well.

232
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,800
And, the investments I made and my dad's stocks.

233
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
I will give all of it to her.

234
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
That wasn't my point.

235
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,000
- The thing is—
- She met my parents.

236
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
My dad and my aunt likes her a lot.

237
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,800
Shen Yi, just let my mom finish first.

238
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Sorry Auntie.

239
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
I just wanted to ask

240
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,900
what did you want to eat, I can go prepare for it.

241
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,400
But now I know whatever Meng Hui likes, you do too.

242
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,200
Right?

243
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Talk to Mr. Zhang and set the date for this Saturday.

244
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,700
This way, it won't be awkward.

245
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
You're back already?

246
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh nothing, just wanted to bring back some oranges for you.

247
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Come, let's drink tea.

248
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Where did you two go today?

249
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
I went to Meng Hui's house to meet her mother.

250
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,800
And did you get along with her mother?

251
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,300
Pretty well.

252
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,600
Where is Auntie?

253
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Madam is still in the hotel, hasn't come back yet.

254
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,400
Miss Zhao, please go make dinner.

255
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
Let's all eat dinner together.

256
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,600
Okay.

257
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,800
Dad, we're going to go up and pack our things.

258
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Why?

259
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
- We're going back.
- What?

260
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,270
Let's go.

261
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,800
Do you need any of my help?

262
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,000
No, no need.

263
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Then is there enough luggage? Not enough I have

264
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,200
some more, you can use all you want and return it after.

265
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
- No need, we have enough.
- No need, we have enough.

266
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,400
Okay, okay, okay.

267
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,400
Oh right. You guys don't have a car, I'll call the driver to drive you.

268
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,300
I drove my car here.

269
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,550
T- Then, you guys can continue.

270
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,800
Uncle,

271
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,740
I know you don't agree for Shen Yi and I to be together.

272
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,040
You're also worried about us but I will try my best for you to accept me.

273
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,200
I really like Shen Yi so I hope you can give me a chance.

274
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,430
Do you like this?

275
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,060
It looks quite cute.

276
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,410
Xiao Jiang.

277
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,530
- Director Shen .
- Wrap this up in a while and let them take it back.

278
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,260
Uncle, no need. It's not that kind of liking.

279
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,240
Do you still not understand what I mean?

280
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,860
Uncle, you're saying that you're letting Shen Yi and I be together?

281
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,930
Thank you, Uncle.

282
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,160
We'll get going then.

283
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,630
Dad, we'll get going then.

284
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,070
It's so late and Xue Lai is still not back.

285
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,480
When she throws a temper, it never ends.

286
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,680
He's already old.

287
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,910
He's still trying to be romantic?

288
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,690
Why are we eating at the bakery shop downstairs from Shen Yi's company?

289
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,690
Shen Yi is busy. Meng Hui came to keep Shen Yi company,

290
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,750
so we can only come to keep Meng Hui company.

291
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,060
Why aren't you talking?

292
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,560
I don't dare to speak nonsense.

293
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,390
The outcome of saying something wrong is very severe.

294
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,720
In which aspect?

295
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,770
I don't dare to easily say "I like it".

296
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,910
If I say I like something, Shen Yi will do whatever it takes to get it for me.

297
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,330
For example, Wei Lei's panda purse,

298
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,320
- if I say I like pandas then Shen Yi will—
- Okay.

299
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,350
You like pandas?

300
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,450
This is yours and this is yours.

301
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,420
This is yours.

302
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,700
Didn't I tell you to not drink iced water?

303
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,390
Drink this.

304
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,620
You just said you like pandas?

305
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,030
I don't. I don't like them.

306
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,710
If you like pandas then that's easy.

307
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,520
We'll go look at them. Let's go tomorrow.

308
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,360
Xing Yao.

309
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,250
Please reserve two seats for me on a flight to Chengdu tomorrow.

310
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:56,720
Director Shen, we have an important meeting tomorrow.

311
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,120
It's fine. Cancel the meeting.

312
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,470
I also have an important meeting tomorrow.

313
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,740
Okay, don't cancel the meeting.

314
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,780
Then if the sales rise then

315
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,580
should I thank Miss Meng

316
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,450
or should I thank the pandas.

317
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,570
Director Xu, did you have too much "dog food"?

318
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,200
Why don't you go back to the company and properly digest it?

319
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,440
Oh right, Xing Yao. I suddenly remember something that I want to talk to you about.

320
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,990
Okay.

321
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,410
I'm going to go handle some work.

322
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,720
Then Miss Meng,

323
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,590
I'll be borrowing Director Shen.

324
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,280
Your boyfriend left with the woman that secretly likes him.

325
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,710
Are you not worried?

326
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,240
This is what it's call to have security.

327
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,100
I observed at a bit just then.

328
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:03,020
Shen Yi and Xu Xing Yao have a safety distance.

329
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,140
Xing Yao.

330
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,830
Shen Yi, there's so words... why don't I talk first?

331
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,020
Okay.

332
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,070
You would never let anything affect your work before

333
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,530
but after you met Meng Hui,

334
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,030
you keep breaking your own rules.

335
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,580
Because I only had one goal back then

336
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,150
which is make the liquid foundation well.

337
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,240
Is the company not important anymore?

338
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,530
At the beginning, I started this business with you

339
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,310
because I saw your drive and determination.

340
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,480
I also did the liquid foundation for Meng Hui.

341
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,620
To me, she's more important than work.

342
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,250
I already know about Xiao Ba's.

343
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,600
We collaborated for so long.

344
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,560
Your capabilities, I know it well.

345
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,010
I think I want to introduce you to Qian Shan Enterprise.

346
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,770
that way you'll develop more.

347
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,270
You want me to resign?

348
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,490
I...

349
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,600
I can't leave.

350
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,850
If I leave then who will help you?

351
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,600
There's a lot of words that I don't want to say

352
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,990
but I hope you can understand

353
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,860
we're just collaborating. I already have a girlfriend.

354
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,800
You already know, right?

355
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,570
About me liking you.

356
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,570
That's right. I do like you.

357
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,300
I liked you for a long time.

358
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,360
For you, I worked hard every day,

359
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,490
to maintain my figure. Even though I stayed up late every day, I didn't let myself look older.

360
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,020
I worked hard to make myself for talented

361
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,600
to match the person I like.

362
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,030
I tried to shine when I'm by your side

363
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,080
but what about Meng Hui?

364
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,410
She doesn't know anything.

365
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,140
She made your work and life a mess.

366
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,150
That's because you don't understand her.

367
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,030
You said because of me,

368
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,580
you worked so hard and put in so much effort.

369
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,770
But do you know

370
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,460
that you'll give people near you, pressure and oppression?

371
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,610
Meng Hui is different. She also works hard but the people around her

372
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,940
will become talented with her.

373
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,230
This is the biggest difference between you two.

374
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,850
How long have you met her?

375
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,760
How long did I keep you company?

376
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,560
I don't believe that you truly like her.

377
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,620
What you like

378
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,200
- is the scar on her face.
- Xing Yao.

379
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,190
This isn't love but paying for what you've done.

380
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,750
Do you know what you're talking about?

381
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,680
So I have to leave?

382
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,230
Resigning is your best choice.

383
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,220
But rather than worrying about Shen Yi and Xing Yao's relationship,

384
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,190
why don't you think about what's the relationship

385
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,700
with Shen Yi and Meng Hui?

386
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,280
I think something is odd with Shen Yi.

387
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,970
Could it be that he did something that he feels sorry for Meng Hui?

388
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,980
Impossible. Don't spout nonsense.

389
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,640
Why don't I go secretly ask Sui An?

390
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,850
Forget it. You want to secretly ask Sui An?

391
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,790
It's already good if you don't expose your bottom-line.

392
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,630
Why don't I ask Jiang Jiang? It's easier.

393
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,600
At least, I won't expose myself.

394
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,350
You're here.

395
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,730
Give him a glass of milk. The usual for me.

396
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,730
Okay.

397
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,070
Ah Tao, it's so late.

398
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,110
Isn't it not good to call me out to a bar?

399
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,290
Didn't we agree to meet during the weekend?

400
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,110
But I really want to meet you today.

401
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,630
Jiang Jiang,

402
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,000
are you hiding something from me, recently?

403
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,010
You could tell?

404
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,270
I didn't. It's fine.

405
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,220
When you get along with women, you have to be more honest.

406
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,380
If there's anything then tell me. Perhaps, I can help you solve it.

407
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,550
You can't solve this.

408
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,670
If I tell you about this then the issue will be complicated.

409
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,890
Perhaps, we won't be able to be friends anymore.

410
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:26,040
But if you don't say it, I already guessed it.

411
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,660
You guessed it?

412
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:33,070
So I hope you can personally tell me.

413
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,310
Give me two more glasses.

414
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,120
Okay.

415
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,420
Then I'm saying it.

416
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,940
Although if I say it, it'll be a bit unexpected,

417
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,130
and I don't know if our relationship will change after I finish saying it.

418
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,400
But anyways, Ah Tao

419
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,920
I think I like you.

420
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,530
You're not asking about this?

421
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:42,940
No, I... I was asking about this.

422
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,190
Then, when did you find out?

423
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,850
Do you think I'm quite laughable?

424
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,950
Drink this alcohol first and we'll talk about it.

425
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,840
You're back already?

426
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,100
The home decorations changed.

427
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,860
Do you like it?

428
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,140
What happened to the bunk beds?

429
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:11,480
Meng Hui, I have a surprise for you, close your eyes.

430
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,070
Close them.

431
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,580
Be careful.

432
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,580
Stairs, stairs.

433
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,550
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

434
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,980
Don't open your eyes yet.

435
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,400
What is it? So mysterious.

436
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,640
Okay.

437
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,040
♫  Girl  ♫

438
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,830
♫ The girl in the mirror ♫

439
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,970
♫  Is the same  ♫

440

♫  Opening  ♫

442
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,850
It's so beautiful.

443
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,180
♫  Stopping at  ♫

444
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,670
♫  An unrestricted haven  ♫

445
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,440
It's so adorable.

446
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,770
What is today? It's so romantic.

447
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,110
You're not proposing, right?

448
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,780
If I propose to you,

449
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,500
will you say yes?

450
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,770
Give me your hand.

451
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,620
Like this, you're mine.

452
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,050
Meng Hui, follow me.

453
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,340
[Marry me]

454
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,870
Y- You're are serious?

455
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,330
Yes, I am being serious.

456
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,880
Whenever in the future, I will always be there with you.

457
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,590
Wherever you want to go, I'll take you.

458
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,630
The caps of the water bottles you can't open,

459
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,460
I'll do it for you.

460
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,120
The sour oranges you don't like to eat,

461
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,660
I'll help you eat it.

462
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,840
If you want to go east, we'll move east.

463
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,690
If you like the west's rainbow and clouds,

464
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,870
I'll turn them into lipstick.

465
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,140
To give it to you.

466
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,960
Meng Hui.

467
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,730
With your presence, you have made my life

468
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,100
colorful.

469
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,230
You don't even know,

470
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,130
how important you are to me.

471
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,780
I really truly

472
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,200
absolutely love you.

473
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,300
Meng Hui.

474
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,760
Will you marry me?

475
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,990
Yes!

487
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,000
♫  How could you deny me that  ♫

488
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,940
It's all gone.

489
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,460
There's still more.

490
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,950
♫  How could you deny me that  ♫

491
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,600
- Finish this one.
- There's one more.

492
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:10,560
Then it's settled. From now on, you're mine forever. No regrets.

493
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,740
No matter what happens,

494
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,890
we won't leave each other.

495
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,760
I think I'm in love.

496
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,220
Oh my heavens!

497
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,850
I think I'm getting married.

498
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,370
Can you guys please wait for me?

499
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,350
Wait, let me take a call.

500
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,320
I'm busy.

501
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,460
Doctor Sui, are you free this weekend?

502
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,460
Let's go hiking.

503
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,930
If you don't have time,

504
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,510
I might have to invite someone else.

505
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,360
See you this Sunday.

506

If the foundation isn't laid down well, any attempt at repair will only be a façade to cover it up.

508
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:30,120
♫  Life is like strolling in an endless circle  ♫

509
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,200
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

510
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,360
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

511
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,300
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

512
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,150
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

513
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:55,370
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

514
00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:04,350
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

515
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,590
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

516
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:19,420
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

517
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:24,190
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

518
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:29,440
♫  Don't let me   ♫

519
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,470
♫  wander the world  ♫

520
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,490
♫  Leading me  ♫

521
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:44,900
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

522
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:52,430
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

523
00:46:54,810 --> 00:47:00,230
