You don't have to keep your figure.

- Why?
- Because I'll love you no matter how you look.

Your pickup lines are really bad.

I totally don't understand.

25
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,580
It really seems like a married couple for ten years.

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,140
Our feelings has been completely exhausted.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,950
Don't be so discouraged. A person's sincere feelings can be felt.

I also don't believe that we've been brothers for so many years

We're going to divorce. Why is it like we're getting married now?

Are you going back on your words?

Not quite.

Didn't you usually say that you brought the wrong size so you gave me the clothes?

You told me that you had a good relationship with Shen Yi

so my appearance made him discard you

This is different from what you told me.

This proves that even if you go back to ten years ago,

She can change me

162
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,550
and I can also change her.

163
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,700
Just like this hairstyle. It doesn't look nice

164
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,040
but she trimmed it so I like it.

165
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,090
Resign.

166
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,630
Thank you for everything that you did for LS company all these years.

167
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,430
You've worked hard.

168
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,700
I hope at least at the company,

169
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,940
you can treat me as a partner that you can work with.

170
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,450
She said I don't understand what flawed beauty means and that I don't understand you.

171
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,480
Shen Yi, if you do this, it will indicate that something has been censored in the program and open to media speculations.

172
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,570
I'll be responsible. Xing Yao, do you... like me?

173
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,260
That's right, I do like you.

174
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,690
I've liked you for a long time.

175
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,560
I worked hard to made myself more talented

176
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,710
just to match up with the person that I like.

177
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,110
Let me give you a toast. Starting from today, be happy with each other.

178
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,480
And, also

179
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,920
let Meng Hui be at ease.

180
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,110
We'll get going first then. Director Shen, bye-bye.

181
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,710
Let's go eat hotpot. Bye-bye.

182
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,200
Yes.

183
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,850
You're here.

184
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,360
- O-One more time.
- Forget it, let me do it.

185
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,460
One more time.

186
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,640
Sister is so amazing.

187
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,740
I also want one.

188
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,560
Sister is so amazing.

189
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,390
- You should give it to the kids.
- You're so amazing.

190
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,150
Behave yourselves.

191
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,410
Give it to them.

192
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,230
Here, kids. Here.

193
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,010
Two for each of you.

194
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,590
Two for each of you.

195
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,720
Thank Brother and Sister. Say it.

196
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,330
- Thank you, Sister.
- Sister, caught all of the plushies.

197
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,990
Brother is also amazing. He didn't catch a single one.

198
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,770
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Sister.

199
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,160
- Kid. Kid that—
- Thank you, Sister.

200
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,130
This...

201
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,590
- Are you happy?
- I'm happy.

202
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,770
Do you feel like you're in love?

203
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,660
I do.

204
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,590
I wish us a happy marriage.

205
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,230
What's wrong? Are you sleepy?

206
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,220
I woke up so early today and it's already this late.

207
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,840
Of course I'm sleepy.

208
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,740
But, I'm awake when I'm on a date with you now.

209
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,500
You already feel like you're in love.

210
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,610
Why are you sleepy?

211
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,100
Didn't you see if you can persuade Meng Hui and let her believe that you two love each other then she can recover?

212
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,220
How come you can't do it now?

213
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,200
What do we do now? Do we go back to the start?

214
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,530
Try divorcing Meng Hui and see if she can recover.

215
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,320
Of course, I can't.

216
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,520
I clearly have a method without divorcing. Why should I divorce?

217
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,840
I can't give up, she loves me.

218
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,770
I definitely missed out on some details.

219
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,160
Say, why did she doubt your love in the first place?

220
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,020
Because of the scar.

221
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,770
They're not clear right now

222
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,400
whether there are other factors involved in their relationship.

223
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,780
Oh right. Do you guys think

224
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,450
she's different from usual this time?

225
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,820
How is she different?

226
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,010
In the past, she would always think she didn't have a scar on her face.

227
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,800
She would do makeup to cover the scar.

228
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,850
But this time, she openly

229
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,650
and revealing the scar for everyone to see.

230
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,260
This scar is a source of trauma for her. It's what triggered her PTSD.

231
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,070
Once this scar is removed,

232
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,250
their feelings will be real.

233
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,980
That's right. I want to help her remove the scar.

234
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,860
How are you going to remove it?

235
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,650
Professor Smith.

236
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,060
Professor Smith?

237
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,430
[Thank you for the appointment, please be punctual in attending of the following time. Wait about 7 years and 4 months.]

238
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,910
Director Shen, we already asked all the employees to register

239
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,330
to make an appointment for Professor Smith's surgery.

240
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,340
But... getting the appointment is as difficult as winning the lottery.

241
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,640
I got it!

242
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,780
Hurry! How long?

243
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,930
Two years and eight months.

244
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,930
[Email from Dr. Smith]

245
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,640
Hello, I want to confirm.

246
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,300
Did I really get an appointment for Doctor Smith's surgery?

247
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,390
Yes, Mr. Shen. We already made an appointment

248
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,430
for a recovery surgery for Miss Meng Hui's scar.

249
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,750
But, I just made the appointment two days ago.

250
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,070
It was said that I have to wait until two years later.

251
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,900
How come it suddenly got moved early?

252
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,450
It's like this. I don't know why but this time

253
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,600
Doctor Sui took the initiative to contact our teacher.

254
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,580
At the same time, he also told your story.

255
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,480
Our teacher saw Miss Meng Hui's Weibo video and he really wants to help her

256
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,520
so he promised to Doctor Sui's request.

257
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,220
He suddenly arranged this surgery.

258
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,610
You said this is Sui An's request?

259
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,930
Our teacher always wanted to work with Doctor Sui

260
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,530
but he kept rejecting

261
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,720
saying that he still has something important to do in China and can't leave.

262
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,650
Why are you here?

263
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,410
It's already so late and you're still drinking.

264
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,700
I just got off work. I still have to work tomorrow.

265
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,820
I can keep you company.

266
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,940
Mr. Sui has signed a contract with Professor Smith.

267
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,210
Doctor Sui will come to England soon to work with us for five years

268
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,550
and it's also more convenient to take care of Miss Meng.

269
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,700
What is going on?

270
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,680
You found out?

271
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,990
Why are you like this?

272
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,150
Do you want me to owe you forever?

273
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:04,140
Didn't you say that I was making it up to you?

274
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,860
How come now,

275
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,650
it turns into you're owing me?

276
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,800
Shen Yi,

277
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,040
after the surgery is finished,

278
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,750
you guys won't be in pain anymore.

279
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,820

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,930
Once Meng Hui's scar is removed,

322
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,330
she will recover from her PSTD.

323
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,350
right?

324
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,500
Shen Yi.

325
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,960
Shen Yi?

326
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,930
Stop crying.

327
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,600
My suit is expensive.

328
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,270
Will you pay for it?

329
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,540
You got an appointment for Professor Smith's surgery?

330
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,410
He said that he was my Weibo video and wanted to do my surgery.

331
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,590
That's why he made an exception and gave me the opportunity.

332
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,960
Invited me over to England next week to do a recovery surgery.

333
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,170
This is great. I'll go with you.

334
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,920
I'm not at ease with Shen Yi.

335
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,000
Since his PTSD is still in a relapsed state.

336
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,330
We will all help you take care of him.

337
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,940
But his PTSD is my fault.

338
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,070
It's because he injured me, so he couldn't let it go.

339
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,860
If I leave him now, what if it gets worse?

340
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,780
Meng Hui, repairing your scar is the thing you wanted to do most in life.

341
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,940
For Shen Yi, it's equally important. Stop thinking nonsense.

342
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
You finished the surgery?

343
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,130
It's done.

344
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,540
Why did you come so early?

345
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,800
I came to help tidy up your office.

346
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,850
You're so busy. How could you have the time to clean?

347
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,380
Are you tired? Have you ate?

348
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,140
I'm not tired. I already ate.

349
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,390
You called me over so suddenly. Do you have a surprise for me?

350
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,480
I... might have to go to England for awhile for a business trip.

351
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,890
A business trip to England?

352
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,110
When will you be back? We just got together and now you're abandoning me.

353
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,210
The most I can give you is a week.

354
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,890
What's wrong? It won't be a week?

355
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,570
A month?

356
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,890
Five years.

357
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,760
Five years?

358
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,830
Wei Lei, I have to go.

359
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,460
Five years.

360
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,250
If I had a child, they'd call you "uncle".

361
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,790
I'm going to help with Meng Hui's scar repair surgery.

362
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,200
Considering her current situation,

363
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,270
it might be better after the repair.

364
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,710
It's because of Meng Hui again?

365
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,100
Go with me, okay?

366
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,270
England.

367
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,640
Someone in the London fashion industry invited me over a long time ago.

368
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,500
Victoria Beckham... Anna Wintour...

369
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,480
Benedict Cumberbatch... Harry Potter...

370
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,210
they all called me many times, but I didn't go.

371
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,210
How many years does a model have?

372
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,440
Before you decided, did you think of me?

373
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,190
What makes you think I'd go with you?

374
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,730
At first, you put Shen Yi before me.

375
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,340
After Meng Hui showed up, I ended up behind both Shen Yi and Meng Hui.

376
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,650
Now, you even put yourself before me.

377
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,970
I'm not important at all.

378
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,600
Look.

379
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,690
You can't even be bothered to explain yourself.

380
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,960
Right.

381
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,180
Let me show you this.

382
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,340
How long will you be gone? One week?

383
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,010
With the surgery and recovery, at the very least, half a year.

384
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,220
It's best that it's all done there.

385
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,120
Let me accompany you.

386
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,100
But you can't leave your company behind.

387
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,330
You also have the product launch press conference next month.

388
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,160
It's fine. I will go visit you often.

389
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,800
Don't worry. I'm not going to run away.

390
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,760
Then...

391
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,710
What do you want to say?

392
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,100
Will you still love me when you come back?

393
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,600
Of course.

394
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:55,510
In the future, when you get your period, can you stop eating cold foods?

395
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,240
Okay, but popsicles are really good.

396
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,220
Get some rest. Don't move around too much.

397
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,810
I will pack your luggage for you. Whatever you need,

398
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,870
just let me know.

399
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,830
The weather in England should be similar to the weather here.

400
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,660
But you will need to adjust to a new time zone.

401
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,360
I checked online,

402
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,370
the fastest way to get over jet lag is to

403
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,470
not eat for 24 hours prior,

404
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,230
and then eat breakfast the next day at 7am.

405
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,830
That way, your body will think it's a fresh start.

406
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,200
Actually, I don't think I can let you starve for 24 hours.

407
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,780
I bought some snacks a few days ago. I'll put it in your bag.

408
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,870
Eat if you're hungry. You don't have to worry about Sui An.

409
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,630
He doesn't eat sweets. He won't fight with you for them.

410
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,770
I got a secondary card for my credit card. Use it all you want.

411
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,540
That's enough.

412
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,630
Drink some more.

413
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,090
What's that smell?

414
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,530
I forgot to turn off the stove.

415
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,550
I don't blame you. If I cooked it myself, this wouldn't have happened.

416
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,370
Right, winter arrives earlier in England.

417
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,250
You have to bring some winter clothes. Let me go look.

418
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,350
Aren't you too worried about me?

419
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,420
You're going to be gone for half a year.

420
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,900
I'm anxious and I'm worried about you.

421
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,420
I'm worried you won't be able to eat well,

422
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,060
sleep well, and that there'll be no one to accompany you.

423
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,950
How could that be possible?

424
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,500
Didn't you say you will visit often?

425
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,870
There's also Wei Lei, Ah Tao, and Sui An. Think about it,

426
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,110
I have to meet four people in a month. I'm going to be very busy.

427
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,800
Right, don't forget to remind me tomorrow morning

428
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,070
to bring your starry night lamp.

The temperatures are dropping. Don't catch a cold.

It's getting cooler today. Why are you wearing so little?

432

I have a magazine shoot scheduled today.

433

Who knew temperatures were going to drop today?

A weak woman like you

435
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,370
is carrying such a large suitcase?

Shen Yi didn't even offer to drive you.

Let me drive you to the airport.

It's fine. Didn't we already go over this? Ah Tao will drive me.

Hello? Shen Yi.

460
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
I just realized, if Meng Hui goes to England,

461
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,200
with the time there and all those strangers,

462
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
won't she realize her perception of time is incorrect?

463
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,800
Don't worry, I will accompany her the whole way.

I already communicated with Professor Smith.

We will coordinate with her perception of time.

Also,

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,500
negative ¥0.21.

483
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,260
Boss, what did you want to discuss today?

484
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
I sent you the time.

485
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,500
Help me book a ticket to England for the day after tomorrow.

486
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,800
But don't we have an appointment with three other CEOs that day

487
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,800
to discuss working together for the next quarter.

488
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,600
Push it back. Can you guys not survive without me?

489
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,500
Yeah.

490
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,800
In the future, please book me a ticket to England every week.

491
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You guys can't rely on me to solve everything.

492
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,600
I need to go to accompany my wife.

493
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,800
I am a man with a family.

494
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,000
The plane is about to depart,

495
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,100
but Meng Hui still hasn't arrived yet.

496
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,300
[Ah Tao]

497
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
- Hello?
- Hello.

498
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,200
I heard from Sui An that Meng Hui didn't show up,

499
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,600
but Meng Hui didn't come find me either.

500
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,800
I'm worried she noticed the real date or something.

501
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,000
Hurry up and go home to check on her.

502
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,600
Director Shen!

503
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,200
Meng Hui.

504
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
Why are you here?

505
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,800
Because whenever you're sad or having a hard time,

506
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,100
you will come here and cry.

507
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,590
Why did you come here?

508
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,800
Didn't you want to go do the scar repair surgery?

509
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,400
I don't want to go anymore.

510
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,500
Are you scared of the surgery?

511
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,400
It'll only be slightly uncomfortable. It won't hurt.

512
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,200
Don't be afraid. I will fly over and accompany you the day after tomorrow.

513
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,500
I'm not afraid it'll hurt.

514
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,300
Then...

515
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,800
I don't want to leave you.

516
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,200
Especially at this time.

517
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,400
You don't even know how to make ginger water.

518
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,000
If I left you, who would take care of you?

519
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,600
Me?

520
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Because of me,

521
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,300
you're giving up a surgery that you have been looking forward to for so long?

522
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,200
Shen Yi, I don't care about this scar anymore.

523
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,800
Between the person I love and surgery, I don't need to decide

524
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,500
in order to know what I should do.

525
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,780
The person you love?

526
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,800
Yes, I love you.

527
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,800
You're more important than this scar.

528
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,300
Can you feel my love?

529
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,600
Don't be like this. This is the decision I made. It has nothing to do with you.

530
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,200
No, it does have to do with me.

531
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,800
Why did I tell you I have some PTSD?

532
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,600
If I didn't tell you that, would you already be on the plane?

533
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm going with you.

534
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,400
Look, I don't have any problems at all.

535
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,200
I am completely fine. You don't need to stay.

536
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,600
You have to go get that surgery.

537
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,000
You know you have PTSD?

538
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,600
Leave, we're leaving now.

539
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,600
We'll book the earliest flight. If not, we'll get a private jet.

540
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,400
There's still time left.

541
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,800
So you're all recovered?

542
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,300
Then I feel at ease.

543
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Let's go repair that scar, okay?

544
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,600
Why?

545
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,500

The driving motive behind beauty is for the eyes of the beholders.
