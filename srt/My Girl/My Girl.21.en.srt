[Episode 21: No makeup, showing disappointment]

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,200
PTSD?

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,200
Who has PTSD?

23
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,810
It's me.

24
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,430
I have PTSD.

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,300
Then, what illness is that?

26
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,010
Let me give you an example.

27
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,290
For example, if you get scolded by your boss then will would you think

28
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,170
it would better if I was the boss of my boss?

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,840
When you go buy things at the grocery store then you'll think

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,120
that it would've been great if the items were discounted,

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,880
- right?
- I did.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,790
If you like someone then you'll think

33
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,740
that it would've been great if they were my girlfriend.

34
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,680
Have you?

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,260
Let me give you the simplest example. If you're old then you'll think

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,780
it would've been great if I could go back to being eighteen years old.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,690
This is illusions in your eyes

38
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,060
but to me, I will treat it like it's real.

39
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,740
Whenever I relapse, please do not tell me I have PTSD.

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,600
because that way, the consequences will be very severe,

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,830
right?

42
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,160
That's right.

43
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,460
Then has your illness ever acted up?

44
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,350
A few times.

45
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,910
There was one time that I thought you were a makeup artist.

46
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,690
We were at the television program everyday.

47
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,290
You did my makeup and covered my acne.

48
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,820
Do you still remember?

49
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,500
I remember.

50
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,550
There was one time that I thought you were the boss of the company and we were working face to face.

51
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,860
Our love started from then on.

52
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,040
Do you still remember?

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,150
I also remember.

54
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,760
There was also one time where I thought we were siblings.

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,790
Even though we weren't related by blood but we loved each other

56
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,470
but our family doesn't agree to our relationship.

57
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,620
I was forced to be with a girl that I didn't like.

58
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,730
He even dare to say it.

59
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,760
What about later?

60
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,920
Later on, you use all means to prove that you love me.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,620
You confessed to me and we overcame the obstacles to end up together.

62
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,630
I also remember this.

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,430
Look

64
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,000
at how much you loved me back then.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,260
I didn't.

66
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,440
We were a couple for ten years.

67
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,780
You're still shy in front of me. That is really rare.

68
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,080
Can he be more shameless?

69
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,220
How come you didn't tell me earlier that you have PTSD?

70
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,310
I was afraid that you'll worry about me.

71
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,320
Everytime I encounter pressure then I'll act up.

72
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,350
I'm afraid that you will...

73
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,460
just like now.

74
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,700
- Shen Yi!
- Director Shen!

75
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,930
- Shen Yi!
- Director Shen!

76
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,500
- Shen Yi!
- Director Shen!

77
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,620
- Shen Yi, are you fine?
- Director Shen!

78
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,950
- Shen Yi!
- Director Shen, are you fine?

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,830
Shen Yi, what are you up to?

80
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,600
Don't touch him!

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,670
It's all my fault.

82
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,140
I told him about the divorce right now.

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,920
He must be under a lot of pressure.

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,750
What happens if his illness acts up right now?

85
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,730
Shen Yi.

86
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,130
What's wrong with me?

87
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,510
You are...

88
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,250
Hello, I'm Lawyer Su.

89
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,590
I'm here to help you two with the divorce procedures today.

90
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,100
Divorce?

91
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,100
We only got married for one month? Why are we divorcing?

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,340
Darling.

93
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,730
Do you still remember what year it is right now?

94
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,640
2020. We only got married for one month.

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,160
How could you hold a divorce procedure?

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,610
That... let's end here today.

97
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,450
You may leave first. Treat it like you've never came before.

98
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,630
Meng Hui, do you really want to divorce me?

99
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,730
No, I didn't.

100
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,090
We only got married for one month. How could we divorce?

101
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,410
We have a good relationship.

102
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,050
I really do feel inadequate.

103
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,390
Meng Hui,

104
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,680
let me talk with Shen Yi.

105
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,060
Okay.

106
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,760
Shen Yi, what are you doing? How can you switch it around and trick her?

107
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,570
Do you think you can keep dragging it on so that Meng Hui never divorces you?

108
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,060
Won't you be forcing her to remain in her current state forever?

109
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,810
Do you want her to live in dreams forever?

110
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,620
It'll be very troublesome and she'll never recover.

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,460
You're wrong. How come every time Meng Hui's illness acts up,

112
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,780
you guys all choose to cooperate with her, lie to hear, let her live in dreams, and fulfill her wishes.

113
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,730
Didn't you guys ever want to tell her the reality and let her accept herself?

114
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,320
What is reality?

115
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,480
Reality is that I love her and she loves me.

116
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,420
When I "relapsed" just then, she didn't even hesitate to protect me.

117
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,530
Can't you tell that she loves me?

118
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,630
So, both of us love each other so why should we divorce?

119
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,070
But this is more troublesome. You must prove that you guys love each other so she can recover.

120
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,100
You have to prove you that you guys are still in love with each other in order for her to recover.

121
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,450
I have confident.

122
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,530
My dad told me before that this is an opportunity.

123
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,420
At the beginning, I couldn't understand

124
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,570
but just now,

125
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,720
I already found a solution to solve it.

126
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,570
We might even be able to completely cure her PTSD this time.

127
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,390
Wei Lei,

128
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,020
you seemed to put it in the wrong place. The heart one should be here.

129
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,750
This is crooked.

130
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,640
Move it down a bit. Move it down by a centimeter.

131
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,310
Like this?

132
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,150
Enough, leave. Shen Yi is about to come back.

133
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,590
Leave.

134
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,240
Leave.

135
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,830
Are you still blaming me?

136
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,090
It's just that somethings

137
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,160
I still haven't thought about it clearly. Give me some more time.

138
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,340
I'll think with you then.

139
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,620
This isn't your problem.

140
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,430
Don't be troubled with me.

141
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,910
You're back. Dinner is ready.

142
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,740
Dinner is ready. Do you want to eat first or take a bath?

143
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,780
Do you want me to prepare the water?

144
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,460
Love you.

145
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,260
You... say it again.

146
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,160
L- Love you.

147
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,040
Is there something wrong?

148
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,850
I know.

149
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,180
How is it? Is it the same as how you first met me?

150
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,730
Am I beautiful? Am I pretty?

151
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,620
Beautiful.

152
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,180
It's good that I'm beautiful.

153
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,450
I'll go take a shower and sleep then.

154
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,340
Director Xu, in the morning, I came to the company to take a look.

155
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,050
The company's documents, computer systems, and meeting agendas

156
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,060
are all dated with 2030.

157
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,490
I'll give you an hour to change it back to ten years ago.

158
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,490
Why?

159
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,930
You...

160
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,850
remembered everything?

161
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,610
Aren't you the person who best understands Shen Yi?

162
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,530
How could you not know he has PTSD?

163
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,030
It's right that it's 2030 right now

164
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,350
but Shen Yi thinks we went back to ten years ago when we first met.

165
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,090
Shen Yi has PTSD?

166
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,820
It's not a serious illness, just a mental one. Don't discriminate against him.

167
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,570
Take this document back and redo it. What were you even thinking?

168
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,540
It's too innovative. We need to do a retro version.

169
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,580
But, Director Meng, I just made this proposal again.

170
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,540
But this is also for Shen Yi. Aren't you his right hand person?

171
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,210
It's more suitable for you to do this.

172
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,120
Director Meng, I already explained to you.

173
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,290
Shen Yi and I have no relationship. You're overthinking.

174
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,910
You still don't remember what I'm saying. In 2030, you indeed have no relationship with Shen Yi

175
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,510
but it's 2020 right now.

176
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,680
You and Shen Yi are close friends.

177
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,660
What do you mean?

178
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,100
We returned back to ten years ago. I won't interfere with your guys' relationship.

179
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,760
You guys can try to see if you can be together.

180
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,510
You've worked hard.

181
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,460
- Shen Yi.
- What's wrong?

182
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,080
I casually made you some food.

183
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,780
See if it suits your taste.

184
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,070
No need. Meng Hui will deliver food for me.

185
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,860
Take it away.

186
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:15,000
Meng Hui, why did you come now? I'm about to starve to death.

187
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,670
Why don't you eat hers? Hers look tastier.

188
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,200
But I only want to eat yours.

189
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,530
What good food did you make today?

190
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,100
Miss Meng Hui, you remembered it wrong. Shen Yi, doesn't eat bitter melon.

191
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,880
As long as you made it, then I'll like eating it.

192
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,890
Okay, I'll feed you.

193
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,580
Why are you using all sorts of details to hint that you love me very much?

194
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,200
- What do you mean?
- Look.

195
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,330
Your watch has stopped at 9:33 a.m.

196
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,730
That means in your heart, other than me, it's still me.

197
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,470
Do you think I'm very childish?

198
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,040
I'm joking.

199
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,950
But, I've received your sincerity.

200
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,420
Okay.

201
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,800
Don't pretend. I was the one who gifted you this watch.

202
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,120
You have so many watches but why do you only wear this one?

203
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,160
Thank you, darling.

204
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,330
I have to work now. Let's go home together tonight.

205
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,110
I'll go work too.

206
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,550
Okay.

207
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,650
Are you finished?

208
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,560
You're so slow.

209
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,900
Let's go.

210
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,440
- Shen Yi.
- What's wrong?

211
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,480
There's a lot of documents so you have to suddenly work overtime

212
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,730
so you might have to go back late.

213
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,890
- No, that—
- Okay, you guys work overtime then.

214
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,590
I'll get going first. You can come home later.

215
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,530
Bye-bye.

216
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,650
What are you doing?

217
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,770
I suddenly thought of an interesting little game.

218
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,320
I want to play it with you.

219
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,220
Look, our palm lines match.

220
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,980
Do you know how rare that is? It's less than one in a thousand.

221
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,730
Do you know why? This means

222
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,390
we're fated. Your heart has me

223
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,700
and my heart has you.

224
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,910
Childish. This is a game played by kids.

225
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,230
If you go out to find ten people, it'll probably work with nine people.

226
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,520
Xing Yao, let me borrow your hand.

227
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,130
See, it doesn't match!

228
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,690
I'm fated with you.

229
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,150
You guys take your time and play.

230
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,180
In the past, we belonged to each other.

231
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,620
but how long can this line be?

232
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,200
We just got married but what about ten years later?

233
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,710
Will you still love me?

234
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,790
A lifetime is so long. Can you guarantee that you'll never change?

235
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,790
What are you doing?

236
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,470
As long as it's within my abilities,

237
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,930
I can let the line be as long as you want

238
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,110
but it doesn't have to be too long as long as it's a lifetime.

239
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,460
The table, you can wipe, the floor, you mop, the sofa, you wash, the wall–

240
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,240
I will clean it.

241
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,440
What's wrong?

242
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,970
Leave.

243
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,810
Director Shen.

244
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,170
Didn't I tell you to postpone the wedding? Why did you come again?

245
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,690
The wedding is canceled

246
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,460
but do you remember the 30,000 fresh flowers you ordered?

247
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,620
I-I already paid the deposit.

248
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,430
- Director Shen.
- Jiang Jiang!

249
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,090
W- What is he saying? Something about canceling the wedding. How come I don't understand?

250
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,730
Director Shen, you own such a large company. How could you deny the charges you owe?

251
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,190
I'm not denying my charges. What are you talking about? I don't understand.

252
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,220
What are you talking about? What about the wedding being canceled?

253
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,350
I came to discuss the details about the wedding with you.

254
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,190
Time's tight and we have lots to do. What deposit are we refunding?

255
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,050
We already got married for a month and haven't had a wedding.

256
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,740
You must look forward to a grand wedding, right?

257
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,170
If you want it then we'll have one.

258
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,660
Really?

259
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,700
I love you.

260
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,490
I love you too.

261
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,080
Happiness came all of a sudden.

262
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,270
I'm saying that a broken mirror can be put back together.

263
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,540
You must live a harmonious married life and never break your vows.

264
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,660
Be sweet to each other and live happily.

265
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,320
Fresh flowers, a lawn, a helicopter. Whatever you need, I can get it.

266
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,620
Spend however much you need.

267
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,060
I'll go make preparations.

268
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,440
Meng Hui, are you really going to hold a wedding with me?

269
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,590
Look at how good I treat you. I'll give you whatever you want.

270
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,760
But I think it's not enough.

271
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,160
What else do you want?

272
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,680
I want...

273
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,460
I want...

274
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,330
I want a honeymoon.

275
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,570
- Shen Yi! Don't be too over—
- That.

276
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,970
Calm down. He's a patient after all. Calm down.

277
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,050
Honeymoon right?

278
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,750
Okay, you and you all go.

279
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,750
Why are they going for? Isn't a honeymoon for a world of two people?

280
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,270
Isn't this your brother,

281
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,160
assistant, and my best friend? So what if they come with us?

282
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,410
You've been weird with Sui An recently. Do you not want to go?

283
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,360
We're good.

284
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,430
I'll remember you.

285
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,280
5-star hotel, first-class airplane ticket, use his credit card for everything. Put it on his tab.

286
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,390
No problem, use my credit card.

287
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,060
You're so outgoing this time.

288
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,240
But I have a request.

289
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,440
Okay, say it all at once.

290
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,410
I want to have the honeymoon first then hold the wedding.

291
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,720
Okay, no problem. I can fulfill it.

292
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,380
- Can I get a mixed salad?
- Okay.

293
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,290
No, it's better to order the steak. Didn't you want to eat it?

294
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,850
How did you know?

295
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,670
You were looking at the top left corner of the menu for a long time, but you kept hesitating.

296
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:33,880
You're guessing that I'm very tired today and I don't want to eat oily food so you ordered a salad for me.

297
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,720
There's no need. Just order whatever you want to eat.

298
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,210
Your girlfriend is really good at reading people.

299
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,770
You're so amazing.

300
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

301
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,760
Give me a warm cup of milk.

302
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Okay, please wait.

303
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,020
Thank you.

304
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,210
I'm not cold. I want to eat ice cream.

305
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,820
Huh?

306
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,080
Why are you always walking in front of me?

307
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,900
Can you put aside the fact that you're a therapist?

308
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,830
We're dating and not looking at an illness.

309
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,820
You don't have to try to predict everything.

310
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,550
How can there be any surprises or any fun if you're like that?

311
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,830
Are you still cold?

312
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,250
Ah Tao.

313
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,280
Why did you come?

314
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,430
I came to wait and eat dinner with you. I don't know if I have this honor.

315
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,010
You don't.

316
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,360
I said already said that I have a boyfriend.

317
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,290
I know.

318
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,530
It's Qian Shan Company, Shen Qian Shan's son, Shen Yi's

319
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,100
assistant. There are rumors about it.

320
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,810
Everyone's saying how the great and famous Liu Yi Xin is dating some assistant.

321
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,760
So funny.

322
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,580
You have to put your insight further. For example, me,

323
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,310
I'm one thousand better than him.

324
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,980
I have a house and a car.

325
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,130
I can afford to buy flowers and I earn more money than you.

326
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,190
Why should I be with you?

327
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,820
I don't understand. How can I not be compared to him?

328
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,820
Have you been using him as your research test subject

329
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,660
to study dating psychology?

330
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,760
Jiang Jiang! Jiang Jiang!

331
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,260
It's so beautiful.

332
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,560
Boss, isn't the inside of this place quite nice. You were even complaining about it just then.

333
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,430
Boss, let's play this.

334
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,680
Come on, I'll serve the ball.

335
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,470
Childish.

336
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,010
I'll go look at the rooms.

337
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,350
Let's go over there to take a look.

338
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,020
Look at this.

339
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,080
[2020]

340
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,290
Didn't you already make preparations?

341
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,350
I'm going to go to the washroom.

342
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,440
How can an old married couple spark passion?

343
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,270
First, you must maintain a sense of mysteriousness.

344
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,060
You must be able to hide it well, remain elusive.

345
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,370
Stay secretive and unpredictable.

346
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,130
Keep them guessing.

347
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,330
What are you reading?

348
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:55,070
From The Psychology of Dating, by Liu Yi Xin.

349
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,040
Is it this book,  The Psychology of Dating ?

350
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,070
I left yesterday, not because I was mad that you had other pursuers,

351
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,300
but because I found out this book was by you.

352
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,560
You knew that I was using it as my relationship guide book, yet...

353
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,400
What else have you been keeping from me?

354
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,460
It really does feel like you're using me as a test subject.

355
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,790
I randomly wrote this book.

356
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,970
You guys shouldn't trust it either.

357
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,170
Did you understand?

358
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,850
Nope.

359
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,020
But I understand.

360
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,220
Watch me tonight. I will arrange everything.

361
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,480
Cheers!

362
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,270
Since you guys haven't gotten married yet, tonight will be a singles' night.

363
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,550
Let's play some exciting games. How does truth or dare sound?

364
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,680
Whoever doesn't answer has to drink.

365
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,350
I'll ask the first question.

366
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:10,320
What kind of daring things have you done for the person most important to you?

367
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,510
For her, I've had to prematurely terminate projects I've worked on for many years.

368
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,190
My company also almost went bankrupt.

369
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,710
Everyone already knows this story.

370
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,870
When I graduated from university, there was an opportunity to do my postgraduate overseas.

371
00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:00,090
That night, he ended up getting drunk with his friends and passed out.

372
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,080
I braved a rainstorm and took him to the hospital.

373
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,330
The doctor ended up telling me that

374
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,660
he was actually just too exhausted from writing his thesis and fell asleep.

375
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,090
The next day, I caught a severe cold.

376
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,280
I missed out on the postgraduate opportunity.

377
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,800
How come you never told me this?

378
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,420
You sacrificed so much for her. Who is this girl?

379
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,470
Is it someone you've kept hidden in your heart? I thought you told me you never dated?

380
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,880
You never told me you got into a postgraduate program.

381
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,500
You said you wanted to start your own business after graduation.

382
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,490
If I didn't say that, how could you have been at ease?

383
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,230
I–

384
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,750
Your most important person really is him.

385
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,830
Next question, how many times have you dated?

386
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,300
How many times have you dated?

387
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,030
Can I choose to do a dare instead?

388
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,610
Let's split up the rooms through cards. Jiang Jiang, hand out the cards.

389
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,560
O-Okay.

390
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,700
Whoever gets the King gets to decide.

391
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,910
I got the King. Whoever picked a 9

392
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:44,150
must share a room with me tonight.

393
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,920
Eh?

394
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,360
Jiang Jiang, how did you hand out the cards?

395
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,030
I read it upside down.

396
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,600
Isn't his a 6?

397
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,520
Yeah, it's a 6.

398
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,100
That's right, 6, 6, 6.

399
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,590
Then yours can only be a 9.

400
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,470
Wei Lei, how about we share a room tonight?

401
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,000
I caused such a ruckus, for what?

402
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,590
Are you my sister or not? Why are you trying to mess up such an important moment for me?

403
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,540
But isn't tonight singles' night?

404
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,840
Do you know what singles' night is?

405
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,930
Passionate.

406
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,780
Unpredictable.

407
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,790
Go back, I don't want to talk to you.

408
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,310
So... what is singles' night supposed to be?

409
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,030
Didn't you say you were here to help get Shen Yi and Meng Hui get back together?

410
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,850
I was trying to fool her.

411
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,520
See, now she's going to sleep with Shen Yi.

412
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,650
Yeah, those two are going to bed in the same room.

413
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:33,200
But now I'm stuck sharing a room with you.

414
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,450
You're too full of yourself.

415
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,700
I didn't do this for you.

416
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,340
I'm going to go stay with Ah Tao.

417
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,260
Have you been using me as a test subject?

418
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,920
- I haven't.
- Have you been fooling me this whole time?

419
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,140
I–

420
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,950
I'm going to find Dr. Sui.

421
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,860
Why would you go find him?

422
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,510
At least Dr. Sui is a doctor.

423
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,410
This was my PhD thesis. It just so happened I got it published.

424
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,370
After meeting you, I realized this was all nonsense.

425
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,850
Psychology is just psychology. Clinical trials are just clinical trials.

426
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,160
Look at this. Attraction. Do you remember we first met in your office?

427
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,760
You insisted I had problems, so I had no choice but to go in and see you once a week.

428
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,010
Did you do that just to get my attention? I was your test subject.

429
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,490
Then you're a very interesting subject.

430
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,380
See, you can't deny it now.

431
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,050
Look at this part. Reliance.

432
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,040
Whenever I encounter a problem, you show up by my side immediately,

433
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,330
and call and text me nonstop, asking me for my itinerary and my plans.

434
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,200
You did that so I'd get used to it and become reliant on you.

435
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,730
And this part. Protectiveness.

436
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,470
You got along with your classmates very well, but you made it seem like

437
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,360
you were bullied in middle school because everyone treated you like a boy,

438
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,230
triggering my sense of protectiveness.

439
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,010
And this too, "Awareness of gender"

440
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,940
When I went to your house for the first time, your...

441
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:11,520
What did I even see? You did it on purpose.

442
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,830
I really wasn't aware.

443
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:19,070
So... so that's when you started liking me?

444
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,420
I think I like you.

445
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,520
No, that wasn't. Don't speak nonsense.

446
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,430
It really wasn't?

447
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,890
It was.

448
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,670
That really wasn't my intention.

449
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:42,100
Also, I didn't wear that one today.

450
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,090
W- Who's asking that?

451
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,970
Sui An is looking for you.

452
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,290
What happened to you? Did you get into a fight with Dr. Sui?

453
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,630
Do you believe me? He's going to come find me within a minute.

454
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,380
60, 59, 58, 57...

455
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,110
What are you doing?

456
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,290
In a stable relatinship,

457
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,050
you should add in some unpredictable factors.

458
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,430
You should maintain an appropriate physical distance and emotional distance.

459
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,290
This way, you can arouse a sense of curiosity

460
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,990
and lust, in both parties.

461
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,140
Staying reserved without being too undisciplined.

462
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,930
Being conservative without losing a sense of self.

463
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,670
Stern without being arrogant.

464
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,230
Author, Liu Yi Xin.

465
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm going to sleep outside.

466
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,970
Don't you find yourself annoying?

467
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,900
Dr. Sui, when are you going to pick up Miss Wei Lei?

468
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,360
Do you think she'll end up sleeping there tonight?

469
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,150
If you want to go back, you can go back on your own.

470
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,130
I don't dare. I'm scared Ah Tao won't like that.

471
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:59,140
I feel very useless. I can't compare to her in anything.

472
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,250
She keeps holding on to me so shamelessly. What is she hoping to get from me?

473
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,660
No matter how many times I take the initiative, how hardworking I am,

474
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,660
it's all useless, all for nothing.

475
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,570
The truth is I'm not good enough for Ah Tao.

476
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,390
I don't deserve to be liked by her.

477
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,940
Can't you tell I like you?

478
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,750
Are you avoiding me?

479
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,940
Only when I am with you can I let go of all restraints.

480
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,870
I don't have to worry about the day people will expose me.

481
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,560
I don't have to worry about the day I turn old and ugly.

482
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,230
If I didn't provoke Zheng Jue at the time,

483
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,340
he wouldn't have injured Meng Hui's face.

484
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,200
But I never told him what happened

485
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,530
and kept it from him all these years.

486
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,160
It turns out he's like me. He's worried people will find out his secret.

487
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,100
What did I say? He was definitely going to come find me.

488
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,970
Ah... Tao.

489
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,880
Why is it you? What are you doing?

490
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,690
I'm here to find Ah Tao.

491
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,000
As expected, he still finds me annoying.

492
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,980
I already took an initiative, yet he's still ignoring me.

493
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,050
Don't be upset.

494
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,100
I'm so good at acting.

495
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,870
I'm pretty good here.

496
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,530
All right, that's enough.

497
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,450
Wei Lei.

498
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,480
I never found you annoying.

499
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,300
It's because I feel like I made a lot of mistakes,

500
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,540
but I never stood up and took responsibility for it.

501
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,400
I feel like the Sui An you like

502
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,600
should be a man with a sense of responsibility,

503
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,730
a man who can withstand anything.

504
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,810
But I feel like I am not.

505
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,100
You should find someone that can take responsibility.

506
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:10,650
To me, you're the best person.

507
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,960
Do you remember when I got my restoration surgery,

508
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,770
I always called you in the middle of the night,

509
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,080
asking you whether there would be any long term side effects.

510
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,030
You always very patiently explained it to me.

511
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,290
Whenever I needed you the most,

512
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,230
you were always by my side,

513
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,960
never giving up on me.

514
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:16,890
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by My Girl Team @ Viki.com

515
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,380
Do you still need therapy?

516
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,100
Yes.

517
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,900
It can't be cleaned.

518
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,350
Try harder.

519
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,290
- You didn't use detergent, of course it can't be cleaned.
- Oh.

520
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,890
You're so dumb. Let me do it.

521
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,030
I got it, let me do it.

522
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,400
Love is the best kind of makeup.

523
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,250
♫  Life is like strolling in an endless circle  ♫

524
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:09,280
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

525
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,430
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

526
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:19,410
♫  But I can feel you here in this world   ♫

527
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:24,310
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

528
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:29,440
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

529
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:38,090
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

530
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,590
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

531
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:53,510
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

532
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:58,340
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

533
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:08,650
♫  Don't let me wander the world  ♫

534
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,650
♫  Leading me  ♫

535
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:19,160
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

536
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:26,320
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫

537
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:42,220
